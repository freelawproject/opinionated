In May of 1975, appellee Nellie H. Moore, a resident of Fairfax County, filed her bill of complaint in the northern Virginia court below against appellant Thomas E. Moore, Jr., who lived in the town of Blackstone in the southern part of the Commonwealth. She alleged the parties had last cohabited in Fairfax County and that they had lived separate and apart without cohabitation and without interruption for a period of more than two years. She sought a divorce from the bonds of matrimony, but asked for no ancillary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">The husband was duly served with process and filed a timely answer, by counsel, admitting the allegations of the bill. He averred that, except for the merits of the divorce, there were no issues for the court to adjudicate. He asked that he not be required to pay the wife\u2019s counsel fees or costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">Within two weeks after the answer was filed, the chancellor referred the cause to a commissioner in chancery. The decree of reference, endorsed by both attorneys, directed the commissioner to inquire and report on the questions of jurisdiction, whether the wife was entitled to the relief prayed for, and any other subject \u201cwhich may appear pertinent to this cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">One month later, on July 9, 1975, the plaintiff\u2019s depositions were taken in the commissioner\u2019s Fairfax office, upon timely notice, at which time the wife and her daughter testified. The husband and his attorney did not appear at the hearing, pursuant to a prior understanding between counsel. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>attorneys had also agreed that the husband would not be liable for any of the wife\u2019s counsel fees or court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Approximately three months after the hearing, the commissioner\u2019s report was filed in the clerk\u2019s office of the court below, after due notice was given to both counsel. The commissioner reported that jurisdiction had been established by the evidence, that the ground for the divorce had been proven, and that \u201c[t]here appear to be no property rights and matters of support to be determined by the Court.\u201d He recommended that the wife be granted the divorce based on the parties\u2019 two-year separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">The suit then remained dormant for approximately six months until April 2, 1976, when the husband\u2019s attorney wrote the chancellor asking that a final decree be entered and asserting that during the six-month period the wife\u2019s attorney had refused to respond to his letters and telephone calls about the suit. The attorney enclosed a draft of a decree, endorsed only by him, providing for an absolute divorce to the wife on the ground alleged in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">Within a week thereafter, the wife, by counsel, filed a motion to \u201cdismiss\u201d the cause upon the ground \u201cthat she no longer wishfed] to pursue the matter.\u201d A letter to the chancellor from the wife\u2019s attorney accompanied the motion. Counsel denied that he had failed to communicate with his adversary, asserting that during the previous October he had notified the husband\u2019s attorney that he would not seek entry of a final decree because his attorney\u2019s fee had not been paid by the wife. In the letter, counsel for the wife also stated he had just been \u201cinstructed by Mrs. Moore to move the Court to dismiss the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">The husband, by counsel, then filed a motion seeking a hearing on the wife\u2019s request for dismissal and also asked to be heard on his \u201capplication\u201d for entry of a final divorce decree, apparently referring to the letter of April 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">On April 23, 1976, following oral argument of counsel, the trial court entered the order appealed from which stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-10\">\u201cIt appearing to the Court that the Complainant is desirous of dismissing her Bill of Complaint; it is therefore</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJy\">\u201cOrdered and adjudged that the Bill of Complaint be, and hereby is, dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>The order was endorsed by the wife and her attorney as: \u201cWe ask for this\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">The question presented is whether the chancellor erred in permitting the plaintiff to dismiss the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">The husband relies on former Code \u00a7 8-220 (1957 Repl. Vol.), which was in effect at the time of the proceedings below <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-7\">\u201cA party shall not be allowed to suffer a nonsuit unless he do so . . . before the suit or action has been submitted to the court for decision . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">The husband contends that the wife was prohibited from voluntarily dismissing her action because, prior to the filing of the wife\u2019s motion to dismiss, the suit had been finally \u201csubmitted\u201d to the chancellor for a ruling. Defendant says that by requesting entry of a final divorce decree, he had \u201calready conclusively committed himself to a decision of the Court on the determinative issue.\u201d He argues that the cause \u201cwas tantamount to being under advisement, in a sense\u201d, thus \u201cprecluding the arbitrary taking of a non-suit.\u201d The argument concludes with the observations that the \u201conly jurisdiction\u201d for the suit is in the court below, located \u201ca 260-mile return trip distance\u201d from defendant\u2019s home in Blackstone; that the cause \u201chad been in the court and counsel\u2019s hands for 11 months\u201d; that the commissioner had filed his report recommending the granting of a divorce; that additional \u201clegal expense\u201d and court costs caused by further litigation would be \u201coppressive\u201d to the husband; and that dismissal is prejudicial to \u201cdefendant\u2019s right and desire to remove from his solely-owned real estate the cloud of an estranged wife\u2019s inchoate dower.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We do not agree with the husband\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">This court has not recently considered the procedure to be followed in equity for voluntary dismissal of a pending suit. The evolution of the procedure in chancery is tied to the development of the nonsuit rule at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">One hundred and eighty-eight years ago, the General Assembly adopted the first nonsuit statute, which applied only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>to actions at law tried by jury. Section 10 of <em>\u201cAn act coyiceming jeofails ayid certaiyi proceediyigs in civil cases\u201d </em>provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-5\">\u201cEvery person desirous of suffering a nonsuit on trial, shall be barred therefrom, unless he do so before the jury retire from the bar.\u201d Acts 1789, ch. 28.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">The statute remained substantially unchanged until 1932 when it was amended and reenacted to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-7\">\u201cA party shall not be allowed to suffer a non-suit, unless he do so before the jury retire from the bar. And after a non-suit no n,ew proceeding on the same cause of action shall be had in any court other than that in which the non-suit was taken, unless that court is without jurisdiction, or not a proper venue, or other good cause be shown for proceeding in another court.\u201d Acts 1932, ch. 30.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">In 1954, the first sentence of the statute (then codified as Code \u00a7 8-220) was amended and the language pertinent to this case was added as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-9\">\u201cA party shall not be allowed to suffer a nonsuit unless he do so before the jury retire from the bar <em>or before the suit or act\u00fam has beeyi submitted to the court for decisioyi or before a motioyi to strike the evideyice has beeyi sustained by the court.\u201d </em>Acts 1954, ch. 333 at 417.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">Prior to the 1954 amendment, there was no statutory equivalent to \u00a7 8-220 governing dismissal procedure in chancery. So Virginia followed established English chancery practice that a complainant in a suit in equity was <em>domiyius litis, </em>and generally had the absolute right to dismiss the suit at any time before final decree unless affirmative rights of the defendant or others had attached. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Old Dominion Trust Co., </em>139 Va. 246, 255-56, 123 S.E. 549, 551 (1924); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Staunton Mut. Tel. Co., </em>134 Va. 291, 298, 114 S.E. 600, 602 (1922). The injury which would result to a defendant must have been of a character that adversely affected some substantial right concerning his defenses, \u201c \u2018and not the mere ordinary inconveniences of double litigation, which in the eye of the law would be compensated by costs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kemper </em>v. <em>Calhoun, </em>111 Va. 428, 431, 69 S.E. 358, 359 (1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>But with inclusion in the 1954 amendment of the word \u201csuit\u201d, a term indigenous to chancery practice, the General Assembly changed the existing equity general rule and provided for a voluntary dismissal as a matter of right only up to the time the suit had been \u201csubmitted\u201d to the chancellor for decision. Hence, in a nonjury trial, at law or in equity (in which no counterclaim or cross-claim has been filed <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>), a nonsuit or dismissal without prejudice may not occur as a matter of right after the \u201csuit or action has been submitted to the court for decision\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">The critical inquiry in this proceeding then becomes: Had this divorce suit been \u201csubmitted\u201d to the chancellor for decision, within the meaning of the statute, at the time the wife filed her motion to dismiss? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Certainly the mere filing by the commissioner of his report, without more, under Virginia equity practice does not amount to a \u201csubmission\u201d of the cause to the trial court for decision. Such a report may repose in the file in the clerk\u2019s office for many months for any number of reasons before the cause is brought to the attention of the chancellor for adjudication. Moreover, and contrary to the husband\u2019s contention, the unilateral act of this defendant of forwarding to the court a sketch for a decree is not equivalent to a \u201csubmission\u201d in the statutory context.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">For a \u201csubmission\u201d to have occurred under the procedural circumstances of this suit, in which both litigants were represented by counsel who had filed pleadings in the cause, it was necessary for the parties, by counsel, to have <em>both </em>yielded the issues to the court for consideration and decision. This could have been accomplished either as the result of oral or written argument, formal notice and motion, or by tendering a jointly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>endorsed sketch for a decree (or in the case of disagreement over the form, two separate drafts upon notice and motion). None of these steps had taken place at the time the wife\u2019s motion to dismiss was filed and, consequently, under the statute the cause had not been \u201csubmitted\u201d and the plaintiff had an absolute right to a voluntary dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">We likewise reject the husband\u2019s corollary argument that the trial court \u201cabused its discretion\u201d in failing to grant the wife a \u201cno fault\u201d divorce upon the husband\u2019s \u201capplication\u201d therefor. He points out that Code \u00a7 20-91(9)(a) provides (emphasis added) that a divorce from the bond of matrimony could be decreed '\u201c[o]n the <em>application </em>of either party if and when the husband and wife\u201d had been separated for the required statutory period. He says he made \u201capplication\u201d in the cause when it was \u201cfully matured and submitted\u201d and thus he was entitled to have the wife awarded a divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">Aside from the conclusion, already stated, that the cause had not been \u201csubmitted\u201d, we also hold that the request by the husband for a decree in favor of the wife did not amount to an \u201capplication\u201d under \u00a7 20-91(9)(a). For there to be an \u201capplication\u201d under this statute, the party applying must himself seek affirmative relief by way of divorce in his favor through an original divorce proceeding or through a cross-bill filed in a pending suit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here the husband sought to force the wife to obtain a divorce against her wishes. Carried to its logical conclusion in a \u201ccontested\u201d divorce case, approval of the procedure employed by this husband would permit the guilty party to force the innocent one to be awarded a merits adjudication of divorce contrary to the innocent party\u2019s desires when the guilty party himself had no grounds for a divorce in his favor. This would indeed be a novel development in the law, given the public policy in favor of preserving the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">For these reasons, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling. It will consequently be</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b957-13\"> Now, with changes, Code \u00a7 8.01-380(A), effective October 1, 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b957-14\"> Apparently, the husband owned real estate in Blackstone in which the wife had a dower interest.

Meade, Lile\u2019s Equity Pleading and Practice \u00a7 273 (3d ed. 1952); <em>Case </em>v. <em>Case, </em>243 S.C. 447, 449-50, 134 S.E.2d 394, 395 (1964). But the General Assembly in the 1954 amendment obviously intended the statutory term \u201cnonsuit\u201d to be used in a comprehensive sense <em>(i.e., </em>voluntary termination by the plaintiff of pending litigation not precluding a later lawsuit upon the same cause of action), whether it be a nonsuit at law or a dismissal without prejudice in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">This same comprehensive interpretation of the term has been carried forward to the new nonsuit statute. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-380 (A) and 8.01-2(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b959-11\"> Caveat.

Under those circumstances, unlike this case, a determination on the merits of the grounds for divorce would have already been made.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
