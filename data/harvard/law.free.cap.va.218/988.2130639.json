Thereafter, Lloyd Howard Rosser admitted that he had broken and entered the building, and he implicated the defendant, Allard, in the burglary. The defendant says that the testimony given by Rosser, an accomplice, was uncorroborated and that the court erred in not giving a cautionary instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-9\">In the recent case of <em>Dillard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 820, 224 S.E.2d 137 (1976), we enunciated the principles that determine when a cautionary instruction should be given in cases involving the testimony of accessories. There we noted that such an -instruction should be granted in the absence of the corroboration of an accomplice\u2019s testimony. We rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that independent evidence supporting the ultimate fact that the accused committed the offense charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>was required to be shown. We held that a less demanding test, the \u201crelation to guilt standard\u201d, was the proper test and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1154-5\">\u201cThe corroborative evidence, standing alone,' need not be sufficient either to support a conviction or to establish all the essential elements of an offense. If those were the requirements, and the Commonwealth had at hand independent evidence sufficient to satisfy them, then the need to use accomplice testimony would not arise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1154-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1154-7\">\u201cWhere, therefore, the testimony of an accomplice is corroborated in material facts which tend to connect the accused with the crime, sufficient to warrant the jury in crediting the truth of the accomplice\u2019s testimony, it is not error to refuse a cautionary instruction. This rule applies even though the corroborative evidence falls short of constituting \u2018independent evidence which supports the alleged ultimate fact\u2019 that the accused committed the offense charged.\u201d 216 Va. at 823-24, 224 S.E.2d at 140.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1154-8\">In <em>Dillard </em>we quoted from <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>111 Va. 862, 869, 69 S.E. 953, 955 (1911), where we said: \u201c[T]he corroboration or confirmation must relate to some fact (or facts) which goes to establish <em>the guilt </em>of the accused.\u201d We found the test in <em>Jones </em>to be the proper standard, observing that it was \u201cnot as rigid as the ultimate fact test\u201d. 216 Va. at 823, 224 S.E.2d at 140. In the instant case we must analvze the testimony to determine whether, as stated in <em>Jones, </em>the corroboration of the testimony of Rosser \u201crelated to some fact which goes to establish\u201d the guilt of Allard, or, as stated in <em>Dillard, </em>such corroborative testimony \u201ctends to connect\u201d Allard with the burglary. If so, it was not error for the court to have refused a cautionary instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-9\">Rosser testified at length regarding the events that led up to and followed the breaking and entering of the. jewelry store on October 13th. He said that he and Allard got together in the early afternoon hours at his father\u2019s apartment; that they had several drinks there and that he and Allard \u201cwere together about all day from then on, and we went drinking, just messing around and stuff\u201d; that Allard suggested that they break into the Lynchburg Stamp &amp; Seal Jewelry Store because \u201cwe could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>probably get the money out of there\u201d; and that, while he demurred at first, he was eventually persuaded to participate in the burglary. Rosser said that they entered the building about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m.; that although they searched through the store they were unsuccessful in their efforts to find any money; that after they left the building they went to a nearby bar, referred to in the evidence as the Virginia Grill and as Ginger\u2019s Diner, where they \u201cdrank a few beers\u201d. Rosser said that while they were in the bar he observed several Lynchburg policemen who were investigating the burglary which by then had been discovered by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">Rosser admitted that at the time of his arrest for breaking and entering the jewelry store he asked police officer Viar \u201cif Mr. Allard had been charged with the same thing\u201d. It was after Rosser was told that his fingerprints had been found on some broken glass in the jewelry store that he confessed and gave the statement which implicated Allard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">M. D. Roach of the Lynchburg Police Department testified that he investigated the burglary on the night of the break-in and that in the course of the investigation he and other officers went to Ginger\u2019s Diner. He said that there he saw both Rosser and Allard, who were together. When asked if Allard did anything unusual on the occasion, he replied in the affirmative, saying that he [Roach] \u201cremained outside along with several other police officers, and James Allard came up to me and wanted to know what we were doing\u201d. Roach said that Allard wanted to know \u201cwho we were looking for\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-7\">Allard was called as a witness on his own behalf and testified that he had previously been convicted of a felony. He denied participating with Rosser in the burglary but recalled little else about what he did or whom he saw during the afternoon and evening of October 13th. He admitted being with Lloyd Rosser and said that they had been \u201cjust fooling around, hanging around\u201d and drinking. He recalled being at Ginger\u2019s Diner but did not know when he got there. He said that he stayed there until closing time and that Rosser left a little earlier by himself. He testified that there were \u201ca bunch of other people\u201d at the diner but that he did not know who they were or who was serving behind the counter on this night. Allard admitted that while at the diner the police officers showed up on the outside and that he went out and asked Officer Craig \u201cwho was he looking for\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>The defendant was specifically asked, \u201cWere you continuously with him [Rosser] from the time you got with him that afternoon and went to Ginger\u2019s place, did you go there together?\u201d He responded, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d While Allard testified that he had no idea what time they got to the diner, or how long they stayed there, when asked, \u201cAnd Rosser was with you the whole time, you and Rosser the whole time?\u201d he said, \u201cYes, sir, we was together.\u201d He was further asked, \u201cWas Lloyd Rosser with you in your presence the whole night at Ginger\u2019s Diner?\u201d He answered, \u201cYes, sir, up until the time he went home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">The evidence given by Rosser was clear and concise. While, admittedly, he hoped for leniency by the court, he said no promises had been made to him by the prosecution. The burglary was established not alone by Rosser\u2019s confession, but by his fingerprints found at the scene. He implicated his friend and drinking companion, Allard. The facts and circumstances surrounding the burglary tend to connect Allard with the crime. They include the close relationship and association of the two men; Rosser\u2019s inquiry if Allard had been arrested in connection with the burglary made before Rosser had admitted his own involvement in the crime or had implicated anyone else therein; the vague and evasive testimony given by the defendant; the inability of the defendant to recall the events of the day and evening on which the crime was committed; the admission by defendant that he was with Rosser the entire afternoon and evening of October 13th; the failure of Allard to call any witness to show that he remained in the diner the entire evening, or that he was there alone at any time during that evening; and the conduct of Allard which aroused the suspicions of the police officers during their investigation of the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">We can onlv conclude that if Rosser and an accomplice burglarized the .jewelry store on the night of October 13. 1976, and that if Rosser and Allard were together during the entire evening, a fact which the trial judge could have found from the testimony, Rosser\u2019s accomplice was Allard. The occasion and opportunity for Allard to have committed the crime were clearlv shown. <em>See Crosby </em>v. <em>Common wealth, </em>132 Va. 518, 110 S.E. 270 (1922). and <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 833, 223 S.E.2d 877 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>In <em>Smith </em>v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 455, 237 S.E.2d 776 (1977) we held it error for a cautionary instruction to have been refused. However, in <em>Smith </em>there was no evidence other than that of the accomplice which connected the defendant with the crime. Thus, the accomplice\u2019s testimony was not sufficiently corroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">The testimony of Rosser was corroborated in many of the material facts which related to and tended to connect Allard with the burglary charged, and to such an extent that the trial judge was warranted in crediting the truth of the testimony of the accomplice. It was not error, therefore, for the trial court to have refused the defendant\u2019s cautionary instruction. We find no merit in defendant\u2019s other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1153-10\"> \u201cInstruction C.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-11\">\u201cThe Court instructs the jury that under the testimony given by Lloyd Rosser in this case, he was an accomplice in the commission of the offense charged in the indictment, and while the jury may find its verdict upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, such evidence is to be received with great caution, and the Court, in this case, warns the jury of the danger of basing a verdict on the unsupported testimony of an accomplice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-12\">\u201cThe Court further instructs the jury that the testimony of an accomplice must be received with great care and caution, and if you believe the testimony of an alleged accomplice was false, and that he was induced to testify falsely, either by fear of punishment or hope of reward, you must disregard that testimony in its entirety.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
