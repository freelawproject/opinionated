During subsequent construction of several homes on the parcel, appellees Herndon Lumber and Millwork, Inc. and Washington Concrete Products, a Division of General Industries, Inc., supplied certain materials under contracts with Baker and Moore.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">In December of 1974, Herndon Lumber and Washington Concrete each recorded a Memorandum For Mechanic\u2019s Lien alleging certain indebtednesses due them by Baker and Moore. Listed as the name of the owner in each memorandum was only Baker and Moore General Contractors, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">Thereafter, foreclosure proceedings commenced under the deed of trust. Loyola Federal purchased the property at the sale and a deed from the trustees to Loyola was recorded in April of 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">In May of 1975, this proceeding was instituted, Herndon Lumber filing a petition to enforce its mechanic\u2019s lien against, among others, Loyola Federal. Washington Concrete thereafter filed an intervening.petition to enforce its lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">Following reference to a commissioner in chancery, the trial court confirmed that part of the commissioner\u2019s report which found that the respective petitioners had each complied with the provisions of the appropriate statute to perfect their liens. From the lower court\u2019s June 14, 1976 final decree declaring the liens valid, we granted Loyola Federal an appeal, limited to a consideration of the foregoing issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">Loyola argues that the liens were defective and thus invalid. It cites Code \u00a7 43-4, which deals with the requirements for perfection of mechanic\u2019s liens under these circumstances and which provides, in part, that the memorandum must include \u201cthe names of the owner of the property sought to be charged\u201d. Loyola contends that \u201cboth the holder of the equitable title, and the Trustees, holding legal title, are \u2018owners\u2019 of the real property and therefore [the names of the trustees] must be in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>eluded in the Memorandum of Lien\u201d. We do not agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">The word \u201cowner\u201d in \u00a7 43-4 was not qualified, hence the statutory term is to be construed in its ordinary meaning, given the context in which it is used. <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Brumback, </em>177 Va. 36, 42, 12 S.E.2d 801, 803-04 (1941). \u201cOwner\u201d is a word of general purport, but its primary meaning, as applied to land, is \u201cone who owns the fee and who has the right to dispose of the property\u201d and includes \u201cone having a possessory right to land\u201d. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1259 (rev. 4th ed. 1968). Thus, \u201cowner\u201d, as used in \u00a7 43-4, means the fee simple owner of the real estate, the one who has the right of possession to the land, the person who may be, in fact, responsible for the debt to the mechanic and for the subsequent lien against the property. In this context, \u201cowner\u201d does not mean a trustee under a deed of trust (which is likewise a lien), whose powers and duties are limited by statute and the instrument under which he acts.</p>\n<p id=\"A_Y\">To recognize that a trustee is not an \u201cowner\u201d under \u00a7 43-4, one need only refer to other provisions of the mechanic\u2019s lien laws, Code \u00a7\u00a7 43-1 to -71. Section 43-1 provides that the term \u201cgeneral contractor\u201d includes certain specified persons \u201cwho contract directly with the owner\u201d; that section also specifies that the term \u201csubcontractor\u201d shall include certain designated persons \u201cwho do not contract with the owner but with the general contractor\u201d. Similarly, \u00a7 43-3, dealing with the creation of a mechanic\u2019s lien, provides that when the claim is for repairs or improvements to existing structures only, no lien shall attach to the property unless such work was \u201cordered or authorized by the owner, or his agent.\u201d Likewise, \u00a7 43-11, which specifies how the \u201cowner\u201d may become personally liable, provides for timely notice of the probable amount of the claim to \u201cthe owner or his agent\u201d to be followed by a verified account of the claim furnished to \u201cthe owner\u201d of the building or structure upon which the work was done. That statute also deals with the effect of a bona fide agreement for deductions \u201cby the owner\u201d because of the general contractor\u2019s breach of contract. Correspondingly, \u00a7 43-13.1 specifies that one is guilty of a felony who knowingly presents a forged waiver of lien form \u201cto an owner, his agent, contractor, lender, or title company\u201d for certain purposes. Finally, \u00a7 43-16 deals with the circumstance when \u201cthe owner is compelled to complete <em>his </em>building, structure, or railroad\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>(emphasis added) and speaks of the \u201camount expended by the owner for such completion\u201d. To treat \u201ctrustee\u201d as a synonym for \u201cowner\u201d in any of the foregoing statutes would produce an absurd result completely foreign to the obvious meaning of each of the provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">For these reasons, we hold the trial court was correct in deciding that the memoranda in issue were valid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the decree appealed from will be</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b968-10\"> This issue is the subject of a 1977 statutory change, note 2 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b970-6\"> While not affecting this proceeding, the 1977 General Assembly amended Code' \u00a7 43-1 to include the following definition of \u201cowner\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-7\">\u201cAs used in this chapter, the term \u2018owner' shall not be construed to mean any person holding bare legal title under an instrument to secure a debt or indemnify a surety. . . .\u201d Acts 1977, ch. 294.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
