Ten days earlier, his wife, Janice Leonard McCreery, had been granted temporary custody of their two daughters, then aged two and four. Following <em>ore terms </em>hearings and pursuant to a letter opinion dated April 8, 1976, the chancellor entered an order on April 16,1976 awarding permanent custody to Mr. McCreery and visitation rights to his wife. The chancellor denied Mrs. McCreery\u2019s motion to stay execution of the order pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-16\">The crucial question raised by Mrs. McCreery is: \u201cDid the chancellor err in expressly holding that this Court has abolished the \u2018tender years presumption\u2019 and in failing to find it controlling in this case?\u201d This question posits two issues, <em>viz.. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>whether the \u201cpresumption\u201d has been abolished, and, if not, whether it is controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">In <em>Mullen </em>v. <em>Mullen, </em>188 Va. 259, 270-71, 49 S.E.2d 349, 354 (1948), we held that \u201cthe mother is the natural custodian of her child of tender years, and that if she is a fit and proper person, other things being equal, she should be given the custody\u201d. In his letter opinion, the chancellor construed our decision in <em>Burnside </em>v. <em>Burnside, </em>216 Va. 691, 222 S.E.2d 529 (1976), \u201cto overrule <em>Mullen </em>and all earlier cases in Virginia to the extent that there exists any presumption in favor of the mother as being the natural custodian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">As appears from our decision in <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>217 Va. 477, 229 S.E.2d 875 (1976) (decided after the date of the chancellor\u2019s letter opinion) affirming the chancellor\u2019s application of the presumption, and as the husband concedes on brief, <em>Burnside </em>did not overrule <em>Mullen </em>and its progeny. On the contrary, <em>Burnside </em>fully acknowledged the <em>Mullen </em>rule. Analyzing the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, quoting the chancellor\u2019s conclusion that \u201call things are hot equal in this case\u201d, and citing <em>Portewig </em>v. <em>Ryder, </em>208 Va. 791, 794, 160 S.E.2d 789, 792 (1968), where we said that the rule \u201cis not to be applied without regard to the surrounding circumstances\u201d, we invoked the maxim that, notwithstanding the \u201cpresumption\u201d and other \u201csecondary\u201d matters, \u201cthe primary and controlling consideration is the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d <em>Burnside </em>v. <em>Burnside, supra, </em>216 Va. at 692-93, 222 S.E.2d at 530-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Confusion about the nature and function of the so-called \u201ctender years presumption\u201d results from confusion between two important societal values \u2014 the right of a parent to custody of its minor child and the right of a child to the custodial care of a parent. In the scale of values, society gives priority to the latter. This is. so principally because society owes one of its dependent members a duty superior to the duty it owes a self-sufficient member.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The \u201ctender years presumption\u201d is relevant only in custody disputes between natural parents. Yet, it has nothing to do with the respective rights of the two parents. Rather, it has to do with the right of the child. The \u201cpresumption\u201d is, in fact, an inference society has drawn that such right is best served when a child of tender years is awarded the custodial care of its mother. <em>See Harper </em>v. <em>Harper, supra, </em>217 Va. at 479, 229 S.E.2d at 877. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>courts, acting in the interest of society at large, apply that inference irrespective of the rights of the parents. And that inference controls unless, in a particular case, it is overcome bv evidence that the right of the child will be better served by awarding the child the custodial care of its father.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">By definition, the inference controls only when the evidence shows that the mother is fit and \u201cother things\u201d affecting the child\u2019s welfare are equal. Even when it appears that both mother and father are fit parents, other things yet may be unequal. These \u201cother things\u201d are things which affect the quality of the custodial care received by the child. Quality is determined not only in terms of the training, talents, and resources of the custodian but also in terms of the motivation of the custodian to make proper provision for the physical needs of the child, its psychological and emotional health, its intellectual and cultural growth, and its moral development. Although fully qualified in other respects, a person may be too ill-suited by temperament or too preoccupied with personal pursuits to administer proper care to a child. Comparing the quality of care offered by two parents, the courts are guided by histories of past performance and prospects for future performance. If the comparison results in equipoise, the inference that the right of the child is best served by awarding the child the custodial care of the mother controls. We must decide whether, as Mrs. McCreery contends, the inference is \u201ccontrolling in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The letter opinion discloses that, notwithstanding his erroneous reading of <em>Burnside, </em>the chancellor considered what he called the \u201ccriteria\u201d explicated in <em>Mullen </em>and based his decision upon \u201call of the surrounding circumstances\u201d affecting the quality of custodial care offered by the two parents. Looking to the \u201cenvironment for raising the children\u201d, he noted the difference in living accommodations. When Mrs. McCreery left her husband in January 1976, she and the children moved into \u201ca two-bedroom apartment in an apartment complex\u201d located several miles from the jointly-owned marital domicile. Mr. McCreery remained in the home, \u201ca spacious, attractive and well-appointed detached residential dwelling with separate bedrooms for the children\u201d, located within two blocks of a school, the family\u2019s church, and the home of the children\u2019s babysitter. He testified that he planned to \u201cbuy out my wife\u2019s interest in the house\u201d and live there with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>As Mrs. McCreery points out, \u201c[suitability of the home is not to be determined <em>merely </em>by comparing physical accommodations or material advantages.\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>White </em>v. <em>White, </em>215 Va. 765, 768, 213 S.E.2d 766, 768 (1975); <em>accord, Clark </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>217 Va. 924, 234 S.E.2d 266 (1977). While such a comparison, standing alone, is never dispositive, the adequacy of living facilities and the convenience of the location of the home may be highly relevant to the determination of the suitability of the child-rearing environment, and the chancellor committed no error in considering the comparison in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The chancellor also considered what he called \u201cthe effect on [Mrs. McCreery\u2019s] life and her habits and behavior of her employment with the Federal Government, and of her attachment to her supervisor and fellow employee, Mr. Short.\u201d Mrs. McCreery argues that the chancellor denied her equal protection of the laws by \u201ctreating the mother differently from the father on the basis of her employment\u201d. In effect, she says that the right of a working mother to the custody of her child is equal to that of a working father, and that the decree constituted a judicial denial of her constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">We examine the facts underlying the constitutional question. The McCreery\u2019s first daughter was born in January 1972. Three months later, Mrs. McCreery decided she wanted to return to work. Although she had had four years\u2019 experience as a school teacher, she applied for different work. Mr. McCreery testified that she had told him \u201cover and over again\u201d that \u201cshe hated teaching because it was babysitting.\u201d In April 1973, six months before the second child was born in October, Mrs. McCreery accepted a position which she held for five months. Three months after the birth of the second child, she began filing applications for a position with the Federal Government. In October 1974, when the older child was two years old and the younger one year old, Mrs. McCreery accepted a job at a level classified four grades below the level for which she had qualified. She testified that her husband wanted her to go back to work and that the reason she did so was to earn money to pay certain family bills. Mr. McCreery said that the family had no unpaid bills and that he had asked his wife not to return to work. The chancellor found that Mrs. McCreery had \u201csought outside employment to relieve her of the stress and anxiety of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>household duties and chores and in connection with the raising of the children\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">As federal employees, both parents were frequently required to make TDY (temporary duty) trips to distant cities. \u201cNine or ten times\u201d Mrs. McCreery was accompanied by Mr. Short. On one such trip, she took the children to the home of a friend in Seaford and, without leaving word where she could be reached, went to Norfolk and registered qt the same motel where Mr. Short was registered. After Mrs. McCreery left her husband, Mr. Short left his wife and stayed with two friends in an apartment. Mrs. McCreery gave him a key to the apartment where she and the children were living, and during the week preceding the custody hearing he spent two nights in her apartment and \u201cstored\u201d some of his clothes, shaving gear, and other personal effects there.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The chancellor drew what he called an \u201cinescapable\u201d inference but found that the evidence was insufficient to show that the children had been subjected to \u201cany immoral influences\u201d or that Mrs. McCreery \u201cis an unfit mother.\u201d He concluded, however, that she \u201chas, perhaps unconsciously, relegated these two little girls to a position secondary to her job and her relationship with Mr. Short.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Accepting the premise that the rights of two working parents to the custody of their children are coequal, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 31-15 (Repl. Vol. 1973), We reject Mrs. McCreery\u2019s contention that the custody decree was the product of invidious discrimination. The chancellor did not divide working parents into separate classes according to sex. Nor did he base his decision upon a finding that mothers are not proper custodians unless they are full-time housewives. Rather, comparing the quality of custodial care offered by two working parents, he decided that the effect of Mrs. McCreery\u2019s employment on her \u201chabits and behavior\u201d, <em>i.e., </em>her preoccupation with \u201cthe glamour of her work\u201d and \u201cher relationship with her supervisor\u201d, was such that \u201cthe interests of the two children in this case would be best served\u201d by awarding the children the custodial care of a working father who \u201cis willing to place the welfare of these children above all else, to a much greater extent than the mother\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Aside from the constitutional question, Mrs. McCreery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>contends that the chancellor\u2019s decision is not supported by the evidence and, therefore, constitutes an abuse of discretion. Several witnesses testified that Mr. McCreery performed many household chores and personal services for the children. On occasion, he prepared hot meals and washed the dishes, changed diapers and did the laundry, bathed and dressed the children, and took them to and from the babysitter\u2019s home where the children were left while the McCreerys were at work. The babysitter said that \u201c[h]e is a mother figure really in their eyes\u201d. One witness stated that Mrs. McCreery had told her that Mr. McCreery \u201chad been as much a mother to the girls as she had\u201d. Based upon his findings during four hours of examination, Dr. Joel Ganz, Supervisor of Psychiatry at Georgetown University School of Medicine, described Mr. McCreery as \u201ca very nurturing parent\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s not only willing to be a father, he\u2019s willing to be a mother, in being able to serve both roles. I think he has a tremendous function for the children . .. rather than the usual working father role.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In his testimony concerning his wife\u2019s treatment of the children, Mr. McCreery recounted certain incidents which he felt were indicative of indifference and neglect. Mrs. McCreery\u2019s witnesses, her aunt, her sister, her brother-in-law, and a neighbor, testified that she had been a good mother to her children. The witnesses called by Mr. McCreery, none of whom were related to either party, described the differences in the relationship between the children and their two parents. The babysitter, who had been employed by both parties, testified that when the father comes to pick up the children, \u201cthey\u2019re overjoyed\u201d, \u201cthrilled\u201d, \u201cvery excited\u201d, \u201call over him\u201d; when the mother comes, \u201c[t]hey are usually matter of fact, get their coats on and ready to go\u201d. After Mrs. McCreery left her husband and moved into the apartment, the children \u201cwent through a bad time. They were insecure . .. went back to carrying their security blankets.\u201d A neighbor who had known the McCreerys for more than nine years testified that the children were \u201cconstantly sitting in their daddy\u2019s lap\u201d but that she had \u201cnever seen [Mrs. McCreery] be very affectionate with the children.\u201d Some time before the second child was born, Mrs. McCreery told the witness \u201cthat if she had to do this all over again, speaking of having children, that she didn\u2019t think that she would.\u201d Another family friend who frequently exchanged visits with the McCreerys testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>the children \u201care very open, spontaneous, and affectionate with their father. I have never really seen them be affectionate at all to their mother.\u201d \u201c[W]hen I compare the two, the mother and the father, the way I see the children respond to both of them, they certainly do seem to be much better off with their father.\u201d Dr. Ganz was asked to describe the effect upon the children of having \u201canother man, other than their father, spending two or three evenings a week at the apartment with the mother and every other weekend visitation privileges with the father\u201d. Dr. Ganz replied: \u201cI would think the children in this situation might regress, they might start to thumb-suck if they\u2019d stopped, they might get into bed-wetting and security blankets, things they have given up as independents, they might regress back to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We hold that the evidence was sufficient to show that \u201cother things\u201d were not equal in this case; hence, the \u201ctender years presumption\u201d was not controlling. While, because of his misimpression that the \u201cpresumption\u201d had been abolished, the chancellor did not expressly pronounce that the presumption had been overcome, the findings stated in his letter opinion were tantamount to a pronouncement that \u201cother things\u201d were not equal. Those findings, based as they were upon evidence heard <em>ore terms, </em>and his decision that the interests of the children will be best served by awarding them the custodial care of their father are presumed to be correct. Reading from the transcript, we cannot say that the chancellor abused his discretion or that his decision was plainly wrong, and we will affirm the final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">I\u2019Anson, C.J., and Carrico, J., dissent No dissenting opinions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
