Spencer sought from John Adams Cooper, Sr., a statement and settlement of the accounts of a business partnership Mrs. Spencer alleged the parties had \u201cengaged in\u201d while they lived together as husband and wife. Acting upon the report of a commissioner in chancery, the court ruled that a partnership had existed between the parties and that Mrs. Spencer was entitled to judgment against Cooper in the sum of $3,481.80, representing her share of the partnership assets. On appeal, the sole question is whether the trial court erred in finding the existence of a partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Both parties had been married previously. In 1947, believing mistakenly that their respective divorces had become final, they went through a marriage ceremony. The union continued until 1970, when the parties separated. Upon seeking advice of counsel, they learned they had not been married legally. The ostensible Mrs. Cooper then married another, and she is now Mrs. Spencer.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Pertinent parts of the record show that, in 1960, the parties purchased and moved to a farm in Franklin County, to which they took title as tenants by the entireties. In 1962, they commenced a commercial egg business and farming operation, which they called \u201cJo-Bets Farm,\u201d derived from the first name of each. The business prospered and, in 1965, Cooper left his regular job to devote more time to the farming venture. Assisted by their three children, the parties worked together in the business. Periodically, each worked part-time in employment away from the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">The parties maintained a joint checking account in which they deposited the income from the farming operation and from their outside employment. From the account, they paid not only the expenses of the business but also the family\u2019s living expenses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>They filed joint income tax returns reflecting their income from all sources, but they filed no partnership returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Following the separation of the parties in 1970, Cooper continued to operate the business until the farm was sold in 1972. Proceeds from the sale of the farm were divided between the parties. The present litigation resulted from their disagreement over division of their other assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Testifying before the commissioner in chancery, Mrs. Spencer claimed that the \u201cJo-Bets\u201d business was \u201coperated as a partnership.\u201d She stated that the contracts the business executed with its customers were \u201cmarked\u201d to show \u201cit was a partnership\u201d and that each partner \u201cwould sign [a contract] and put \u2018partner\u2019 \u201d after his or her name. She identified several customer contracts; all, however, were signed by Cooper only, and none identified the business as a partnership. When this lack of partnership identification was called to her attention and she was asked whether she could produce \u201cany documents showing that [the business] was a partnership,\u201d Mrs. Spencer replied: \u201cI don\u2019t have to. When man and his wife live together that is enough for me to say there was a partnership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Called as a witness by Mrs. Spencer, Cooper maintained that the business was not a partnership but merely \u201ca family operation.\u201d Cooper testified that the parties shared everything, \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cprofits,\u201d but the sharing was \u201cjointly,\u201d as \u201cman and wife.\u201d Although he stated that the parties \u201csplit everything equally,\u201d he explained that no division ever was made \u201cof the money,\u201d and \u201cboth worked and both lived off the proceeds . .. like any family would do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">In <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Knox, </em>197 Va. 602, 607, 90 S.E.2d 844, 847 (1956), which involved another dispute over whether a partnership existed between husband and wife, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">\u201cPartnership relations are formed by a contract expressed or implied between two or more parties for joining together their money, goods, labor, or skill in a venture or business, upon an agreement to divide the gains or losses between them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">In the present case, because no express agreement was claimed by Mrs. Spencer, she had the burden of producing evidence from which the trial court could find the existence of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>implied partnership agreement between the parties. We do not believe Mrs. Spencer carried this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The Uniform Partnership Act, in effect in Virginia, sets forth several indicia of the existence of a partnership. Code \u00a7 50-7(4) provides that the \u201creceipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is prima facie evidence that he is a partner in the business ....\u201d But the evidence in this case does not show that Mrs. Spencer ever received a share of the profits of the \u201cJo-Bets\u201d business. She did not testify that profits were divided, and she did not contradict Cooper\u2019s positive testimony that no division ever occurred; neither did she dispute Cooper\u2019s statement that the parties merely \u201clived off the proceeds .. . like any family would do.\u201d So Mrs. Spencer is not entitled to the benefit of a prima facie case under Code \u00a7 50-7.</p>\n<p id=\"AlW\">Other indicia of the existence of a partnership, enumerated by the Uniform Act, are the joint ownership of property and the \u201csharing of gross returns.\u201d But, even when present, such indicia do \u201cnot of [themselves] establish a partnership.\u201d Code \u00a7 50-7(2) and (3). While Mrs. Spencer jointly owned with Cooper the \u201cJo-Bets\u201d farm property, and while she may have shared the gross returns of the business, beyond these facts, all Mrs. Spencer offered to prove the existence of a partnership was her self-serving, conclusory statement that the business was \u201coperated as a partnership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The evidence was not sufficient to support a finding of an implied partnership agreement between the parties; it showed no more than what Cooper termed \u201ca family operation.\u201d Accordingly, the decree of the trial court will be reversed, and a final decree will be entered here in favor of Cooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final decree.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
