(Kitchens). The specific question presented is whether the trial court erred in holding Kitchens not subject to its jurisdiction under the provisions of Virginia\u2019s \u201clong arm statute\u201d which grants our courts personal jurisdiction over a party \u201cas to a cause of action arising from the [party\u2019s] . . . [transacting any business in this State.\u201d Code \u00a7 8-81.2(a)(l).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The facts are not in dispute. Plywood, a Virginia corporation, operates a plant in Danville, Virginia, which manufactures plywood panels. Kitchens uses plywood panels in fabricating kitchen cabinets at its plant in Richland, Pennsylvania. Kitchens, a foreign corporation, is not domesticated in Virginia. It has never sold or offered to sell its products in Virginia. The officers and directors of Kitchens are not, nor have they ever been, residents of or domiciled in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">On September 28, 1975, Gordon Herron, a salesman employed by several manufacturers, including Plywood, called on Kitchens at its plant in Pennsylvania. As the result of Herron\u2019s solicitation, Kitchens placed an order with Plywood for more than 500 plywood panels to be shipped, F.O.B. Danville, to Kitchens. On November 7, 1975, Plywood delivered the panels to a common carrier which, in due course, delivered them to Kitchens\u2019 plant in Pennsylvania. On the same date Plywood billed Kitchens for the panels in the amount of $5,844.35. When Kitchens declined to pay this bill, alleging that some of the panels shipped to it were defective, Plywood instituted this action in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">The purpose of our \u201clong arm statute\u201d is to assert jurisdiction, to the extent permissible under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution of the United States, over nonresidents who engage in some purposeful activity in Virginia. <em>Carmichael </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>209 Va. 451, 456, 164 S.E.2d 703, 707 (1968). And a single act by a nonresident which amounts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u201ctransacting business\u201d in Virginia and gives rise to a cause of action may be sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon our courts. <em>Kolbe, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chromodern, Inc., </em>211 Va. 736, 740, 180 S.E.2d 664, 667 (1971). Due process requires, however, that a nonresident have \u201ccertain minimum contacts\u201d within the territory of the forum so that the maintenance of the action does not offend \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">In addressing itself to the question of what minimum contacts in the forum state suffice to satisfy due process, the Supreme Court in <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235 (1958), pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">\u201c... The application of that rule will vary with the quality and nature of the defendant\u2019s activity, but it is essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws . .. .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Here Kitchens\u2019 order was solicited by Plywood\u2019s representative in Pennsylvania, and the order, upon which Plywood relies to create a contract, was prepared by Plywood\u2019s agent in Pennsylvania. Kitchens is not domesticated in Virginia, and none of its officers or directors is a resident of or is domiciled in this state. Kitchens has never sold or offered to sell any of its products in Virginia. While the risk of loss of panels shipped F.O.B. Danville passed from Plywood to Kitchens when the panels were placed in the possession of the common carrier at Danville, Code \u00a7 8.2-319(a), and while technical acceptance of the order may have occurred in Virginia by Plywood\u2019s delivery of the panels to the carrier, this evidence is insufficient to establish that Kitchens had the necessary \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with Virginia to satisfy due process and give our courts jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\"> Recodified in 1977 as Code \u00a7 8.01-328.1(A)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
