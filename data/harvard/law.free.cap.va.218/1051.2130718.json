(A &amp; P or employer). The narrow question presented here is whether there is credible evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding that Robertson is continuing to suffer total disability as a result of this occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-8\">Medical authorities agree that meat wrappers asthma is a bronchial reaction or pulmonary insufficiency resulting from exposure to the fumes generated when a \u201chot\u201d wire cuts the plastic wrapping used by butchers to package cuts of meat for display and sale. The active agent in the wrapping material is polyvinyl chloride. Some, but not all, authorities believe that price labeling ink is a factor in causing the disease. The authorities appear to agree that the disease is \u201creversible early, chronic with continued exposure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-9\">Robertson was employed by A &amp; P as a meat wrapper for approximately 24 years. On March 5, 1976, she was hospitalized and treated for meat wrappers asthma. Robertson\u2019s symptoms subsided so she was released from the hospital on March 11 and allowed to return' to work on March 18. Shortly after she returned to work, Robertson again suffered the coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath which are symptoms of the disease. She was readmitted to the hospital for treatment on March 26 and was discharged as improved on April 3. Robertson testified at the hearing before Commissioner Joyner on November 16,1976, that she was still unable to return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-10\">The employer does not challenge the Commission\u2019s finding that Robertson contracted an occupational disease, as defined in Code \u00a7 65.1-46, while employed by A &amp; P and that she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>entitled to receive compensation and other benefits for a \u201ccertain period of time.\u201d It argues, however, that there is no credible evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding that Robertson continues to suffer total disability from an occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">Upon appeal the Commission\u2019s finding of fact are conclusive and binding upon us if supported by credible evidence. Code \u00a7 65.1-98. <em>Shawley </em>v. Shea-Ball, 216 Va. 442, 219 S.E.2d 849 (1975). If, however, there is no credible evidence on which the Commission\u2019s findings of fact are based, its findings are not binding and the question presented becomes one of law. <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Bragg, </em>203 Va. 204, 123 S.E.2d 393 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">The medical evidence consists of the written reports from four physicians and the deposition of one of those physicians. Two of the physicians, Dr. James E. Wheless and Dr. Gary E. Glontz, jointly practice internal medicine. They saw Robertson initially and arranged for her hospital admissions. Dr. Alexander McCausland, a specialist in allergies and immunology, was called in by them as a consultant and confirmed the diagnosis by the internists that Robertson was suffering from meat wrappers asthma. At the employer\u2019s request, Dr. Edward S. Ray of the Medical College of Virginia saw Robertson on two occasions to evaluate her condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-7\">Dr. Wheless, by his report of July 21, 1976, was of the opinion that Robertson was totally and permanently disabled as a result of meat wrappers asthma. In a supplement to his report, on November 29, 1976, Dr. Wheless said he would \u201cprofessionally defer to any decision [of] Dr. McCausland ... regarding the cause of Mrs. Robertson\u2019s problem.\u201d Dr. Wheless, responding to a request to Dr. Glontz for a report, stated that Dr. Glontz would likewise defer to Dr. McCausland\u2019s opinion on the cause of Mrs. Robertson\u2019s problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-8\">Dr. Ray first saw and examined the employee on August 18, 1976. Reporting on this examination Dr. Ray said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1217-9\">\u201cIt is my opinion that Mrs. Robertson is hypersensitive to the fumes and gases generated by the mechanism of cutting and sealing of the plastic wrappings of meat. She developed severe spasms of her bronchi as the result of exposure to these fumes and gases that required hospitalization on two occasions in March, 1976. I agree that she should have no further exposure to these agents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>\u201cI also believe that this experience has resulted in the bronchi of Mrs. Robertson becoming more s\u00e9nsitive to other air pollutants and that she should continue to avoid all air pollutants as much as possible. It is likely that this hypersensitivity to air pollutants will disappear over the next few months, but until this occurs, I consider her totally disabled as the result of her employment as a meatwrapper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">Dr. Ray examined Mrs. Robertson on November 17. Regarding this examination, he states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-6\">\u201cIt remains my opinion that Mrs. Robertson has episodes of bronchospasm and that her bronchi are hypersensitive to air pollutants. I would suggest that she be given work beginning 12-1-76, in a working environment free of air pollutants (smoke, fumes, dust, odors, etc.) and that required light physical activity. If her wheezing increases, she should be retired... .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-7\">\u201cMrs. Robertson has been seen in consultation by Dr. Alexander McCausland of Roanoke who is a specialist in allergies and hypersensitive reactions of the bronchi. I would suggest that you obtain his opinion in regard to the relationships of Mrs. Robertson\u2019s exposure to the gases as a meatwrapper and her persistent symptoms of cough and intermittent wheezing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1218-8\">The deposition of Dr. Alexander McCausland was taken on December 6, 1976, by leave of the Commission, and filed as a part of the record. As we noted earlier, Dr. McCausland confirmed the original diagnosis of meat wrappers asthma made by Drs. Wheless and Glontz while Robertson was hospitalized. He agreed that the disease was reversible early and could become chronic with continued exposure. On the basis of Robertson\u2019s history, which showed she suffered from hay fever and other allergies as early as 1954, Dr. McCausland was of the opinion that her difficulty arising from exposure to polyvinyl chloride was \u201ctransient [,] because [when] she got out of it, she got all right.\u201d When Dr. McCausland saw the employee on April 21, 1976, \u201c[s]he wasn\u2019t having too much trouble,\u201d so he concluded that she was no longer suffering from meat wrappers asthma but from her other allergies. At the time he testified, Dr. McCausland was still treating the employee for dust allergy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>Referring to Robertson\u2019s reaction to oven cleaners, dust and smoke, Dr. McCausland believed \u201cthey are separate things except that they may have made her a little more susceptible fin] the meat wrapper job.. ..\u201d When asked if Robertson\u2019s length of exposure as a meat wrapper \u201cwould have made her chronic\u201d the physician responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-5\">\u201cI really don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know what [the medical authorities] consider chronic in this. I don\u2019t have enough information to know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-6\">\u201c... [M]y idea of the word \u2018chronic\u2019 would be ... a person who kept on wheezing and didn\u2019t quit but that is purely my opinion.. ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">In finding that Robertson was totally disabled, the Commission obviously accepted Dr. Ray\u2019s opinion, based upon his August 18 examination, that Robertson suffered total disability as a result of her occupational disease. While the employer argues that Dr. Ray, in a later report, deferred to Dr. McCausland\u2019s view that Robertson\u2019s work-related asthma had \u201ccleared up\u201d, this was not the effect of Dr. Ray\u2019s later report; he merely suggested that an opinion be obtained from Dr. McCausland. And, in any event, the Commission was free to accept Dr. Ray\u2019s opinion rather than Dr. McCausland\u2019s views. Because Dr. Ray\u2019s opinion constitutes credible evidence supporting the Commission\u2019s finding that Robertson was totally disabled from an occupational disease, we will affirm the award of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
