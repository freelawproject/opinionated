To the November 18, 1976 order sentencing him to confinement for these convictions, we granted defendant a writ of error limited to a consideration of four questions. They deal with the legality of a warrantless arrest, the validity of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>consensual search, the admissibility of inculpatory statements made by the defendant and the correctness of a pre-trial ruling on discovery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">These are the facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, gleaned from the evidence presented during a suppression hearing and at the trial. On December 19, 1975, Detective Martin F. Twomey, assigned to the Robbery Division of the Norfolk Police Department, was working part-time as a salesclerk at a Norfolk gun shop. A customer, who acted \u201crather suspicious\u201d in Twomey\u2019s opinion, sought to purchase ammunition for a carbine and for a .32 caliber pistol, the customer being unsure whether he needed the .32 caliber ammunition \u201cfor an automatic or a revolver.\u201d Thereupon, the customer left the store and immediately returned with an \u201cunusual\u201d foreign-made .32 caliber automatic pistol which looked like a .45 caliber gun. The customer purchased a quantity of ammunition for the carbine and, with Twomey\u2019s advice, rounds to fit the pistol. Because the customer\u2019s \u201cmannerisms in' the store didn\u2019t seem right,\u201d Twomey made a note of his name, age and address \u2014 \u201cSamuel Lowe, birthday, 8-30-50, 1448 Longdale Drive, Norfolk, Virginia\u201d \u2014 as recorded by the individual upon purchase of the ammunition. As the customer left, Twomey also \u201cjotted down\u201d the license number of the Oldsmobile automobile in which the customer was riding as a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Three days later, on December 22, 1975, a Norfolk Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (ABC) store was robbed. Twomey was assigned, in the course of his police duties, to investigate. Upon arrival at the scene, Twomey learned that two armed men had committed the crime; one had carried a carbine and the other had used what appeared to an eyewitness to be a .45 caliber pistol. Twomey was told that the pistol-wielding bandit had jumped upon the store counter and fired a shot into the ceiling. The only physical evidence which Twomey found at the scene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>was located near the counter and was a .32 caliber automatic shell casing of the type he had sold his customer in the gun shop on December 19. In the course of the investigation, Twomey obtained detailed physical descriptions of the robbers. In addition, Twomey learned from a witness the license number of a Plymouth automobile used by the robbers as the \u201cgetaway\u201d vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">As Twomey was drafting the report of his investigation, it \u201cdawn[ed] on\u201d him that one of the robbers may have been his December 19 gun-shop customer. The eyewitnesses\u2019 physical description of one of the robbers <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was similar to the customer\u2019s appearance, as Twomey remembered it. The guns reportedly used in the robbery and the shell casing found at the scene were like the items involved in the earlier ammunition sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">But at this point, Twomey felt that \u201cit was premature\u201d to seek a warrant for Lowe\u2019s arrest. He testified he was uncertain whether his customer had given his correct name at the time he bought the ammunition and he wanted \u201ca little more evidence\u201d that the ammunition purchaser and the robber were the same person. Therefore, Twomey endeavored to find \u201cSamuel Lowe\u201d in order to observe his customer again to determine whether he matched the robber\u2019s description.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Twomey then retrieved from his personal papers at home the notes he had made at the gun shop and proceeded to look for \u201cLowe.\u201d He obtained from the Division of Motor Vehicles the description of a Pontiac automobile registered in the name of a \u201cSamuel Lowe\u201d and went to 1448 Longdale Drive, the address given by the customer, on several occasions during the week following the robbery looking for the vehicle, but was unable to find it. Twomey determined that the Oldsmobile which transported his customer to the gun shop was registered to an individual at an address which was on the \u201cnext street from Longdale\u201d Drive. He also ascertained that the Plymouth used as the robbers\u2019 \u201cgetaway\u201d car was a stolen vehicle. During one of his trips to the vicinity of 1448 Longdale Drive, Twomey found the Plymouth parked a \u201cblock and a half\u201d from that address.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Thereafter, on December 28, 1975, near 10:00 p.m., Twomey, accompanied by several other police officers, went to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Longdale Drive address, an apartment building, to \u201csee if the man [he] saw [at the gun shop] was the man named Samuel Lowe living at\u201d that address. Previously, Twomey had \u201cchecked the rental agency\u201d and had been told that \u201cno man by that name had rented an apartment at 1448 Longdale.\u201d The police had not obtained an arrest or search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">At the address were four apartment units, two \u201cdownstairs and two upstairs.\u201d In front of the building was parked the Pontiac automobile registered to \u201cLowe.\u201d The officers entered the building (the record does not indicate that the entrance door was locked) and Twomey knocked on the first-floor \u201cleft-hand door first\u201d and determined \u201cLowe\u201d was not there. He next went to the other first-floor unit and told the female answering the door \u201cwho [he] was looking for and she stated \u2018he lives upstairs\u2019 and pointed straight up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The officers went to the second floor and Twomey knocked on the door of apartment 202, but \u201cthere was no answer.\u201d He knocked again. The door was opened and the defendant was standing \u201cjust inside the threshold\u201d with the door \u201copened inward.\u201d Twomey was \u201cjust outside the threshold\u201d on the \u201clanding.\u201d At that moment, Twomey realized that the person at the door \u201cwas the man who came in the gun shop\u201d and determined that he matched the description of one of the robbers. At the same instant, Twomey noticed \u201c[d]irectly behind the defendant, in the living room, there was a bean bag chair and laying right on the bean bag chair side by side were two .30 caliber carbines.\u201d Thereupon, Twomey displayed his police badge, identified himself as a police officer, stated to the defendant that he was under arrest for armed robbery, and told Lowe to \u201cput his hands on the wall.\u201d Twomey testified he would not have arrested the defendant if he had not been the same person who came to the gun shop on December 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Because he saw two carbines on the sofa, Twomey \u201cfelt\u201d the other armed robber was in the apartment. In addition, Twomey was concerned for his own safety and that of the other officers. So after defendant was placed under arrest, the officers entered the apartment, with the sole purpose, according to Twomey, \u201cof finding the second man.\u201d While Twomey did not pull his gun, several of the other officers drew theirs. Handcuffs were then placed on Lowe and he was given, orally, the warnings required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), after which he was ordered to sit on the floor in the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Next, the officers looked into the several rooms of the apartment seeking, without success, the second robber. The police thereafter reholstered their weapons. One of the officers accompanying Twomey then recognized Lowe as a person previously observed at the home of a known drug dealer. Thereupon, Lowe was asked to give his consent to search the entire apartment. Twomey had a \u201cConsent to Search Form,\u201d the content of which was explained to Lowe. In addition, the form was read to him in its entirety.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant, after the reading, stated: \u201cYou go ahead and search, but I ain\u2019t signing nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">During the ensuing search, a quantity of narcotics, the subject of the drug convictions, was found in the apartment. Thereafter, defendant was taken to the police station and, after he signed a form providing for waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, admitted being a participant in the ABC store robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The defendant contends that the arrest without a warrant was unlawful and therefore the evidence obtained following the arrest, <em>viz., </em>the narcotics and the inculpatory statements, should have been suppressed as fruits of that illegal arrest, citing <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471 (1963), and its progeny. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>initial question then becomes: Was the arrest valid? We think it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">In attacking the arrest, defendant first argues it was made on mere \u201csuspicion\u201d and without probable cause. He dwells on Twomey\u2019s testimony to the effect that he did not seek a warrant before going to the apartment in question because he did not believe sufficient probable cause existed to obtain one, yet \u201cinexplicably,\u201d the argument continues, armed with no additional information upon arrival at the apartment, Twomey nevertheless decided when he saw defendant that he then had the necessary probable cause to make the arrest without a warrant. We disagree with this contention that sufficient probable cause was lacking at the time of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The face-to-face confrontation at the apartment threshold established for the first time one fact in Twomey\u2019s mind and it enabled him to reasonably believe other facts, all of which pointed to a conclusion that the person standing at the doorway was one of the robbers. Established was the fact that the person before him was his gun-shop customer. To be reasonably concluded by Twomey from the confrontation was that he was facing an individual who matched the eyewitness description of one of the robbers. This customer-robber link was buttressed by the fact that the customer bought .32 caliber bullets for a gun which initially appeared to Twomey to be a .45 caliber pistol, while a .32 caliber shell was found at the scene of the crime, apparently fired from the robber\u2019s gun which, to an eyewitness, looked like a .45 caliber pistol. In addition, the customer purchased ammunition for a carbine and one of the robbers carried such a weapon. And the robber-apartment occupier link was made stronger by the fact that the \u201cgetaway\u201d vehicle was found near the apartment. We conclude, therefore, that the officer here, armed with all of the foregoing information, had probable cause at the doorway to arrest defendant without a warrant, that is, such facts and circumstances had developed at that time to justify a person of reasonable prudence and caution in believing that the offense had been committed and that the person to be arrested was the offender. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 431 n.4 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring); Code \u00a7 19.2-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Continuing to assail the arrest, defendant argues, second, that it took place in defendant\u2019s \u201chome.\u201d He says that even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>probable cause existed, the' Fourth Amendment requires a warrant prior to intrusion into the residence of a suspect for the purpose of effecting an arrest, absent exigent circumstances. And, according to defendant, such necessitous circumstances were not present at the time of this arrest. To the contrary, we believe an exigency existed justifying the warrantless arrest upon probable cause and we consequently reject defendant\u2019s argument.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">In <em>Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294 (1967), the Supreme Court \u201crecognized the right of police, who had probable cause to believe that an armed robber had entered a house a few minutes before, to make a warrantless entry to arrest the robber and to search for weapons.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>427 U.S. 38, 42 (1976). Here, the officer had just ascertained the whereabouts of the armed robber in this case, who was in close proximity to two deadly weapons in plain view. The other robber may have been in the same apartment. The delay, however slight, incident to obtaining a warrant would likely have resulted in the escape of at least one armed perpetrator of a crime of violence, thereby increasing the danger of further violence to the police themselves and to the community at large. Swift apprehension was required under these circumstances. \u201cThe Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to delay in the course of an investigation if to do so would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others.\u201d <em>Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden, supra, </em>387 U.S. at 298-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the circumstances of defendant\u2019s arrest had no effect on the admissibility of either the narcotics or the inculpatory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">As an alternative ground for suppression of the drugs, defendant argues that the consent to search was involuntary because it was given under duress. Defendant points out that he was in custody, handcuffed, sitting on the floor and surrounded by his armed captors; additionally, he says his refusal to sign the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>waiver form also demonstrated his reluctance to agree to the search. He thus contends the consent was invalid because it was coerced. There is no merit to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The fact of custody alone is not enough in itself to demonstrate a coerced consent to search. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>423 U.S. at 424. But the burden is on the Commonwealth to prove the voluntariness of any consent. <em>Hairston </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 387, 388, 219 S.E.2d 668, 669 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 937 (1976). And whether the consent was actually freely given is a question of fact to be determined from \u201cthe totality of all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 227 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">We think the evidence is sufficient in this case to support the trial court\u2019s ruling that the Commonwealth carried its required burden of proof. The testimony of the officers showed, and the defendant admitted during the suppression hearing, that the Consent to Search Form, note 3 <em>supra, </em>was read to him; the officers stated that it was also explained to defendant. He was thus possessed of the knowledge that he had the right to withhold consent, yet the evidence is that defendant stated: \u201cYou go ahead and search.. . .\u201d Moreover, there was positive testimony from the officers that their guns were not drawn at the time and that no threats or promises were made to defendant. As a matter of fact, when defendant learned before the consent that the officers suspected he was a drug user, defendant offered to obtain for the police his drug paraphernalia from the apartment bathroom. In sum, the record conclusively shows the Commonwealth met the test of voluntariness, approved in <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 229, in that the consent was \u201cthe product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker\u201d and that defendant\u2019s will had not \u201cbeen overborne and his capacity for self-determination [had not been] critically impaired\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Finally, defendant contends he was denied pre-trial access to exculpatory information concerning the robbery because the trial court refused his request, contained in a motion for a bill of particulars, that the Commonwealth be ordered to file \u201c[t]he names and addresses of all persons who were present at the time the alleged offense was committed.\u201d Defendant argues (in the face of his admission that he was a participant in the robbery) that identification of defendant was an \u201cimportant factor\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>case. He says that the evidence shows there were at least six eyewitnesses to the robbery, yet only two testified and they identified defendant as one of the robbers. Defendant contends that: <em>\u201cIf </em>[the witnesses not called] <em>would </em>testify that the defendant was not one of the robbers, their testimony <em>irould be exculpatory </em>and should have been made available to the defendant\u201d (emphasis added). The obvious speculation inherent in the foregoing contention is fatal to the validity of the position defendant takes. In the first place, there is no showing that the police and prosecutor knew the names and addresses of all the witnesses to the robbery. Secondly and more importantly, the record fails to reveal that the testimony of any of the uncalled witnesses, whether or not their whereabouts were known, would exculpate the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">There is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case and the case of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83 (1963), relied on by the defendant, did not establish one. <em>Weatherford </em>v. <em>Bursey, </em>429 U.S. 545, 559 (1977). Our rule providing for discovery in a criminal case, Rule 3A:14, contains no provision requiring the Commonwealth to furnish the names and addresses of the eyewitnesses to a crime. We said, however, in <em>Stover </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 789, 795, 180 S.E.2d 504, 509 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>412 U.S. 953 (1973), quoting <em>Brady, </em>that \u201c[i]t is now settled that \u2018the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to the accused upon request violates due process when the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u2019 \u201d At the core of this due process rule of fairness is that the evidence must be exculpatory, favorable to the accused. Here, defendant\u2019s argument urges us to assume that critical basic fact, without support from the record. There is not the slightest indication the Commonwealth withheld information favorable to defendant. Actually, the trial court, upon defendant\u2019s motion, ordered the prosecutor to furnish exculpatory information \u201cof whatever form, source or nature\u201d, and there is no direct claim that this order was not complied with. Defendant merely contends that \u201cif\u201d the uncalled witnesses \u201cwould\u201d testify that defendant was not one of the robbers, their testimony \u201cwould be exculpatory.\u201d Such conjecture is insufficient to bring the motion here under the rule of <em>Brady </em>and <em>Stover.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Defendant also relies on <em>United States ex rel. Meers </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>326 F.2d 135 (2d Cir. 1964). That decision is inapposite. There, the court held the prosecutor had improperly failed to make known to the defense the existence of two disinterested witnesses to a robbery. But in that case, identity of the witnesses and the exculpatory nature of their testimony was known to the prosecution at the time of the trial, a circumstance not present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of convictions here will be</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-7\"> In addition to the foregoing questions, and in spite of our restriction of the issues, defendant continues to debate on brief and at the bar an issue eliminated from the appeal at the petition stage, <em>i.e., </em>whether a photograph taken of the defendant and used for identification purposes was the fruit of an illegal arrest. We will take no further notice of that contention. <em>See Reid </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>216 Va. 630, 632, 221 S.E.2d 166, 168 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b837-9\"> \u201c. . . male Negro, twenty-three, five foot eight, two hundred and fifteen pounds.
