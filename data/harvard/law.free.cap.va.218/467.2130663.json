Malibu\u2019s appeal presents questions of the applicability and the constitutionality of the Closing Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">The record shows that Malibu is a retailer of automotive parts and supplies, with a store in the City of Virginia Beach. On Sunday, July 4, 1976, a city police officer, Howard T. Carr, attired in civilian clothing, entered Malibu\u2019s store and ordered a quart of motor oil. He told a clerk he wanted the oil for use in his lawnmower. At the clerk\u2019s request, Carr signed a statement indicating the oil was \u201cneeded for emergency repairs o[r] emergency service of a vehicle.\u201d After receiving and paying for the oil, Carr identified himself as a police officer. Subsequently, Malibu was indicted for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-341 in making the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-15\">As pertinent to this appeal, Code \u00a7 18.2-341 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-16\">\u201c(a) On the first day of the week, commonly known and designated as Sunday, no person shall engage in work, labor or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>business or employ others to engage in work, labor or business except in the following industries and businesses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\">\n<em>a</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">\u201c(4) Servicing, fueling and emergency repair of motor vehicles ... <em>including the selling of such parts and supplies for such emergency repairs </em>\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The italicized language was added to the statute by an amendment enacted at the 1976 session of the General Assembly. Acts 1976, c. 569. The sale in the present case occurred subsequent to the effective date of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Malibu contends first that, by the 1976 amendment, the General Assembly \u201ccarved out\u201d a new exemption for \u201ccertain businesses,\u201d <em>viz., </em>those engaged in selling parts and supplies for the emergency repair of motor vehicles. Malibu then argues that, because 80% of the items it stocks, including motor oil, \u201ccould fall into the category which could be considered for an emergency purpose,\u201d it \u201cfalls within the category of businesses\u201d covered by the new exemption. It \u201cshould be allowed,\u201d therefore, Malibu concludes, to \u201cstay open [on Sunday] in order to sell those [emergency repair] items.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Furthermore, Malibu maintains, because its principal business is the sale of emergency repair items and this business is exempted from Sunday closing, under the rationale of <em>Bonnie BeLo Enterprises </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 84, 225 S.E.2d 395 (1976), it should be permitted to sell on Sunday not only emergency repair items but also \u201cother items which are sold in the ordinary and normal course\u201d of its business. Here, although it is not clearly expressed, apparently it is Malibu\u2019s contention that, if motor oil is not considered an emergency repair item, the Sunday sale of oil in the present case still was permissible because the sale was incidental to Malibu\u2019s claimed principal business of selling emergency repair items.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">We disagree with Malibu upon the effect of the 1976 amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-341(a)(4). We do not believe the amendment \u201ccarved out\u201d a new class of businesses that would be permitted to remain open on Sunday. Instead, we believe, as the trial court held, that the amendment affects only businesses engaged in the servicing, fueling, and emergency repair of motor vehicles. Those businesses, which were already permitted to operate on Sunday, may now sell on Sunday the parts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>supplies necessary to perform emergency repairs on motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Malibu is not engaged in servicing, fueling, or repairing motor vehicles. Rather, it is a mere seller of automotive parts and supplies. As such, even if 80% of its stock consists of emergency repair items, it is not covered by the exemption contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-341(a)(4), either in the section\u2019s original form or its amended version.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">For this reason, Malibu\u2019s reliance upon our decision in <em>Bonnie BeLo </em>is misplaced. In that case, we held that, if a merchant\u2019s principal business is permitted as an exception to the Sunday Closing Law, he may, incidental to the operation of that business on Sunday, sell such other items as are sold in the ordinary and normal course of his business.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Even if we assume that Malibu\u2019s principal business is the sale of emergency repair items and that motor oil is ordinarily sold in the course of that business, Malibu\u2019s Sunday sale of oil in the present case still would not have been permissible. Malibu\u2019s principal business is not permitted as an exception to the Sunday Closing Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Malibu contends next that the Sunday Closing Law is unconstitutionally discriminatory. Malibu argues first that the statute discriminates because other businesses in the City of Virginia Beach are permitted to sell motor oil on Sunday, while auto parts stores, including Malibu, are forbidden to sell the same product. Here, Malibu points to testimony it presented in the court below which showed that, on a Sunday subsequent to the date of Malibu\u2019s offense, sales of motor oil were made in a drugstore, a supermarket, and a service station, all located in Virginia Beach.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">This precise objection was raised to the Maryland Sunday Closing Law in <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420 (1961). The objection was rejected. 366 U.S. at 427-28. A similar complaint of discrimination was leveled against the Massachusetts Sunday Closing Law in <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Crown Kosher Market, </em>366 U.S. 617 (1961). This complaint was rejected. 366 U.S. at 622-24. And this court, in <em>Mandell </em>v. <em>Haddon, 202 </em>Va. 979, 121 S.E.2d 516 (1961), held \u201cwithout merit\u201d a contention that Virginia\u2019s Sunday Closing Law denied the retail merchants there involved \u201cequal protection of the laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>At the time <em>Mandell </em>was decided, the exceptions to Virginia\u2019s Sunday Closing Law were stated in terms of commodities. The exemptions in the present statute, however, are expressed in terms of industries and businesses. Even so, considering that all auto parts businesses similar to Malibu are required to close on Sunday, what was said in <em>Mandell </em>is applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\">\u201c[The statute applies] to all who are similarly situated or engaged in the same kind of business, without discrimination. The equal protection clause goes no further than prohibiting <em>invidious </em>discrimination, and the [statute does] not fall within that category ....\u201d 202 Va. at 992, 121 S.E.2d at 526-27.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Malibu argues also that it is subjected to unlawful discrimination in the enforcement of the Sunday Closing Law because, as it showed in the court below, auto parts stores are permitted to remain open on Sunday in the nearby Tidewater cities of Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, and Norfolk. The ready answer to this argument is two-fold: first, \u201cthe Equal Protection Clause relates to equality between persons as such, rather than between areas and ... territorial uniformity is not a constitutional prerequisite.\u201d <em>McGowan </em>v. Maryland, 366 U.S. at 427; second, Malibu will not be heard to complain that the authorities in other jurisdictions may have failed to enforce a law which Virginia Beach officials have enforced against Malibu.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Malibu\u2019s next contention is that the Sunday Closing Law is unconstitutional and void \u201cin its entirety\u201d because it is vague and indefinite. Malibu argues that the term \u201cemergency,\u201d as used in the exemption contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-341(a)(4), \u201cis not sufficiently definite to enable an individual of ordinary intelligence in any case to determine with a fair degree of accuracy what, is permitted and what is prohibited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>Maryland, supra, </em>the Supreme Court upheld<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the Maryland Sunday Closing Law against a claim that certain of its terms were \u201cunconstitutionally vague.\u201d We adopt, as dispositive of Malibu\u2019s present contention, what the Supreme Court said in <em>McGowan:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">\u201cWe believe that business people of ordinary intelligence . .. would be able to know what exceptions are encompassed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>the statute ... as a matter of ordinary commercial knowledge:... [T]here is no necessity to guess at the statute\u2019s meaning in order to determine what conduct it makes criminal... .\u201d 366 U.S. at 428.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Finally, Malibu contends that \u201cthe entire\u201d Sunday Closing Law is unconstitutional because of its local option feature. This feature permits a county or city, by ordinance and public referendum, to provide that the Closing Law \u201cshall have no force or effect\u201d within such locality. Code \u00a7 18.2-342.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The record fails to disclose, however, that Malibu raised in the trial court any claim that the Sunday Closing Law is unconstitutional because of the local option feature. Accordingly, we will not notice the claim here. Rule 5:21, Rules of Court; <em>Manley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 146, 149, 176 S.E.2d 309, 312 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">For the reasons assigned, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Inscrutably, Malibu says In its brief that the Court \u201cstruck down\u201d the Maryland statute because of vagueness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
