Grether (defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">A demurrer confesses the truth of the facts alleged and accepts all reasonable inferences therefrom. Plaintiff, a blind person, accompanied by her four year old son and her guide dog, arrived at defendant\u2019s \u201cmedical office\u201d on the morning of October 18, 1975, a Saturday, to keep an appointment \u201cfor treatment of a vaginal infection\u201d. She was told that defendant would not treat her unless the dog was removed from the waiting room. She insisted that the dog remain because she \u201cwas not informed of any steps which would be taken to assure the safety of the guide dog, its care, or availability to her after treatment.\u201d Defendant \u201cevicted\u201d plaintiff, her son, and her dog, refused to treat her condition, and failed to assist her in finding other medical attention. By reason of defendant\u2019s \u201cwrongful conduct\u201d, plaintiff was \u201chumiliated\u201d in the presence of other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>patients and her young son, and \u201cfor another two days while she sought medical assistance from other sources\u201d, her infection became \u201caggravated\u201d and she endured \u201cgreat pain and suffering\u201d. Alleging that defendant\u2019s waiting room \u201cis a public place and a place to which the general public is invited and where she had a right to have her guide dog with her pursuant to Virginia Code \u00a7 63.1-171.2<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201d, plaintiff demanded damages resulting from \u201cbreach of his duty to treat\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The order sustaining the demurrer was based upon two grounds. Ruling as matters of law, the trial court held that \u201cthe defendant had no duty to treat the plaintiff since he had not accepted her as a patient\u201d and that \u201cdefendant\u2019s waiting room is not a public facility or place contemplated by\u201d the White Cane Act. We address the first ruling in our determination whether the motion for judgment was sufficient to allege the creation of a physician-patient relationship and a duty to treat. If we determine that it was, then the trial court\u2019s second ruling bears upon the question whether defendant\u2019s withdrawal from the relationship for the reasons and under the circumstances alleged in plaintiff\u2019s motion excused non-performance of the duty to treat.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Although there is some conflict of authority, the courts are in substantial accord upon the rules concerning the creation of a physician-patient relationship and the rights and obligations arising therefrom. In the absence of a statute, a physician has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>legal obligation to accept as a patient everyone who seeks his services. <em>Findlay </em>v. <em>Board of Sup\u2019rs. of County of Mohave, </em>72 Ariz. 58, 230 P.2d 526 (1951); <em>Childers </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>201 N.C. 42, 158 S.E. 744 (1931); <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Eddingfield, </em>156 Ind. 416, 59 N.E. 1058 (1901). A physician\u2019s duty arises only upon the creation of a physician-patient relationship; that relationship springs from a consensual transaction, a contract, express or implied, general or special, <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Emmons, </em>36 Cal.App.2d 199, 204-05, 97 P.2d 503, 507 (1939); and a patient is entitled to damages resulting from a breach of a physician\u2019s duty. <em>See </em>61 Am. Jur.2d Physicians, Surgeons, Etc. \u00a7 96 (1972); 70 C.J.S. Physicians and Surgeons \u00a7\u00a7 37, 38 (1951). Whether a physician-patient relationship is created is a question of fact, turning upon a determination whether the patient entrusted his treatment to the physician and the physician accepted the case. <em>Parkell </em>v. <em>Fitzporter, </em>301 Mo. 217, 256 S.W. 239 (1923); <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Pock, </em>57 Mont. 51, 187 P. 282 (1920); <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>123 Minn. 319, 143 N.W. 793 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">We consider first whether the facts stated in the motion for judgment, and the reasonable inferences deducible therefrom, were sufficient to allege the creation of a physician-patient relationship and a duty to treat. Standing alone, plaintiff\u2019s allegation that she \u201chad an appointment with defendant\u201d would be insufficient, for it connotes nothing more than that defendant had agreed to see her. But plaintiff alleged further that the appointment she had been given was \u201cfor treatment of a' vaginal infection\u201d. The unmistakable implication is that plaintiff had sought and defendant had granted an appointment at a designated time and place for the performance of a specific medical service, one within defendant\u2019s professional competence, <em>viz., treatment </em>of a particular ailment. It is immaterial that this factual allegation might have been contradicted by evidence at trial. Upon demurrer, the test of the sufficiency of a motion for judgment is whether it states the essential elements of a cause of action, not whether evidence might be adduced to defeat it. <em>See Grubbs </em>v. <em>National Life, &amp; Co., </em>94 Va. 589, 591, 27 S.E. 464, 465 (1897).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">We are of opinion that the motion for judgment was sufficient to allege a consensual transaction giving rise to a physician-patient relationship and a duty to perform the service contemplated, and that the trial court erred in holding as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>matter of law that defendant had not accepted plaintiff as a patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">We consider next how a physician-patient relationship, once created, may be lawfully terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">As a general rule, unless the services to be rendered are conditioned or limited by notice or by the terms of employment, the physician-patient relationship continues until the services are no longer needed, <em>Vann </em>v. <em>Harden, </em>187 Va. 555, 565, 47 S.E.2d 314, 319 (1948); however, the relationship may be terminated earlier by mutual consent or by the unilateral action of the patient; and under certain circumstances, the physician has a right to withdraw from a case, provided the patient is afforded a reasonable opportunity to acquire the services he needs from another physician. <em>See </em>Annot,, 57 A.L.R. 2d 432, 439, \u00a7 3(1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Under plaintiffs construction of the White Cane Act, defendant\u2019s withdrawal from her case was not justified by the circumstances. She argues that defendant\u2019s office was a place \u201cto which the public is invited\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 63.1-171.2(b) and that defendant\u2019s withdrawal violated the right to which she was entitled under Code \u00a7 63.1-171.2(c). Under the trial court\u2019s construction, defendant\u2019s office was not covered by the Act and plaintiff had no statutory right to take her dog there.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">We are persuaded by plaintiff\u2019s argument as applied to the facts alleged in this case. It fairly appears from the face of the motion for judgment that defendant\u2019s office was a place to which certain members of the public were invited by prior appointment to receive certain treatment at certain scheduled hours. Plaintiff did not allege that defendant\u2019s office was a place to which the general public was generally invited to receive general medical services. Accordingly, while we hold that, under the facts alleged here, defendant\u2019s office was within the intendment of the White Cane Act and that the trial court erred in ruling otherwise, we believe it would be beyond the issues drawn for us to hold as a matter of law that the Act as presently written covers all physicians\u2019 offices under all circumstances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Even if the trial court had been correct in holding that plaintiff had no statutory right to take her guide dog to defendant\u2019s office, the question yet would have remained whether plaintiff\u2019s refusal to part with her dog without the assurances she sought constituted a circumstance justifying defendant\u2019s withdrawal from her case. Also remaining would have been the other question related to defendant\u2019s right to withdraw, <em>viz., </em>whether, as plaintiff expressly alleged, she was denied a reasonable opportunity to acquire the services she needed from another physician. Both questions were questions of fact which, even in the absence of the White Cane Act, were the subjects of proof, and we hold that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case will be remanded with instructions to restore plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment to the docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-7\"> This statute, part of the \u201cWhite Cane Act\u201d (Acts 1972, c. 156), reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-8\">\"S 63.1-171.2.
