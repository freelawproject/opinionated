Parham (hereinafter, Parham), a Richmond public schoolteacher, a writ of mandamus against the School Board of the City of Richmond (hereinafter, the School Board). The order compelled the School Board to submit to arbitration a grievance Parham had brought pursuant to the \u201cProcedure for Adjusting Grievances,\u201d adopted by the State Board of Education (hereinafter, the State Board). The same order awarded the State Board, an intervenor in the proceeding, a declaratory judgment upholding the constitutionality of a provision of the Procedure which requires binding arbitration of certain disputes between local school boards and their non-supervisory employees. The sole question for decision is whether the provision for binding arbitration is constitutionally valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>Adopted in 1973 and subsequently amended, the Procedure prescribes the method for settling employee grievances. A grievance is defined as a difference or dispute concerning \u201cthe application of the provisions of the [local school board\u2019s] Policies, Rules and Regulations as they affect the work activity of [non-supervisory employees].\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a step-by-step process provided by the Procedure, an employee may submit a dispute successively to the immediate supervisor, the school principal, the division superintendent, and the local school board. Failing resolution of the dispute at these levels, the employee may appeal the matter to an arbitration panel which, after a <em>de novo </em>hearing, renders a decision in the case. An arbitration panel consists of one member chosen by the employee and one selected by the school board. If these two cannot resolve the dispute, they choose a third panelist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">According to the terms of the Procedure, an arbitration panel\u2019s jurisdiction is \u201cconfined exclusively to the application of the provision or provisions of the [local school board\u2019s] Policies, Rules and Regulations at issue between the employee and the [local school board];\u201d the panel has \u201cno authority to add to, detract from or amend any such provision or provisions.\u201d And, in a section entitled \u201cBoard\u2019s Prerogatives,\u201d it is stated that nothing in the Procedure is intended to \u201ccircumscribe or modify\u201d the right of the local school board to exercise eight listed functions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The same section provides further, however, that should \u201ca disagreement arise over whether a grievance concerns one or more of the [local school board\u2019s] prerogatives ... the question of the arbitrability of such grievance shall itself be a matter within the jurisdiction of the Panel described in ... this Procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>Lastly, the Procedure contains this pertinent provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-5\">\u201cThe award of the Panel on the merits of any grievance adjudicated within its jurisdiction and authority as specified herein shall be final and binding on the aggrieved employee and the [local school board] and the [local school board] hereby delegates such authority to the Panel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">In the present case, Parham unsuccessfully processed her grievance through the several administrative levels prescribed by the Procedure and ultimately presented the dispute to the School Board, where she received an adverse decision. When she called for arbitration, the School Board refused to arbitrate, stating that it questioned the constitutionality of the Procedure \u201cinsofar as it compels arbitration binding on school boards in Virginia.\u201d Parham then filed her petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the School Board to submit the matter to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">At the heart of the present controversy are the provisions of Article VIII of the Virginia Constitution, which article relates to education. In pertinent part, the article reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-8\">\u201c\u00a7 2. <em>Standards of quality; State and local support of public schools. </em>\u2014 Standards of quality for the several school divisions shall be determined and prescribed from time to time by the Board of Education, subject to revision only by the General Assembly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-9\">\n<em>u</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-10\">\u201c\u00a7 4. <em>Board of Education. </em>\u2014 The general supervision of the public school system shall be vested in a Board of Education....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-11\">\u201c\u00a7 5. <em>Powers and duties of the Board of Eduation. </em>\u2014 The powers and duties of the Board of Education shall be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-12\">\u201c(e) Subject to the ultimate authority of the General Assembly, the Board shall have primary responsibility and authority for effectuating the educational policy set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>this Article, and it shall have such other powers and duties as may be prescribed by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1118-5\">\n<em>a</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1118-6\">\u201c\u00a7 7. <em>School hoards. </em>\u2014 The supervision of schools in each school division shall be vested in a school board . ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">The School Board recognizes that \u00a7 4 of Article VIII places \u201cgeneral supervision\" of the public school system in the hands of the State Board. The School Board notes, however, that, under \u00a7 7 of Article VIII, the \u201csupervision\u201d of schools is vested in local school boards and that, implementing this constitutional mandate, the General Assembly has conferred upon such local boards extensive authority to execute their supervisory duties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The School Board acknowledges that, within the general supervision/supervision format of \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 7 of Article VIII, the General Assembly may \u201capportion various supervisory powers over the school system and schools, respectively, between the State Board and local school boards.\u201d And the School Board concedes that it must observe not only the standards of quality prescribed by the State Board, as revised by the General Assembly, but also the lawful regulations of the State Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">The School Board argues, however, that \u201cmanagement of a school board\u2019s teaching staff and other employees is ... an essential function of supervision\u201d and that neither the General Assembly nor the State Board can divest local school boards of this function and place it \u201cin an authority other than the local boards.\u201d Yet, the School Board asserts, the effect of the binding arbitration provision of the Procedure is to permit \u201can outside agency, in the form of an arbitration panel... to divest the local board of its essential function by the substitution of [the panel\u2019s] judgment for that of the board.\u201d As a result of the panel\u2019s action, the School Board maintains, a local school board\u2019s policies, rules, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>and regulations relating to the work activity of employees could be altered or rendered meaningless. This, the School Board concludes, is constitutionally impermissible under \u00a7 7 of Article VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">On the other hand, Parham and the State Board contend that the constitutionality of the Procedure should be upheld as a standard of quality enunciated pursuant to \u00a7 2 of Article VIII. These parties contend also that the Procedure is constitutionally valid as a rule or regulation adopted pursuant to the general supervisory power of the State Board vested by \u00a7 4 and the ultimate authority of the State Board to effectuate the educational policy of the state granted by \u00a7 5(e). Furthermore, it is asserted, the General Assembly not only has conferred upon the State Board full authority to adopt the Procedure either as a rule or regulation or as a standard of quality <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but also has itself \u201cenacted\u201d or \u201cratified\u201d the Procedure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a result of this legislative action, it is maintained, the Procedure is entitled to a presumption of constitutional validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>The Procedure, Parham and the State Board argue, does not divest a local school board of any of its powers of supervision; the Procedure preserves the local board\u2019s authority to make its own policies, rules, and regulations and to administer the mission of the schools. The Procedure, it is asserted, comes into effect only after the local board has exercised its supervisory powers, and even then the Procedure amounts to no more than a \u201cdevice\u201d with which to contest a misapplication of a policy, rule, or regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">In analyzing the arguments of Parham and the State Board, it is interesting to note that neither of these parties specifically defends the binding arbitration provision of the Procedure; the arguments merely assert the validity of the Procedure in general. The closest approach to a defense of the provision is a statement that \u201cthe arbitration panel has no authority whatsoever to make or enforce any decisions as to how the local school is to be operated.\u201d This merely evades, rather than answers, the School Board\u2019s contention that the arbitration provision permits \u201can outside agency, in the form of an arbitration panel ... to divest the local board of its essential function [of managing its teaching staff] by the substitution of [the panel\u2019s] judgment for that of the board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">This contention of the School Board presents the real question in the case, <em>viz., </em>whether the binding arbitration provision of the Procedure produces an unlawful delegation of power. In resolving this question, we will assume the correctness of the position stated by Parham and the State Board that the General Assembly, by its revision of standards of quality in 1973, 1974, and 1976 (note 5), \u201cenacted\u201d or \u201cratified\u201d the Procedure. And, based upon this assumption, we will accord the Procedure a presumption of constitutional validity. But the presumption would be unavailing against a finding that the Procedure results in an unlawful delegation of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-7\">There can be no doubt that <em>a </em>delegation of power is involved in the binding arbitration provision. Indeed, the very section of the Procedure which provides that an arbitration panel shall have authority to make a final and binding decision also states that the local school board \u201chereby delegated such authority to the Panel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-8\">Whether, however, the arbitration provision results in an <em>unlawful </em>delegation of authority is a more difficult question. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>Previously, we have encountered binding arbitration provisions concerning public school employees only as part of collective bargaining agreements entered into by a local school board and certain labor organizations. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arlington County Board, </em>217 Va. 558, 232 S.E.2d 30 (1977), we held, <em>inter alia, </em>that, because the power to enter into collective bargaining agreements was not indispensable to the discharge of the functions of a local school board, we could not imply such authority from the power of supervision vested by \u00a7 7 of Article VIII of the Constitution. Having determined, in the final analysis, that the local board possessed neither constitutional nor statutory authority to enter into the agreements, we stated specifically that we did not reach the question whether the agreements produced an unlawful delegation of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">Although not involving binding arbitration provisions, <em>Howard </em>v. <em>School Board of Alleghany County, </em>203 Va. 55, 122 S.E.2d 891 (1961), is pertinent to resolution of the present case. There, a state statute required the sale of school property if such disposition was favored by a majority of voters in a referendum. Ruling the statute invalid, we said that it was an \u201cessential function\u201d of a local school board\u2019s power of supervision, granted by what is now \u00a7 7 of Article VIII of the Constitution, \u201cto determine whether a particular property is needed for school purposes and the manner in which it shall be used.\u201d The effect of the disputed statute, we stated, was \u201cto divest the board of the exercise of that function and lodge it in the electorate,\u201d thus stripping the board \u201cof any or all authority to exercise its judgment in the matter.\u201d 203 Va. at 58, 122 S.E.2d at 894. This is but another way of saying that the statute produced an unlawful delegation of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">We believe the binding arbitration provision involved in the present case has the same effect as the offending statute in <em>Howard, viz., </em>to remove from a local school board and transfer to others a function essential and indispensable to the exercise of the power of supervision vested by \u00a7 7 of Article VIII. The function involved here concerns the application of local policies, rules, and regulations adopted for the day-to-day management of a teaching staff. Clearly, in the Article VIII general supervision/supervision allocation of powers between the State Board and local school boards, this function is vested in the local boards. It would be wholly unrealistic to say that Article VIII <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>was designed to inject the State Board directly into the daily management of a local teaching staff. Recognizing this proposition and implementing \u00a7 7 of Article VIII, the General Assembly has placed the management of local teaching staffs in local school boards. (See note 3 and Code \u00a7 22-72).</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">Equally clear, the function of <em>applying </em>local policies, rules, and regulations, adopted for the management of a teaching staff, is a function essential and indispensable to exercise of the power of supervision vested by \u00a7 7 of Article VIII.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This power of supervision would be an empty one, indeed, if a local school board, once having adopted a valid policy, rule, or regulation, found itself powerless to enforce what it had promulgated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">In the present case, no question is raised concerning the validity of the policy adopted by the School Board and disputed by Parham. No complaint is made that, in adopting the policy, the School Board exceeded its authority in any way. Nor is it claimed that the policy conflicts with law or is contrary to any standard of quality or rule or regulation adopted by the State Board.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">Yet, the binding arbitration provision of the Procedure denies the School Board the right to decide upon the ultimate application of the policy. The provision effectively divests the School Board of a function indispensable to its \u00a7 7 power of supervision and transfers to an arbitration panel the authority to make a final and binding decision upon the application of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that the binding arbitration provision of the Procedure produces an unlawful delegation of power, violative of \u00a7 7 of Article VIII of the Constitution. In reaching this conclusion, we have not been unmindful of the authority placed in the State Board by other portions of Article VIII or of the rule that all parts of the Constitution should be harmonized to effectuate the intention expressed within the four corners of the instrument. The several provisions of Article VIII would not be harmonized, however, by an interpretation which would so magnify the authority of the State Board that, as a result, the \u00a7 7 power of local supervision would be rendered meaningless. Our conclusion with respect to the binding arbitration provision of the Procedure avoids such a result in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed, Parham\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus will be dismissed, and final judgment will be entered here declaring the binding arbitration provision of the Procedure constitutionally invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1116-6\"> Hinder the terms of the Procedure, the discharge of an employee, the failure to reappoint an employee during a probationary period, and the revocation, suspension, or denial of a teaching certificate are not subject to the Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1116-7\"> The listed functions are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-8\">\u201c(a) Determine and administer the mission of the school system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-9\">\u201c(b) Hire, promote, transfer, discipline, suspend, assign and retain employees in positions within the school system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-10\">\u201c(c) Maintain the efficiency of school operations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-11\">\u201c(d) Relieve employees from duties for legitimate reasons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-12\">\u201c(e) Take action as may be necessary to carry out the duties of the school system in emergencies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-13\">\u201c(f) Determine the methods, means and personnel by which operations are to be carried on;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-14\">\u201c(g) Direct the work of [local school board] employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>\u201c(h) Issue and revise policies, rules and regulations necessary to carry out the foregoing and all other managerial functions entrusted to and conferred upon the [local school board] by law . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1118-9\"> Under Code \u00a7 22-93, a city school board shall establish and maintain a public school system \u201cin accordance with the requirements of the Constitution and the general educational policy of the Commonwealth.\u201d Under Code \u00a7 22-97, a city school board has the power and duty: to \u201cexplain, enforce, and observe the school laws, and to make rules for the government of the schools;\u201d to \u201cdetermine the studies to be pursued, the methods of teaching [and] the government to be employed in the schools;\u201d to \u201cemploy teachers on recommendation of the division superintendent and to dismiss them when delinquent, inefficient or in anywise unworthy of the position;\u201d to \u201cvisit the . . . schools . . . and to take care that they are conducted according to law, and with the .utmost efficiency;\u201d and to \u201cperform such other duties as shall be prescribed by the State Board or are imposed by other parts of this title.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1119-6\"> Under Code \u00a7 22-19, the State Board may \u201cmake rules and regulations not inconsistent with law for the management and conduct of schools\u201d and, except as provided in \u00a7 22-19.1, such rules and regulations \u201cshall have the force and effect of law.\u201d Under \u00a7 22-19.1, the State Board is directed to submit to the General Assembly periodic reports containing the standards of quality \u201cto be prescribed in the future\u201d for school divisions.
