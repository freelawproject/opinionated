The damages sought represented losses resulting from a train derailment which occurred June 1, 1973 at Lorton where Sutton was installing a \u201ccrossover\u201d connecting two main line railroad tracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Following a pre-trial conference, the trial court entered an order on May 28, 1976 ruling, <em>inter alia,- </em>that the language of the contract was ambiguous, that extrinsic evidence would be admissible to show what the parties intended the language to mean and \u201cthe scope and nature of the work to be covered thereby\u201d, and that, aside from questions concerning damages, the sole issue would be \u201c[w]hether the work being performed by Sutton on June 1, 1973 was being done under the said contract dated January 2,1973.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">At the conclusion of Railroad\u2019s testimony and after considering 22 exhibits introduced by Railroad and 20 exhibits filed during cross-examination by Sutton, the trial court overruled Sutton\u2019s motion to strike. Upon reconsideration of certain exhibits and further argument by counsel, the trial court reversed its ruling, sustained Sutton\u2019s motion, and entered a final order June 3, 1976 granting summary judgment in favor of both defendants. Judgment was based upon the trial court\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat there is just no reasonable way reasonable men can differ . . . that the railroad intended that there should have been in existence a separate and distinct contract out from under the [January 2, 1973 contract].\u201d On June 16, 1976, the trial court overruled Railroad\u2019s motion to set aside the judgment. This ruling was based upon a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>that, because Railroad had tendered Sutton a contract specifically describing the Lorton job. (the facts concerning which will be detailed later), \u201creasonable men couldn\u2019t differ, but that the railroad itself did not consider that this work was done under the [January 2,1973] contract\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The writ of error was limited to consideration of Railroad\u2019s assignment of error number three which reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred in sustaining the motion to strike . . . because . .. [t]he evidence before the trial court was sufficient to permit the jury to decide whether the work . . . was being performed pursuant to the January 2,1973 contract. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">We believe, as Sutton says, that this \u201cis the only real point before this Court\u201d. We consider, therefore, whether the testimonial and documentary evidence adduced by Railroad and the documentary evidence filed by Sutton was sufficient to raise a jury question on the issue tried below.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Railroad\u2019s principal witness was William .Gilbert who, as Engineer of Track, was responsible for both construction and maintenance of tracks. As early as 1970, Sutton, an independent contractor, had been performing contract work for Railroad. Some of the contracts were verbal, evidenced only by Sutton\u2019s post-work invoices; some were created by acceptance of Sutton\u2019s prior written proposals; and some were formalized, sometimes before and sometimes after work began, on Railroad\u2019s printed contract form MW-66. Most of the contracts were \u201ccost-plus\u201d; several were \u201cfixed-price\u201d or \u201cceiling-price\u201d. Pursuant to a general understanding that Railroad would keep the Sutton work crew occupied \u201cas long as there was work for them\u201d, Gilbert assigned the projects and had the crew moved from one job to another as circumstances required. Usually, Gilbert discussed the jobs in advance with R. H. Blevins, Sutton\u2019s vice-president, but on one or two occasions, Gilbert simply conveyed instructions through his subordinate, Mr. Proffitt, directly to Sutton\u2019s superintendent, Mr. Phillips.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">In 1972, Gilbert and the late L. B. Cann, Railroad\u2019s Chief Engineer and Gilbert\u2019s superior, held a meeting with Blevins. Concerning that meeting, Gilbert testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-10\">\u201cWhen we first began using Sutton Company, we were making individual contracts for each work they did. And it became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>burdensome. So we made a blanket contract to cover any work done during an entire year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">Gilbert drafted language to fill the blank spaces on form MW-66, and the parties executed \u201cthe first blanket contract\u201d on July 5, 1972. A \u201csecond blanket contract\u201d, identical in every material respect to the first, was executed on January 2, 1973. The pertinent parts of those contracts (with Gilbert\u2019s language italicized) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-5\">\u201cThe Contractor [Sutton] . . . shall execute ... the following work:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-6\">\n<em>\u201cMiscellaneous cork to be done as directed by the Engineer of Track during the gear 1974.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-7\">\u201cIn consideration of the completion of the work . . . the Company [Railroad] shall pay to the Contractor the complete cost of such work to the Contractor plus the following percentages: <em>157c overhead, 157c profit.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-8\">\u201cBefore doing any work under this contract the Contractor shall secure and keep in effect. . . the following items:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-9\">\u201cid) Comprehensive automobile and general liability insurance, including Contractor\u2019s protective insurance shall be carried by the Contractor. . . . This insurance shall apply to . .. damage to the property of the Company when caused by the negligence of the Contractor .. . and shall cover the contractual obligation to indemnify Company set forth below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-10\">\u201cThe Contractor shall indemnify and save harmless the Company from and against all losses . . . growing out of or in any manner directly or indirectly caused by the execution of the work or in guarding the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9R\">\u201cContractor assumes all risks of, and will repair at his sole cost prior to the completion and acceptance of the entire work by the Company, all damages to materials and work occasioned by any casualty or other cause due to the negligence of the Contractor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>The certificate of insurance issued by Sutton\u2019s insurer on December 27, 1972 described the \u201coperations\u201d covered as \u201cMiscellaneous work for Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac Railroad Company\u201d, and under the words \u201cDesignation of Contracts\u201d, listed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-5\">\u201cAGREEMENTS BETWEEN RICHMOND, FREDERICKSBURG &amp; POTOMAC RAILROAD COMPANY AND SUTTON COMPANY, INC. (CONTRACTOR)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-6\">\u201cCONSTRUCTION AGREEMENTS \u2014 INDEMNIFICATION OF RAILROADS \u2014 AGREEMENTS INDEMNIFYING RAILROADS IN CONNECTION WITH OPERATIONS INVOLVING AN EXPOSURE TO ACTUAL RAILROAD TRAIN HAZARDS\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">As defined in the certificate, \u201c \u2018contractual liability\u2019 means liability expressly assumed under a written contract or agreement\u201d. A copy of the January 2, 1973 contract was mailed to L. T. Nuckols, Jr., an independent insurance agent. In the margin of that copy, which was introduced as an exhibit, was the penciled notation: \u201cThis is blanket contract for work not to exceed $1000.00 per agreement with Mr. Cann and Mr. Gilbert.\u201d Nuckols testified that the notation was \u201con the contract when I received it\u201d but \u201cI don\u2019t know who wrote it on there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Gilbert did not personally talk with Blevins in advance of the Lorton crossover project. However, sometime in May 1973, Proffitt told Phillips that \u201cthis would probably be one of the next jobs coming up.\u201d On May 24, they \u201cwalked over the location . . . and made marks on the rails as to where the point of switch was to be\u201d. The next day, Phillips\u2019 crew unloaded the materials. Work was suspended during the holiday weekend and resumed on May 29. The derailment occurred on June 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">A letter drafted by Cann and dated June 8 was hand-delivered that day to Blevins. Attached was a contract on form MW-66 signed by Cann. The contract, back-dated to May 25, 1973, was identical to the blanket contract in all material respects, except that it described the Lorton project in specific language. There was an \u201cinternal disagreement\u201d among Railroad\u2019s officials about the need for a specific contract, and Gilbert testified that it was prepared and delivered upon advice of counsel, \u201c[j]ust for double assurance, I guess, that we were covered.\u201d Blevins took the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>contract with him but declined to sign it and marked it \u201crejected\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Sutton completed construction of the crossover and submitted its Invoice 1745 on June 28, 1973. The total billing of $16,682.08 included the cost of labor and materials, 15% for overhead, 15t\u00bf for profit, and a separate item of $271.92 for \u201ccontractual liability insurance.\u201d Railroad paid the invoice in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Gilbert testified that the parties intended that the \u201cblanket contract would be used anytime it was not superseded by another contract\u201d and that it \u201ccovered everything that was not covered by something else.\u201d As a \u201crule of thumb\u201d, a specific contract was negotiated \u201cfor a capital expenditure job\u201d or a job which \u201cwas going to [involve] a substantial amount of money\u201d, but \u201c[i]t would be at the railroad\u2019s option as to whether we wanted a separate contract for our own internal accounting purposes.\u201d The Lorton project, he said, was \u201cunder the capital expenditure account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Reviewing the- testimonial and documentary evidence, Railroad argues that all projects, whether capital expenditure or maintenance, which were commenced without prior specific contract were covered by the blanket contract; that projects for which a specific contract was executed after work was begun or completed were covered by the blanket contract until the specific contract was signed; and that all projects, including the Lorton project, were thus covered by written contracts of indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Reviewing the same evidence, Sutton contends, as it alleged in its grounds of defense, that the blanket contract was intended to cover only miscellaneous repair jobs costing less than $1000; that capital expenditure projects were customarily performed under specific contracts; and that, absent a specific contract for the Lorton project, Sutton was not obligated to indemnify Railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">The numerous exhibits introduced by both parties were designed to show a \u201ccourse of dealing\u201d supporting their respective positions. Some were explicated by testimony; many were not. As construed by Railroad, the exhibits reflect examples of small repair jobs performed under specific contracts, large repair jobs performed without specific contracts, capital expenditure projects performed under specific contracts, and capital expenditure projects performed under the blanket contract. As Sutton construes the exhibits, they reflect numerous examples of small repair jobs performed under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>blanket contract and several examples of \u201cjobs calling for construction of turnouts, crossovers and switches [which] were almost without exception the subject of specific contracts\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Relying upon <em>Railroad </em>v. <em>Hughes-Keegan, Inc., </em>207 Va. 765, 152 S.E.2d 28 (1967), Railroad says that the content of Sutton\u2019s Invoice 1745 raises an inference that Sutton itself considered the Lorton project covered by the blanket contract. The billings for cost, overhead, and profit were in accord with the terms of the blanket contract; the insurance premium was billed pursuant to indemnity insurance required by the blanket contract; and the \u201corder number\u201d on the invoice was labeled \u201cverbal\u201d in the same manner as the order numbers on invoices introduced by Sutton as samples of jobs performed under the blanket contract. Distinguishing <em>Hughea-Keegan </em>on its facts, Sutton draws a different inference. Pointing to the paragraph in the blanket contract which requires Sutton, prior to Railroad\u2019s acceptance of its work, to repair and bear the cost of damages resulting from Sutton\u2019s negligence, Sutton says that Railroad\u2019s acceptance of and payment for the work without invoking this paragraph raises an inference that Railroad did not consider the Lorton project covered by the blanket contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The same inference arises, Sutton contends, from Railroad\u2019s efforts to persuade Blevins to sign the back-dated contract. Railroad argues that such an inference is defeated by the course of dealing disclosed by the evidence. Citing Gilbert\u2019s testimony and certain exhibits relating to projects performed under specific contracts executed after work was begun or fully completed, Railroad says that execution of back-dated contracts was a matter of common practice, initiated at Railroad\u2019s option to facilitate internal accounting procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">The issue tried in the lower court was what work the parties intended the blanket contract to cover. Under the law of the case, the language of that contract is ambiguous and extrinsic evidence is competent to resolve the ambiguity. See footnote 1. What the parties intended, therefore, is a question of fact to be determined from the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract and from the course of dealing under it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>At the time Sutton moved to strike the evidence, the evidence was in conflict. Gilbert\u2019s testimony concerning the circumstances and intent of the contracting parties squarely contradicted the import of the penciled notation someone made upon the copy of the blanket contract mailed to Sutton\u2019s insurer; and while some of the evidence tended to support one version of the course of dealing and the inferences to be drawn therefrom, other evidence tended to support the opposite version and contrary inferences.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-5\">\u201c[I]n ruling on a motion to strike plaintiff\u2019s evidence all inferences which may be fairly drawn from the evidence must be considered most favorably to the plaintiff, and where-there are several inferences which may be drawn, though they may differ in degree of probability, the court must adopt those most favorable to the party whose evidence it is sought to have struck out, unless the inferences be strained, forced or contrarv to reason.
