The causes were consolidated, and the trial court held that in each instance the \u201cseparate family living units\u201d constitute \u201cresidential units\u201d, and that the tax on gas and electric service should be levied in accordance with \u00a7 35-122 of the Portsmouth City Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">The authority of a city to impose a consumer\u2019s tax on gas and electric service is not questioned. Specifically in issue here, in addition to \u00a7 35-113 which defines \u201cresidential use\u201d, are \u00a7\u00a7 35-114 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 35-122.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 35-114 imposes a 20% tax upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>each purchaser of any utility service on the first $1,000 of the charge made for the service during any monthly period. A maximum tax of $200 per month is intended. However, the section incorporates by reference \u00a7 35-122, and the taxes imposed are levied \u201csubject to the limitation set forth in section 35-122\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Section 35-122, titled \u201cExclusions\u201d, provides for a limitation of the $200 maximum tax imposed under \u00a7 35-114 by limiting the levy for residential users to 20% of the first $9 paid by the consumer to the utility server for gas, or a maximum monthly tax of $1.80, and 20% of the first $17 paid each month by the consumer to the utility server for electricity, or a maximum monthly tax of $3.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 35-122 further state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">\u201c. . . provided, however, that where more than one single-family residential unit is served by one meter, in computing the maximum amount of such charge subject to tax, such sum of ... [$9.00 for gas and $17.00 for electricity] . .. shall be multiplied by the number of single-family residential units served by each meter;. ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">Edgefield and Churchland contend that their apartment buildings, each serviced by a master meter, occupy exactly the same position as shopping centers, office buildings and factories and are subject to the tax imposed and levied by \u00a7 35-114, and with a maximum tax of $200 per month for each type of utility service. They point to the language of \u00a7 35-113 which defines \u201cresidential use\u201d as meaning \u201c. . . any utility service used by the owner or the tenant of private residential property or the tenant of an apartment who is billed for and pays directly the charge for such utility service in or for such property\u201d. Admittedly, tenants renting from Edgefield and Churchland are neither billed nor pay directly for either gas or electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">The City of Portsmouth argues that it has reasonably classified purchasers of gas and electricity in three categories: (1) Owners of apartment complexes consisting of a number of single-family residential units served by one meter ($1.80 for gas, $3.40 for electricity, a month, respectively, multiplied by the number of units); (2) Owners and tenants of private residential property and tenants of apartments served by separate meters (20% of the charge for gas and electricity but not exceeding $1.80 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>and $3.40 a month, respectively); (3) All other purchasers of any utility service (20% on the first $1,000 charged, or a maximum of $200 a month).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">The City says it can be assumed that in determining the rental for their residential apartments the appellants consider the cost of the utilities furnished its tenants, and that indirectly the tenants are paying for these utilities by their rental payments. It points out that absent the provisions of \u00a7 35-122(a) and (b), the $200 per month tax on gas and electricity prorated among Edgefield\u2019s tenants would amount to only $1.30 per month for each utility service, while consumers in apartments served by individual meters would pay not exceeding $1.80 utility tax for gas and not exceeding $3.40 utility tax for electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">While we agree that it may have been the intent of the council of the City of Portsmouth, when it enacted the City\u2019s Utility Services Tax, to classify utility users in the three categories outlined, the ordinances enacted by the council failed \u2022 to accomplish that object.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Section 35-114 imposes the utility tax upon <em>each purchaser </em>of any utility service, not upon each user. Section 35-113 provides that the word purchaser \u201cshall be taken to include every person who purchases a utility service\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Section 35-122, however, limits the levy made under \u00a7 35-114 to those who are purchasers of utility service for \u201cresidential use\u201d. We must therefore turn again to \u00a7 35-113 for the City\u2019s definition of residential use.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">That portion of the ordinance defining residential use, \u00a7 35-113, is clear and unambiguous. It establishes two categories of residential use of utility service. One is by \u201cthe owner or the. tenant of private residential property\u201d. The other is by \u201cthe tenant of an apartment who is billed for and pays directly the charge for utility service\u201d. Edgefield and Churchland fit neither category and neither do the tenants to whom appellants rent apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Appellants are therefore not subject to the limitations for residential users provided for in \u00a7 35-122 and, as to them, the tax on gas and electric service should be levied by the City of Portsmouth in accordance with the provisions of its Code \u00a7 35-114.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the lower court is reversed and the causes are remanded for such further proceedings as may be indicated consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\"> All code section references in this opinion are to the Portsmouth City Code, Article VII, Utility Services Tax.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-9\"> \u201cSec. 35-114.
