Under \u00a7 65.1-56, an employee is entitled to compensation for fixed periods for the total or partial loss or loss of use of specified members of his body. Under \u00a7 65.1-64, when an employee receives or is \u201centitled to compensation\u201d for an injury covered by \u00a7 65.1-56 and he dies from unrelated causes, \u201cthe unpaid balance of compensation\u201d is payable to his statutory distributees dependent upon him for support. The present case invokes the survival provisions of \u00a7 65.1-64, and the issue is whether, at the time of his death from an unrelated cause, the employee was \u201centitled to compensation\u201d for an injury covered by \u00a7 65.1-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>On January 14,1973, the employee, William L. Hart, sustained a gunshot wound to his right arm in the course of his duties as a deputy sheriff of Spotsylvania County. Pursuant to an agreement with the County and the latter\u2019s insurance carrier, Hart received compensation for temporary total incapacity until January 6, 1974, when the compensation payments ceased upon his return to work at his pre-injury wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">According to his physician, Dr. Marriott C. Johnson, Hart \u201cmade a remarkable recovery\u201d and \u201cregained amazing function in his right arm.\u201d He experienced, however, \u201csome stiffness in his fingers\u201d and \u201cin the wrist.\u201d Doctor Johnson discussed with Hart \u201cthe possibility of another evaluation\u201d by Dr. Frank McCue, a hand surgeon, \u201cin regards to optimal improvement of [Hart\u2019s] hand.\u201d Hart was \u201chesitant about any further surgery because he [did not] want to lose what he [had] regained.\u201d Later, however, with the \u201cupgrading\u201d of the sheriff\u2019s department where Hart was employed, he became \u201cvery interested in what [could] be done to further improve the hand function.\u201d Doctor Johnson advised Hart that \u201csurgery on the forearm . . . would be a strong consideration.\u201d Consequently, Johnson referred Hart to Dr. McCue, with the request that McCue determine whether surgery \u201cwas a serious consideration\u201d and to \u201cproceed if it was indicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Hart had an appointment to see Dr. McCue on November 10, 1975. On November 2, however, Hart died of a heart attack. On November 11, Dr. Johnson wrote the insurance carrier, reporting that, upon reviewing his records following Hart\u2019s death, he discovered he \u201chad never stated a permanent impairment rating on Mr. Hart\u2019s right arm.\u201d Johnson opined that, based upon \u201ca total evaluation\u201d made of Hart\u2019s injury during an examination on October 30, the \u201cimpairment rating of [Hart\u2019s] right arm on his last visit would be ... 60 per cent permanent impairment of that arm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Invoking the survival provisions of \u00a7 65.1-64, on February 26, 1976, Hart\u2019s widow, the present appellee, applied to the Industrial Commission for a determination \u201cwhether or not the insurance company in this case is responsible for any further payment\u201d on account of Hart\u2019s 1973 injury to his right arm. Upon a record consisting of Dr. Johnson\u2019s various medical reports, the Commission held that, at the time of his death, Hart \u201chad a compensable 60% permanent loss of use of the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>arm.\u201d The Commission held further that the claim for compensation for permanent disability survived Hart\u2019s death, thus entitling his statutory distributees dependent upon him for support to an award of $70 per week for 120 weeks. The award was entered accordingly, and the County and its insurance carrier have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The benefits provided by Code \u00a7 65.1-56 for the loss or the loss of use of a body member are payable \u201cirrespective of continued employment, loss of wages, or like considerations.\u201d While \u00a7 65.1-56 benefits are \u201cin lieu of all other compensation,\u201d they are payable even though the employee, as in the present case, previously may have received compensation for temporary total incapacity or, as in other cases, for temporary partial incapacity. <em>Nicely </em>v. <em>VEPCO, </em>195 Va. 819, 823, 825, 80 S.E.2d 529, 531, 532-33 (1954). And, where the permanent loss or loss of use of a member is partial only, \u201ccompensation may be proportionately awarded.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The benefits provided by \u00a7 65.1-56 for partial loss are awardable upon a \u201crating\u201d by the Commission of the percentage of incapacity suffered by the employee. The \u201crating\u201d determines the ultimate amount of compensation the employee is entitled to receive. Pertinent to the present situation, if an arm injury causes total incapacity of that member, the scheduled compensation would be awardable for 200 weeks; but because the Commission \u201crated\u201d Hart\u2019s loss of arm use at 60%, compensation was \u201cproportionately awarded\u201d by fixing the compensable period at 120 weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Where, as here, an employee suffers the loss of use of a scheduled body member, the compensation provided by \u00a7 65.1-56 is not awardable \u201cuntil the injury has reached a state of permanency, i. e. maximum improvement, when the degree of loss may be medically ascertained.\u201d <em>Collins </em>v. <em>G. M. Clements Company, </em>48 O.I.C. 49 (1966); <em>Nicely </em>v. <em>VEPCO, supra. </em>In other words, before \u00a7 65.1-56 benefits are awardable, it must appear both that the partial incapacity is permanent and that the injury has reached maximum medical improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">In the present case, it is not questioned that Hart\u2019s arm injury was permanent. Whether, however, at the time of Hart\u2019s death from an unrelated cause, the arm injury had reached maximum medical improvement is the crucial issue in the case. If the injury had not reached such improvement at the time of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>death, Hart could not have been \u201crated\u201d for benefits under \u00a7 65.1-56, and he would not have been \u201centitled to compensation\u201d for the injury within the meaning of the survival provisions of \u00a7 65.1-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The widow-appellee contends that the Commission \u201cfound from all of the evidence, that [Hart\u2019s] injury had reached maximum improvement and that [Hart] could have been rated for permanent disability\u201d under \u00a7 65.1-56. These findings, the widow-appellee argues, are \u201cconclusive and binding\u201d upon this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The Commission, however, in its opinion stated the issue in the case to be this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">\u201c[W]hether or not a claim for permanent disability survives the death of the claimant when no claim for compensation for the permanent disability had been filed prior to his death, <em>although maximum improvement had been reached </em>and the claimant could have been rated for permanent disability.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Neither in other parts of the Commission\u2019s opinion nor anywhere in the opinion of the hearing commissioner is the question of maximum improvement mentioned. The Commission merely assumed that Hart\u2019s injury had reached maximum improvement, and, then, acting upon the assumption, held that th-.? claim for permanent disability survived Hart\u2019s death. In making the assumption, the Commission overlooked the real issue in the case, the question of maximum improvement, which was presented squarely by the memoranda filed with the Commission by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">We are not bound, therefore, by any finding of fact by the Commission upon the issue of maximum medical improvement. But even if the Commission had made a finding that maximum improvement had been reached, we would not be bound thereby because the finding would not have been supported by credible evidence. <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Bragg, </em>203 Va. 204, 207, 123 S.E.2d 393, 395 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">Standing alone, Dr. Johnson\u2019s belated \u201crating\u201d of Hart\u2019s arm injury at \u201c60 per cent permanent impairment\u201d might justify an inference that the doctor considered the injury to have reached maximum medical improvement. Resort to inference would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>necessary because, in his reports, Dr. Johnson did not indicate that the injury had reached maximum improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Doctor Johnson\u2019s \u201crating,\u201d however, does not stand alone, and any inference that he considered Hart\u2019s injury optimally improved is overcome by known facts. Doctor Johnson clearly stated that further surgery on Hart\u2019s arm was \u201ca strong consideration,\u201d consonant with Hart\u2019s expressed wish to see \u201cwhat [could] be done to improve the hand function.\u201d Doctor Johnson referred Hart to Dr. McCue to determine whether surgery was \u201ca serious consideration\u201d and to \u201cproceed if it was indicated.\u201d And an appointment for these purposes was made for Hart with Dr. McCue.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Given the facts of this case, until the doctors had decided against surgery for Hart, or surgery had been performed and its outcome had become known, it could not be determined whether Hart\u2019s arm injury had reached maximum medical improvement. Any finding by the Commission, therefore, that the injury had reached such ' stage of improvement would be based upon speculation and not upon evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Accordingly, we hold that, at the time of his death, Hart was not entitled to the benefits provided by Code \u00a7 65.1-56. With this determination, it follows necessarily that the claim for benefits did not survive Hart\u2019s death. The award of the Commission will be reversed, therefore, and a final award will be entered here in favor of the County and its insurance carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final airard.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-10\"> In pertinent part, \u00a7 65.1-56 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-11\">\u201cIn cases included by the following schedule the incapacity in each case shall be deemed to continue for the period specified and the compensation so paid for such injury shall be as specified therein and shall be in lieu of all other compensation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-12\">\u201c{13) For the loss of an arm sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the average weekly wages during two hundred weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-13\">\u201cIn construing this section the permanent loss of the use of a member shall be held equivalent to the loss of such member and for the permanent partial loss or loss of use of a member compensation may be proportionately awarded.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b730-14\"> In pertinent part, \u00a7 65.1-64 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-15\">\u201cWhen an employee receives or is entitled to compensation under this Act for an injury covered by \u00a7 65.1-56 and dies from any other cause than the injury for which he was entitled to compensation, payment of the unpaid balance of compensation shall be made to his statutory distributees, dependent upon him for support, in lieu of the compensation the employee would have been entitled to had he lived . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
