Finding the defendant\u2019s claim meritorious, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The evidence shows that on December 27, 1975, Trooper R. H. McKinney of the Virginia State Police stopped the defendant for speeding. While talking to the defendant, the trooper observed a \u201cpack of cigarette wrapping papers\u201d on the floorboard of the defendant\u2019s car, forward of the driver\u2019s seat. After he had picked up and examined the papers, the trooper looked further. He found a folded brown paper bag tucked beside the driver\u2019s seat, next to the door. The officer reached down and picked up the bag and looked into it. He discovered what appeared to be marijuana, and, thereupon, he arrested the defendant for possessing the drug. Upon analysis, the substance in the bag proved to be marijuana. .</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">On appeal, the defendant contends that because he was stopped for \u201cthe fairly common offense of speeding\u201d and the only reason his vehicle was searched was the discovery of the cigarette papers, the police officer lacked probable cause either to conduct the search or to seize the marijuana. Cigarette papers, the defendant argues, while usable for illegal purposes, are intrinsically lawful objects, and their presence in an automobile cannot alone justify a warrantless search of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The Attorney General does not rely specifically upon any of the recognized exceptions which permit a warrantless search of a suspect\u2019s automobile. Indeed, the Attorney General concedes that the present case is distinguishable from those decisions in which the exceptions have been applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">The Attorney General\u2019s only support of the search and seizure involved in this case is set forth iri the following quotation from his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">\u201cThe officer ... obviously made some connection between the cigarette papers and the brown bag. His testimony was: \u2018Having seen the papers, I reached down and picked up the brown bag and looked into it.\u2019 ... The cigarette papers were in plain view and so was the brown bag. It is submitted that when the officer saw the cigarette papers and brown bag, there was probable cause to believe that the Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>possessed marijuana and to make an arrest. The prior search and seizure was therefore valid. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">We cannot agree with the Attorney General\u2019s conclusion with respect to the legality of the search and seizure. Admittedly, the cigarette papers were in plain view in the automobile, and, perhaps, so was the brown bag itself; but the contents of the bag were not visible. And, although the police officer did make \u201csome connection\u201d between the cigarette papers and the brown bag, the connection was not combined with any other circumstance which might have justified a rational belief that the bag contained contraband drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The trooper admitted candidly in his testimony that his search of the vehicle was based \u201cpurely on the premise that fhel saw Tthel cigarette papers lying underneath [the defendant\u2019s! feet on the driver\u2019s side\u201d of the car. Absent other circumstances connecting the cigarette papers with the brown paper bag, it would have been just as rational to believe that the bag contained tobacco, or the defendant\u2019s lunch, or any other lawful substance. Thus, contrary to the Attorney General\u2019s assertion, the trooper did not have \u201cprobable cause to believe that the Defendant possessed marijuana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Because the evidence of the presence of marijuana in the defendant\u2019s automobile was improperly admitted, we must reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
