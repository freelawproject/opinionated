He was found guilty as charged, and his punishment was fixed at confinement in the penitentiary for 20 years for each offense. Motions to set aside the jury verdicts as contrary to the law and the evidence were overruled by the trial court, which entered judgments on the verdicts. In this appeal, which we granted on limited grounds, the question for our determination is whether the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney made improper argument to the jury that requires reversal of Jones\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">In his argument to the jury, after all evidence had been introduced and the court\u2019s instructions had been given, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, without objection, made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>\u201c ... As was pointed out in the beginning, anything that I say now, anything that I said then, is not evidence, I am not a witness, I am merely telling you what I believe to be the case and this is my argument.... And I believe that the evidence, considered in its totality would lead you to one conclusion, and that is that the defendant is guilty of that which he is charged....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">He discussed the testimony of various witnesses in detail, and then referred to the testimony of Frank Thompson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-6\">\u201c ... Now this man is retarded is true, he\u2019s slow. But I\u2019ve been prosecuting for twelve years, and I\u2019ve seen a lot of witnesses that were not said to be retarded that needed it a heck of a lot worse than he did. I thought he made a good witness. I thought he told the truth, the truth gentlemen and ladies when it rings, you hear it, you know it. You don\u2019t have to have me to stand here and tell you what\u2019s the truth and what\u2019s not the truth.... The overall meaning is did this man strangle Frank Thompson, and is that the man that did it and if you believe that and all the rest of that trash, then you can throw it into the street, (inaudible) I want you to be convinced as I am. So we\u2019ve got.. ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">At this point defense counsel objected that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney was \u201ctestifying when he said that in his experience as Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney he had never seen a more perfect witness.\u201d The objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, continuing his argument, discussed the alibi defense relied upon by Jones:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-9\">\u201c ... What did he say? Where did he say he was that night, he had gone to Franklin to get a motor for Roy Pair. Where is Roy Pair, Roy Pair is not here. Roy Pair would know, because he had an invoice. He said that his wife, when he got back, there, there she is, did you see her on the stand?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">Defense counsel objected and stated that he \u201cwould like to be heard at the Counsel table.\u201d The record shows no motion for a mistrial or for a cautionary instruction or any ruling by the trial court on the objection. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney continued with this statement to which no objection was interposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-11\">\u201cYou\u2019ve already been heard. Ladies and gentlemen, it\u2019s been brought to my attention that it is not a matter of record that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Mrs. Jones is in Court, so forget the fact if she is in Court or she is not. But the inference that I want you to draw is if he spent the night with her, why didn\u2019t she testify that she was in New York or where she is. Why isn\u2019t she here to testify. It\u2019s a simple reason.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Despite the unsatisfactory state of the record before us, it seems clear, and the Commonwealth has not denied, that a motion for a mistrial was made and overruled at the time defense counsel objected to the argument of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and asked to be heard. At the conclusion of the closing arguments, before the jury retired, defense counsel noted for the record his objections to the trial court\u2019s rulings on instructions, and referred in the following language to this part of the argument of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-6\">\u201cThe defendant notes his exception to the Court\u2019s failure to grant a mistrial in the course of the argument by the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney when he pointed out to the jury that the defendant\u2019s wife was in the courtroom and pointed her out and stated that her failure to testify and argued that her failure to testify created the presumption that her testimony would not be favorable to the defendant. The defendant\u2019s objection being to the fact that there is nothing in the evidence to indicate that defendant\u2019s wife was present in the courtroom and that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney by his statement to the jury was testifying to which the defendant excepts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Whether defense counsel relied on Code \u00a7 8-288 (Repl. Vol. 1957),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> now \u00a7 19.2-271.2 (Cum. Supp. 1977), in his motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>mistrial cannot be determined from the record. It appears more likely that his motion was based upon the action of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney in pointing to a spectator whom he believed to be Mrs. Jones. Nevertheless, the applicability of the statute was fully considered by the trial court when arguments were presented on the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdicts. In overruling the motion, the trial court stated that as Jones had raised the defense of alibi, the provisions of Code \u00a7 8-288 did not apply. The court reasoned that Jones had testified that his wife was at home when he returned there from Franklin on the evening that the crimes were committed, and that it would be a miscarriage of justice to prohibit the Commonwealth from rebutting the inference that she was at home with Jones when the Thompsons were wounded, thereby providing support for his alibi. This ruling by the trial court constituted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The language of Code \u00a7 8-288 is mandatory. The statute does not, as the Commonwealth has argued in the trial court and before us, apply only if the Commonwealth had attempted to call Mrs. Jones as a witness against her husband and Jones had objected. Nor did the defendant invite the comments of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney by testifying that he was at home when the crimes were committed. The statute provides no exception where an alibi defense is asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">The \u201cinference\u201d which the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney wished to have the jury draw was that if Mrs. Jones had been called to testify for the defendant, her testimony would have been unfavorable. This is precisely the kind of argument which Code \u00a7 8-288 was intended to prohibit. <em>Roller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>161 Va. 1104, 1110, 172 S.E. 242, 244 (1934). <em>See Wilson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>157 Va. 962, 162 S.E. 15 (1932). In <em>Roller, </em>where the evidence was highly conflicting, we declined to presume that the comments made in violation of the statute were harmless, and we withheld any decision on the question of harmless error in a case where the evidence is substantially free from conflict. <em>Id. </em>161 Va. at 1110, 172 S.E. at 244-245.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">In the present appeal, we cannot agree with the Attorney General that the doctrine of harmless error should be applied. He asserts on brief that the evidence of guilt, including positive in-court identification by the victims, was overwhelming; that the only contradiction was in the alibi defense; that it is \u201cnot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>probable\u201d that any verdict but a guilty verdict could be sustained; and that the error, therefore, was harmless. He cites <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>192 Va. 205, 64 S.E.2d 713 (1951). In that case, however, the defendant refused the offer of the trial court to give a cautionary instruction to the jury to disregard the improper argument. The evidence of guilt was conclusive, and there was nothing in the verdict, which fixed the defendant\u2019s punishment at 90 days in jail when the maximum punishment was 12 months in jail, to show that the defendant was prejudiced by the improper argument. Moreover, the correct rule that must be applied is that error in a criminal case will require reversal of a conviction unless the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23-24 (1967), <em>rehearing denied, </em>386 U.S. 987 (1967); <em>Goins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 285, 237 S.E.2d 136 (1977); <em>Vass </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 740, 745, 204 S.E.2d 280, 284 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">In the present appeal, the crimes were heinous, and the guilty verdicts were supported by the evidence, but the jury fixed Jones\u2019s punishment at the statutory maximum for each offense. The crucial evidence for the Commonwealth, consisting of the identification testimony of two persons, one of retarded mentality, was not overwhelming. As we cannot say that the error may not have prejudiced Jones, at least as to the quantum of punishment, we hold that his convictions must be reversed and the cases remanded for a new trial. Therefore, we will consider other portions of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s argument which Jones says were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">We agree that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney engaged in improper argument when he expressed his personal opinion as to the credibility of a witness and the weight of the evidence. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 459, 467, 150 S.E.2d 545, 550 (1966). We do not believe that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney may validate such an argument in advance by a prefatory admonition to the jury that whatever he said was not evidence and that the jury must decide the case on the evidence. It is the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s duty to present the available evidence to the jury, and let the jury perform its function of evaluating the evidence and determining the credibility of witnesses, without being subjected to the pressure of the prosecutor\u2019s personal views.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>There is no merit to Jones\u2019s argument that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney improperly argued for the maximum punishment. Defense counsel in closing argument discussed the court\u2019s instructions and referred specifically to the instruction prescribing the applicable punishment if the jury returned verdicts of guilty on the charges of malicious wounding or a lesser included offense. In his rebuttal argument, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney asked for the maximum punishment, to which defense counsel objected on the ground that this was not responsive to the closing argument for the defense and was, therefore, not proper rebuttal. This objection was properly overruled. The argument was clearly responsive to the defense argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">For the reasons assigned, the judgments of the trial court will be reversed and the cases will be remanded for a new trial-consistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-8\"> \u201c\u00a7 8-288.
