We also consider whether duly-attested abstracts of civil money judgments against the defendant were admissible as evidence in this criminal trial and whether the. defendant was prejudiced by references made during the trial to a proceeding in which defendant was adjudicated a bankrupt. We find error in all three instances and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-15\">Defendant William P. Riegert was indicted on November 24, 1975 for \u201csteal[ing] property of Haywood L. Darnell having a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>value of approximately $5350.00. Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.1-100, [<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] 18.1-118.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]\u201d Tried by a jury on June 8,1976, defendant was found guilty as charged and his punishment was fixed at confinement in jail for 90 days and a fine of $1,000. To the trial court\u2019s June 18, 1976 judgment of conviction, which confirmed the jury\u2019s verdict, we awarded defendant a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Viewed in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence discloses these facts. On Saturday, January 11, 1975, Darnell, an auctioneer, pursuant to a contract with Mrs. John G. Carpenter, conducted an auction on the Carpenter property in Orange County to dispose of a part of the estate of Mrs. Carpenter\u2019s deceased husband. Among the items advertised to be sold at the auction were livestock and \u201capproximately] 8,000 Bales\u201d of hay.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">One of those attending the auction was the defendant Riegert, who resided in Northern Virginia and who had received a brochure publicizing the event. Riegert, a developer and contractor for five years who planned to buy a farm, had purchased hay (20 bales) only once before.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Prior to commencement of the bidding on the hay, Darnell announced to the audience that the hay would be sold in bulk and not by the bale. He also stated several times to the group that less hay than advertised was available for sale; he invited those who planned to bid on it to carefully examine the quantity of hay, which was stored at several different locations on the Carpenter property. Although the defendant testified to the contrary, the Commonwealth's evidence showed that Darnell said nothing to the group about making any \u201cadjustment\u201d in case the lot of hay actually bought by the successful bidder was less than the purchaser thought he was buying. According to the testimony, the audience was told by Darnell that \u201cwhat you seen is what you are buying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The defendant was the high bidder in the amount of $3850 on hay which was stored in a barn near the auctioneer\u2019s tent. The evidence showed that this barn contained, at the most, 4500 bales. Defendant also bought, six head of cattle for a total of $1500. He then wrote a personal check to Darnell\u2019s order drawn on the Guaranty Bank and Trust Company of Fairfax, Virginia, for $5350 dated the day of the auction. Written in the margin on the face of the check, apparently by the defendant, was \u201cauction \u2014 Orange \u2014 6 head &amp; 8,000 Hay.\u201d The check was delivered on the day of the auction and defendant was given a statement from Darnell showing that $3850 was paid for \u201cHay in Barn.\u201d Defendant moved the cattle and \u201csome of the hay\u201d from the site on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Darnell, testifying for the Commonwealth, stated that on the Wednesday following the auction, defendant called him complaining that only about 2800 bales of hay were in the barn and seeking an adjustment in the price, which Darnell refused. On the following Friday, January 17, 1975, defendant orally ordered Guaranty Bank to stop payment on the Darnell check,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which was done. After learning of the stop-payment, Darnell contacted defendant who said \u201che liked the cows\u201d but again complained about the quantity of hay and told Darnell \u201cyou have got to do something about the hay.\u201d Darnell again refused to make any adjustment and, when he was unable to \u201cget any satisfaction out of [Riegert] at all\u201d, subsequently contacted an Orange County attorney who suggested that Darnell bring a civil suit to recover the amount due.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Defendant continued to remove the hay after payment was stopped on the check and eventually removed it all. Two hundred and fifty bales were sold by defendant for one dollar a bale on the day of the sale to a West Point, Virginia, contractor who attended the auction.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">A civil judgment for $5350 was obtained in favor of Darnell against Riegert after a jury trial on July 18, 1975 at which Riegert appeared by counsel only. At the time of his criminal trial almost one year later, this civil judgment remained unsatisfied. Defendant testified that on July 22,1975 he offered to satisfy the judgment by paying Darnell $5000. Darnell denied that any such offer was ever made.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The Commonwealth called as a witness William W. Duncan, who, during late 1974 and early 1975, was in charge of the bookkeeping department of the Guaranty Bank. Testifying from bank records, Duncan stated that on the day before the auction, Riegert had a balance of $510.93 in his checking account and that this balance had dropped to $286.93 by January 17, the day the bank received the stop-payment order. The records also showed that on January 14 a check drawn on the account for $460 was returned as an overdraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Duncan stated that during the first three weeks of January there was \u201csome activity\u201d in Riegert\u2019s account but that no loans were actually made to defendant. He testified, however, that Riegert was \u201cover collateralized\u201d with the bank, meaning that defendant had \u201cexcessive collateral on deposit with the bank for some thirty thousand odd dollars.. ..\u201d Duncan said that it was \u201cnot inconceivable that additional monies would be made available to [defendant]\u201d, but that such additional sums were not advanced because \u201c[apparently they were not requested.\u201d On cross-examination, Duncan stated that in order for additional sums to be made \u201cavailable\u201d, the bank required \u201ca formal request from either Mr. or Mrs. Riegert or both for .. . an additional loan to be made to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Duncan further stated that the bank made loans by allowing overdrafts. He stated that when there were insufficient funds in an account to pay a check, a branch manager or loan officer who had knowledge of the depositor\u2019s financial condition made the decision whether to pay that particular overdraft. In reponse to questions from the trial court, interjected during cross-examination, Duncan explained that the January 14 overdraft was not paid but was returned \u201cfor insufficient funds\u201d because \u201capparently\u201d the particular loan officer on that occasion decided not to permit the overdraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">\u25a0 When asked to describe \u201cthe bank\u2019s practice with respect to stopping payment on a check where there [were] insufficient funds in the account to cover that check\u201d, Duncan testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">\u201cThe policy of the bank in dealing with stop payment is that we will not accept a stop payment on a check if the balance of the account is less than the amount of the check being requested that stop payment be placed on. In other words, if a check is requested to have a stop payment placed on it and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>balance of the account is less than the amount of the check it\u2019s the policy of our bank that we will not accept that stop payment. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Duncan further testified that he personally issued the stop payment on the check in question and that when the order was received from Riegert,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">\u201cI had a telephone conversation with a loan officer, I cannot tell you the individual\u2019s name at this point because it\u2019s one of many, who authorized me to place a stop payment on this check which would indicate that funds were available to pay the check through the bank resources. I had that conversation with the loan officer and that loan officer authorized the stop payment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Duncan also answered \u201ccorrect\u201d to the question: \u201c[I]f no prior arrangements had been made to pay the check the bank would not have issued the stop payment.. . ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">On redirect examination, when asked whether defendant was treated as a customer in a different manner in January 1975 than in February of the same year, Duncan testified that Riegert\u2019s account with the bank during those months \u201cwas always handled with the same attitude and atmosphere within the bank.\u201d He stated that if there were additional overdrafts in February, they \u201cmight not [be paid] but on the other hand they might [be paid].\u201d Duncan then testified, when handed defendant\u2019s February bank statement, that during the month one overdraft was \u201capparently\u201d paid and three others were \u201creturned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The defendant\u2019s evidence, a great deal of which was obviously rejected by the jury, showed the following facts. He testified that he wanted to fulfill \u201ca dream to live on a farm some day and work the farm\u201d, so he commenced purchasing cattle and looking for a farm to buy during the Fall of 1974. Riegert, 33 years of age, bought about 50 head of cattle in October and November and intended to buy other cattle in December. In order to finance that anticipated purchase, and the purchase of hay to feed the cattle, defendant said that he, along with a friend, had arranged to borrow $11,000 from the Federal Land Bank. Introduced into evidence was a copy of a promissory note in that amount dated January 13, 1975, payable to the Warrenton Production Credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Association executed by defendant, his friend and their respective wives.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant said he had applied for the loan in December after he had learned of the Carpenter auction.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Defendant further testified that because he had not obtained the loan proceeds from the Federal Land Bank, during \u201cthe week prior to the auction\u201d he went to Guaranty Bank and advised one Jim Newsome, described as the Executive Vice President of the bank, of the land bank loan application. He told Newsome he \u201chad never been to an auction before\u201d so he did not know the amount he would have to pay for his purchases and indicated to Newsome he did not want his purchases to exceed \u201cten or eleven thousand dollars.\u201d According to Riegert, Newsome told defendant \u201cto go ahead and\u2018write a check\u201d, stating that he would \u201capprove the check when it came in to be paid.\u201d Defendant testified that Newsome said the bank would \u201cpay the check at the time it came in.\u201d Newsome did not testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Riegert further testified that he was the \u201cowner of a major subdivision.\u201d He stated that Guaranty Bank \u201cfinanced all of the properties\u201d and \u201ccollected the notes\u201d for defendant while \u201cholding\u201d the first deeds of trust which defendant \u201csigned over [to the bank] as collateral.\u201d He stated that when he \u201cneeded money,\u201d he could \u201cdraw\u201d against the collateral and this was the \u201cbasis\u201d of his \u201clending strength.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Riegert testified that on the day of the auction Darnell stated to the audience that about 6,000 bales of hay were available for sale and that \u201ccompensation would be made\u201d for \u201can excessive amount of discrepancy.\u201d He further testified that he did not examine the hay before the purchase to estimate the number of bales he was buying. He said he thought he \u201chad bought right around 6000 bales\u201d but that he was later told \u201cthere was only 2800 or 2900 bales of hay actually counted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Defendant denied he intended to defraud Darnell and stated that, in spite of several telephone conversations with Darnell during the three days following the sale and a meeting with Mrs. Carpenter at her home on January 14, he was unable to \u201cresolve\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>the matter. Riegert testified he \u201cdidn\u2019t know what to do about [the controversy]\u201d, so on January 17 he called Guaranty Bank seeking advice and talked \u201cto a loan officer\u201d who said \u201cwell, probably the correct thing to do is put a stop payment on the check and work the thing out with the auctioneer.\u201d Riegert said the loan officer called Duncan in the bookkeeping department and ascertained the check \u201chad not come in\u201d and thereupon defendant issued his order to stop payment:</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Riegert attempted to explain his conduct in continuing to remove the hay. from the Carpenter premises, even after payment of the check was stopped, by saying that he thought the controversy was \u201cgoing to be worked out.\u201d He testified: \u201cAll I was looking for was compensation in regards to the hay that Mr. Darnell had mentioned to me and to everybody else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In order to sustain a conviction for larceny by false pretenses, the Commonwealth must prove: \u201c(1) an intent to defraud; (2) an actual fraud; (3) use of false pretenses for the purpose of perpetrating the fraud; and (4) accomplishment of the fraud by means of the false pretenses used for the purpose, that is, the false pretenses to some degree must have induced the owner to part with his property.\u201d <em>Bourgeois </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 268, 272, 227 S.E.2d 714, 717 (1976).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this context, the false pretense must be a representation as to any existing fact or past event. <em>Id.; Hubbard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>201 Va. 61, 66, 109 S.E.2d 100, 104 (1959). But-merely showing that the accused knowingly stated what was false is not sufficient; there must also be proof that his intent was to defraud. <em>Trogdon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 862, 872 (1878).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Furthermore, the fraudulent intent must have existed at the time the false pretenses were made, by which the property was obtained. <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 912, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>918-19 (1877). And in order to determine whether the intent to defraud existed at the time the act was committed, the conduct and representations of the accused must be examined, since intent\u2019 is \u201ca secret operation of the mind.\u201d <em>Trogdon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>72 Va. at 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">As to the sufficiency of the evidence, the Attorney General argues, reviewing the facts, that each element of the offense has been properly established. We disagree. We need only focus on whether the Commonwealth has proved that a present intent to defraud existed in the mind of defendant when the check in question was delivered, on January 11, 1975, because we think the requisite proof of that element is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The main thrust of the Attorney General\u2019s argument on this issue is directed to proof of \u201cinadequacy of the defendant\u2019s bank account\u201d and \u201cthe absence of any effort on the part of the defendant to seek credit or [a] loan to be deposited to his account to cover the check to Darnell in light of the notice of January 14, 1975, attached to the returned check... .\u201d But the Commonwealth\u2019s own evidence failed to carry the prosecution\u2019s burden to exclude every reasonable hypothesis save that of guilt; rather, it established facts which were consistent with defendant\u2019s innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">In the first place, the Commonwealth\u2019s witness Duncan testified that he, in accordance with bank policy and pursuant to proper authorization, placed the stop-payment order on the check, even though the account contained insufficient funds to cover it, and that the fact of such authorization \u201cwould indicate that funds were available to pay the check through the bank resources.\u201d He also indicated that the stop-payment order would not have been issued by the bank unless \u201cprior arrangements\u201d had been made by the depositor for the bank to pay the check. To be inferred from this evidence is the fact, consistent with defendant\u2019s innocence, that, even though the defendant had insufficient funds in his checking account to pay the check when issued, Riegert had made arrangements prior to January 17, and even prior to the date of issuance, to have the check honored. Manifestly, such evidence negates the existence on the day of the auction of any intent to defraud in the mind of the accused. This is evidence that Riegert issued and delivered the check fully intending, at that time, that it would be paid, having, made prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>arrangements with the bank for it to be \u201ccovered.\u201d But that is not all.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The fact that defendant waited until January 17 to stop the payment of the check likewise militates against a finding of the necessary intent to defraud. There were at least four normal banking business days between January 11 and January 17 during which the check could have been presented and presumably paid, according to the evidence we have just discussed.' If defendant intended, when the check was delivered, to use the stop-payment device to defraud Darnell, the accused would not have given Darnell the time and opportunity to negotiate the check before such stop order was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">And the evidence of the January and February overdrafts, which were returned for insufficient funds, fails to save the Commonwealth\u2019s case. The prosecution\u2019s own witness explained that overdrafts were not converted into loans and paid unless a \u201cformal request\u201d for an additional loan to cover the overdraft had been made or unless the specific bank officer handling the transaction decided to permit the overdraft. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude, consistent with defendant\u2019s innocence and contrary to the handling of the Darnell check, that as to the overdrafts returned, no \u201cformal request\u201d by defendant had been made nor had any officer approval been given in connection with those particular transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">For these reasons, we hold the circumstantial evidence that the defendant entertained an intent to defraud at the time of the act in question insufficient to sustain the conviction. The Commonwealth, as a matter of law, has failed to overcome the presumption of innocence and has failed to exclude all reasonable conclusions inconsistent with Riegert\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Because there may be a retrial of the defendant after remand, we address the other two issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">Over the strenuous objection of the defendant, the trial court permitted the prosecutor, as a part of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, to introduce as exhibits duly-attested abstracts of 14 civil money judgments obtained against the defendant during the period from January 11, 1974 to January 13, 1975. On their face, the exhibits showed that one judgment had been satisfied in full and three had been partially paid. The defendant testified that many of the other judgments had also been satisfied. The Attorney General contends the abstracts were admissible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>establish the \u201ccollateral fact\u201d of \u201cthe financial condition of the defendant and his intent with respect to the check he gave to Darnell.\u201d We reject that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Standing alone, mere evidence of judgments, satisfied or unsatisfied, is of insufficient probative value to establish either a defendant\u2019s financial worth or an intent to defraud under these circumstances. It is common knowledge that the fact of judgment indebtedness is but one element in a composite statement of financial condition. The most affluent and solvent person may have judgments outstanding. Thus, even assuming that overall financial status may be probative to show intent in a case such as this, to allow the Commonwealth, in this manner, to fix upon only one aspect of defendant\u2019s apparent ability to pay his debts was erroneous and prejudicial to the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Finally, the trial court allowed the prosecutor, over objection, to cross-examine the defendant from a bankruptcy petition and its schedules filed on defendant\u2019s behalf on February 10, 1976. The documents were not received as exhibits in this case and they are not a part of the record on appeal. From the evidence, it appears that the bankruptcy adjudication, based on a voluntary petition, was on April 12, 1976. Stating that the questions based on the bankruptcy documents would not be restricted to the period near January 11, 1975, the trial court permitted the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney to interrogate defendant on portions of the documents, bringing before the jury such facts as an apparent indebtedness to a bank on January 1, 1975 of $39,000, a \u201cNovember 18\u201d partial payment on a loan for $47,000 obtained on May 15,1973, and \u201cforeclosure of property\u201d at some undisclosed time.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The Attorney General contends for the correctness of such procedure, stating that \u201cthe Bankruptcy Act does not prohibit such evidentiary use.\u201d The trial court allowed the interrogation because the defendant had \u201cput in issue his business record and his personal record ... to a certain extent and it is proper [for the defendant] to be examined upon that.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">The mere fact of a bankruptcy adjudication made 15 months after the alleged crime is, of itself, prejudicial to the defendant under these circumstances, because it is too remote in time to have any proper relevance to the defendant\u2019s state of mind on January 11, 1975 or to his financial condition on that date. Moreover, drawing from the bankruptcy documents isolated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>facts through the medium of cross-examination highly prejudiced the accused in this case for the reasons we have just stated in our discussion of the civil judgment issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Not cited by either party to this appeal, but worthy of consideration on this point, is <em>Trogdon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra. </em>There, in a prosecution for larceny by false pretenses, this court held admissible the entire record of a defendant\u2019s bankruptcy. 72 Va. at 880. But in that case, the bankruptcy petition had been filed only one month after the defendant\u2019s representations of solvency out of which the prosecution arose. In addition, the basis of the indictment there was that defendant had obtained property on credit which had been extended to him as the result of his claims of financial stability. Thus, <em>Trogdon </em>is distinguishable on its facts and is not controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of conviction will be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial, if the Commonwealth be so advised..</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-10\"> Code g 18.1-100 (Cum.
