Hanvey.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">The stipulated facts show that Virginia Mutual issued its contract of insurance to Hanvey effective from October 2,1973 to April 2, 1974. On November 26, 1973, fifty-five days after the issuance of the policy, Virginia Mutual sent a notice to Hanvey advising him that his policy was terminated as of December 8, 1973. On January 9, 1974, Hanvey was involved in an accident with Lillian C. Pugh. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty Mutual), pursuant to its uninsured motorist endorsement of a policy issued to Mrs. Pugh, paid to her the sum of $9,500 for injuries sustained in the accident. Liberty Mutual asserted that Virginia Mutual had not effectively cancelled its policy to Hanvey and claimed that Virginia Mutual is indebted to it for the sum paid Mrs. Pugh.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides in pertinent parts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-6\">\u201c(e) No cancellation ... by an insurer . .. shall be effective unless the insurer shall deliver or mail, to the named insured . . . , a written notice of the cancellation .... Such notice shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-7\">\u201c(1) Be approved as to form by the Commissioner of Insurance prior to its use;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-8\">\u201c(2) State the date, which shall not be less than thirty days after mailing to the insured of the notice of cancellation on which such cancellation . .. shall become effective</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-9\">\u201c(3) State the specific reason or reasons of the insurer for cancellation . ..;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-10\">\u201c(4) Advise the insured of his right to request in writing, . .. that the Commissioner of Insurance review the action of the insurer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-11\">\u201c(5) Advise the insured of his possible eligibility for insurance through the Virginia Automobile Insurance Plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">Section 38.1-381.5 further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-13\">\u201c(f) Nothing in this section shall apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-14\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-15\">\u201c(3) To any policy of automobile insurance which has been \u25a0 in effect less than sixty days,....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>Paragraph 15 of Virginia Mutual\u2019s policy relating to cancellation conditions, in pertinent part, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-4\">\u201cThis policy may be cancelled by the company by mailing to the insured ... at the address shown in this policy written notice stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-5\">\u201c1. When not less than ten days thereafter such cancellation shall be effective, if this policy has been in effect less than sixty days ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">The trial court, in a written opinion, held that since Virginia Mutual mailed a notice of cancellation to Hanvey fifty-five days after the policy was issued advising him that his policy would be cancelled effective ten days thereafter, the \u201ctiming of this exercise converted the policy into one that has been in effect for more than sixty days, took it out of Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(f) and made it subject to the provisions of Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(e);\u201d and that since the policy was not cancelled pursuant to the latter section, it was in full force and effect when Hanvey was involved in the accident with Mrs. Pugh. Judgment was thereupon entered for Liberty Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">We do not agree with the reasoning and findings of the trial court. Subsection (e) sets forth what is required of the insurer to effectuate cancellation of a policy for cause. Subsection (f)(3) states that nothing in that section shall apply to a policy of automobile liability insurance which has been in effect less than sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">It is clear from a reading of subsection (f) along with the notice provision in the policy that if Virginia Mutual elected to cancel the policy within sixty days of its effective date, it was privileged to do so upon its mailing the notice which fixed a termination date not less than ten days thereafter. The provision of the policy merely set the period that the notice must run. It is obvious that the notice requirement in the policy was for the purpose of giving the insured time to apply for other insurance. There is nothing in subsection (f) requiring that the effective date of the cancellation must be within sixty days. It is to the mailing of the cancellation notice within sixty days that the statute speaks. Here Virginia Mutual mailed within the sixty days required by subsection (f)(3) the unequivocal notice of cancellation of the policy. For us to hold subsection (e) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>applicable, subsection (f) would have to read \u201cany policy of automobile insurance which will have been in effect less than sixty days\u201d rather than the language of the statute \u201chas been in effect less than sixty days.\u201d Hence, we hold that when Virginia Mutual mailed the notice of cancellation, the insurance policy had been in effect less than sixty days and therefore the requirements of Code \u00a7 38.1-381.5(e) are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Liberty Mutual\u2019s reliance on the majority opinion in <em>Langdon </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., </em>357 F.2d 819 (D.C. Cir. 1966), is not persuasive here. The only issue presented there was the interpretation of the cancellation provisions of the insurance policy. The court found that the provisions of the policy were ambiguous and under well-recognized principles interpreted the language against the insurer and in favor of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">For the reasons stated, the judgment is reversed and final judgment is here entered for Virginia Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">\n<em>Reve rsed and final jndg m ent.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b972-16\">. The statute was amended in 1975, but the amendments are not relevant to this case. Acts 1975. c. 63 at 232, and c. 319 at 535.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
