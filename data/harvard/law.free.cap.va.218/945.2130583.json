Wheelhouse and three other vice squad officers of the Richmond Police Department were conducting a narcotics, investigation at the intersection of St. John and Federal Streets. While there they observed an automobile moving southbound on St. John Street, heading toward them. The car stopped about a third of a block from the intersection, and Wheelhouse noticed the occupants of the front seat \u201cmoving around quite a bit.\u201d \u201cFive or six seconds\u201d later, the car started off slowly and then increased its speed. One of the detectives with Wheelhouse stepped out in the street and stopped the car. Wheelhouse approached the driver and asked him for his identification. A strong odor of burnt marijuana was emanating from the vehicle, and a search was then made of the car for marijuana, but none was found. Wheelhouse and the other vice squad officers, however, saw in the back seat of the automobile a \u201cLloyd\u2019s\u201d stereo set and a television set.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-12\">Defendant was questioned relative to the ownership of the items, and he stated that the items were the property of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>sister. He then changed his story and said the items were his uncle\u2019s. Finally, the defendant said that he did not know to whom they belonged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">Detective Wheelhouse explicitly testified that he did not place the defendant under arrest; that defendant w\u00e1s under no restraint in any way from leaving the scene; and that neither he nor the other three vice squad detectives seized the items. He said that after receiving so many conflicting statements from the defendant as to the ownership of the property, he radioed Detectives Houchins and Lightfoot, whose duties were to investigate breaking and entering offenses, and requested that they come to the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">When Detectives Houchins and Lightfoot arrived, Wheelhouse advised them of the conflicting statements made by the defendant relating to the ownership of the items. Wheelhouse and the other vice squad officers then left the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">Houchins testified that prior to receiving the call from Wheelhouse, he had received a report that a building on 4th Avenue had been broken into and entered and a \u201cLloyd\u2019s\u201d stereo set had been taken therefrom. Upon questioning defendant concerning the ownership of the items, he.said defendant told him that the items were the property of his sister. Houchins stated he immediately dispatched an officer to the residence of the defendant\u2019s sister to talk with her, but. she was not at home. Defendant\u2019s father, who was at the residence, stated, however, that the items did not belong to defendant\u2019s sister. .Houchins then seized the items, gave the defendant a receipt, and .took them to police headquarters.. Defendant then left the scene. Houchins stated that the defendant was free to leave the scene at any time before and during the time he was questioning him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\">After checking with the occupant of the 4th Avenue building and other police reports of break-ins, Houchins found that the \u201cLloyd\u2019s\u201d stereo set taken from defendant\u2019s automobile was not the one stolen from the 4th Avenue address; however, he concluded it may have come from the home of Shirley Watters, 4023 North Avenue. The following day, defendant was arrested on a warrant charging him with breaking and entering the North Avenue residence and stealing a \u201cLloyd\u2019s\u201d stereo set. Defendant was then questioned by the police, after having been given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and he stated that he had bought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>the items seized from a man called \u201cSmoke.\u201d The next day, defendant told the police that he won the items in a \u201ccrap\u201d game.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">Defendant argues that even though the items seized from the back seat of his automobile without a warrant were in plain view, they were inadmissible in evidence because there was no probable cause for the officers to believe that the items were contraband or the fruits of a crime. We do not agree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-6\">\u201cProbable cause, as the very name implies, deals with probabilities. These are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations in everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act. Probable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the arresting officer\u2019s knowledge and of which he had reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed.\u201d <em>Schaum </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 498, 500, 211 S.E.2d 73, 75 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">In the present case the evidence shows that items were not seized by Wheelhouse or the other members of the vice squad. The seizure was made by Houchins. Before seizing the items, Houchins knew the defendant had told Wheelhouse several conflicting stories concerning their ownership. Houchins had also been told by the defendant that the items were his sister\u2019s. Upon checking the verity of the defendant\u2019s statement, Houchins found from a conversation with defendant\u2019s father that the sister did not own the items. Prior to answering Detective Wheelhouse\u2019s request that he come to the St. John\u2019s Street location, Houchins had received a report that a residence on 4th Avenue had been broken into and a \u201cLloyd\u2019s\u201d stereo set had been stolen. Even though it later developed that the \u201cLloyd\u2019s\u201d stereo set seized from the defendant was not the one taken from the 4th Avenue building, Houchins had probable cause to believe from the information he had received that the items, at the time he seized them, were fruits of a crime that had been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">Defendant argues that his statements made to the police concerning how he obtained the items should have been excluded because the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not given before he was questioned by the officers. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-9\">It is true that at the time the statements were made by the defendant to Wheelhouse and Houchins, the defendant had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>been given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. But <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), applies to \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d Custodial interrogation means \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d 384 U.S. at 444; <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 69, 72, 235 S.E.2d 331, 333 (1977); <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 768, 772, 222 S.E.2d 573, 576-77 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">The evidence here was not rendered inadmissible for failure to give the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The questioning of the defendant was conducted during an \u201cinvestigatory\u201d stage. The evidence shows that defendant was not under arrest at the time; nor was he in custody. He was free to leave the scene when the questioning began, and he was not deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way. In fact, he left the scene without restraint after the questioning was completed and the articles were seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">The fact that the defendant\u2019s questioning by the police concerning the ownership of the items may have caused him to feel that he was deprived of his right to leave the scene does not require the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to be given.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-7\">\u201cAny interview of one suspected of a crime by a police officer will have coercive aspects to it, simply by virtue of the fact that the police officer is part of a law enforcement system which may ultimately cause the suspect to be charged with a crime. But police officers are not required to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings to everyone whom they question.\u201d <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495 (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1113-8\">For the reasons stated, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1110-13\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-89, as amended.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
