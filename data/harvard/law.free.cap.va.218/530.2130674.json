On November 11, 1970, Danny R. Murray and Dollie K. Murray (the Murrays) purchased a new 1970 Marshfield mobile home from Key Trailer Sales, Inc. (Key), in Norfolk. A security interest, retained by Key in the purchase agreement to secure the deferred purchase money, was duly assigned for consideration by Key to Bank. The Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles, pursuant to application under the provisions of Chapter 3 of Title 46.1 of the Code, Code \u00a7 46.1-41 <em>et seq., </em>issued a certificate of title showing the Murrays\u2019 ownership of the trailer and Bank\u2019s security interest therein, Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.1-68, 46.1-68.1, 46.1-69, thus perfecting Bank\u2019s lien, Code \u00a7 46.1-71. This title certificate was delivered to and has since been retained by Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The Murrays took possession of the trailer and occupied it until the spring or summer of 1973. Regular monthly payments were received by Bank until August 9, 1974, after which no further payments were made. Upon default, Bank attempted to locate the trailer. Key, the dealer, was no longer in business. The mobile home was not located by Bank until January, 1975, when it was found in Hunning\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Hunning acquired possession of the trailer in June, 1973, under a purchase agreement with Key which reserved a security interest. Key assigned this security interest to a Pennsylvania bank which is- not a party to this action. In addition to signing the purchase agreement, Hunning signed an application for a title certificate to the mobile home and paid Key the state titling tax of $129.90 on the purchase price. Hunning was not surprised when he did not receive a title certificate for the mobile home because he had been told by Key that the certificate would be retained by the lienholder, the Pennsylvania bank, until the purchase money lien was satisfied. Hunning never received a registration card for the trailer, a fact which \u201cworried him\u201d, but he made no inquiry in this regard. Hunning knew the trailer he was purchasing was not new when he entered into his agreement with Key.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>The trial court found, and its findings are not disputed here, that Hunning purchased the trailer in the ordinary course of business from the inventory of Key, a dealer in that commodity. The trial court also found that Hunning\u2019s purchase from the dealer\u2019s inventory was \u201cin good faith without notice of any prior liens\u201d, and that Bank had no knowledge, prior to January, 1975, that Key had obtained possession of the vehicle, placed it in inventory, offered it for sale and actually contracted to sell it to Hunning.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Based on the foregoing' facts, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of Hunning on Bank\u2019s claim that it was entitled to possession of the trailer in order to subject it to sale to satisfy Bank\u2019s lien. This judgment was based on the trial court\u2019s letter opinion that Hunning took the trailer free of Bank\u2019s security interest by virtue of Code \u00a7 8.9-307(1) which, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">\u201c\u00c1 buyer in ordinary course of business . .. takes free of a security interest created by his seller even though the security interest is perfected and even though the buyer knows of its existence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Here, as in the trial court, Hunning relies solely on Code \u00a7 8.9-307(1) to defeat the validly perfected security interest of Bank. Hunning argues that this statutory provision applies because Key, the seller, as a party to the initial contract of sale with the Murrays, created the security interest which is the basis of Bank\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Bank\u2019s security interest was not created by Key, the seller, but by the Murrays, the initial purchasers from Key. It follows that Code \u00a7 8.9-307(1) is inapplicable and Bank\u2019s security interest remains unimpaired and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Therefore, the judgment appealed from will be reversed and the case will be remanded with direction that the trial court enter such orders as are required to enable Bank to enforce its rights under the security interest which it holds.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
