Code \u00a7 11-2(7). The question we decide here is whether the oral employment contract for personal services involved in this case falls within the foregoing provision of the statute. We think it does not and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">Plaintiff-appellee Marietta Bernot, the employee, sued at law appellants Joseph M. Silverman and Joseph M. Silverman, Inc. (sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as defendant or employer) seeking damages for wrongful discharge under an oral contract of employment and for anticipatory breach of a pension agreement. The plaintiff asserted that in 1964 she entered Silverman\u2019s employ for an agreed period of time extending until she attained age 62 or until his death, whichever should first occur, and that Silverman wrongfully discharged her from such employment to her economic detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the employee for $50,000, upon which the trial court entered judgment on March 1, 1976. From this judgment order we granted the employer a writ of error, limited to the consideration of the foregoing question.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">Stated in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, these are the facts. In 1956, Mrs. Bernot first met Mr. Silverman; she was approximately 41 years of age and he was about 52. At the time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>she owned and operated a millinery shop in Alexandria. He was executive sales director of a life insurance company and president and sole shareholder of defendant Joseph A. Silverman, Inc., a corporation dealing in real estate investments. The parties immediately developed a close personal relationship and each later separated from their respective spouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Within several years, Silverman began \u201cinviting\u201d Mrs. Bernot to become his personal secretary and the manager of his office located in the District of Columbia. He represented to her that his annual income was \u201ca hundred thousand dollars\u201d and \u201cthat he could do a lot better\u201d, which statement she \u201ctook with a grain of salt.\u201d Accordingly, these offers were initially declined by Mrs. Bernot because she \u201cintended to stay in [her] shop\u201d in order to \u201cget [her two children] through college.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">These appeals continued \u201cperiodically,\u201d with Silverman offering her \u201cmarvelous benefits to associate with him.\u201d In 1964, when Mrs. Bernot had an opportunity to sell her millinery business, Silverman again asked her \u201cto come to work for him in his office.\u201d She was then concerned about \u201cher long term security\u201d, and wanted to leave \u201cthe intensity of the hat shop\u201d. So she sold her business and accepted Silverman\u2019s offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">She testified that Silverman orally promised that if she remained in his employ until she reached the age of 62 or until his death, whichever event occurred first, then she would receive a pension of $300 per month for the remainder of her life and, in addition, would be furnished a residence for the same period of time, all expenses connected with the residence to be paid by him or his estate during the period of her occupancy. The plaintiff\u2019s duties involved working full time at defendant\u2019s place of business as an office manager and acting as his housekeeper, which included cooking his meals and cleaning his residence. Initially her salary was set at $400 per month, but in 1965 it was increased to $600 per month and remained at that rate until her final termination in June of 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">In 1965, Silverman purchased a residence in McLean in the name of the defendant corporation. He, Mrs. Bernot, and her daughter lived there for about two years. During the period, Mrs. Bernot paid rent to the corporation of $200 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">In 1967, her employment was terminated by defendant for the first time. She was forced to vacate the McLean residence. She then purchased her own home in Annandale and moved there in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>May of 1967. Shortly thereafter, defendant asked plaintiff to resume her employment, stating \u201che would honor all his commitments\u201d to her. She agreed; thereafter they continued to occupy separate residences.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">In 1967, defendant showed her the rough draft of a will which contained a provision that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">\u201cMarietta Bernot is to receive a life-time income of $300.00 per month. In addition she is to have the life-time right to occupy premises and enjoy all of the furnishings therein, located at [the McLean address] and all expenses of maintenance, taxes, utilities etc are to be paid by the Trustees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Silverman executed a will in November of 1968 containing the foregoing clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">During her employment, plaintiff, repeatedly asked defendant to inform her about the provisions he had made to secure her retirement benefits and each time defendant answered: \u201cJust trust me\u201d. She testified that the execution of the will was \u201cthe first tangible evidence that something had been done.\u201d Then in 1970, defendant handed plaintiff a bank receipt which indicated that a $50,000 bond had been purchased in her name, although up to the time of trial she had not realized any profit or interest from that security.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">In 1972, \u201c[t]he personal relationship\u201d of the parties ended, although she continued in his employ performing the same duties. In December of that year, Silverman assaulted her in his McLean home. In January of 1973, he again struck her in his office during business hours. From January to May of 1973, when defendant underwent major surgery, plaintiff was \u201cfired\u201d on two occasions. Each time, upon his request, she returned because she \u201cwas afraid to be out of work\u201d and she \u201cwas afraid about losing my benefits with Mr. Silverman\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">Then in June of 1973, during an argument in Silverman\u2019s home, while she was preparing his evening meal, he again terminated her employment. When he later asked her to \u201ccome back,\u201d she refused. She testified: \u201c[B]y then I was really afraid of him. I was afraid of his violence. I couldn\u2019t go back after that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aru\">Plaintiff, thereafter, attempted to support herself by selling real estate, without much success. So in 1974, she went to Silverman to determine whether \u201che was going to honor these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>commitments.\u201d When he refused to do so, this action ensued in November of 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The trial court ruled that the contract of employment asserted by the plaintiff was not required to be in writing. The court, therefore, submitted to the jury, in addition to the issue of damages, the question whether the plaintiff had established the contract (the evidence was in direct conflict, Silverman denying the existence of any such agreement) and, if so, whether defendant had breached it or whether plaintiff had resigned her employment without just cause. The verdict of the jury has, of course, settled the disputed issues of fact and fixed the terms of the contract; remaining for decision is a question of law requiring the construction of the agreement, that is, whether the contract was within the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Defendants contend, and we agree, that the crucial inquiry is whether this contract could be fully performed on either side within a year from the making thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">When it appears by the whole tenor of an agreement not in writing that it is to be performed after the first year, then the contract is within the statute and must be in writing. <em>Seddon </em>v. <em>Rosenbaum, </em>85 Va. 928, 931, 9 S.E. 326, 327 (1889). But when by its terms, or by reasonable construction, such a contract can be fully performed on one side within a year, although it can be done by the occurrence of some improbable event, as the death of the person referred to, the contract is not within the statute and need not be in writing. 85 Va. at 933, 9 S.E. at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">The defendants\u2019 position is that this contract is one for a definite duration, <em>viz., </em>until plaintiff reached the age of 62, subject to an express <em>defeasance, </em>or termination, <em>i.e., </em>Silverman\u2019s death, which may have happened within a year. His death, they contend, would have <em>ended </em>the obligations of the parties and would not have <em>performed </em>the contract. They argue that the statute \u201crequires no writing for an oral contract that is capable of being performed, not terminated, within a year.\u201d They urge that \u201cit is of vital importance to distinguish between promises providing for an alternative form of performance and agreements subject to an express defeasance or cancellation.\u201d The \u201creach\u201d of the statute, continues the argument, \u201cis gauged by the promise intended to be performed and not by those eventualities unrelated to full performance that defeat the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>The defendants\u2019 analysis of the standards to be employed is close to the mark, but we disagree with defendants\u2019 application of those criteria to these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">We construe the agreement to provide, as plaintiff argues, for alternative performances, that is, we think the parties contemplated that the agreement would be fully performed if either (1) the plaintiff remained in Silverman\u2019s employ until she reached the age of 62, or (2) the plaintiff remained in Silverman\u2019s employ until his death. Silverman\u2019s need and desire to have Mrs. Bernot serve him would have been completely fulfilled if she performed for the duration of his life. Accordingly, since the death of the employer could have occurred within the first year of the agreement, the contract is not within the so-called <em>\u201cinfra annum\" </em>provision of the statute of frauds and need not be in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The distinction between termination (defeasance) by operation of law, as urged by the defendants, and completion by performance, as correctly advocated by the plaintiff, is aptly stated in 2 Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 447, at 556 (1950) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">\u201c[I]n service cases it is generally recognized that termination of duty by operation of law is not identical with performance of a promise. The death of a party may terminate duty; but the contemplated work has not been done. <em>It is othenrise if the parties have themselves agreed upon the limitation as one of the terms of the agreement that, created the duty.\" </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Here the parties have expressly delineated the duration of the contract in terms of the life of the employer, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthe parties have themselves agreed upon the limitation as one of the terms of the agreement.. ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">The conclusion we reach is not only dictated by the pertinent Virginia decisions, relied on by the plaintiff, but is consistent with the reasoning employed in the cases from other jurisdictions cited by the defendants. In <em>Seddon </em>v. <em>Rosenbaum, supra, </em>the parties agreed that the defendant would sell the plaintiff 250 shares of stock \u2018 \u201cat the end of 3 years at 96. Stock may be called at 96 at any time before expiration of 3 yrs.\u2019 \u201d 85 Va. 929, 9 S.E. at 327. The promise bargained for was the sale of the stock at 96. The alternatives for performance were sale at 96 at the end of three years or sale at 96 upon call within a year. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Thus the contract was held not to fall within the <em>\u201cinfra annum \" </em>provision of the statute. Fulfillment, not annulment, could occur withfn a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">In <em>Thomas </em>v. Armstrong, 86 Va. 323, 10 S.E. 6 (1889), Miss Thomas promised to come and live with Mrs. Rusmiselle and be her servant upon Mrs. Rusmiselle\u2019s promise to provide for Miss Thomas\u2019 support when she died. In the course of deciding that this oral contract should be enforced, this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-6\">\u201cThe contracts contemplated by the statute, are such as, by their terms, are postponed beyond a year; but when the agreement is to be performed upon a contingency, and it does not appear within the agreement that it is to be performed after the year, then writing is not necessary, for the contingency might happen within the year. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-7\">\u201cThis contract was fully performed by Miss Thomas, who went to live with Mrs. Rusmiselle, and assumed the position contracted for on her part; its full performance on both sides was not postponed beyond the year, but was contingent upon the death of Mrs. Rusmiselle, which might have happened within the year. It is not, therefore, such a contract as is not to be performed within the year by its terms, and so was not required by the statute to be in writing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">86 Va. at 326, 10 S.E. at 7. <em>See also Glasgow </em>v. Peatross, 201 Va. 43, 109 S.E.2d 135 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">In contrast, in <em>Lee's Adm'r </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>87 Va. 497, 12 S.E. 1052 (1891), a contract not in writing provided for the plaintiff to serve for one year as a solicitor for the defendant\u2019s business at a monthly salary of $100. The agreement, made in August to commence the following October, was held to be within the statute because it was made for one year\u2019s service and was, therefore, not capable of being fully performed within a year. The parties there had specifically agreed that the employee\u2019s promise could only be performed by service for the full one year, a factor which distinguishes that case from the case at bar. In <em>Hill, </em>the implied contingency of the employee\u2019s death within a year, a circumstance inherent in every employment contract for personal services, would only have terminated the contract and would not have performed it. Here, an express provision dealt with the incident of death (albeit the demise of the employer, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>the employee), which would have resulted in performance, not termination, of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Similarly in <em>Wagniere </em>v. <em>Dunnell, </em>29 R.I. 580, 73 A. 309 (1909), relied on by the defendants, the agreement held to be within the statute was to employ the plaintiff at a compensation of $50 per week for three years from the date of the contract \u201c \u2018or for so much of such three (3) years as your results show the ability that you now claim to be able to give me [the defendant].\u2019 \u201d 29 R.I. at 581, 73 A. at 310. This was an agreement to employ plaintiff for three years or for so long not exceeding three years as plaintiff demonstrated the ability he claimed to have. Thus the latter alternative could only be fulfilled within a year if the employee failed to perform according to his representations or if either party was unwilling to comply with the contract. There, the alternative could only have been fulfilled within a year upon a breach by one of the parties. But here, Silverman\u2019s death, as we have said, would constitute full performance and not a breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Likewise, in <em>Gilliam </em>v. Kouchoucos. 161 Tex. 299, 340 S.W.2d 27 (1960), also relied upon by the employer, an oral contract of employment for the term of ten years was held to be within the statute where it was agreed that \u201c \u2018this contract and agreement shall, however, terminate on the death of the operator.\u2019 \u201d 161 Tex. at 300, 340 S.W.2d at 27. There, the court refused to construe the defeasance provision with reference to death as equivalent to an alternative form of performance, holding that the contract of employment was for a term of ten years to be terminated, not performed, on the death of the operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">As did the Texas court, we refer to Professor Williston's statement that the thin and technical distinction between the performance of a promise on the one hand, and an excuse for non-performance on the other, implicates the form of the contract as well as its substance. The following illustrations from Williston demonstrate the importance of the contract form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-8\">\u201c1. A promise to serve two years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-9\">\u201c2. A promise to serve as long as the employee lives, not exceeding two years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-10\">\u201c3. A promise to serve two years if the promisor lives so long;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>\u201c4. A promise to serve two years, but if the promisor dies the contract shall be terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-5\">! \u201cIt is obvious that all these promises have substantially the same meaning and, if enforceable, the same legal effect; yet certainly the first promise, and presumably the fourth, are within the Statute, while certainly the second and presumably the third are not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">3 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 499, at 606 (3d ed. 1960). <em>See. </em>Restatement of Contracts \u00a7 198, Comment c (1932); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 198 (Tent. Draft Nos. 1-7, 1973). The Texas court held that <em>Gilliam </em>fell within class 4. The Bernot-Silverman contract falls within class 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The employer also relies on <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Texas and Pacific Railway Co., </em>164 U.S. 418 (1896). In that case, \u201cit was agreed between the parties that if the plaintiff [who was in the lumber business] would grade the ground for a switch, and put on the ties, at a certain point on the defendant\u2019s railroad, the defendant would put down the rails and maintain the switch for the plaintiff\u2019s benefit for shipping purposes as long as he needed it.\u201d 164 U.S. at 418. There, as here, complete performance of the contract depended upon a contingency which might have happened within a year. \u201cIf, within a year after the making of the contract, the plaintiff had died, or had abandoned his whole business at this place, or for any other reason had ceased to need the switch for the shipping of lumber, the railroad company would have been no longer under any obligation to maintain the switch, and the contract would have been brought to an end by having been fully performed.\u201d 164 U.S. at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">For these reasons, the judgment of the trial court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
