Because the lower court had no jurisdiction of the offence attempted to be charged. 8. There is no such court as that to which the complaint purports to be addressed, and which undertook to take jurisdiction and render judgment in the premises, inasmuch as in and by the complaint it is alleged that said \u2018 Dorchester District Court was and is holden at said district for the transaction of criminal business within the county of Suffolk,\u2019 whereas said court has only jurisdiction of a fractional portion of the county of Suffolk. ... 5. There is no proper and sufficient averment of any intent illegally to sell said intoxicating liquors within the Dorchester district. 6. There is no proper sufficient negation of license, authority, or appointment, &amp;c. 7. The negation is uncertain, indefinite, and insufficient, inasmuch as it does not appear for any certainty to what the word there \u2019 applies. 8. It does not appear in and by the complaint precisely and clearly that the exposing and keeping was within the county of Suffolk, or outside and beyond the Dorchester district, inasmuch as it is averred that the court has jurisdiction of the whole county of Suffolk, instead of the Dorchester district thereof.\u201d <em>Pitman, </em>J., overruled the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-9\">At the trial, there was evidence- tending to show that the defendant kept a grocery store in a building numbered 1175 on Dorchester Avenue in the Dorchester district in the city of Boston; and that his tenement consisted partly of two rooms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>on the first floor of the building, one of which was occupied by him as such store, and the other adjoined it as a kitchen. One Perry, a police officer, was permitted to testify, against the objection of the defendant, that he visited the defendant\u2019s premises on the day in question together with two other officers; but finding the store closed, they went into the kitchen, and there saw seven men, five sitting around a table and two standing up, and that he saw the wife of the defendant have two bottles of what he called lager beer under her apron, and that he took one from her, and the other she broke over the stove.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-6\"><em>G.
