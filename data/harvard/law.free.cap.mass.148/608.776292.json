And the plaintiff says the defendant owes him one hundred eighty-two and dollars for money received by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-6\">\u201c Second Count. And the plaintiff says that on or about the seventeenth day of April, A. D. 1886, he bought of the defendant a certain horse, and paid the defendant therefor the sum of one hundred eighty-two and dollars; that the defendant then warranted said horse to be sound and kind on delivery by a written warranty, as will appear in the bill of sale therefor, a copy of which is hereto annexed. And the plaintiff further says, that the defendant gave him until four o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the following Monday to try said horse; that the plaintiff tried said horse, and found him to be unsound at the time of said purchase, in consequence whereof the plaintiff returned said horse to the defendant during the forenoon of said following Monday, and rescinded said sale. And the plaintiff says that in consideration of the foregoing premises the defendant owes him the sum of one hundred eighty-two and dollars, the price paid for said horse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-7\">\u201c Third Count. The plaintiff, being in doubt as to whether to declare in contract or in tort, hereto adds the following count as and for a count in tort, being for one and the same cause of action as the first or second count. And the plaintiff says that on or about April 17th, A. D. 1886, he attended the defendant\u2019s auction for the sale of horses at the rooms of the defendant, where the defendant put up a certain horse, representing him to be a little sore forward, and the plaintiff then and there bid upon said horse, and said horse was knocked off to the plaintiff for the sum of one hundred eighty-two and dollars; that before the plaintiff paid for said horse he required the defendant to warrant said horse sound and kind, which the defendant did by a written warranty, as will appear in the bill of sale thereof, a copy whereof is hereto annexed; that the defendant gave the plaintiff until four o\u2019clock of the Monday following to try said horse; that the plaintiff took said horse and tried him, and found him not sound, but wholly unsound and valueless to the plaintiff, in that he was foundered, in consequence whereof the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>plaintiff during the forenoon of said following Monday returned said horse to the defendant, and rescinded said sale; but the \u25a0 defendant wholly refused to take said horse, or to give back to the plaintiff the purchase money. And the plaintiff says that,' if said horse had been as represented by the defendant, said horse by his appearance would have been worth to the plaintiff the sum of three hundred dollars. In consequence of the foregoing premises, the plaintiff says that by the loss of the purchase of such a horse as said horse was represented to be by the defendant, and the taking of said horse to the plaintiff\u2019s stable, and the return thereof to the defendant\u2019s stable, and the care of said horse, and the annoyance and vexation of rescinding said sale, he has suffered great damage, to wit, the sum of four hundred dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-5\">A copy of the written warranty annexed to the second and third counts of the declaration was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-6\">\u201c Boston, April 17, 1886.

Subsequently, upon a further examination of the declaration, the presiding judge stated to the plaintiff that his construction of the declaration then was, that the first and third counts referred to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>second count, and that he should rule that the plaintiff was limited in his right to recover to the written warranty set forth in his second count; and the plaintiff thereupon acquiesced in that ruling. Before the judge had ruled that the plaintiff must be confined to his count upon the written warranty, the plaintiff offered in evidence an advertisement, published in the Boston Globe, of the proposed sale of a lot of horses, among which was the horse in question, which advertisement was admitted, against the defendant\u2019s objection, and so far as material was as follows: \u201cAuction Sale. By J. C. Richardson, Combination Sale Stables, . . . Boston. Special and positive sale on Saturday, April 17, at 10.30 o\u2019clock A. M., sharp, of two carloads of Canada and one carload of Illinois horses, just arrived. . . . Any one in want of first-class reliable stock should not fail to attend this sale, as in all our sales we never withdraw a horse when offered, and each and every horse will be warranted as represented, or money refunded, and a satisfactory trial given. ... We shall also receive on Saturday morning one carload of extra-fine driving, drought, saddle, family, and general purpose horses, . . . and will offer them at 12.30 P. M., sharp, consisting of . . . Nos. 17 and 18, pair of chestnut horses, seven and eight years old, fifteen and three tenths hands; two thousand six hundred and thirty pounds; extra broke, single or double; a first-class team for farm, express, or general business use. Henry S. Harris, Auctioneer.\u201d No question was made as to the identity of the advertisement, nor that it was inserted by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-5\">After the ruling confining him to the second count, the defendant objected to the reading of the advertisement, and to comments by plaintiff\u2019s counsel upon its materiality, and asked the judge to rule it out, now that the first and second counis were out of the case; but the judge refused to exclude it, and the defendant did not except to this refusal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-6\">The plaintiff then testified, in substance, that, in consequence of having seen the advertisement, he attended the sale; that, when the horse in question was led up to the auctioneer\u2019s stand, the defendant said, \u201c This horse appears a little sore forward \u201d; that the auctioneer read an advertisement identical with that seen by the plaintiff, and said, \u201c This is No. 17, what will you bid for him, gentlemen?\u201d that the horse was knocked down to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>him for $182.50; that after paying fifteen dollars to the clerk, as a deposit, he received from him an unreceipted bill, at which he looked, and saw that he had credit for that amount; and that, about fifteen or twenty minutes later, he <em>\u201c </em>started towards the clerk\u2019s desk, and told him I guess I would take my horse, drawing my bills from my pocket, and asking him what kind of a warranty I was going to get with this horse. The clerk takes the bill from me, and wrote in on it, \u2014 was writing in on it, \u2014 and I turned to the auctioneer, and I says, \u2018 This horse is a good worker ? \u2019 Of course he is a good worker.\u2019 \u2018 How long a trial will I have ? \u2019 \u2018 Until four o\u2019clock, Monday.\u2019 Then the clerk points to what he had written in as the warranty, the words, \u2018 Sound and kind on delivery.\u2019 Then he receipted the bill, and reached it to me, and I paid him the balance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-7\">The plaintiff further testified, that, after taking the horse home, he discovered it to be unsound, and that, in consequence thereof, on the following Monday he returned it to the defendant, who refused to take it back, whereupon the plaintiff left it in the defendant\u2019s stable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-8\">The defendant testified that he first saw the receipted bill on the Monday after the sale ; that he did not authorize any one to write \u201c Warranted sound and kind on delivery \u201d in it; that at the time of the sale he said to the auctioneer, and to the crowd, \u201c This horse is sore, and we will withdraw the warranty, and sell him for unsound.\u201d On cross-examination the defendant testified that the warranty alluded to as withdrawn was that contained in the advertisement relating to the pair, Nos. 17 and 18; that the clerk had written warranties in other bills of sale of horses when told to do so by him, and that it was his business to do so; that the bookkeeper kept the boobs, and the account of the sales, made the bills of sale, and collected the bills; that he, the defendant, was not always present in the auction-room within ready reach of the auctioneer or the clerk at all times during the <em>sale; </em>that if he was not there, and the clerk knew that the horse was sold with a warranty, he would have the right to put that in the bill of sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-9\">John D. Rust, called by the defendant, testified that, at the time of the sale, he was the defendant\u2019s bookkeeper; that the words \u201c Warranted sound and kind on delivery\u201d were written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>by him a few minutes after the bill was receipted, and the balance of the price was paid by the plaintiff in consequence of plaintiff\u2019s stating to him, \u201c Mr. Richardson said this horse was warranted, and being warranted to be put on the bill\u201d; and that he had no authority from the defendant to warrant this horse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-5\">The defendant asked the judge to rule, among other things not material, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-6\"><em>\u201c </em>When the horse was knocked down to the plaintiff by the auctioneer for the sum bid, the plaintiff being the highest bidder therefor, the contract was complete, and if the insertion of the words \u2018 Warranted sound and kind on delivery \u2019 was made in the bill without the defendant\u2019s consent, such bill would not bind the defendant as and for a warranty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-7\">The judge refused so to rule, and instructed the jury, among other things not excepted to, after reading the bill of sale containing the alleged warranty, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-8\">\u201c The parties agree that the horse was bought. It is not in dispute that this paper was delivered to the plaintiff, but the defendant comes in and says, in the first place, that this paper was no part of the transaction, that it was delivered after the contract was made, and therefore is not binding upon the defendant, because he was not paid anything for it. On that, gentlemen, I instruct you, as matter of law, that if, before the money was paid and the horse delivered, a question arose among the parties as to what should be the form of the warranty, and it was settled by writing in these words, \u2018Warranted sound and kind on delivery,\u2019 and that was a part 6f the understanding under which the money was paid by the plaintiff to the defendant, then it was a part of the trade, notwithstanding the fact that you may find that there bad been no actual agreement to warrant before that time. If, however, after the trade was completed, not only by the agreement upon the terms of the sale, but if the horse had been delivered and the money had been paid, and this putting in here was an afterthought, and the defendant was not bound by the agreement of the sale to insert it, but everything had been done, and then that was put in, the money paid, horse transferred, no question about warranty, but the defendant chose to put that in afterwards, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>it was no part of the contract, and he is not bound by it. The sale is not complete .by the agreement of the terms of the sale, it must be carried out by the payment of the money, or the consideration, whether money or otherwise, \u2014 in this case by the payment of the money, and by the delivery of the horse, \u2014 and if, before that had been done, a question having arisen, if it did arise, as to what kind of a warranty, if anything, the plaintiff should have, and upon that arising this was done, then it is a warranty that is a part of the sale.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b632-6\"><em>S. J. Thomas &amp; L. M. Clark, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b632-7\"><em>H. E. </em>Swasey, <em>(J. V.

Subsequently, the court ruled that the plaintiff \u201c was limited in his right to recover to the written warranty set forth in his second count,- and the plaintiff thereupon acquiesced in that ruling.\u201d Before this ruling was made, the plaintiff had put in evidence, against the objection of the defendant, an advertisement, which the defendant had caused to be published in a newspaper, of the proposed sale of a lot of horses, in which was. included the horse bought by the plaintiff. After the plaintiff was confined by the ruling to the second count, the defendant asked the court to exclude the evidence of the advertisement\u201d, but the court refused, and the exceptions state thatthe defendant did not except to this refusal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">The complaint of the defendant is, that, on a correct construction of the whole declaration, the advertisement ought never to have been admitted in evidence. It is conceded that, if the foundation of the action had been, not a breach of a written warranty, but fraudulent misrepresentations, the advertisement would have been admissible; but it is said that the action proceeded solely on the ground that the plaintiff had rescinded the sale on account of the breach of a written warranty, and that evidence of the advertisement could not be introduced for the purpose of enlarging or varying the written contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>The bill of sale of the horse contained the words, \u201c Warranted sound and kind on delivery,\u201d and was signed in the name of the defendant by his bookkeeper. The plaintiff had bid off the horse at an auction held by the defendant, at which the advertisement had been read as containing the terms on which the horses were to be sold. The defendant\u2019s bookkeeper, after the horse had been struck off to the plaintiff, required him to make a deposit of fifteen dollars, and he gave to the plaintiff an unreceipted bill of sale of the horse, containing the price, with a credit of fifteen dollars. Apparently the sale was for cash. The testimony of the plaintiff tends to show that, before the horse was delivered to him, he offered to pay the remainder of the price to the bookkeeper, and asked the bookkeeper what kind of warranty he was to have, and that the bookkeeper took the bill of sale, wrote in the words warranting the horse, received the plaintiff\u2019s money, receipted the bill in the name of the defendant, and delivered it to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">One question in the case was whether the bookkeeper was authorized by the defendant to give a written warranty; and besides the evidence of his authority generally, there was distinct evidence that he had authority from the defendant to give a written warranty if the horse had been sold with an oral warranty. The advertisement in connection with the other testimony tended to show that the horse was sold with some kind of a warranty, and that therefore the bookkeeper was authorized to give a written warranty in behalf of the defendant. Besides, if the horse was sold with an oral warranty that he was sound and kind, the insertion of these words in the bill of sale had only the effect of making the written paper conform to the actual contract. <em>Spalding </em>v. Conant, 146 Mass. 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The next exception argued is to the refusal to rule that, \u201c when the horse was knocked down to the plaintiff by the auctioneer, for the sum bid, the plaintiff being the highest bidder therefor, the contract was complete\u201d; and the contention is, that the insertion of the warranty in the bill of sale after this would not bind the defendant, even if made by his authority, because there would be no consideration to support it. Upon this question the instructions of the court were correct. Those instructions were, in substance, that if, before the money was paid and the horse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>was delivered, the question arose between the parties as to the form of the warranty to be given, and the parties agreed that these words of warranty should be written into the bill of sale as a part of the contract, and they were so written in, and the money was then paid and the horse delivered, the warranty would rest upon a good consideration, and would bind the defendant ; but that if, after the horse had been delivered and the money paid, the warranty was inserted by the defendant in the bill of sale, and the defendant was not bound by the contract of sale to insert it, but he voluntarily chose to put it in, then the defendant was not bound by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">We think there was evidence for the jury, not only that the horse was actually sold with the warranty declared on, but also that the bookkeeper had authority from the defendant to give in his behalf a written warranty of a horse sold by him. These are all the exceptions argued by the counsel for the defendant, and the entry must be, <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
