The declaration of the plaintiff contained the following allegations: \u201c And the plaintiff says the defendant executed to it a bond,\u201d which was annexed to the declaration, and of which the following, to which no seals were attached, is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AiC\">\u201c Know all men by these presents: that we, E. Ernest Caduc, of Hyde Park, Norfolk County, Mass., as principal, and Sarah T. Bacon, of Boston, Mass., George P. Bates, of Boston, Mass., Thomas H. Bacon, of Brookline, Norfolk County, Mass., as sureties, are holden and stand firmly bound unto the Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Company, a corporation duly established by law, in the sum of twenty thousand dollars, to the payment of which to the said corporation or its assigns we hereby jointly and severally bind ourselves, our heirs, executors, and administrators, according to the amounts set against our respective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>names. The condition of the obligation is such that whereas the said E. Ernest Caduc has been duly elected treasurer of the above named corporation, and has accepted said office, now, therefore, if the said E. Ernest Caduc shall faithfully perform and discharge all the duties of said office during the term for which he has-been elected, and during such further time as he may continue to hold said office, whether by re-election or otherwise, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise it shall be and remain in full force and virtue. In witness whereof, we hereunto set our hands and seals this twenty-ninth day of May, A. D. 1879. Sarah T. Bacon, for five thousand dollars, George P. Bates, for five thousand dollars, Thomas H. Bacon, for ten thousand dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-3\">\u201c And the plaintiff says, that E. Ernest Caduc, named in said bond, did not faithfully perform and discharge all the duties of his office as treasurer of the plaintiff corporation, as stipulated in said bond, but said Caduc received as such treasurer, and converted to his own use, divers large sums of money and divers articles of personal property of the plaintiff corporation, more particularly stated \u201d in a schedule annexed, \u201c to the value of more than fifteen thousand dollars. And so the plaintiff is entitled to recover of defendant the sum of ten thousand dollars, with interest thereon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-4\">The defendant demurred to the declaration, on the ground that it did not set forth a legal cause of action, \u201c for that it does not appear in said declaration that the principal ever signed or entered into the written obligation or bond upon which it is sought to hold the defendant as his surety.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-5\">The Superior Court sustained the demurrer, and ordered judgment for the defendant j and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b561-6\"><em>H. </em>N. Sheldon, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b561-7\"><em>J.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alq\">The only question is as to the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration. The averment that the defendant executed to it a bond is in the form given in the statutes for a declaration upon a bond, and implies a delivery of the bond to the plaintiff. Pub. Sts. c. 167, \u00a7 94, Schedule of Forms. The bond is a several obligation. If the defendant, knowing that Caduc had not signed it as principal, but intending never<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>theless to be himself bound as surety, executed the bond and delivered it as it is, as and for his bond, he may be held liable upon it. Caduc was liable without a bond. <em>Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. </em>v. <em>Caduc, </em>144 Mass. 85. The declaration imports a state of facts which, if proved, will entitle the plaintiff to recover. Her<em>rick </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>11 Met. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The objection that the defendant\u2019s signature was not under seal was not specified in the demurrer, and is not now open. Pub. Sts., c. 167, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and demurrer overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
