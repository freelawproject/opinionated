The injury in each case was alleged to be to the plaintiff and to the occupants of her premises in her and their comfort and enjoyment thereof, and to the plaintiff\u2019s reversionary interest therein. Writs dated September 17, 1887, and December 22, 1887.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Laihrop, </em>J., it appeared in evidence that the defendant and the plaintiff were the owners of adjoining estates in Newburyport; that the fence was erected by the defendant in 1881, before the plaintiff, or her husband, under whom she claimed, acquired any title to her estate ; and that the other structure, or building as it was claimed to be by the defendant, though framed to some extent into the fence, was wholly on land of the defendant, and was erected after the date of the writ in the first case and before the date of the writ in the second; but there was no evidence that the defendant had ever made any repairs, performed any labor, or done anything upon the fence after it was erected in 1881, except that the other structure, or building, was erected as above stated, and it did not appear that what was done to the fence in the erection of this structure or building was done for the purpose of keeping up or repairing the fence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-8\">The plaintiff admitted that neither she nor any member of her family had ever occupied her estate, and that it had always been occupied by tenants. There was no evidence of any injury to the plaintiff or her tenants, except what, might have been gathered upon a view by the jury of the premises, made at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the request of the plaintiff. The plaintiff contended that this was sufficient to entitle her to go to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\">The judge ruled that the statute was constitutional; but being of the opinion that, assuming that there was evidence to go to the jury that the fence was maintained unnecessarily exceeding six feet in height, and that it was maliciously maintained for the purpose of annoying the owner of the adjoining property, yet the statute did not mean personal annoyance where the owner was not in occupation of the property, also ruled that the plaintiff, it appearing that her estate was occupied solely by tenants, was not entitled to maintain the actions; and directed a verdict for the defendant in each case, and reported the cases for the determination of this court upon the following questions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-6\">\u201c1. Is the statute on which these actions are brought constitutional ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-7\">\u201c 2. Can the plaintiff, not being in occupation of said adjoining property, maintain either action ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-8\">\u201c 3. Can the plaintiff recover in the first action, or on the first count in the second action, without proof that the defendant did something more to maintain the fence than merely to permit it to remain after it was built ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-9\">\u201c 4. Can the plaintiff recover, without proof of injury to the reversion, other than that which might have been gathered from a view ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-10\">If the rulings were right, judgments were to be entered on the verdicts ; otherwise, new trials were to be granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-11\"><em>W. H. Niles &amp; G. J. </em>Carr, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-12\"><em>H. I. Bartlett, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b427-13\">Holmes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHh\">These are both actions under St. of 1887, c. 348. We have decided that the statute is constitutional in <em>Rideout </em>v. <em>Knox, ante, </em>368. The plaintiff had never occupied the premises, and there was no evidence of any injury to her or to her tenants, except what the jury may have gathered from a view. The judge ruled that as it appeared that the plaintiff\u2019s estate was occupied solely by tenants, she was not entitled to recover, and directed verdicts for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">Notwithstanding the use of the word \u201c nuisance,\u201d \u00a7 1 of the statute in no sense creates an easement in favor of the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>land, but only makes it unlawful to do malevolently what the defendant still has a right to do from other motives. This right of action is given by \u00a7 2 to an \u201c owner or occupant, injured either in his comfort or the enjoyment of his estate by such nuisance.\u201d This means, we think, that the owners may have an action under some circumstances, although not in occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">This action is for causing personal annoyance for the sake of annoying, and to attempt to answer the question whether the annoyance suffered is within the act, by deciding whether there is an injury to the reversion by the principles of the common law, is likely to mislead. We agree that the comfort or enjoyment which must be enjoyed must be comfort or enjoyment in the use of the premises, and that it is not enough that an owner not in occupation is disturbed in his mind when he thinks about the fence. But we are of opinion that such an owner might suffer an actionable injury. If the fence was likely to diminish his rents, or to make it more difficult to get tenants, the injury to his comfort or the enjoyment of his estate on account of that reasonable anticipation would be within the act. The jury might be able to say upon a view that the fence would have that effect. What they see is evidence in the case. <em>Parks </em>v. Boston, 15 Pick. 198, 209. <em>Tully </em>v. <em>Fitchburg </em>Railroad, 134 Mass. 499, 503. <em>Hanks </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany </em>Railroad, 147 Mass. 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">If the motives for allowing the fence to stand are malicious, as explained in <em>Rideout </em>v. Knox, the defendant may be liable, although he has done no act upon it since the passage of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">\n<em>New trials granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
