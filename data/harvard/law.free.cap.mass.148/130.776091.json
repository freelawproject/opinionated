Upon cross-examination, he testified that he could not tell what money he threw down; that he did not look at it; that it might have been a cent or a button; that he asked the woman for some \u201c hard stuff,\u201d and that she brought him the glass of rum; that he did not see the defendant there on the premises, but that the woman said, \u201c I will call my husband if you wish to see him, he is in the next room\u201d; that he told her that he did not; and that he did not hear any answer from the defendant when she did call, as he thought she did. The judge refused to rule, as requested by the defendant, that there was not sufficient evidence to warrant a verdict of guilty, and, against the defendant\u2019s objection, instructed the jury, that, if they should find that the wife sold the rum as the agent of her husband, the defendant, they could find him guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-3\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-4\"><em>J.

This argument would be proper before the jury, and on a motion for a new trial; but the direct testimony of O\u2019Brien, if believed, was sufficient to warrant a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\"><em>2. </em>The points that there was no evidence that the sale testified to in the Superior Court was the same that was testified to in the District Court, and that the woman referred to by O\u2019Brien was the defendant\u2019s wife, were not taken at the trial, and are not open now.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">B.
