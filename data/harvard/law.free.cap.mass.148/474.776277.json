Sts. c. 112, \u00a7 133, to the Superior Court, for a jury to revise the award of a special commission appointed under \u00a7 131 to apportion among other things the cost of altering a railroad crossing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-9\">At the trial, before Brigham., C. J., it appeared that a special commission, which was duly appointed after the county commissioners had duly decided that the alterations were necessary, and had prescribed the manner and limits within which the same should be made, had filed an award determining that the railroad company should carry the decision of the county commissioners into effect, and apportioning the cost thereof between it, the county of Middlesex, and the city of Newton. The jury returned a verdict increasing the proportion of the charges and expenses to be borne by the railroad company; and a motion was duly made to set aside the verdict, so far as the apportionment was concerned, because \u201c 1. There was no warrant in law for such apportionment by the jury,\u201d and \u201c 2. There was no fact found by the special commissioners relative to such apportionment which could be revised by the jury.\u201d The judge overruled the motion; and the petitioner alleged exceptions. The respondents also alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-10\"><em>S. </em>Hoar, for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-11\"><em>C.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIrl\">The contention of the petitioner is, that the award of the special commission was final, in respect to the apportionment between the county, city, and railroad company of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>the expenses of making the alteration. This depends upon the construction of the statute giving the right to apply for a jury. No such question could have arisen under the St. of 1878, c. 175, \u00a7 2, which provided that \u201c any party affected by said award may . . . apply to said court for a jury to revise and determine any matter of fact or issue relating to the determination and award of said special commissioners as to the party by whom the charges and expenses occasioned by making such alterations and all future charges for keeping in repair such crossing and the approaches thereto, as well as all costs of the application to the county commissioners, or of the hearing before said special commissioners, shall be borne, or as to the apportionment of all or any of such charges between the railroad corporation and the town, city or county in which said crossing is situated.\u201d The provision upon this subject is expressed in the Pub. Sts. c. 112, \u00a7 133, as follows: \u201c A party aggrieved by said award may . . . apply to the court for a jury to revise and determine any matter of fact found therein\u201d; and the specification of particulars contained in the earlier statute is omitted. But the meaning is the same. One object in consolidating and arranging the statutes was to reject superfluous words, and to condense into as concise and comprehensive a form as is consistent with a full and clear expression of the will of the Legislature all circuitous, tautological, and ambiguous phraseology. Resolve of 1880, c. 46. We find in the above section of the Public Statutes no intention to change the law, and the general authority which is vested in the jury to revise and determine any- matter of fact found in the award is broad enough to include the apportionment of the cost of making the alterations between the railroad corporation, the county, and the city. The respondents\u2019 exceptions are waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\n<em>Petitioner\u2019s exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
