In December, 1884, the state prison was established at Boston and the Massachusetts reformatory at Concord, subsequent to which the petitioner was removed to the state prison at Boston, by virtue of a warrant of the Governor, issued in pursuance of the St. of 1884, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>c. 255, \u00a7 4.

The petitioner was removed on January 31, 1885, to the reformatory, in pursuance of an order of the board of commissioners of prisons, which recited, among other things, that the removal was by virtue of the St. of 1884, c. 255, and that the superintendent of the reformatory was to receive and keep the petitioner until \u201c discharged in due course of law.\u201d This order was signed, \u201c By order of the Board of Commissioners, W.

On December 23, 1885, by order of the commissioners, a permit to be at liberty during the remainder of his term of sentence was issued to the petitioner, unless the permit before the expiration of the sentence should be revoked or become void. The permit contained no reference in terms to any approval of the Governor and Council, which approval appeared upon the application alone. At a meeting of the commissioners of prisons held on December 20, 1887, it was voted, upon consideration of the prisoner\u2019s conduct, \u201c that his permit be revoked, and that the secretary be directed to issue an order for his arrest and return to the reformatory.\u201d On the same day an order for the petitioner\u2019s arrest and return to the reformatory was issued, which, after reciting the revocation of the permit and commanding the proper officers, in the name of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, to arrest and deliver the petitioner to the superintendent of the reformatory, \u201c to be therein detained according to the terms of his original sentence, as provided in chapter two hundred and fifty-five of the acts of the year one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four,\u201d concluded as follows: \u201cWitness the commissioners of prisons of said Commonwealth, at Boston, this 20th day of December in the year 1887.

On January 31, 1885, under the alleged authority of St. 1884, c. 255, \u00a7 14, he was re-, moved, with the consent of the Governor and Council, from the state prison then at Boston to the reformatory at Concord. At that date, his sentence, as shortened for good behavior, expired on July 23, 1886. Pub. Sts. c. 222, \u00a7 20. On December 24, 1885, he received a permit to be at liberty, under St. 1884, c. 255, \u00a7 33, issued with the approval of the Governor and Council. On December 20,1887, the permit was revoked, and on December 23 the petitioner was arrested. He now applies for a habeas corpus, on the ground that the removal, permit, and arrest were all contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">St. 1884, c. 255, \u00a7 14, purports to authorize the removal. It applies to \u201c any prisoner,\u201d and is not inconsistent with the exclusion of prisoners held on a sentence of five years or more in \u00a7 3, because \u00a7 3 had reference only to the disposition of the prisoners in the first instance, at the time when the state prison was removed from Concord to Boston, and the old state prison building was occupied by the reformatory. The petitioner had been removed to Boston, and the subsequent removal of him back to Concord to the reformatory was within the words of \u00a7 14, and was not affected by \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">It is argued that the act of 1884 could not be applicable to the prisoner, because \u00a7 33 left the granting of permits absolutely to the discretion of the prison commissioners, and this impaired the vested right which he had under Pub. Sts. e. 222, \u00a7 20, to a deduction from the term of his imprisonment. But even if his case was governed by the latter section, his rights were not impaired, because the prisoner had no vested rights under \u00a7 20. It is true that \u00a7 20 contains the words \u201c shall be entitled to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>deduction,\u201d and \u201c shall receive a written permit to be at liberty,\u201d etc. But it goes on, \u201c The board issuing a permit as aforesaid may at any time revoke the same,\u201d and the context shows that there was no limit set upon the discretion of the board. Under the Pub. Sts., as under the St. of 1884, the petitioner\u2019s permit was subject to revocation by the board of prison commissioners without cause shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">These considerations dispose of the main objection to the arrest. An arrest upon the revocation of a revocable release from imprisonment under a sentence, is not subject to the rules which are laid down for arrests under proceedings against persons not yet convicted. See <em>Kennedy\u2019s </em>case, 135 Mass. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The prison commissioners, having revoked the permit, directed their secretary to issue an order for the petitioner\u2019s arrest, which he did. This was not a delegation of power to the secretary, but merely a direction to perform a ministerial duty. The commissioners are not a court, they have no official seal, and there is no requirement in the statutes that their warrant should be under seal. St. 1884, c. 255, \u00a7 34. The same observations apply to their previous warrant for removal. It is expressly provided that this warrant \u201c shall be signed by the secretary of the \u201d board. \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">When the permit was revoked and the petitioner was rearrested, he was held under his original sentence by force of the statute, subject to the plain provision, which does not need interpretation, that \u201c the time between his release upon said permit and his return to the reformatory shall not be taken to be any part of the term of the sentence.\u201d St. 1884, c. 255, \u00a7 34, and Pub. Sts. c. 222, \u00a7 21, are to the same effect, and just the opposite of the provision construed in <em>West\u2019s case, </em>111 Mass. 443. The prisoner received his original sentence, and accepted his permit subject to this liability. See <em>Dolan\u2019s case, </em>101 Mass. 219. The warrant simply incorporates the statute by reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The fact that the permit does not show on its face that it was issued with the approval of the Governor and Council gives to the petitioner no ground for complaint. It is an instrument which enlarges, not one which abridges his liberty, and is not to be governed by the same rules as a warrant for arrest. He accepted it, and took all the benefits of it without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>As we are of opinion that the petitioner has no case on the merits, we have not considered whether habeas corpus would be the proper remedy if his views were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
