At the hearing, before <em>0. </em>Allen, J., it appeared that Thomas Pritchard, Jr. died on November 2, 1865, leaving a will which contained the following provisions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-5\">\u201c 1st.

I give and bequeath to each of my brother and sister not named above ten dollars each.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-11\">\u201c 7th. I give my wife authority at her decease to give to her sister, Mary P.

Pritchard, executrix of this my will, which was wrote by my own hand in the city of Newburyport, this eleventh day of July, in the year eighteen hundred and sixty-four.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-13\">\u201c 9th. In case the estate should exceed the sum named, I give to my wife fifty cents on the dollar, and to my father and brother William the balance, equally divided.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-14\">The widow of the testator died, testate, in April, 1884, and her executor upon the settlement of her estate paid over to the plaintiff six thousand five hundred dollars, that amount being the balance remaining of the sum of fourteen thousand dollars mentioned in the second article of her husband\u2019s will, and constituting the fund in question. Sarah F. Gould, one of the defendants, contended that the reversion of the fund mentioned in the second article of the will was intestate property, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>should be distributed as such, while the other defendants contended that the reversion of that fund was disposed of by the ninth clause of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\">The judge made a decree, which provided, among other things not material, \u201c that the reversion of said fund was intestate property, and should be distributed as such; but, since the widow has already received her share thereof, no part to be paid to the estate of the testator\u2019s widow.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-6\">From this portion of the decree the defendants, except Sarah F. Gould, took an appeal; and the judge reported the case for the consideration of the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-7\"><em>F. H. Pearl, </em>for Sarah F. Gould.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-8\"><em>C. A. Sayward, </em>for the other defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b160-9\">Field, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQU\">The sole question raised by the report in this case is whether the sum of six thousand five hundred dollars, received by the plaintiff as a part of the fourteen thousand dollars mentioned in the second article of the will, is to be distributed as intestate estate, or as property bequeathed by the ninth article of the will. It is not contended that the legal effect of this second article was to give to the widow of the testator, absolutely, this sum of fourteen thousand dollars, and we shall consider only the question raised by the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">The will, after directing that the debts and funeral expenses be paid, disposes of definite sums of money, and by the ninth and last article provides: \u201c In case the estate should exceed the sum named, I give to my wife fifty cents on the dollar, and to my father and brother William the balance, equally divided.\u201d This is not a general residuary clause. We think that the testator intended by this clause to dispose of any excess of his estate over the sums he had already named in his will, and that he did not have in mind or intend to dispose of any part of the fourteen thousand dollars mentioned in the second article. The portion of this sum which the representative of the widow has paid to the plaintiff must be regarded as property undisposed of by the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
