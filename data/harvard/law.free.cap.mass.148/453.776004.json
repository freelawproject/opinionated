J., the following facts were agreed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-3\">On March 5, 1888, the board of aldermen of the city of Lowell, which consists of eight members, passed a vote requiring six of its members to vote in favor of granting licenses to sell intoxicating liquors, and that none should be granted unless six members should assent. At a meeting of the board held on June 5, 1888, at which seven members only were present, the committee on licenses recommended that the defendant\u2019s petition for a fourth class license be granted. Upon the question of granting such a license to him, four members of the board voted in the affirmative and two members in the negative. Upon the following day the defendant tendered the \u25a0requisite fee for a fourth class license, and the bond prescribed by law; and demanded from the city clerk a license of the fourth class, which was refused him. At the time of the complaint the defendant had no license to sell liquors under the fourth class.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-4\">The defendant admitted that he sold the ale not to be drunk upon the premises, but contended that, by the vote of the board of aldermen on June 5, 1888, and that by his tender of the prescribed fee and bond, he was entitled to a fourth class license, and could lawfully do business under that class.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-5\">The judge ruled upon, these facts that no license had been granted or issued to the defendant under which he was authorized to do business; as provided by licenses of the fourth class, and instructed the jury that they would be authorized in finding that the alleged sale of ale, not to be drunk on the premises, was unlawful.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b472-7\"><em>N.

No license of the fourth class was issued to the defendant, signed by the mayor and city clerk; but, further, there was no effective vote of the board of aldermen granting such license. The board, by a vote, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>which has the effect of a standing rule, provided that no licenses should be granted unless six members of the board should assent thereto. This rule, while it is in force and acted upon, determines the effect of any vote upon granting a license, and if, as in the case before us, only four aldermen vote in favor of the applicant, a license is not granted. The ruling of the Superior Court was correct. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
