The cases were tried together in the Superior Court, before Thompson, J., who, after a verdict in each case for the defendant, made upon a bill of exceptions presented to him by the plaintiffs for allowance the following indorsement: \u201c If the exceptions alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 bill were duly saved, then the same are hereby allowed.\u201d This bill, after reciting the evidence introduced at the trial, set out numerous requests in writing for instructions to the jury, which the plaintiffs requested the judge to give, but which the judge refused to give, except so far as they were covered by the instructions given, and proceeded as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-11\">\u201c The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, before the closing arguments, handed to the court the requests for ruling set forth in the plaintiffs\u2019 bill of exceptions, but the attention of the counsel for the defendant was not called to them either by the court or the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. When the presiding justice arose to charge the-jury, he said to the counsel for the plaintiffs in substance as follows: \u2018I think I will charge the jury, and if I do not cover your requests, you can call my attention to the rulings to which you wish to except.\u2019 And the counsel for the plaintiffs motioned with his head assent thereto, and no suggestion was made that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was not satisfied with the charge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The counsel for the plaintiffs has stated to the court that, when he handed his requests to the court, he said, \u2018I wish to \u00abexcept to thq failure of the court to rule as requested.\u2019 The court has no recollection of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel saying anything to him when he handed to him his requests, but will not say that such words were not used by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-5\">S. <em>M. </em>Thomas, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-6\"><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIe\">No exceptions were properly saved at the trial. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, before the closing argument, handed to the court a paper containing many requests for rulings, but the attention of the defendant\u2019s counsel was not called to them either by the court or by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. The presiding justice said to the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, \u201c I will charge the jury, and if I do not cover your requests, you can call my attention to the rulings to which you wish to except.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel assented to this, and after the charge he took no exceptions, and made no suggestion that he was not satisfied with it. He thus waived any exceptions to the charge. If it did not cover his requests, it was his duty to call the attention of the court to such parts of it as he excepted to. It is not material whether he stated to the judge, when he handed to him the requests, that he wished to except if they were not granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The course pursued by the presiding justice was reasonable and proper, designed and calculated to promote the orderly and fair administration of justice, and to secure the rights of both parties. By his assent to it, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel waived any exceptions to the charge, although he may have previously said that he wished to except \"if his requests were not granted. It was his duty, in fairness to the court and to the other side, to point out the particulars in which he was dissatisfied with the charge, thus giving the court an opportunity to correct any unintentional error, and enabling the other party to know what exceptions were taken, and perhaps, by concession, to save some doubtful question of law which has no important bearing in the case. <em>Ela </em>v.
