This conclusion is compelled by our recent decision in <em>Board of Education of Worcester County v. BEKA Industries, Inc., </em>190 Md.App. 668, 989 A.2d 1181 (2010), <em>cert. granted </em>415 Md. 38, 997 A.2d 789 (June 9, 2010) \u2014 decided after this case was argued \u2014 and by Md.Code (1984, 2009 RepLVol.), State Government (SG) Article, \u00a7 12-201. We also reverse for other reasons set forth below and overturn the November 24, 2008 circuit court judgment reflecting the jury verdict of $169,640 in favor of Koba.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Koba is a Maryland corporation that in 2001 operated two nonpublic, licensed secondary special education schools for emotionally and behaviorally disturbed children. Before the two schools merged in August 2002, these facilities were the Focus Point School and the Meadow Brook Education Center in Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">In 2001-02, twelve Baltimore City public school students, who were temporarily housed in a group home, Bethany House in Talbot County, were referred to Koba for educational services. Seven were referred by the Baltimore City Department of Social Services (BCDSS); three by the Baltimore City Public Schools; one by what is now the State Department of Juvenile Services (DJS); and one by the East Baltimore Mental Health Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">When it received a request to place a child from the Baltimore City Public Schools, Koba would send admission and tuition information to the school system, including a query on how the system wanted to handle transportation. One such letter, dated September 17, 2001, to an employee of the City School System involving one of the twelve city students, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">If requested Meadow Brook will arrange for the transportation of [the student] to and from our school at the rate of $80.00 per day. However, you may opt to arrange for separate transportation services from any source. If you elect to have Meadow Brook arrange for transportation, invoices will be sent at the beginning of the month of service and will be submitted separately from invoices for basic educational services.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Under the apparent belief it would be reimbursed for the service, Koba subsequently arranged with the Facility Operation Center of America (FOCA) to provide transportation services to the twelve children and began to receive billings from the subcontractor. Without a written contract with the Board, Koba, in January 2001, started to submit monthly invoices for each student\u2019s education to the Baltimore City School System. In addition, it sent separate bills for each student\u2019s transportation services primarily to BCDSS, with a copy to the City School System.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The School System apparently received the invoices, because, for the next nine months, it paid Koba at the $80/day rate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Then, it began to question whether the Board was obligated to pay for transportation services to students temporarily living in Talbot County. In September, 2001, Veronica Washington, Coordinator of the City School System\u2019s Office of Nonpublic Services, wrote in a letter to BCDSS that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\">1. Talbot County will not transport these students to Anne Arundel County;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>2. The placement of the special needs students \u201cwas done without collaboration with BCDSS;\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">3. In the 2001-02 school year, the City School System \u201cwill not pay to transport their students from the Bethany House to Anne Arundel County.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Koba was not sent a copy of this letter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">In November 2001, Koba\u2019s contact with the School System, Edie Tress, orally informed the school that as of December 1, 2001, the School System would not pay for the transportation services. The City School System sent out the last 2001 check in December.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Koba continued to arrange for transportation of the children and to bill for the services. For fleeting brief periods in 2002 and 2003, the School System paid Koba additional amounts. On August 15, 2002, the City School System sent Koba a check for $3,040 covering two November 30, 2001 invoices and, on August 31, 2003, it sent Koba a check that included $1,120 in transportation costs in response to a July 31, 2003 invoice. According to evidence in the record, this last invoice related to transportation for a single student from July 14, 2003 to July 31, 2003. The last unpaid invoices were dated July 7, 2003, for transportation of five students in June of 2003. No more transportation payments were forthcoming. During this entire period, Koba billed and was paid for providing educational services. On February 9, 2004, Koba\u2019s president made a final written demand to the school system for payment of the transportation costs, a demand that was obviously rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>After failing in attempts to seek the intervention of the Maryland State Department of Education and others<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and to invoke the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Koba filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on July 6, 2006. After some initial procedural skirmishing, Koba, on March 26, 2007, filed a First Amended Complaint, advancing two counts: 1) breach of statutory obligation; and 2) unjust enrichment. In response, the Board filed a two-page boilerplate answer, raising twenty-five defenses, including limitations and immunity. After another flurry of motions, the statutory claim fell out and the case went to trial before a jury on the unjust enrichment count.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Central to Koba\u2019s unjust enrichment claim was an alleged violation by the Board of Md.Code (1978, 2008 Repl.Vol.), Education (ED) Article \u00a7 8-410(b)(l), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the local school system of the county in which the child with a disability resides shall certify and pay the cost of his daily or other reasonable transportation to school under the rules and regulations adopted by the State Board if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">(i) The school is outside this State or the county in which the child resides; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">(ii) State aid has provided for the education of the child under this subtitle.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Koba contended that because the disabled children \u201cresided\u201d, <em>ie. </em>were domiciled in Baltimore City, the statute obliged the Board to pay transportation costs to a school, like Koba, that was outside the City. The Board countered, in the words of its sole witness, Ms. Washington, that under \u00a7 8-410(b)(l), \u201cwhere ... student[s] [are] in temporary residence[,] where they lay their heads on ... the night before, [that] county is responsible for transportation costs.\u201d Thus, the Board argued that the Talbot County Board, not the City School System, was under a duty to pay transportation costs for the twelve city students.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The parties also clashed over how the Board was \u201cenriched\u201d or benefitted by Koba\u2019s services. Koba asserted that State funds were provided to the Board to pay for transportation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>disabled students, a total of $15 million for the 2002-03 school year. The Board responded that each year\u2019s State transportation grant was based on a headcount of students transported the year before and that, because the twelve students were not included in any count, the Board received no reimbursement for their transportation and no benefit from Koba\u2019s Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">On November 20, 2008, the jury returned a verdict in Koba\u2019s favor of $169,640, computed on the basis of the $80/per day charges on the invoices. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The Board has asked us to review the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">1. Did the lower court have jurisdiction to decide Koba\u2019s claim of unjust enrichment if Koba failed to exhaust mandated administrative remedies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">2. Did Koba produce any evidence to support its claim that the Board was unjustly enriched by Koba\u2019s services?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">3. Was Koba\u2019s claim barred by the statute of limitations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">4. Did the Board\u2019s immunity require the trial court to reduce the jury\u2019s verdict to $100,000?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">Because the legal landscape on the contractual liability of school boards has changed since this case was briefed and argued, we will address the Board\u2019s fourth question at the outset.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">A. Sovereign Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">The Board\u2019s position on immunity has shifted a bit since the onset of this litigation. In the circuit court, the Board, pointing to cases involving the sovereign immunity of State agencies and to SG \u00a7 12-201 (waiving immunity only for \u2022written contracts), argued that the lack of an executed written agreement doomed Koba\u2019s quasi-contractual unjust enrichment claim. While not abandoning this argument, appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>primarily contends here that the immunity conferred by Md. Code (1974, 2006 RepLVol.), \u00a7 5-518 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJP) applies to Koba\u2019s actions. Under that statute, local boards of education may not raise the defense of sovereign immunity to \u201cany claim\u201d of $100,000 or less, CJP \u00a7 5-518(c), but may raise the immunity defense to any amount claimed above the limit of its insurance policy or, above $100,000, if self-insured, or a member of an insurance pool, CJP \u00a7 5-518(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">In <em>Board of Education of Worcester County v. BEKA Industries, Inc. (\u201cBEKA\u201d), supra, </em>this Court concluded that, despite the apparent breadth of the words \u201cany claim[,]\u201d the context and history of CJP \u00a7 5-518 led to the conclusion that the statute covers only tort, not contract actions against local boards. Because this is not a tort action, the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners cannot rely on CJP \u00a7 5-518 in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">BEKA went on to hold that the contractual liability and immunity of a unit of State government, such as a board of education, was governed by Title 12, subtitle 2 of the SG Article.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Specifically, SG \u00a7 12-201(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">Except as otherwise expressly provided by a law of the State, the State, its officers, and its units may not raise the defense of sovereign immunity in a contract action, in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>court of the State, <em>based on a written contract </em>that an official or employee <em>executed </em>for the State or 1 of its units while the official or employee was acting within the scope of the authority of the official or employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Maryland appellate cases have read this limited waiver strictly to deny liability for State units in the absence of a properly executed written contract. <em>See, e.g., Stern v. Bd. of Regents, </em>380 Md. 691, 722, 846 A.2d 996 (2004); <em>Mass Transit Admin. v. Granite Constr. Co., </em>57 Md.App. 766, 781, 471 A.2d 1121 (1984). Thus, SG \u00a7 12-201 would appear to bar appellee\u2019s unjust enrichment claim, which is grounded in an unwritten quasi-contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Koba makes two arguments why the relief it sought is not precluded by State law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> First, it argues that the decision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>this Court in <em>Alternatives Unlimited, Inc. v. New Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners, </em>155 Md.App. 415, 843 A.2d 252 (2004), recognizes an unjust enrichment exception to the sovereign immunity doctrine. Second, appellee asserts that ED \u00a7 8-410(b)(l) itself waives any Board immunity from paying the transportation costs at issue here. We consider these contentions in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The short answer to appellee\u2019s first contention is that <em>Alternatives </em>does not stand for the proposition Koba asserts. Nor would it be possible for the case to be read as it suggests. <em>Alternatives </em>was an unjust enrichment case involving alleged benefits conferred upon the Baltimore County Board of School Commissioners, but was not a decision that changed the law on sovereign immunity. Judge Moylan\u2019s opinion in <em>Alternatives </em>is a thorough explanation of the common law element of enrichmeni/benefit overlayed over the backdrop of the common law nonliability of governmental entities for the unauthorized acts of one of its employees in arranging for a service from a third party. Noting that this rule of nonliability is grounded in protecting the public treasury from unauthorized expenditures, 155 Md.App. at 465, 843 A.2d 252, <em>Alternatives </em>recognized that, for purposes of an unjust enrichment claim, there was a distinction between the provision of a non-cash benefit to government and a cash benefit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">When the benefit is in cash, the case for restitution is far less troubling. When the defendant is a governmental entity, there is no threat to the public treasury because the defendant is not being required to buy anything or to pay out any of its own funds. It is simply required to hand over the easily identifiable cash benefits by which it had been unjustly enriched. There is no cost. The public treasury has not been diminished and the status quo has not been disturbed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 505-06, 843 A.2d 252. As a result of this distinction, this Court allowed an unjust enrichment claim to continue against the Board premised on the conferral of a cash benefit on the governmental entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Fueling Koba\u2019s argument is <em>Alternatives\u2019 </em>comparison of the rationale of protection of the public fisc in an unauthorized expenditure setting with this common justification for sovereign immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 422, 465-66 and 489, 843 A.2d 252. However, the public fisc rationale is not the only justification for the sovereign immunity of a State agency. <em>See Stern v. Bd. of Regents, </em>380 Md. 691, 701, 846 A.2d 996 (2004); and <em>Magnetti v. Univ. of Md., </em>171 Md.App. 279, 287-88, 909 A.2d 1101 (2006), both noting that sovereign immunity protects the State from excessive interference with governmental functions <em>and </em>preserves control over state funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">In addition, while at present, the elements of an unjust enrichment action are exclusively governed by the common law as interpreted by the courts, State sovereign immunity is no longer the sole province of the common law, but is regulated by statutes enacted by the General Assembly. The defense of sovereign immunity was abrogated in Maryland by Chapter 53, <em>Laws of 1786, </em>but was reinstated in less than 40 years. Chapter 210, <em>Laws of 1820. </em>This may explain the Court of Appeals\u2019 reluctance to judicially abrogate the sovereign immunity doctrine before the General Assembly addressed the issue in the 1970s and 1980s. <em>See, e.g., Jekofsky v. State Roads Comm\u2019n., </em>264 Md. 471, 287 A.2d 40 (1972). When the Legislature reentered the area in 1976 to enact a limited waiver of State sovereign immunity in contracts, it expressly restricted the waiver to written contracts, leaving little, if any, room for a court to find a common law exception to SG \u00a7 12-201 on the basis of theories of quasi-contract or implied contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\"><em>Alternatives </em>acknowledged these vital distinctions between the remnants of sovereign immunity not statutorily waived and the common law elements of unjust enrichment. Taking note of <em>Granite Construction, </em>57 Md.App. at 780, 471 A.2d 1121, the Court said: \u201cHowever meritorious a claim based on an implied contract may be, if that claim is against the State or any of its agencies, it is barred because it is not based upon a written contract.\u201d 155 Md.App. at 492, 843 A.2d 252. Again turning to <em>Granite Construction, </em>we observed that \u201c[ejven if we were persuaded that MTA had been unjustly enriched ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>we would be forced to conclude that sovereign immunity would be a complete bar to recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495, 843 A.2d 252. Moreover, a close look at <em>Granite Construction </em>discloses that rebuffing the appellant\u2019s unjust enrichment claim simply because it was not based on a written contract and thus, was barred by sovereign immunity, was a distinct alternative ground to this Court \u201calso\u201d rejecting an implied contract \u201cas a result of conduct on the part of an employee who was acting outside the scope of his employment.\u201d 57 Md.App. at 780-81, 471 A.2d 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">In addition, SG \u00a7 12-201 (a) indicates that these are cumulative conditions to a sovereign immunity waiver. The absence of any one of them bars judicial relief.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> For these reasons, we conclude that <em>Alternatives </em>does not create an unjust enrichment exception to the doctrine of State sovereign immunity preserved by SG \u00a7 12-201\u2019s insistence on a written contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Koba\u2019s second contention \u2014 that ED \u00a7 8-410(b)(l) itself waives sovereign immunity \u2014 also lacks merit. The General Assembly may waive sovereign immunity either directly or by necessary implication. <em>ARA Health Servs. v. Dept. of Public Safety and Correctional Servs., </em>344 Md. 85, 92, 685 A.2d 435 (1996).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>Katz v. WSSC, </em>284 Md. 503, 512, 397 A.2d 1027 (1979), the Court of Appeals, quoting from earlier authorities, said that waiver should be found only \u201cin cases of positive consent given, or by necessary and compelling implication.\u201d The language of \u00a7 8-410(b)(l) does not satisfy this demanding standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">This statute is one of a number of interrelated and overlapping duty-to-pay provisions affecting the disabled school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>children at the center of this case. <em>See </em>ED \u00a7 4-122(c)(4), 8-406(c)(1) and 8-415(d)(2), <em>discussed infra, </em>at pp. 26-30.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> These statutory provisions demonstrate no singular or special concern for enforcing the rights of private contractors to receive payment for out-of-county transportation of special education students.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Rather, these laws appear more concerned with apportioning or assigning financial responsibility for educational and related services between various governmental units, <em>ie. </em>the State and its subdivisions, and one local board of education or another.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">In this regard, it is instructive to compare the statutory waiver of sovereign immunity in <em>Katz, supra, </em>284 Md. at 513-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>15, 397 A.2d 1027, with the lack of a full waiver found in <em>IDEA Public Charter School v. District of Columbia, </em>374 F.Supp.2d 158, 165-67 (D.D.C.2005). In <em>Katz, </em>the Court of Appeals found a. statutory waiver in the enactment of a specific procedure to satisfy judgments against a State agency. 284 Md. at 514-15, 397 A.2d 1027. In <em>IDEA Public Charter, </em>a federal district court held that even though Congress had expressly waived the District\u2019s 11th Amendment immunity under the IDEA, it had not waived such immunity with respect to a charter school\u2019s claim for psychological evaluation services of special education students. The 11th Amendment waiver, the Court said, was intended to protect the rights of a parent of a disabled student to sue, \u201cnot to create a private right of action for all interested bodies.\u201d 374 F.Supp. at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Section 8 \u2014 410(b)(1) lacks the stringent waiver language of either of these statutes, but has more in common with the IDEA in its emphasis on the provision of services to disabled students without parental expense, rather than the <em>Katz </em>statute\u2019s goal of compensating private contractors through facilitating the payment of judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that \u00a7 8-410 does not waive the Board\u2019s sovereign immunity and thus, the unjust enrichment judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">B. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Late in the proceedings in the circuit court, the Board argued that Koba\u2019s suit should be dismissed because the school had not exhausted its administrative remedies before the State Board of Education.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It seems odd that the Board is raising this issue, after Koba tried to file an administrative complaint with the State Board over the nonpayment of its transportation costs and was rebuffed. <em>See </em>n. 8, <em>supra. </em>However, in any event, this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Although under ED \u00a7 2-205(e)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the State Board has broad appellate powers to resolve controversies involving the provisions of the education laws, such authority is not limitless. In <em>County Board of Education v. Cearfoss, </em>165 Md. 178, 166 A. 732 (1933), the Court of Appeals rejected the contention that the State Board had exclusive jurisdiction over a contract dispute. Distinguishing earlier precedent, the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">In none of those cases did the question for determination relate to the legal effect of a contract between an agency of the school system and an individual for the performance of a specified service. Such a question, in our judgment, is not within the initial authority of the county superintendent, or the ultimate power of the State Board of Education, to determine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 187, 166 A. 732. In addition, the Court has repeatedly emphasized that \u201cthe State Board does not have the power to decide purely legal issues.\u201d <em>Resetar v. State Board of Educ., </em>284 Md. 537, 556, 399 A.2d 225 (1979) (collecting authorities).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">These well-recognized limitations on the State Board\u2019s authority apply here. Koba has filed a common law action seeking to impose liability on the basis of a quasi-contract. At the bottom of the dispute is an application of the elements of unjust enrichment and an interpretation of ED \u00a7 8-410. These are purely legal issues capable of judicial resolution.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The circuit court did not err in rejecting the Board\u2019s exhaustion argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>C. Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The Board argues that Koba\u2019s unjust enrichment claim is untimely and foreclosed by limitations. It argues that this cause of action is barred either by 1) the one-year limitation period of the \u201cmost analogous\u201d statute, Art. 25A, \u00a7 1A; or 2) the 3-year limitation period for civil actions set forth in CJP \u00a7 5-101. We believe the Board is partly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">As we noted earlier, n. 13, <em>supra, </em>Art. 25A, \u00a7 1A does not apply to Baltimore City or boards of education. If this case involved a written contract, the one-year limitation period specified in SG \u00a7 12-202 would apply. However, because state sovereign immunity has not been waived for quasi-contracts and implied contracts, \u00a7 12-202 would hardly be the \u201cmost analogous\u201d limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">If sovereign immunity were not in the picture, we believe that the three-year period set forth in CJP \u00a7 5-101 would control an unjust enrichment claim. In <em>City of Baltimore v. Household Finance Co., </em>168 Md. 13, 176 A. 480 (1935), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Court of Appeals indicated that a claim based on an implied contract was subject to the general three-year statute of limitations, even if the implied contract action were premised on a statutory violation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Similarly, Koba\u2019s action is one in quasi-contract for unjust enrichment based on the Board\u2019s alleged violation of State law. Thus, it would be subject to the general limitation period contained in CJP \u00a7 5-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The Board also argues that Koba has failed to file its suit within the three-year limitations period. It asserts that Koba knew the Board would not pay for the transportation costs of the twelve students as early as December 1, 2001, but did not file its complaint until July 6, 2006. The Board also now argues that all but one invoice ($1,120) involved services performed before July, 2003 and that recovery of these costs is barred by \u00a7 5-101.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Koba responds that it was still receiving payments in 2002 and 2003. The payments were a single month\u2019s services for one student in 2003 and two in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>2002. And the school notes that the last invoice paid was dated July 31, 2003 for services provided from July 14 to July 31, 2003 and for which it received payment on August 31, 2003. Koba also points out that it made a final demand for payment in February, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The key issue here is from what point does the statute of limitations run. In <em>Dempsey v. McNabb, </em>73 Md. 433, 438, 21 A. 378 (1891), the Court of Appeals said that a claim for services on the basis of an implied obligation runs from the time the services are performed. This \u201clast rendition of service\u201d test appears to be the law in most other jurisdictions. <em>See Baer v. Chase, </em>392 F.3d 609, 622-23 (3rd Cir.2004) (collecting cases), and <em>GSGSB, Inc. v. New York Yankees, </em>862 F.Supp. 1160, 1171 (S.D.N.Y.1994) (\u201c[A] cause of action for quantum merit begins to run when the final service has been performed.\u201d) However, caselaw generally appears divided over whether a period of demand and refusal is tacked on to the point when services were last rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In <em>News World Communications, Inc. v. Thompsen, </em>878 A.2d 1218, 1225 (D.C.2003), the District of Columbia\u2019s highest court held that \u201c[a] claim for unjust enrichment only accrues ... when the enrichment becomes unjust.\u201d Quoting from <em>Zic v. Italian Gov\u2019t. Travel Office, </em>149 F.Supp.2d 473, 476 (N.D.Ill. 2001), the D.C. court emphasized that \u201cthe essence of a quantum merit claim ... is not the plaintiffs expectancy of payment, but the unjust enrichment of the defendant and ... the defendant was unjustly enriched when the services were rendered and when payment was refused.\u201d 878 A.2d at 1223. However, in <em>Rohter v. Passarella, </em>246 Ill.App.3d 860, 186 Ill.Dec. 807, 617 N.E.2d 46 (1993), an Illinois court rejected as untimely a tax accountant\u2019s quantum merit claims when he waited more than 5 years to file suit after the rendering of his services. Specifically, the court concluded that limitations began to run \u201cas soon as the services were rendered,\u201d not \u201cupon presentment and subsequent rejection of a bill for services,\u201d because the accountant \u201ccould have billed defendants as soon as he rendered his services to them.\u201d <em>Id., </em>186 Ill.Dec.807, 617 N.E.2d at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Apparently echoing a similar refrain is <em>Henry\u2019s Drive-in, Inc. v. Pappas, </em>264 Md. 422, 287 A.2d 35 (1972), where the Court of Appeals of Maryland said, <em>id. </em>at 428, 287 A.2d 35:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">The modern view is that when the maturity of the cause of action is dependent upon the performance of an act within the control of the plaintiff, limitations will run from the time the plaintiff could have acted, without a demand being made. If this were not so, the plaintiff could indefinitely postpone the statutory bar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In any event, the facts of this case make it unnecessary to resolve this issue. Except for the transportation of one student in July 2003 at a billed and paid cost of $1,120, all of the services were rendered more than three years before suit was filed on July 6, 2006. In addition, except for July 7, 2003 invoices for $4,720, the City School System was billed for the transportation costs and clearly refused payment more than three years before Koba went to court.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">To counter the limitations defense, Koba seems to be arguing that partial payments made by the City School System in 2003 and 2003 were an acknowledgment of the entire debt, thus tolling the statute of limitations. This contention is undercut by both the facts and applicable caselaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">First, it is important to note that Koba\u2019s provision of transportation services involved multiple debts, not a single debt. Separate invoices were sent for each student for each month. The August 2002 payment of $3,040 reflected November 30, 2001 invoices for just two students. The August 31, 2003 payment of $1,120 involved just a single student and it was linked to a July 31, 2003 invoice.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Clearly, these were not general, undirected and undesignated payments suggestive of a greater obligation to pay. <em>See Himelfarb v. American Express Co., </em>301 Md. 698, 707, 484 A.2d 1013 (1984) (\u201c \u2018If within three years before the bringing of the suit, the defendant had admitted a single item of the plaintiffs account to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>due, the plea of limitations would have been defeated as to that item, while it would have been a good bar to all the other items in the account.\u2019 \u201d) (Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Second, at most, the August 2002 payment would have started a new period running. <em>Id. </em>at 705, 484 A.2d 1013. However, because Koba sued in July 2006, nearly four years later, the claim still would have been barred by the 3-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Third, <em>Himelfarb </em>noted that, \u201c \u2018[i]n order to make a money payment a part payment within the statute, it must be shown to be a payment of a portion of an admitted debt, and paid to and accepted by the creditor as such, accompanied by circumstances amounting to an absolute and unquestionable acknowledgment of more being due, from which a promise may be inferred to pay the remainder.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707, 484 A.2d 1013. (citations omitted.) It would be blinking reality to read such a commitment in the unexplained, isolated and single-item payments by the City School System in 2002 and 2003. For these reasons, we reject Koba\u2019s partial payment argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">This does not end the matter, however. The Board\u2019s lawyer admitted in open court that claims based on $10,720 in unpaid invoices were not time-barred by \u00a7 5-101.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>See </em>n. 23, <em>supra. </em>Although not conceding these items in this Court, this admission in the circuit court is clearly a waiver of limitations as to the June-July invoiced amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">For these reasons, if Koba\u2019s claim were not precluded by the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the lion\u2019s share of any award would be barred by limitations, but not the sum of $10,720.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">D. Unjust Enrichment</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">The Board has proffered numerous arguments why the court and jury were incorrect in finding the elements of unjust enrichment. However, we need not consider all of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">Unjust enrichment consists of three elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>1. A benefit conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\">2. An appreciation or knowledge by the defendant of the benefit; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">3. The acceptance or retention by the defendant of the benefit under such circumstances as to make it inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without the payment of its value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\"><em>Hill v. Cross Country Settlements, </em>402 Md. 281, 295, 936 A.2d 343 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Integral to Koba\u2019s attempt to demonstrate these elements is its assertion that the Board violated its statutory duty under ED \u00a7 8-410(b)(l) to pay transportation costs for the twelve disabled City students housed in a group home in Talbot County and transported to Koba\u2019s school in Anne Arundel County.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> If the Board had such a statutory duty, it could plausibly be found that the City School System had knowledge of the benefit it was receiving when Koba arranged for transportation services and that Koba was not acting as an officious intervenor or volunteer in performing the Board\u2019s duty.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In our view, a proper understanding of \u00a7 8-410, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>particularly, how it interacts with other key provisions of law relating to transportation of disabled students, will shed light not only on whether the Board has a duty to pay, but also whether it has received a \u201cbenefit\u201d for purposes of an unjust enrichment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Education Article \u00a7 8-403 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">(a) The <em>State and each local school system </em>shall make a free appropriate public education available to each child with a disability, as provided by this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">(b) Appropriate special education and <em>related services </em>are available to a child with a disability from birth through the end of the school year in which the child turns 21 years of age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">(Emphasis added.) Under ED \u00a7 8-401(a)(3), a \u201c[f]ree appropriate public education\u201d includes the provision of \u201crelated services\u201d and under ED \u00a7 8-401(a)(5), \u201c[rjelated services,\u201d includes \u201ctransportation ... as may be required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Education Article \u00a7 4-122 deals with funding a public school program for children in \u201can out-of-county living arrangement\u201d and distinguishes between a \u201c[f]inancially responsible county,\u201d \u2014 generally where the parents reside \u2014 and the \u201c[sjervice providing local education agency,\u201d where the child is placed. \u00a7 4r-122(a)(3) and (5). Section 4-122(c) imposes certain educational costs on the financially responsible county. However, \u00a7 <em>4r- </em>122(c)(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">If the service providing local education agency determines that a child in an out-of-county living arrangement is handicapped and needs a <em>nonpublic educational program </em>as provided by \u00a7 8-406 of this article, the <em>financially responsi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>ble county shall pay </em>for each such child the amount provided by \u00a7 8-415(d)(3) of this article.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Education Article \u00a7 8 \u2014 406(b)(1) states that \u201c[a] child with a disability who needs special education <em>and related services </em>that cannot be provided in a public county, regional, or State program shall be placed in an appropriate nonpublic education program that offers the service.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 8-406(c)(l) provides that \u201c[t]he cost of the nonpublic educational program shall be <em>paid by the State and the county in which the child is domiciled, </em>in accordance with \u00a7 8^il5(d) of this subtitle, as appropriate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">A key component of these interrelated provisions is ED \u00a7 8-415(d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">(1) In this subsection, \u201cbasic cost\u201d as to each county, means the average amount spent by the county from county, State, and federal sources for the public education of a nonhandi-capped child. \u201cBasic cost\u201d does not include amounts specifically allocated and spent for identifiable compensatory programs for disadvantaged children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">(2) As provided in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection, <em>the State and the counties shall share collectively in the cost of educating children with disabilities in nonpublic programs under \u00a7 8-W6 of this subtitle.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">(3) (i) Subject to the limitation under subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, <em>for each of these children domiciled in the county, the county shall contribute for each placement </em>the sum of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">(1) The local share of the basic cost;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>(2) An additional amount equal to 200 percent of the basic cost; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\">(3) A.

Section 5-205(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">The State shall distribute grants as provided under this section <em>to the county boards to provide transportation services </em>for public school students and <em>disabled children for whom transportation is to be provided under \u00a7 8-blO of this article. </em>Appropriations for student transportation shall be budgeted in a separate budget category as provided in \u00a7 5-101 of this title. If the amount that is appropriated to a county under this section in a fiscal year is more than the actual cost of providing student transportation services in that county, a county board may apply any excess funds to costs of pupil transportation in subsequent years. None of these funds may be paid to or claimed by any subdivision, nor may many of these funds be reverted to any subdivision. A county board may not transfer State revenues from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>student transportation category to another category as a result of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Subsection (b) establishes a base grant amount for each jurisdiction and subsection (c) sets forth a formula for increasing the grant. Subsection (d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">For each fiscal year, in addition to the base grant for student transportation provided under subsection (c) of this section, a disabled student transportation grant shall be distributed to each county board. The amount of the grant to each board shall be equal to the product of the number of disabled students requiring special transportation services who are transported by the county board in the previous fiscal year and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">(1) $600 in fiscal year 2004;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">(2) $700 in fiscal year 2005;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">(3) $800 in fiscal year 2006;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">(4) $900 in fiscal year 2007; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">(5) $1,000 in fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter.[<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">Finally \u00a7 5-205(e) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-13\">For the purposes of determining the amount of the grant provided under subsection (d) of this section, the State Board shall develop a procedure and adopt regulations for determining the number of disabled students transported in each jurisdiction in the previous fiscal year.[<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>With an eye on these interrelated provisions (some of which have changed, but without impacting the major events in this case), we now turn back to ED \u00a7 8-410(b)(l), which once again provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">[T]he local school system of the county in which the child with a disability resides shall certify and pay the cost of his daily or other reasonable transportation to school under the rules and regulations adopted by the State Board if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">(i) The school is outside this State or the county in which the child resides; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">(ii) State aid has provided for the education of the child under this subtitle[<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">In light of the provisions quoted on pages 26-29, particularly ED \u00a7\u00a7 8-406(c), 4-122(e) and 8-415(d)(3), it is difficult to look at the words \u201cthe county in which the child with a disability resides,\u201d and to embrace the Board\u2019s view that it does not mean the subdivision where the disabled \u201cchild\u201d <em>(ie., </em>the parent) is domiciled. Moreover, it is a general rule of construction in Maryland that the words \u201cresided\u201d or \u201cresides\u201d in a statutory provision means \u201cdomiciled\u201d or \u201cdomicilary,\u201d unless a contrary intent is shown. <em>Roberts v. Lakin, </em>340 Md. 147, 153, 665 A.2d 1024 (1995) (collecting cases). Finally, under Maryland caselaw, a temporary removal to another habitation does not result in the abandonment of a person\u2019s domicile. <em>Blount v. Boston, </em>351 Md. 360, 371-73, 718 A.2d 1111 (1998). In our view, for purposes of \u00a7 8-410(b)(l), the twelve special education students receiving transportation \u201cresided\u201d in Baltimore City and the Board has misread this statute. This does not translate, however, into an automatic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>finding of a \u201cbenefit\u201d to the Board or one that is \u201cunjust\u201d for the Board to have received.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">In his closing argument to the jury, Koba\u2019s counsel pointed to a number of indicators of \u201cbenefit\u201d to the Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">(1) Payment of the invoice in 2001 and isolated payments in 2002 and 2003 \u201cconfirms the benefit\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">(2) The Board benefitted from its arrangement with Koba because \u201cthe Board had an obligation to certify and pay for these transportation costs\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">(3) The Board received millions of dollars in State aid in FY 2003 to transport disabled students.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">In this Court, Koba argues that the Board received a \u201ccash benefit\u201d to which it was not entitled \u201cbecause Koba has paid for these transportation expenses which [the Board] was required to dip into its treasury to pay as a matter of its legal obligation.\u201d Appellant adds that funds in the account of the Board \u201cwere further enriched by cash received directly or indirectly from the State of Maryland; and through the State of Maryland, from the Federal Government through ... IDEA grants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">As a matter of law, we find that none of these contentions amount to a legally cognizable benefit, whose receipt would have been unjust. The mere nonpayment for services does not constitute unjust enrichment. <em>Castillo v. Barrera, </em>146 Cal.App.4th 1317, 53 Cal.Rptr.3d 494, 503 (App. 2007). Because the profit or advantage to the defendant is a key element in an unjust enrichment action, it is difficult to see how payments to the plaintiff confer that profit or advantage. Nor do such payments by the Board \u201cconfirm\u201d a benefit, as Koba argues. For the same reason, Koba\u2019s billings, which were the obvious basis for the amount of the judgment here, do not mean a benefit was conferred. <em>See Granite Construction Co., supra, </em>57 Md.App. at 775, 471 A.2d 1121 (In an unjust enrichment action, \u201cthe measure of recovery is the gain to the defendant, not the loss by the plaintiff.\u201d) Koba\u2019s other contentions \u2014 the Board\u2019s statutory obligation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>transport and the receipt of appropriations to perform that function \u2014 carry with them their own counter-argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The litany of statutory provisions recited at pp. 424-27, 4 A.3d at 75-77, <em>supra, </em>demonstrates that the duty to fund the transportation of disabled students, both in and outside the particular jurisdiction, is a shared obligation of the State and the subdivisions. The Board has a duty to pay for the transportation, <em>if </em>it receives or can receive reimbursement for those expenditures, <em>see </em>n. 17 <em>supra. </em>The City School System can no longer be reimbursed for the transportation of the twelve students for 2001-03, because they obviously were not included in the ridership head-count by the deadline specified in COMAR 13A.06.07.18. <em>See </em>n. 31, <em>supra. </em>Koba made no showing at trial that the Board can now be reimbursed for transportation of the twelve students. Rather, appellee argues, on the basis of our decision in <em>Alternatives, supra, </em>that receipt by the Board of State funding for transportation is the benefit that makes its claim viable. However, <em>Alternatives </em>says only that when State monies forwarded to the Board are \u201cthe direct result\u201d of the services provided, then a cash benefit may exist. 155 Md.App. at 506, 843 A.2d 252. Under <em>Alternatives, </em>the plaintiff must show that \u201cbecause of\u2019 the services provided to the City School System, the Board received a certain amount of funding to which it \u201cwould not otherwise have been entitled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497, 843 A.2d 252. Koba has made no showing of direct causation between its provision of transportation services and additional State moneys forwarded to the City School System. In fact, because the cost of transporting twelve students was not included in the ridership headcount, the Board probably received less funds than it would have been entitled, and the State \u2014 a non-party here\u2014 was the beneficiary in having to appropriate less.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Koba\u2019s suggestion that the Board received a benefit because it did not expend funds from its transportation budget, mis-comprehends the role of these funds. They are not the Board\u2019s to keep for any use it desires, but to spend on the transportation of disabled children; and presumably that was what the funds were used for from 2001-2003 and in later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>years. If any benefit existed, it was passed on to other children in the fulfillment of the Board\u2019s statutory duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Finally, in determining whether any receipt of benefit by the Board was unjust, it cannot be overlooked that Koba arranged for the cost of transportation of the children in order to receive the far more substantial payments of tuition from the City School System.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Brief at 2. (\u201cKoba had to arrange transportation to provide the educational services required by the Individual Educational Plan for the children.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that Koba\u2019s unjust enrichment claim would have failed even if not barred by sovereign immunity or limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.

In our view, there is no doubt that the Board is properly regarded as a State agency. At one time, the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners had a local aura because Baltimore City was the only home rule subdivision with an express home rule power to establish and maintain a system of free public schools. Over the years, the General Assembly has limited this authority. Now, the City\u2019s express powers, codified in Article II of its Charter, include in Art. II (\u00a7 30) the authority to establish and maintain free public schools \"[s]ubject to the applicable provisions of the Education Article.\u201d <em>See also </em>ED \u00a7 1-202. Home rule issues aside, the Board bears all the key indicia of a State agency. <em>See A.S. Abell Pub. Co. v. Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 38, 464 A.2d 1068 (1983).

ED \u00a7 3-108.1(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b433-7\">. The Board\u2019s brief refers to similar contract waiver language found in Md.Code (1957, 2005 Repl.Vol.) Art. 25A, \u00a7 1A. Presumably, this reference is made only for purposes of analogy, because Article 25A applies only to charter home counties, not Baltimore City, and certainly not to State agencies such as the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners. A statutory waiver of contractual liability with respect to Baltimore City was not added to the law by the General Assembly until 2002. <em>See </em>Chapter 521, <em>Laws of2002. </em>The Fiscal Note for this legislation (HB 452) observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">In practice courts do not allow Baltimore City to claim governmental immunity in contract matters. Thus, Baltimore City is liable in contractual actions to which the City is a party, but the City does not enjoy the one-year limit on filing of contractual actions and it is liable for punitive damages under current law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">In one critical respect, there is a difference between the contractual liability/immunity of Baltimore City and a State agency, such as a local school board. At common law, State agencies enjoyed immunity from contract actions, while political subdivisions and municipalities did not. <em>See Baltimore County v. RTKL Assocs., </em>380 Md. 670, 675, 846 A.2d 433 (2004). Whether this fact would warrant a different result in an unjust enrichment action brought against a local government, is an issue we need not resolve at the present time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b433-10\">. While the parties have not had the opportunity to discuss the impact of BEKA, they have made all the relevant and appropriate arguments for and against the application of SG \u00a7 12-201. Even, if the sovereign immunity issue had not been argued by the parties, we could raise the issue <em>sua sponte. Frosburg v. State Dept. of Personnel, </em>37 Md.App. <em>18, </em>27, 375 A.2d 582 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\">. Thus, <em>Alternatives </em>cannot be read, as Koba contends, to create an exception to sovereign immunity in cases without a written contract, if there is no evidence that a State officer or employee acted <em>ultra vires.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b436-8\">. An additional requirement for an effective waiver is a provision for payment of judgments. <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 709-10, 989 A.2d 1181. Because we find that \u00a7 8 \u2014 410(b)(1) intended no waiver of sovereign immunity, we need not address this additional requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b437-5\">. The language of \u00a7 8-410(b)(l), relied upon by Koba, was enacted in 1967 (Chapter 708, <em>Laws of 1967) </em>\u2014 still the heyday of sovereign immunity \u2014 and eight years before the passage of the federal legislation which has now become the IDEA and which was the backdrop for these later duty-to-pay provisions. When originally enacted, \u00a7 8-410(b)(l) did not create a singular or unequivocal obligation on the part of a local board of education to pay private contractors for transportation services for disabled children receiving an education in the course of an out-of-county placement. In fact, the 1967 legislation imposed the duty to pay on \"the county,\" not the local board. In 1969, the word county was replaced with \"subdivision.\u201d Chapter 405, <em>Laws of 1969. </em>It was not until 1975 that this term was changed to \u201cboard of education.\u201d Chapter 702, Taws <em>of 1975. </em>The 1975 legislation (HB 637), initially sought to impose a duty on local boards to \"arrange\u201d for transportation, contrary to the traditional method of reimbursing parents for the transportation. <em>See </em>Comments on House Bill 637, Morris W. Rannels, Maryland State Department of Education, House Ways and Means Committee, March 5, 1975. However, the word \"arrange\u201d was later deleted from the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">In addition to tying the obligation to receipt of State aid to education funds, the 1967 statute expressly required the State \u201cto reimburse <em>the subdivision </em>for providing this transportation from the General Funds of the State.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although the latter language was deleted in 1981 as part of a major revamping of the funding of State transportation costs, <em>see </em>Chapter 507, <em>Laws of 1981, </em>other provisions in the law recognized that the obligation to fund transportation costs, including those for disabled students, remained a joint one between the local governments and the State. <em>See </em>ED \u00a7 8-406(c)(l) and \u00a7 8-415(d)(2).

This raised an implied obligation on the part of the defendant to reimburse and pay to the plaintiff the moneys expended in that behalf. The action is founded on this implied obligation, and not on the statute, and is really an action of assumpsit. The fact that the duty which the defendant failed to perform was a statutory one does not make the action one upon the statute. The action is clearly one of those described in the [general] statute of limitations.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\">. At trial, the Board moved for judgment at the conclusion of Koba\u2019s case. One issue raised at the time was limitations.
