Jones, was arrested in front of 612 Baker Street in Salisbury, Maryland. A search incident to appellant\u2019s arrest produced suspected narcotics, a sample of which tested positive for cocaine. Appellant was subsequently charged with, among other things, possession with intent to distribute cocaine and trespass on posted property. Appellant filed a motion to suppress on the ground that his arrest lacked probable cause and thus the evidence seized during the search incident to arrest was the result of an illegal search. On April 11, 2008, the Circuit Court for Wicomico County denied appellant\u2019s motion. On June 23, 2008, appellant entered a not guilty plea on an agreed statement of facts, and the State entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>to all counts with the exception of the possession of cocaine. The trial court found appellant guilty of the charge and sentenced him to three years\u2019 incarceration. On appeal, appellant presents one question for review, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">Did the trial court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress on the basis that there was probable cause to arrest appellant for trespassing on posted property?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">For the reasons set forth herein, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The trial court held a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress on April 11, 2008. Officer David Underwood of the Salisbury Police Department was the only witness to testify for the State. Officer Underwood stated that he and Officer Thomas McMenamy were traveling in a patrol car on Anne Street approaching Baker Street when Officer Underwood observed appellant in the rear yard of 612 Baker Street walking toward Anne Street. Officer Underwood testified that upon seeing the patrol vehicle, appellant \u201cimmediately turned around and began walking back towards Baker Street.\u201d According to Officer Underwood, appellant \u201cwas walking at a much quicker pace than he was when he was walking towards Anne Street.\u201d Upon turning the patrol car onto Baker Street, Officer Underwood saw appellant \u201cwalking from the rear yard into the side yard and then eventually into the front yard of 612 Baker Street....\u201d Officer Underwood stated that he was familiar with the owners of 612 Baker Street, Glen and Lynn Bratten, and that there were \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs posted on all sides of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Officer Underwood then stopped appellant \u201cin reference to the trespassing violation____[t]o see if he had a right to be on the property.\u201d Upon questioning, Officer Underwood observed that appellant appeared nervous and avoided making eye contact. When Officer Underwood asked whether appellant had anything illegal on his person, appellant emptied the contents of his pockets, with the exception of his front right watch pocket. Officer Underwood testified that, when he asked appellant about that particular pocket, appellant turned away. According to Officer Underwood, \u201c[a]t that time [appellant] was detained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Officer Underwood then asked appellant where he lived. Appellant \u201cdidn\u2019t provide that address.\u201d Officer Underwood \u201cattempted to make contact with the tenants of 612 Baker Street\u201d by knocking on the door, but no one answered. When asked by the prosecutor whether he knew where appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>resided, Officer Underwood stated: \u201cTo my knowledge, 618 Baker Street.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Officer Underwood next described the physical layout of the homes on Baker Street. He stated that 612 was part of a building containing three rowhouses, 612 was the far right rowhouse as one faced the front, with 614 and 616 to the left, respectively. A driveway separated 616 from 618, the latter being part of a duplex with 620. There was also a driveway between 610 and 612. Officer Underwood testified that he first observed appellant directly behind 612, and then saw appellant come from the back of 612 along the driveway separating 612 and 610 and enter the front yard of 612 where he made contact with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">According to Officer Underwood, appellant was ultimately placed under arrest \u201c[i]n reference to the trespassing.\u201d Officer Underwood searched appellant\u2019s front right watch pocket and found a series of baggies containing what Officer Underwood \u201crecognized through [his] training, knowledge and experience as suspected crack cocaine.\u201d Finally, Officer Underwood testified that the area of Anne Street and Baker Street was \u201cconsidered an open-air drug market and had a high crime rate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Appellant called two witnesses. Appellant\u2019s mother, Vanessa Robinson, testified that appellant was staying at her home at 618 Baker Street. Robinson stated that an individual named Jane Ann<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> lived at 612 Baker Street and had given appellant permission to enter the front yard of 612 Baker Street to access 618 Baker Street. The other witness to testify for appellant was Michael Booker, who lived at 620 Baker Street. Booker testified that around noon on November 23, 2007, he was with appellant in the yard shared by 618 and 620 Baker Street. Booker went inside of his house and when he came back out, he observed the officers place appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>lant in a patrol car. Booker noted that the police did not make any attempt to speak with him before arresting appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The trial court concluded that the police had probable cause to arrest appellant and denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. The court stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">[T]he question really is whether or not based on Officer Underwood\u2019s observations that someone \u2014 that an objectively reasonable police officer in that situation considering the totality of the circumstances would have found there was reasonable grounds to believe that [appellant] was trespassing at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">... [T]here is nothing to suggest that the no trespassing signs which were posted on all sides of the building and from the officer\u2019s testimony would have been visible, said no trespassing except for neighbors. It said no trespassing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">And I believe based on Officer Underwood\u2019s testimony that, an objectively reasonable officer acting under those circumstances considering the nature of the area, the observations of [appellant] where he was located, his behavior and when asked where he lived, actually there is nothing \u2014 I don\u2019t recall there being any testimony that he asked [appellant] what permission he had to be there. He asked him where he lived and he said at one point, I think no answer. Then he said at another time that it was 618, but I think based on the officer\u2019s testimony, I\u2019m going to find that there was probable cause for the arrest, and the arguments made can perhaps more effectively be made at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">On June 23, 2008, appellant made an oral motion to reconsider the denial of his motion to suppress, which was denied. Appellant then entered a not guilty plea to an agreed statement of facts on the sole charge of possession of cocaine, the remaining counts having been <em>nolle prossed </em>by the State. As previously stated, the trial court found appellant guilty and sentenced him to three years\u2019 incarceration with the Division of Correction. A timely notice of appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aj-dedup-0\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Appellant argues that the trial court erroneously concluded that Officer Underwood had probable cause to arrest him for trespass on posted property. Relying on <em>In re Jason Allen D., </em>127 Md.App. 456, 733 A.2d 351 (1999), <em>Johnson v. State, </em>356 Md. 498, 740 A.2d 615 (1999), and <em>Torres v. State, </em>147 Md.App. 83, 807 A.2d 780 (2002), appellant claims that, \u201c[i]n order to find probable cause for trespassing, the court must find that the officers knew that appellant was prohibited from entering the property of 612 Baker Street.\u201d Appellant focuses on the three factors cited by the trial court to support its finding of probable cause, namely, \u201c1) appellant\u2019s physical location; 2) the nature of the area; and 3) appellant\u2019s behavior when asked for his address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Regarding appellant\u2019s presence at 612 Baker Street, appellant asserts that, even with the posted \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs, \u201c[bjeing present on a neighbor\u2019s property does not create probable cause for trespassing, without confirmation that the presence is forbidden.\u201d According to appellant, the mere presence in a high crime area also cannot justify a finding of probable cause, because \u201c[pjrobable cause cannot be found in this case, where the crime is distinct from the one that defines the area.\u201d Finally, appellant contends that probable cause cannot be based on appellant\u2019s \u201cbehavior when asked where he lived,\u201d because (1) appellant was not asked where he lived until after he was arrested, and thus \u201cthe question of whether probable cause had been established [was] moot;\u201d and (2) under Maryland law, appellant\u2019s nervousness upon being stopped by Officer Underwood cannot be the basis for a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Appellant next argues that, even when all pertinent facts are considered, including those not relied upon by the trial court, \u201cthe officers failed to develop probable cause to believe that appellant was trespassing on the property of 612 Baker Street.\u201d Again, appellant claims that \u201cthe officers would need to confirm that [appellant] was not permitted on the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>in order to establish probable cause.\u201d Among the reasons that appellant claims the officers failed to do so was that \u201cthere is no evidence that the officers ever asked appellant if he had permission to. be on the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Finally, appellant focuses on what the officers did know based upon their \u201ccursory investigation,\u201d namely \u201cknowledge of the owners of 612 Baker Street,\u201d \u201cobservation of a \u2018No Trespassing\u2019 sign,\u201d and \u201ca knock on the door of 612 Baker Street that went unanswered.\u201d None of these facts, according to appellant, establishes probable cause. Appellant concludes that, \u201c[bjecause Officer Underwood did not have probable cause to arrest appellant for trespass, the arrest [was] unlawful and the fruits of [the] subsequent search [were] inadmissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The State responds that the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, because the police had probable cause to arrest appellant for trespassing on posted property. Specifically, the State claims that appellant\u2019s arrest was properly supported by probable cause based on the following facts: (1) the property was \u201cposted conspicuously against trespass;\u201d (2) appellant was observed on the rear, side, and front of the property where the signs were posted; (3) the area was known as an open-air drug market; (4) appellant \u201cacted furtively upon seeing [the] police officer[s];\u201d (5) appellant did not live at the property; (6) appellant failed to make eye contact with Officer Underwood and never claimed to have permission to be on the property at 612 Baker Street; and (7) Officer Underwood attempted unsuccessfully to contact the residents of 612 Baker Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The State further contends that in Maryland, the crime of trespass on posted property is to be distinguished from the crime of wanton trespass on private property. According to the State, \u201c[trespass on posted property simply prohibits entry on property that is posted conspicuously against trespass,\u201d while wanton trespass on private property \u201crequires that the individual specifically be notified by the owner, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>owner\u2019s agent, not to enter the property.\u201d The State asserts that appellant\u2019s contention that probable cause requires the officers to know whether appellant was prohibited from entering 612 Baker Street is based on cases interpreting the wanton trespass statute, not the trespass on posted property statute. The State claims that the Court of Appeals has never suggested that posted no trespassing signs with knowledge that a person does not reside in a residence did not create probable cause for trespass on posted property. Finally, the State argues that, even if appellant had permission to be present at 612 Baker Street, probable cause would not be negated, because the \u201cburden is on the defendant to generate that defense at trial.\u201d Therefore, the State concludes that the trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Statutory Trespass Law in Maryland</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Under common law, a trespass to real property had to constitute a breach of the peace for criminal liability to attach. <em>In re Antoine M., </em>394 Md. 491, 503, 907 A.2d 158 (2006). Thus, to criminalize trespass without a breach of the peace required legislative action. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>356 Md. 498, 506, 740 A.2d 615 (1999) (stating that, \u201cfor the most part, criminal trespass is a creature of statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In 1900, the General Assembly enacted the first criminal trespass statute, which we shall refer to as the \u201cwanton trespass\u201d statute. 1900 Md. Laws ch. 66. It stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">Any person or persons who shall enter upon or cross over the land, premises or private property of any person or persons in this State after having been duly notified by the owner or his agent not to do so, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor ... and provided, further, that nothing in this Act shall be construed to include within its provision the entry upon or crossing over any land where such entry or crossing is done under a bona fide claim of right or ownership of said land, it being the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>intention of this Act only to prohibit wilfull and wanton trespass upon the private land of others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 66-67 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In 1920, a statute criminalizing trespass on posted property was enacted, which we shall call \u201ctrespass on posted property.\u201d 1920 Md. Laws ch. 112. This statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">[I]t shall be unlawful for any person to enter or trespass on any property which is posted against trespassers in a conspicuous manner. Any person so doing shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction before any Justice of the Peace shall pay a fine of fifteen dollars ($15.00) and the costs; the prosecution of such offenders shall be made and proceedings instituted by the landowner or tenant of the property unlawfully entered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Unlike the wanton trespass law, the trespass on posted property statute required the premises in question to be \u201cposted against trespassers in a conspicuous manner.\u201d 1920 Md. Laws ch. 112, at 182. The trespass on posted property statute also did not necessitate the owner or the owner\u2019s agent to notify the trespasser that he or she could not enter the owner\u2019s land before criminal liability would attach, nor did it include an exception for invasions done under a <em>bona fide </em>claim of right or ownership. Finally, under the terms of the trespass on posted property statute, it was the landowner\u2019s responsibility to commence any prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">Before 1998, the trespass on posted property and wanton trespass statutes existed in separate sections of the Maryland Code. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1996 RepLVol.), Art. 27 \u00a7 576 (trespass on posted property); Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27 \u00a7 577 (wanton trespass). For the purpose of revising and consolidating Maryland\u2019s trespass laws in 1998, the General Assembly repealed \u00a7 576 and \u00a7 577, and enacted a new \u00a7 577 that placed the two laws into one statutory provision. 1998 Md. Laws ch. 498, at 2361, 2363, 2365 (codified as amended at Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1998 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27 \u00a7 577(a)(1), (2)). No substantive changes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>were made to the laws, except that the legislature eliminated the requirement that a landowner initiate the prosecution for a trespass on posted property. 1998 Md. Laws ch. 498, at 2361-62, 2363 (codified as amended at Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Yol., 1998 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27 \u00a7 577(a)(1)). The two laws were separated again upon the creation of the Criminal Law Article of the Maryland Code in 2002. <em>See </em>2002 Md. Laws ch. 26, at 513-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Today, the two laws remain codified in separate sections of the Criminal Law Article of the Maryland Code. The current trespass on posted property statute, which was in effect at the time of appellant\u2019s arrest, is found at section 6-402(a) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d), and states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOX\">(a) <em>Prohibited </em>\u2014 A person may not enter or trespass on property that is posted conspicuously against trespass by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-4\">(1) signs placed where they may reasonably be seen</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aic\">Md.Code (2002), C.L. \u00a7 6-402(a)(l). C.L. \u00a7 6-403(a) contains the wanton trespass statute, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOg\">(a) <em>Prohibited </em>\u2014 Entering <em>and crossing property. </em>\u2014 A person may not enter or cross over private property ..., after having been notified by the owner or the owner\u2019s agent not to do so, unless entering or crossing under a good faith claim of right or ownership.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In the almost one hundred years that the two criminal trespass laws have coexisted, the fundamental distinctions remain: the wanton trespass statute includes both (1) a requirement that the owner or the owner\u2019s agent notify the individual not to traverse upon the owner\u2019s land, and (2) an exception that excludes entering or crossing under a good faith claim of right or ownership. Neither provision exists in the trespass on posted property statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trespass on posted property law requires that the property be \u201cposted conspicuously against trespass,\u201d a provision not present in the wanton trespass statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>It is these differences that appellant\u2019s argument fails to appreciate. Appellant cites <em>In re Jason Allen D., Johnson, </em>and <em>Torres, </em>for the proposition that probable cause to arrest an individual for trespassing on posted property requires the police to have knowledge that the alleged trespasser was prohibited from entering the property in question. Appellant\u2019s reliance is misguided. We shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">In <em>In re Jason Allen D., </em>we addressed the bona fide claim of right exception to the wanton trespass statute. The appellant was arrested twice in the same day for wanton trespass on public housing property, from which he previously had been prohibited from entering.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>In re Jason Allen D., </em>127 Md.App. at 460-61, 733 A.2d 351. Subsequent to the first arrest, law enforcement was dispatched to the same public housing complex because of a report that the appellant was \u201charassing\u201d the security guards. <em>Id. </em>at 462, 733 A.2d 351. Upon returning, an officer observed the appellant standing on the premises with a group of individuals, one of whom was later identified as the appellant\u2019s cousin. <em>Id. </em>at 462-63, 466, 733 A.2d 351. The officer then arrested the appellant for \u201ctrespassing on the Housing Authority\u2019s property after being duly notified not to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, 733 A.2d 351. The trial judge found that the appellant had committed wanton trespass. <em>Id. </em>at 471, 733 A.2d 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">On appeal, the appellant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 472, 733 A.2d 351. According to the appellant, he had a right to be on the property because he was a guest of his cousin at the time of his second arrest. <em>Id. </em>In reversing, this Court noted that the wanton trespass statute did not criminalize entries made under a bona fide claim of right. <em>Id. </em>at 475, 733 A.2d 351. We observed that the undisputed evidence at trial revealed that the appellant\u2019s cousin invited the appellant on the premis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>es and that the appellant\u2019s cousin was standing with the appellant at the time of the arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 479-80, 733 A.2d 351. We concluded that the appellant generated sufficient evidence to show he was on the property under a bona fide claim of right, and that the State failed to rebut this defense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 484-85, 733 A.2d 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the Court of Appeals decided that a two-year ban notice satisfied the notification requirement of the wanton trespass statute. In that case, the police were patrolling a public housing complex and noticed the petitioner driving on a street within the community. <em>Johnson, </em>356 Md. at 502, 740 A.2d 615. The arresting officer recognized the petitioner and radioed dispatch to see whether the petitioner was included on a list \u201cof names of people that have been banned from different Housing Authority properties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The arresting officer was informed that the petitioner had received a notice two years ago not to return to the property in question. <em>Id. </em>Acting upon this information, the officer stopped the petitioner and arrested him for wanton trespass on public housing property. <em>Id. </em>at 500, 502, 740 A.2d 615. A search incident to arrest produced illegal narcotics. <em>Id. </em>at 502, 740 A.2d 615. After denying a motion to suppress the evidence, the trial court found the petitioner guilty on an agreed statement of facts of possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance and simple possession of the same. <em>Id. </em>at 500, 502, 740 A.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The petitioner challenged his conviction on appeal by arguing that the officer lacked probable cause for the arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 502-03, 740 A.2d 615. Under the wanton trespass statute, a trespasser had to be \u201cduly notified by the owner or his agent\u201d not to enter public housing property. <em>Id. </em>at 500-01, 740 A.2d 615. The petitioner maintained that the police could not have reasonably believed that the two-year old ban \u201cduly notified\u201d the petitioner that he was prohibited from the premises, and therefore probable cause to arrest could not exist. <em>Id. </em>at 503, 740 A.2d 615. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument, holding that it was reasonable for the arresting officer to rely on the two-year old notice as \u201cdue notice\u201d that the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>was banned from the public housing complex.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 510, 740 A.2d 615. According to the Court, probable cause existed for the petitioner\u2019s arrest because \u201ca notification to stay off property given on one occasion remains effective for future occasions.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 508, 740 A.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In <em>Torres, </em>this Court considered whether the arrest of the appellant thirteen days after an officer observed the appellant allegedly committing a wanton trespass was reasonably prompt. <em>Torres, </em>147 Md.App. at 93, 93 n. 6, 807 A.2d 780. Police were dispatched to an apartment building at 125 Lee Avenue where individuals were using and selling controlled dangerous substances in the parking lot.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 90, 807 A.2d 780. Upon arriving at the scene, Officer Frank Webb observed the appellant \u201cput \u2018an unknown object\u2019 \u201d in his mouth and run into the rear entrance of the building. <em>Id. </em>Officer Webb searched inside the building for the appellant in order \u201cto investigate why [the appellant] was, first of all, trespassing, find out what [the appellant] put in his mouth,\u201d but was unable to locate the appellant. <em>Id. </em>at 90, 807 A.2d 780. Officer Webb did not know whether the appellant had ever been banned from 125 Lee Avenue, but intended to find out if he caught the appellant. <em>Id. </em>at 91, 807 A.2d 780.

In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Officer Underwood testified that, as he and Officer McMenamy were traveling down Anne Street towards Baker Street, he observed appellant in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>rear yard of 612 Baker Street walking towards the officers. When appellant noticed Officer Underwood\u2019s patrol car, \u201che immediately turned around and began walking back towards Baker Street----at a much quicker pace than he was when he was walking towards Anne Street.\u201d Officer Underwood saw appellant walk from the rear yard into the side yard and then into the front yard of 612 Baker Street. Officer Underwood also saw \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs posted on all sides of 612 Baker Street and knew appellant was not an owner of the residence there.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Armed with this knowledge, Officer Underwood encountered appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">[OFFICER UNDERWOOD]: At that point, stopped [appellant], made contact with him in reference to the violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019m sorry. What was the last thing you said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">You stopped him, made contact and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">[OFFICER UNDERWOOD]: In reference to the trespassing violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Oh, okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\">[OFFICER UNDERWOOD]: To see if he had a right to be on the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">At this point, we hold that Officer Underwood had reasonable suspicion to believe that appellant was committing a trespass on posted property under C.L. \u00a7 6-402(a). <em>See Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 20-21, 88 S.Ct. 1868; <em>Nathan, </em>370 Md. at 660, 805 A.2d 1086. Officer Underwood saw appellant enter onto property that had \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs \u201cconspicuously posted\u201d and knew that appellant was not an owner of that property. Officer Underwood also knew that appellant probably was not going to visit any resident of 612 Baker Street, because appellant was walking away from Baker Street when Officer Underwood first saw him, and then walked back to 612 Baker Street in an apparent attempt to avoid contact with the police. What Officer Underwood did not know was whether appellant lived at 612 Baker Street. Consequently, Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Underwood had the legal right \u201cto stop and briefly detain\u201d appellant, <em>Wilson, </em>409 Md. at 440, 975 A.2d 877, in order to investigate the circumstances that provoked the suspicion. <em>See Nathan, </em>370 Md. at 660, 805 A.2d 1086; <em>Collins, </em>376 Md. at 368, 829 A.2d 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Officer Underwood proceeded to ask appellant whether \u201che had anything illegal on his person.\u201d Appellant began emptying all of his pockets on the patrol car, with the exception of his front right watch pocket. Officer Underwood observed that appellant was nervous and avoided eye contact. When Officer Underwood inquired about the contents of the right front watch pocket, appellant turned his right side away from Officer Underwood. At that time, in Officer Underwood\u2019s words, appellant \u201cwas detained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">At this point in the factual chronology, appellant asserts that he was \u201carrested for trespassing.\u201d In other words, appellant claims that Officer Underwood\u2019s testimony that appellant \u201cwas detained\u201d meant that appellant was arrested. More importantly, appellant contends that he was not asked for his address until after his \u201cdetention,\u201d <em>ie., </em>\u201carrest,\u201d and thus appellant\u2019s response could not be factored into the determination of whether probable cause had been established. Appellant is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">First, we note that Officer Underwood used the word \u201cdetain,\u201d not \u201carrest,\u201d in his testimony. Moreover, after he testified about questioning appellant regarding his address and learning that appellant did not live at 612 Baker Street, Officer Underwood was asked by the prosecutor: \u201cAnd was [appellant] ultimately placed under arrest?\u201d, to which Officer Underwood replied: \u201cThat is correct, he was.\u201d Second, there simply is no evidence that Officer Underwood made a custodial arrest of appellant at the time that Officer Underwood said that appellant \u201cwas detained.\u201d Officer Underwood was not asked any questions by either the prosecutor or defense counsel about what he meant by \u201cdetaining\u201d appellant or what he did to \u201cdetain\u201d appellant. Clearly, during a valid <em>Terry </em>stop, a police officer has the right \u201cto stop and briefly detain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>an individual.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>409 Md. at 440, 975 A.2d 877. Finally, our standard of review requires that we consider the evidence \u201cand <em>the inferences that may be reasonably drawn </em>in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,\u201d in this case, the State. <em>McFarlin, </em>409 Md. at 403, 975 A.2d 862 (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added). Therefore, we infer, from Officer Underwood\u2019s testimony that he \u201cdetained\u201d appellant, that Officer Underwood\u2019s actions were nothing more than a <em>Terry </em>stop and had not yet risen to a custodial arrest. Accordingly, Officer Underwood was entitled to conduct a further investigation into appellant\u2019s status at 612 Baker Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Officer Underwood\u2019s further investigation was chronicled in the following colloquy with the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Did you make any effort to verify whether or not he lived at 612 Baker Street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">[OFFICER UNDERWOOD]: Yes. I asked [appellant] where he lived. He didn\u2019t provide that address. We attempted to make contact with the tenants of 612 Baker Street with no success.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: How did you attempt to make contact with them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">[OFFICER UNDERWOOD]: By knocking on the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: And no one answered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">[OFFICER UNDERWOOD]: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-11\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Do you know where [appellant] resides?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-12\">[OFFICER UNDERWOOD]: To my knowledge, 618 Baker Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-13\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Where is that in relation to 612 Baker Street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-14\">[OFFICER UNDERWOOD]: 612 is \u2014 if you are facing the front, 612 is the far right row house, then you have 614, 616, then you have a driveway, and then you have 618.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-15\">Officer Underwood\u2019s investigation was clearly within the scope of a valid <em>Terry </em>stop because his actions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>directed \u201cto obtain information confirming or dispelling [his] suspicions.\u201d <em>Collins, </em>376 Md. at 368, 829 A.2d 992 (internal quotations omitted). As previously stated, Officer Underwood knew, prior to the <em>Terry </em>stop of appellant, that appellant was not an owner of 612 Baker Street, that 612 Baker Street was \u201cposted conspicuously\u201d with \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs on all sides, and that appellant entered upon 612 Baker Street in the face of those signs. In his investigation, Officer Underwood asked appellant for his address and confirmed his suspicion that appellant did not reside at 612 Baker Street. Officer Underwood also attempted to ascertain whether appellant\u2019s entry was authorized by a resident of 612 Baker Street, but no one answered the knock on the door of 612 Baker Street. There was no evidence that appellant ever told Officer Underwood that he had permission to enter onto 612 Baker Street. The results of the <em>Terry </em>stop thus \u201cwarranted] a prudent person in believing that [appellant] had committed\u201d the misdemeanor crime of trespass on posted property. <em>Haley, </em>398 Md. at 133, 919 A.2d 1200. Accordingly, when Officer Underwood subsequently arrested appellant \u201c[i]n reference to the trespassing,\u201d his actions were supported by probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Appellant\u2019s entire argument is based on the premise that probable cause cannot exist unless the police determined that appellant was prohibited from entering 612 Baker Street. This premise is incorrect. As noted above, notification of a person not to enter or cross private property is an element of the wanton trespass statute and is not present in the trespass on posted property statute. <em>Compare </em>C.L. \u00a7 6-403(a) <em>with </em>C.L. \u00a7 6-402(a). Moreover, none of the cases relied upon by appellant interpret the trespass on posted property statute; they involve only the wanton trespass statute. <em>See In re Jason Allen D., Johnson, </em>and <em>Torres. </em>Thus we conclude that there was no need for the police to confirm that appellant was banned from entering 612 Baker Street in order to have probable cause to arrest appellant for trespassing on posted property.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>In addition, the fact that appellant may well have had permission to enter onto 612 Baker Street does not negate Officer Underwood\u2019s probable cause to arrest appellant for trespass on posted property. As previously mentioned, the exception for a good faith claim of right to enter or cross private property appears only in the wanton trespass statute, not in the trespass on posted property statute. <em>Compare </em>C.L. \u00a7 6-403(a) <em>with </em>C.L. \u00a7 6-402(a). Consequently, although a police officer may ask a suspect about any right or permission to be on the subject property, there is no requirement to do so in order to establish probable cause for arrest for trespass on posted property.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As the trial court correctly pointed out in its ruling, a claim of right or permission to enter onto private property posted against trespassing is, at most, a defense to be raised at trial. <em>Cf. In re Jason Allen D., </em>127 Md.App. at 484, 733 A.2d 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Therefore, when examining the facts adduced from Officer Underwood\u2019s testimony and the inferences that could be reasonably drawn from them in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that there was probable cause to arrest appellant for trespassing on posted property.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WICOMI-CO COUNTY AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\">.
