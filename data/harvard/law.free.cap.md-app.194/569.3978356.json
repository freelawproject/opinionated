On March 11, 2008, the Baltimore City Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation (CHAP), appellee in both matters, held a hearing to consider whether the structure known as the Pennsylvania Railroad Building, located at 200 East Baltimore Street (\u201cthe structure\u201d), should be placed on the Landmark List and/or the Special List of structures having historical or architectural significance. The structure is owned by Baltimore Street Parking Company, LLC,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant. At the March 11, 2008 hearing, CHAP voted to place the structure on the Special List and the Landmark List. Appellant filed a petition for judicial review of CHAP\u2019s determination in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Subsequently, appellant withdrew its request for review of the Landmark List determination on the ground that such review was premature. Appellant continued to seek review of the Special List determination, and on February 20, 2009, the circuit court affirmed CHAP\u2019s decision to place the structure on the Special List. Appellant appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">On September 18, 2008, appellant filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City in which it named CHAP and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (\u201cthe City\u201d), appellees,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as parties. On May 18, 2009, the court dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint for declaratory judgment, and appellant appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Perceiving no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">On appeal, appellant presents two issues for our review, as phrased by us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">I. Whether CHAP violated appellant\u2019s due process rights by denying appellant notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before placing the structure on the Special List.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">II. Whether appellant was properly afforded judicial review by way of administrative mandamus or, if not, whether appellant must be afforded judicial review pursuant to Maryland Code (2006 RepLVol.), \u00a7 3-^401, et. seq. of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d), the Declaratory Judgment Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">In the late 1990\u2019s, appellant began acquiring properties in the area in which the structure is located and entered into discussions with City agencies with respect to development of the area. Several buildings were demolished with appropriate approvals and a surface parking lot was built. The structure in question was not demolished. In a letter dated October 9, 2002, Laurie Schwartz, then Deputy Mayor of the City, wrote to appellant stating that, among other things, the City did not support demolition of the property, but \u201cwould be more inclined to support demolition of [the property] when the request is made within the context of a significant redevelopment project and it can be shown that preserving the building is neither feasible nor desirable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">The next events relevant to this appeal occurred in 2008, but before reviewing them, we pause to briefly outline the applicable legislative enactments. The General Assembly, to \u201cpreserve structures and landmarks of historic and architectural value,\u201d authorized the City to \u201cenact laws for historic and landmark zoning and preservation.\u201d Maryland Code (2003 RepLVol.), Article 66B, \u00a7 2.12. Pursuant to that authority, Article 6, subtitle 3 of the Baltimore City Code sets forth the process for designating Preservation Districts, Landmark Lists, and Special Lists. On the recommendation of the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Planning Commission, CHAP may propose the designation of a Preservation District or designate a structure for the Landmark List, but both require City Council approval. Art. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 3-1 and 3-2. CHAP may place a structure on the Special List without further approvals. Art. 6, \u00a7 3-3. A structure in a Preservation District or on the Landmark List may not be substantially altered without approval of CHAP, after conducting a public hearing on the request to alter. Art. 6, \u00a7 4-1 to 4-6. In contrast, with respect to a request to alter a structure on the Special List, CHAP may cause the issuance of a permit to perform the alteration to be delayed for up to six months. Art. 6, \u00a7 4-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">By notice dated December 26, 2007, CHAP advised appellant that it would hold a public hearing on January 8, 2008, to consider placing the structure on the Landmark List and Special List.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">At the January 8, 2008 hearing, appellant requested that it be postponed. Fred Shoken,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> CHAP\u2019s staff presenter, related facts relevant to the structure\u2019s historical, architectural and cultural significance. Alfred Barry III, an employee of AB Associates and a representative of appellant, stated that appellant was given late notice and had insufficient time to prepare for the hearing. Appellant stated that it had \u201cno plans to demolish this building. We haven\u2019t applied for any permits.\u201d CHAP granted the continuance and stated that it would \u201chave public testimony at the future consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">On February 6, 2008,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>counsel for appellant sent a letter to the Baltimore City Planning Department (\u201cthe Planning Department\u201d) and to Baltimore Development Corporation (\u201cBDC\u201d), referencing a meeting held on February 5 or 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>regarding the structure and \u201csummarizing the history of [their] existing agreement\u201d in order to \u201cbetter formalize that agreement and obviate any reason for CHAP designation of [the property].\u201d The letter outlined the history of appellant\u2019s acquisition of the property, which included that appellant acquired the property \u201cin July of 1998 following an earlier purchase that year of the Tower Building parking lot.... Both acquisitions were part of a planned long-term acquisition of the entire block for future redevelopment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The letter noted that the Urban Renewal Plan (\u201cURP\u201d), approved in May of 2001, included acquisition authority for three Baltimore properties for demolition, but \u201cnotably\u201d, the structure was not included on the URP\u2019s Notable Properties List.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The author of the letter expressed the view that the URP and the design review process should control the redevelopment of the area and that \u201cCHAP designation of the building would create a bifurcated authority, with different bodies having jurisdiction over portions of the larger site that would potentially be conflicting and would significantly impede the redevelopment process for the site.\u201d The letter proposed to \u201cdraft and enter into a formal agreement with your Departments that would ensure that this analysis relating to the building be accomplished as part of the City\u2019s review of the development plans for the site ..., with the understanding that the proposed CHAP designation be withdrawn in connection with the execution of such more formal agreement.\u201d Appellant noted that it \u201chopes to reach an agreement in principal [sic] before the next scheduled CHAP hearing on March 11th.\u201d Based on our review of the transcript of the March 11, 2008 hearing, it appears that Kathleen Kotarba, CHAP\u2019s executive director, Mr. Shoken, and representatives of BDC, the Planning Department, and Downtown Partnership of Baltimore attended the meeting held on February 5 or 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>On February 22, 2008, Mr. Barry, on behalf of appellant, wrote a letter to the Planning Department enclosing an \u201cinitial draft agreement [they] discussed\u201d relating to the structure. The letter reflected copies to BDC, CHAP, and Downtown Partnership. The draft agreement provided, among other things, that appellant would not demolish the structure, and the Special List and Landmark List designations by CHAP would be withdrawn. The draft agreement contained signature lines for the Planning Department, BDC, the City, and CHAP. The author stated that he would \u201cappreciate confirmation that [appellant] does not have to prepare for the March 11th CHAP hearing\u201d and that the hearing would be continued \u201cpending resolution of this alternative.\u201d The requested confirmation did not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">On February 28, 2008, CHAP sent a formal notice to appellant, advising that it would hold a public hearing on March 11, 2008, \u201cto consider Baltimore City Landmark and Special List designation of [the property].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">At the March 11, 2008 hearing, Mr. Shoken made a presentation as to the location of the structure, the designation of other buildings in the area, and the history of the structure. Mr. Shoken advised that the structure was built after the Baltimore Fire and showed a photograph from a newspaper in 1905, showing the ground floor of the structure. Mr. Shoken advised that the property was included in a 2001 \u201cHABS survey\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> entitled, \u201cTen Enduring Landmarks of Baltimore\u2019s Central Business District.\u201d Mr. Shoken stated that \u201cone of the things that [is] unique about this building ... is [that it is] only one of two buildings surviving on this block\u201d and that \u201cby retaining these buildings, you retain that history and the historical remembrance of what\u2019s there.... \u201d Mr. Shoken concluded that \u201cin applying the [CHAP] criteria, the building meets those standards of number one, four and five.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">After Mr. Shoken presented the facts supporting the designation of the property, the chairman and presiding commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>sioner stated they were \u201cmoving on to representatives from [appellant].\u201d Appellant had four representatives at the hearing, namely, Albert Figinski, appellant\u2019s counsel, Victoria Morrison, appellant\u2019s executive vice president and general counsel, Mr. Barry, and Mark Gellman, an employee of Edison Properties, LLC. The following ensued at the hearing, in pertinent part.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: I\u2019m here because we have asked for a postponement of this hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">What you are going to do today to this property amounts to a temporary or permanent injunction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">I[n] the law, those attempting to get a temporary or permanent injunction need to show some irreparable harm or some balance of convenience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">And I suggest to you that the record demonstrated by the documents which I have asked to be placed in the record do not demonstrate either irreparable harm or a balance of convenience for the designation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">On February 13th, Mr. Barry wrote to the Commission thanking them for their postponement of the January hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">In January you postponed the hearing because of insufficient notice given to us in December.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-11\">We stated in that letter what we would do would be to meet with members of this group, as well as other representatives of the City and come up with some kind of agreement that would protect any conceivable City interest, at the same time not placing what I consider to be a temporary or permanent injunction upon this property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-12\">On February 22nd, Mr. Barry wrote to [the Planning Department], telling [it] that here\u2019s an initial draft of an agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-13\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>On February 6th, there was a meeting, I believe you had representatives there, representatives from BDC were there, the Director of the Planning Commission was there, and other members of the City superstructure were there. And a draft agreement was produced. That draft agreement I suspect is part of your record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-4\">It is at least four pages in length. Now, this is draft. This is not a flaming arrow. This is a beginning of discussion. But what I am suspecting by the motions that may follow, is that you wish to cut off those discussions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">That would be a tragedy. It would be a tragedy for the process, and it would be a tragedy for the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">It would be a tragedy because the agreement suggests that we will work with this group, as well as other groups, to come up with an appropriate plan for the entire site. This is not done in a vacuum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">MR. BARRY: [I]t really speaks to the heart of whether or not the City of Baltimore wants to enter into transparent and good faith negotiations with the developer, a substantial developer, and have those agreements undermined by actions by this body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">And I think we left that meeting on February 6 with members of your staff, Mr. Shoken was there, feeling that we were going to submit an agreement, it was going to be reviewed by the City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">And if ... anybody had issues with it, we would have the opportunity to respond. And your action today is premature, and it\u2019s unnecessary and you ought to postpone it. But to speak to the agreement and [appellant\u2019s history of this going back to the [T]ower [B]uilding demolition, the adjacent building demolition, the creation by City Council of a parking lot, the acquisition ultimately in 1998 by [appellant] of that parking lot, and the beginnings of discussions with the City over that entire block.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-10\">That began in 1998, ten years ago. And during that time, we went back to the City Council, we went back and got <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>approval to tear the other buildings down. And you\u2019ll hear from Mr. Gellman [regarding the] specific agreement with the City relating to this building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">Now, I think it is notable, and I use that term deliberately, that at that same time the City was redoing its [URP] for the central business district. And it was a two year process by the [Planning [Department and BDC. CHAP was very much involved in that, Preservation Maryland was very much involved in that....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">This building ... was never included on the notable list. CHAP gave a list to the City. It was never part of the draft ordinances. It was never approved by the City Council. And I think that\u2019s important in that [appellant] goes into buying these properties saying ... it can\u2019t be that important, if it\u2019s not part of the overall process that took two years to complete, number one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">Secondly, BDC and [the] Planning [Department] proposed buying this building along with the three adjacent buddings on Baltimore Street that Mr. Shoken talked about and showed you some pictures of, and proposed to tear those down for ... open space, as part of the [URP].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">They wanted to buy those buildings and designate it for open space. When [appellant] was approached about that, we owned the building, we said, if you\u2019re going to buy those buildings for open space, you obviously want to do it as part of an overall development plan for the whole block.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">We are in the process of negotiating for all of those. You don\u2019t need to buy our building. Whatever you do for the other buildings, we have and we began, as you\u2019ll hear from Mr. Gellman, a discussion with the City that we were going to buy the whole block.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">We had every intention of buying it. And ... we had every approval from the City to tear those buildings down, with one exception, and the one exception was the corner building before you today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>This building, if it\u2019s designated, is the tail wagging the dog. Because you should not have a bifurcated process that says this building has designation, the rest of the block has another design approval under the renewal plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\">[I]f you don\u2019t postpone it ... [it] is a bad faith effort in terms of how to treat a substantial developer for the site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">MR. GELLMAN: First came across the property in 1997, when the original \u2014 configuration of the parking lot was for sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">When we went under contract for the parking lot ... I did my due diligence for the property. I met with City officials, I met with the Mayor\u2019s office, [BDC], the Downtown Partnership.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">And what I learned ... was that it was the City\u2019s interest to demolish all of the buildings right up to Calvert Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">So we purchased the parking lot \u2014 we actually closed on the parking lot in March of 1998. We closed on [the structure] in July of 1998. I immediately began negotiating for the other properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">But we got full encouragement and support from the City, from the Mayor\u2019s Office, by BDC, from Downtown Partnership, to try to acquire all of the properties so there could be an integrated development on this site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">We began negotiations with the other owners, and it took several years until we acquired the other three properties. And the City which supported us to buy all of the properties, and were talking about demolition, now asked us, could we leave [the structure] up....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-11\">The answer we got was that they didn\u2019t want the parking all the way out to Calvert Street, because the parking was going to be a temporary use, which is what parking is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>I agreed with the Mayor\u2019s office, that we would not seek any demolition plans or permits for [the structure]. That we would only demolish the other three buildings. We would expand the parking lot, and it didn\u2019t seem like an unreasonable thing for us to agree to, considering that the reason was that they didn\u2019t want this parking lot all the way up to Calvert Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">We agreed to that, after discussions. We had a written agreement to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">[M]aybe I should have had a more formal agreement than just between us and the Mayor\u2019s office, but it was an agreement, until recently when we were approached by this organization to want to designate this building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">MS. MORRISON: [W]e have submitted a draft agreement to the City to make more formal our long standing agreement with the city regarding the site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">Let me walk you through the draft agreement....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-11\">It says any time that we are prepared to pursue a specific redevelopment plan, an architectural and economic feasibility analysis of incorporating this property into the overall development for the entire site will be prepared by us for the City\u2019s review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-12\">The City, through [the Planning Department] and BDC will review the plans, under all of the applicable criteria.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-13\">CHAP and its staff will have full access to the submitted material for their review, and prepare recommendations to [the Planning Department] on the redevelopment plans and the alternatives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-14\">Under the terms of the 2003 City Council approval, [the Planning Department\u2019s] design approval shall be required for the redevelopment plans. We will not apply for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>demolition or alteration permit until such time as final design approval has been obtained from [the] Planning [Department], We\u2019ll maintain it in a clean and secure condition to prevent further deterioration. And that the special list and landmark designations by CHAP will be withdrawn and this procedure used in place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">We voluntarily agreed with the City a number of years ago not to demolish this building....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">Yet placing us on the special list abrogates that agreement with the City, and would impose an entire overlay of vague burdens that would disturb the integrated process that we have already begun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">The special list and landmark designations ... would separate this little piece from the entire site, and it would represent an ad hoc attempt at achieving protection against midnight demolition that\u2019s already in place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">CHAIRMAN: [W]e have two actions before us, special list and landmark designation ... [0]ur focus charge is whether or not this meets the criteria and we should consider these documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">[Appellant\u2019s draft agreement was distributed to the parties and representatives.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: What this document does ... [is] demonstrates a pattern of negotiation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-11\">[CHAP is] an independent agency. No one is trying to ram anything down your throat. However, I would suggest to you that our initial request is that this be postponed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>[I]f you don\u2019t postpone it ... I want you to know that we object to that, because we haven\u2019t really had an opportunity to adequately prepare an assault on this designation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">[T]he Pennsylvania Railroad and the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad at the time of the Baltimore City fire were in conspiracy to come up with a monopolistic control of the railroads.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">They plotted to have the B &amp; 0 build a big building and the Pennsylvania interest, although it would be dominant, to be a little building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">Now, I suggest to you it\u2019s not something you want to historically designate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">CHAIRMAN: Obviously we need to consider what they\u2019re presenting and the legal aspects of it, but our true role today is applying the criteria for special list and landmark designation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">[Appellant], I\u2019m going to give you one more opportunity to speak and we need to move on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: My summary is as follows: There\u2019s no impending need for this designation. The draft agreement is not final. It is a draft. [T]his company has worked with the City to try to come up with a plan for an integrated site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-12\">We believe that you should postpone this vote. And I urge you to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-14\">CHAP COMMISSIONER: What period of time are you requesting for a postponement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-15\">$ }{? <em>tfc</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-16\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: ... [A]t least 60 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-17\">John McClay from Baltimore Heritage testified that the structure \u201cwas placed on the Baltimore Heritage Preservation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>watch list in 2003, one of the original buildings on that list.\u201d Mr. McClay spoke about how the property had been publicized in Style Magazine, the Daily Record, the Baltimore Sun, and was featured in the Baltimore Heritage\u2019s newsletter, \u201cHistoric Buildings We Should Save.\u201d Mr. McClay testified that \u201c[w]e believe that corner buildings are very important in providing historical context.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Kirby Fowler from the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore testified that \u201c[t]his historic building should be part of the texture of a more modern block.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Mr. Fowler also stated the following.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">[Appellant] ... came in and met with the City. I was there, [Ms.] Kotarba, [Mr.] Shoken and others, to discuss what next steps to take.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">And we thought it was a very positive discussion. And as a result of that, the agreement was that [appellant] would go back and produce an agreement that might actually result in the preservation of the building for now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">[Appellant] did so, February 29th ... is when the draft agreement was sent to everyone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">No one from the City got back to [appellant] about it____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">I think there ought to be a good faith approach to something like this. It\u2019s incumbent on all of us to try to negotiate an agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-12\">I think in the end of it we can\u2019t reach some agreement with [appellant], I say let\u2019s landmark this property, let\u2019s do it. But I think it\u2019s not \u2014 we have not been acting in good faith if we never even responded to the draft agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-14\">Following that testimony, the following occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlQ\">CHAIRMAN: We have two considerations in front of us. One is for special list designation, the other is for Baltimore City landmark designation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>We\u2019ve heard the testimony from the owners, and others. We have two agreements that have been referred to. You\u2019ve been given a copy of the letter agreement from October 9th, 2002 between [appellant] and Laurie Schwartz. And I think each of you have been given a copy of the proposed agreement ... referenced throughout this testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">We\u2019re not here to debate the terms of those agreements. Our charge is to consider it for special list and landmark designation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">Is there any further \u2014 are there any further questions or comments from the Commission?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">CHAP Commissioners raised issues regarding appellant\u2019s analogy to an injunction, as well as the effect of the Special List designation, after which Mr. Barry stated the following.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmB\">[W]e left that meeting with [the] Planning [Department], BDC and CHAP thinking that this was not going to be an adversarial hearing, if a hearing at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">So nothing can happen between now and then, because it\u2019s already notified on the special list.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">If we had time following that [January] hearing, we would have prepared to come in with an argument perhaps as to why this does not meet your criteria.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">CHAP voted six to five to deny appellant\u2019s request for a postponement. CHAP then voted unanimously to place the structure on the Special List and the Landmark List. On March 31, 2008, CHAP mailed appellant a letter, stating that at the March 11, 2008 hearing, \u201cthe Commissioners considered the staff report and all testimony presented\u201d and \u201capproved the Special List designation and Baltimore City Landmark.\u201d The letter listed the ways in which the property met the CHAP designation standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>On April 10, 2008, pursuant to Maryland Rule 7-202, appellant filed a petition for judicial review in circuit court. On May 16, 2008, CHAP filed a response to appellant\u2019s petition for judicial review and a motion to dismiss. CHAP argued that judicial review of a decision to place a property on the Landmark and Special Lists was not authorized by statute, that the Landmark designation of the property was not ripe for review, and that the court did not have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">On June 3, 2008, appellant filed a response to CHAP\u2019s motion to dismiss, with a memorandum of points and authorities and a request for a hearing. Appellant argued that there was \u201cinherent judicial power to support judicial review, as well as capacity for review by administrative mandamus,\u201d pursuant to <em>[Reese v. Dep\u2019t of Health </em>&amp; <em>Mental Hygiene, </em>177 Md.App. 102, 144 n. 21, 934 A.2d 1009 (2007) ] and Maryland Rules 7-401, <em>et seq. </em>Appellant also stated that \u201c[t]he City correctly states that the process for Landmark List designation needed further City action and is not renewable now on ripeness grounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">On June 19, 2008, appellant filed a memorandum in support of its petition for judicial review. In appellant\u2019s memorandum, the questions presented were: 1) whether CHAP\u2019s Special List designation on March 11, 2008 was impervious to judicial review and 2) whether appellant was provided sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard at the March 11, 2008 hearing to satisfy due process. Among other things, appellant argued that the \u201cSpecial List designation is not just for a \u2018six month period.... \u2019 Rather, its six month injunction activates when a demolition or alteration permit is requested.\u201d Appellant argued that \u201c[t]he \u201cbrand\u201d of the Special List is ... timeless and limitless and enjoins planning for redevelopment.\u201d Appellant maintained that Article 66B of the Baltimore City Code (\u201cArt. 66B\u201d) authorizes landmark zoning, but does not authorize \u201ca \u2018Special List\u2019 which brands a property and controls it upon \u2018posting.\u2019\u201d Also on June 19, 2008, appellant filed an amended petition for judicial review, noting that it was requesting review of the Special List designation only.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>On July 11, 2008, the circuit court denied CHAP\u2019s motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s petition for judicial review, without prejudice. On September 18, 2008, CHAP filed a renewed motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s petition for judicial review, pursuant to Maryland Rule 7-204(b). In addition to what CHAP argued in its May 16, 2008 motion, it argued that administrative mandamus did not apply to this case because appellants did not timely file their appeal, pursuant to Maryland Rule 7-402.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">On October 10, 2008, appellant filed a response to CHAP\u2019s renewed motion to dismiss. Appellant argued, among other things, that administrative mandamus is applicable to this case because appellant \u201ccomplied with the substance of [Maryland] Rule 7-401, <em>et seq.\u201d </em>and that CHAP received timely notice of appellant\u2019s request for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">On November 5, 2008, the circuit court held a hearing on appellant\u2019s petition for judicial review and CHAP\u2019s renewed motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s petition. On February 20, 2009, the circuit court issued an order and memorandum opinion, affirming CHAP\u2019s decision to place the property on the Special List. In addressing the issue as to whether the circuit court had authority to review the decision of CHAP, the court stated the following.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">Maryland common law recognizes three types of mandamus actions: traditional mandamus, mandamus in aid of appellate jurisdiction and administrative mandamus. Administrative mandamus is applicable in this situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">While technically, [appellant] requested review pursuant to [Maryland] Rule 7-201, given the nearly identical framework, method of proceeding, and timeliness of [appellant\u2019s] appeal and Memorandum, this Court believes it is appropriate to convert the basis for the appeal to [Maryland] Rule 7-401 <em>et seq.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">Jurisdictions other than the City are mandated to permit appeals in historical landmark matters pursuant to ... Art. 66B \u00a7 8.15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Baltimore is not bound by the Statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">The ordinance in the Baltimore City Code restricting judicial review of Special List designation erects a legislative classification that is unique to Baltimore City. This classification endows county residents with an opportunity for judicial review of certain zoning decision[s] which are denied to Baltimore City residents. This is a violation of equal protection. For these reasons, this Court holds that [appellant] can appeal CHAP\u2019s decision to put [the property] on the Special Designation List and denies [appellees\u2019] Renewed Motion to Dismiss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In addressing whether there was \u201csubstantial evidence in the record before CHAP to support its decision to place [the property] on the Special List,\u201d the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">CHAP accommodated [appellant\u2019s] request to postpone the decision at the January meeting. The Commissioners considered and rejected a second request for continuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As_\">[Appellant] was put on notice at the January meeting that CHAP intended to consider Special List designation for the property on March 11, 2008 despite negotiations with other City agencies. Often negotiations continue until \u201ctrial[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"alc-dedup-0\">[Appellant] had ample notice and opportunity to prepare for the March meeting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">* $ *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-9\">CHAP, after hearing testimony from all interested parties, voted to place [the property] on the Special List designation. It did so after consideration of [appellant\u2019s] counsel and witnesses, who attended the meeting. Counsel for [appellant] was invited to rebut any of the testimony supporting the designation. At no time, was a request made to cross-examine witnesses or were any witnesses denied the right to address the Commissioners. The testimony included a history of the building, expert testimony and testimony from the staff. Deference must be given to CHAP\u2019s fact-finding and decision making. Its decision was not premised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>on an erroneous conclusion of law. Further, there is sufficient evidence in the record for a reasoning mind to reach the same factual conclusion CHAP did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\">For the reasons indicated, this Court affirms the decision of [CHAP] to place [the property] on Baltimore City\u2019s Special List Designation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">On March 2, 2009, appellant filed a motion for reconsideration of the circuit court\u2019s February 20, 2009 order. On March 24, 2009, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">On April 22, 2009, appellant noted an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">On September 18, 2008, appellant filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in circuit court, pursuant to CJP \u00a7 3-401, et seq. Appellant\u2019s complaint asked for \u201can interpretation or invalidation of the \u2018Special List\u2019 designation imposed by [CHAP]____\u201d Appellant filed the complaint because CHAP \u201cstated its intentions to renew [its] Motion to Dismiss [the petition for judicial review]. If [CHAP] is correct that judicial review under Title 7 of the Maryland Rules ... is unavailable to [appellant], the \u2018Special List\u2019 designation is unconstitutional because it imposes a burden on the property without judicial review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">On March 11, 2009, appellees filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that, in accordance with the February 20, 2009 order issued by the circuit court, there was no genuine dispute of material fact. Appellees argued, among other things, that because appellant \u201cbrought its claims by way of an appeal of a decision of CHAP under rules 7-202 and 7-402 governing appeals from administrative agencies, and where those rules constitute a special form of remedy governing such appeals, relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act [is] unavailable.\u201d Appellees argued that \u201cthis court\u2019s findings in the administrative appeal [have] finalized all disputes as to any material facts raised by [appellant] and as a result[,] [appel-lees] are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">On May 18, 2009, the circuit court held a hearing on appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted it. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>court held that appellant cannot \u201ccircumvent the special statutory remedy which the Court has found is the appropriate way to proceed by bringing the Declaratory Judgment action, pursuant to [CJP \u00a7 3-409(b) ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">On May 28, 2009, appellant noted an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">On July 16, 2009, appellant filed a motion to consolidate the two appeals. On July 17, 2009, this Court ordered that the two cases be consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We shall incorporate additional facts as necessary in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">\u201cThe basis for judicial review of a decision by a local administrative or legislative body acting in an adjudicatory or quasi-judicial capacity may be (1) a statute or (2) common law or an equity writ (mandamus, injunction, certiorari, or declaratory judgment).\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Mayor of </em>Baltimore, 169 Md.App. 655, 666, 906 A.2d 415 (2006) (quoting <em>Criminal Injuries Comp. Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 500, 331 A.2d 55 (1975)).

Baltimore City Code Art. 6, \u00a7 3-3(a)(l) and (a)(2) (\u201cArt. 6\u201d) provide that CHAP \u201cshall compile and maintain a [Special List] .... that [CHAP] considers to be of such historical or architectural importance ... that these ... structures should be extended the secondary protections of \u00a7 4-7 ... of this article.\u201d Art. 6, \u00a7 3-3(b)(2) states that the procedure to adopt a Special List includes that CHAP must \u201ccause a conspicuous sign to be posted on each structure proposed to be placed on a Special List, giving notice\u201d of a public hearing on whether the structure should appear on the Special List and the time and place of the hearing. Art. 6, \u00a7 3 \u2014 3(b)(3) states that \u201cpublic hearing shall be held no sooner than 10 days nor later than 20 days from the time the sign is posted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Appellant contends that it was denied due process in that it was not afforded adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard. Appellant makes three arguments in support of that contention. In each argument, appellant asserts that designation on the Special List does not meet the due process safeguards provided by <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v. New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978). First, appellant argues that it was denied meaningful notice of the March 11, 2008 hearing and that at the March 11, 2008 hearing, it was denied the opportunity to be heard. Second, appellant argues that CHAP\u2019s Special List designation indefinitely burdens the property because \u201cno guidance for administrative review and postponement can extend beyond six months.\u201d Third, appellant argues that Art. 66B authorizes \u201clandmark\u201d zoning but not \u201cSpecial List\u201d zoning and that the Special List designation is inconsistent with the URP because the property is not listed as one of the URP\u2019s Notable Properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>The <em>Penn Central </em>Court held that a New York City law which preserved historic landmarks and historic districts by placing restrictions on the development of individual historic landmarks did not constitute a \u201ctaking\u201d requiring a payment of \u201cjust compensation,\u201d pursuant to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 107, 136, 138, 98 S.Ct. 2646. Appellant identifies five \u201cexplicit\u201d safeguards approved in <em>Penn Central: </em>(1) the importance of \u201cpreservation of buildings and areas with historic or aesthetic importance,\u201d <em>Penn Central, </em>438 U.S. at 107, 98 S.Ct. 2646; (2) the importance of a State enabling act, <em>Id. </em>at 108-109, 98 S.Ct. 2646; (3) giving all interested parties an opportunity to be heard, <em>Id. </em>at 110-111, 98 S.Ct. 2646; (4) consideration of a master plan, <em>Id. </em>at 111, 98 S.Ct. 2646; and (5) the ability of the owner to seek judicial review of the final designation decision. <em>Id. </em>Appellant argues that \u201cat least four of the five safeguards are foreign to the Special List practice,\u201d thus supporting its contention that it must be afforded sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">\n<em>Proceedings at March, 11 Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Appellant explains that it was provided insufficient notice because \u201cCHAP provided [ajppellant with only ten days\u2019 notice of the March 11, 2008\u201d hearing and, consequently, appellant \u201chad insufficient time to produce the expert testimony needed to deflect any purported evidence of historic and architectural significance.\u201d Appellant contends that this time period was insufficient because the parties were in the midst of negotiations and \u201cit did not expect an adversarial hearing.\u201d Appellant further contends that it was not provided sufficient opportunity for cross-examination at the March 11, 2008 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The failure of an administrative official or board to give a proper notice of a hearing, required by law, prevents the official or board from conducting a valid hearing. <em>Cassidy v. County Board of Appeals, </em>218 Md. 418, 421-22, 146 A.2d 896 (1958). The essence of due process is the requirement that the party be given \u201cnotice of the case against him and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>opportunity to meet it.\u201d <em>Mathews v.

Basslers, Inc., </em>56 Md.App. 507, 519, 468 A.2d 383 (1983) (quoting <em>Cassidy, </em>218 Md. at 424, 146 A.2d 896).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Due process requires the opportunity to be heard \u201cat a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Mathews, </em>424 U.S. at 333, 96 S.Ct. 893 (quoting <em>Armstrong v. Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965)). \u201cAll that is necessary is that the procedures be tailored, in light of the decision to be made, to the capacities and circumstances of those who are to be heard ... to insure that they are given a meaningful opportunity to present their case.\u201d <em>Mathews, </em>424 U.S. at 349, 96 S.Ct. 893 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">On December 16, 2007, appellant received its first notice scheduling a hearing with respect to the Special List designation. CHAP held the hearing more than 10 days later, on January 8, 2008. <em>See </em>Art. 6, \u00a7 3-3(b)(3). At the January 8, 2008 hearing, after CHAP presented evidence of the property\u2019s historical, architectural and cultural significance, appellant requested a postponement of the hearing and was granted it. The date of the continued hearing was not stated on the record at the January hearing. CHAP\u2019s chairman did state that \u201cit would have public testimony at the future consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>ation.\u201d Therefore, at the January 8, 2008 hearing, appellant was aware that CHAP intended to hold a hearing in the future. By the time of the February 6, 2008 letter, it was on notice of the March 11, 2008 hearing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Between the January 8, 2008 hearing and the March 11, 2008 hearing, at least some of the interested entities engaged in negotiations, which included a letter written by appellant\u2019s representative on February 22, 2008, that stated appellant would \u201cappreciate confirmation that [it] does not have to prepare for the March 11th CHAP hearing\u201d and that the hearing would be continued \u201cpending resolution of this alternative.\u201d Appellant never received such confirmation. On February 28, 2008, CHAP sent a formal notice to appellant, advising that CHAP would hold the public hearing on March 11, 2008. <em>See </em>Art. 6, \u00a7 3-3(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">At the March 11, 2008 hearing, appellant had four representatives present, none of whom presented any evidence that appellant did not receive \u201cnotice of the case against [it].\u201d <em>See Mathews, </em>424 U.S. at 348-49, 96 S.Ct. 893. Appellant and its representatives provided information about the history of appellant\u2019s acquisition of the property, the ongoing negotiations between the parties, and the initial draft agreement written by appellant. One of appellant\u2019s representatives stated that appellant was under the impression it was going to submit an agreement and if \u201canybody had issues with it, [appellant] would have the opportunity to respond.\u201d Counsel for appellant reiterated that the draft agreement \u201cdemonstrates a pattern of negotiation\u201d and that if CHAP did not postpone the hearing, appellant objects on the basis that it had not \u201creally had an opportunity to adequately prepare an assault on this designation.\u201d Additionally, appellant\u2019s counsel stated that the structure was part of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d between The Pennsylvania Railroad and the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad and suggested that the structure is \u201cnot something you want to historically designate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">When CHAP asked appellant to summarize its argument, appellant stated that \u201c[t]here\u2019s no impending need for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>designation. The draft agreement is not final. It is a draft. [T]his company has worked with the City to try to come up \u2022with a plan for an integrated site,\u201d and that appellant believed CHAP should postpone the hearing. Further, appellant claimed that \u201c[i]f [it] had time following that [January] hearing, [it] would have prepared to come in with an argument perhaps as to why this does not meet your criteria.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">While appellant asserts that it was \u201cassured there would be no CHAP hearing as long as negotiations continued,\u201d there are no evidentiary materials in the record to support the assertion. Similarly, there is no evidence that appellant was not \u201capprised clearly of the character of the action proposed and enough of the basis upon which it rests to enable [it] intelligently to prepare for the hearing.\u201d <em>See Cassidy, </em>218 Md. at 424, 146 A.2d 896. Appellant was given the opportunity to present evidence and to cross-examine the persons who testified on the merits of the proposed designations but did not do so. Accordingly, appellant was \u201cgiven a meaningful opportunity to present [its] case.\u201d <em>Mathews, </em>424 U.S. at 349, 96 S.Ct. 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">\n<em>Indefinite Burden</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Appellant argues that once a property is designated for the Special List, \u201cCHAP enjoys limitless discretion to postpone the issuance of any permits each and every time a property owner applies for a permit.\u201d Art. 6, \u00a7 4-7. Appellant observes that \u201cCHAP has no published standards for processing permit applications for properties on the Special List\u201d and thus, \u201cno guidance for administrative review and postponement can extend beyond six months.\u201d Appellant concludes that the Special List imposes a \u201climitless restraint\u201d and \u201cmakes essential, for due process, a post-constraint hearing that fulfills procedural due process, not afforded at the March 11, 2008 CHAP hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">CHAP contends that appellant\u2019s \u201cindefinite burden\u201d contention was not raised before CHAP and thus, is not preserved for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>We note that a party \u201cmay not obtain judicial review of a matter when he or she failed to properly raise the matter before the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Heft v. Maryland Racing Com., </em>323 Md. 257, 273-74, 592 A.2d 1110 (1991). Appellant does not make this argument as a stand alone argument, however. As it did in circuit court, appellant observes that the asserted defects are a reason why there was a need for a meaningful hearing on March 11, which appellant asserts it did not receive. As we have already stated, we conclude that appellant was not unlawfully denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Moreover, we see no constitutional violation on the face of the ordinance in question. Art. 6, \u00a7 3-3(a)(l) and (a)(2) provide that CHAP \u201cshall compile and maintain a [Special List] .... that [CHAP] considers to be of such historical or architectural importance ... that these ... structures should be extended the secondary protections of \u00a7 4-7 ... of this article.\u201d Art. 6, \u00a7 3-3(c) provides that from the time notice is posted until CHAP makes its final determination as to the designation of the structure, the structure \u201cis subject to the requirements and procedures of Subtitle 4.\u201d CHAP must hold a public hearing not sooner than 10 days nor later than 20 days from the time the sign was posted. Art. 6, \u00a7 3-3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Art. 6, \u00a7 4-l(a) and (b) provide that when a structure is placed on the Special List, changes may not be made to the structure without first obtaining a permit from the Department of Housing and Community Development (\u201cDHCD\u201d). Art. 6, \u00a7 4-2(a) provides that, upon receipt of an application for a permit, DHCD must forward the plans to CHAP within 5 days of receipt of the application. Art. 6, \u00a7 4-2(c) provides that DHCD may not issue a permit for changes to or demolition of the structure until CHAP authorizes it or \u201cproceeds as provided in this article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Art. 6, \u00a7 4-3 provides that if CHAP does not authorize the issuance of a permit, it shall schedule a hearing \u201cno sooner than 10 days nor later than 20 days\u201d after notice is given. Art. 6, \u00a7 4-4(a) provides that CHAP must determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>to issue the permit within 15 days of the hearing and must consider certain factors set forth in Art. 6, \u00a7 4-4(b). Art. 6, \u00a7 4r-7(b) provides that if CHAP decides to deny issuance of the permit, it must notify DHCD to postpone issuance of the permit for up to six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">CHAP placed the structure in question on the Special List and provided notice of a hearing to appellant. Appellant has not applied to DHCD for a permit to make changes or demolish the property. However, even if appellant did apply for a permit and CHAP refused to approve it, appellant would be entitled to another hearing. If unsuccessful at that hearing, the effect would be to delay the issuance of a permit for up to six months. CHAP does not enjoy \u201climitless discretion,\u201d and the ordinance provides opportunities for the structure owner to provide input.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">\n<em>Inconsistency with enabling act and URP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Appellant contends that the Special List provisions are inconsistent with Art. 66B, \u00a7 2.12, which expressly authorizes \u201clandmark\u201d zoning, but does not expressly authorize \u201cSpecial List\u201d zoning. Further, appellant contends that the Special List designation is inconsistent with the City\u2019s URP because the structure is not listed as one of the URP\u2019s Notable Properties. Appellant contends that the Special List designation \u201cimposes burdens unmentioned in the urban renewal ordinance.\u201d Again, as was true of the last argument, appellant makes the argument to emphasize the importance of receiving a meaningful hearing. We address it in that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Art. 66B, \u00a7 2.12, entitled \u201cHistoric and landmark zoning and preservation,\u201d provides that, \u201c[t]o preserve structures and landmarks of historic and architectural value as a public purpose of the State, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City may enact laws for historic and landmark zoning and preservation.\u201d Art. 66B, \u00a7 2.12 was enacted \u201c[f]or the purpose of preserving structures and landmarks of historic and architectural value as a public purpose in this State.\u201d 2000 Md. Laws 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Pursuant to Art. 6, \u00a7 3-3, CHAP is empowered to maintain a Special List that CHAP \u201cconsiders to be of such historical or architectural importance ... that these ... structures should be extended the secondary protections.... \u201d Given that the purpose of Art. 66B, \u00a7 2.12 was to \u201cpreserve] structures ... of historic and architectural value,\u201d the Special List designation meets that purpose and is encompassed within Art. 66B, \u00a7 2.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">The Baltimore City Code, Art. 13, \u00a7 2.5(b)(1) (\u201cArt. 13\u201d) defines a \u201cRenewal Plan\u201d as a plan \u201cfor the elimination, correction, or the prevention of the development or the spread of slums, blight, or deterioration in an entire Renewal Area or a portion thereof.\u201d <em>120 W. Fayette St., LLLP v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>407 Md. 253, 258 n. 1, 964 A.2d 662 (2009). In the URP for the Central Business District, Baltimore City Ordinance No. 01-170, there are 39 \u201cNotable Properties\u201d listed, of which the \u201cpreservation, maintenance, improvement, and continued use ... are deemed significant to the overall well-being and quality of the City.\u201d The URP lists five development standards for Notable Properties, providing specific criteria where demolition of a Notable Property is allowed, as well as procedures for obtaining a permit to demolish a Notable Property, including the requirement of \u201cpublic notice of the proposed demolition for a period of 12 months.\u201d Baltimore City Ordinance No. 01-170.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">As stated, a structure on the Special List is afforded preservation protections as a result of being identified as historically or architecturally important. Art. 6, \u00a7 3-3. The goal is the same, but the protections of the Special List are more limited and exist for a limited period of time. <em>See </em>Art. 6, \u00a7 4-7(b) (if CHAP decides to deny issuance of a permit, it may cause delay in issuance up to six months). We perceive no actionable inconsistency. Without commenting on the merits, this and the preceding argument may be more properly addressed to a designation of a structure on the Landmark List.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>\n<em>Judicial Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The parties agree that appellant was properly afforded judicial review pursuant to administrative mandamus, Maryland Rule 7-401 (governs actions for judicial review of a quasi-judicial order or action of an administrative agency). Appellant does not claim that it was entitled to a declaratory judgment, as distinguished from judicial review. Appellant argues that if this Court decides that appellant should not be afforded judicial review by way of administrative mandamus, appellant should be afforded the ability to pursue a declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Art. 66B, \u00a7 8.15 provides that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by a decision of a historic district commission or historic preservation commission may appeal the decision in the manner provided for an appeal from the decision of the zoning board or commission of the local jurisdiction.\u201d However, Art. 66B, \u00a7 2.13 states, in pertinent part, that \u201c\u00a7\u00a7 3.01 through 8.15 of this article do not apply in Baltimore City.\u201d The circuit court concluded that, while appellant filed its petition pursuant to Maryland Rule 7-201, it could proceed pursuant to Maryland Rule 7-401. We agree with the circuit court, and appellant was properly afforded judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">\n<em>Substantial Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Appellant does not directly raise the question whether CHAP\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. When a court reviews the decision of an administrative agency, it must apply the \u201csubstantial evidence test\u201d to determine \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119 (1978). In reviewing an administrative agency\u2019s decision, \u201ccourts will act where a decision is not supported by facts, or where an action is not within the scope of delegated authority, or is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Baltimore Import Car Service &amp; Storage, Inc. v. Maryland Port Authority, </em>258 Md. 335, 342, 265 A.2d 866 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>The evidence presented at the March 11, 2008 hearing by CHAP\u2019s staff presenter and other persons regarding the location of the property, the designation of other buildings in that area, and the history of the property was sufficient to meet the substantial evidence test. Given appellant\u2019s meager response as to why the structure should not be on the Special List and the evidence as to its architectural and historical significance, a reasoning mind could have reached the same factual conclusion as CHAP. <em>See Bulluck, </em>283 Md. at 512, 390 A.2d 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.
