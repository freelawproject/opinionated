On June 6, 2008, appellant was sentenced to two years incarceration for carrying a handgun, and a concurrent sentence of two years for carrying a concealed dangerous weapon. Appellant timely appealed and presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-11\">1. Was it plain error material to the rights of the accused for the trial judge to conduct the voir dire by posing all the questions at once and then calling individual jurors to the bench to discuss their responses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-12\">2. Was it error to respond to a jury question about the elements of the crime of wearing, carrying or transporting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>handgun on one\u2019s person by sending to the jury a copy of the applicable statute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">3. Was the evidence insufficient to sustain the Appellant\u2019s conviction for carrying a handgun on his person?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">For the following reasons, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Officer David Simmons, of the Baltimore City Police Department, and accepted as an expert in the use of radar, testified that on June 23, 2007, at around 2:50 p.m., he was on patrol in a marked police vehicle near the 3200 block of Reisterstown Road. Officer Simmons noticed a Ford Explorer traveling northbound at a speed of 50 miles per hour, which was in excess of the posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour. Officer Simmons watched the vehicle pass his location, and then turn right near the 2500 block of Druid Hill Park Drive. Officer Simmons then proceeded to follow the Explorer and testified that he \u201chad to travel at a pretty high rate of speed to catch up with the vehicle.\u201d After activating his emergency lights and siren, Officer Simmons then stopped the Explorer.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">Officer Simmons approached the Explorer and spoke to the vehicle\u2019s driver, appellant in this case. Sitting in the front passenger seat was appellant\u2019s co-defendant at trial, Berry Green. After advising appellant of the reason for the stop, appellant informed Officer Simmons that his driver\u2019s license was suspended. Officer Simmons confirmed this information over his police radio, and learned that appellant\u2019s license had been suspended for a failure to appear in traffic court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">Officer Simmons directed appellant to exit the vehicle and then brought him to the back of his patrol vehicle. From that location, Officer Simmons also was able to see that Green, the passenger in the Explorer, was \u201cbending over in the passenger side of the vehicle as if he was stuffing something underneath the seat.\u201d Officer Simmons further testified that, based on his training and experience, which included looking for \u201ccertain signs that maybe there may be a weapon, there may be some drugs in the car, or maybe because you might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>attempting to try to hide something,\u201d it appeared to Officer Simmons that Green was attempting to conceal something. While Officer Simmons made these observations, he asked appellant if there were any drugs or weapons in the Explorer, and appellant replied that there were none.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">At this point, Officer Simmons radioed for backup. Once those units arrived, Officer Simmons advised appellant that he was being arrested for driving on a suspended license. Officer Simmons again asked appellant if there were any drugs or guns in the Explorer, and appellant replied that there was a \u201cfishing knife underneath the driver side seat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Officer Simmons went to the driver\u2019s side seat and found \u201cwhat was, appeared to be a battle knife to me. The knife had what\u2019s pretty much like a brass knuckle holding for you to hold on it, and it had spikes coming form [sic] the portion where the fist is wrapped around it, and it also had a long blade which was definitely not used for fishing.\u201d The knife was admitted into evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Officer Simmons then had Green step out of the vehicle and the police continued to search for more weapons. Officer Ronald Zimmora, who had responded to the scene, informed Officer Simmons that he found a loaded gun underneath the passenger side seat. Officer Simmons asked Officer Zimmora to stay with appellant while he searched the vehicle. After searching the vehicle underneath the passenger side seat, Officer Simmons located a loaded .38 caliber revolver. The butt of that handgun was facing outward towards the passenger seat. The revolver was admitted into evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Officer Simmons demonstrated for the jury where the two weapons were found inside the vehicle. He testified that the \u201c[k]nife was under the driver\u2019s side seat, and actually the gun was underneath the passenger side seat.\u201d Further, Officer Simmons agreed with the prosecutor\u2019s question that a person located either in the driver\u2019s seat or the passenger\u2019s seat could \u201creach either of the weapons as they were recovered on June 23rd, 2007.\u201d Both appellant and Green denied knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>the gun. The parties stipulated that the revolver was operable and met the definition of a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Appellant testified on his own behalf and admitted that he was speeding when Officer Simmons performed the traffic stop. Appellant indicated that he did not know his co-defendant, Green, and was just giving Green a ride in exchange for money. Appellant admitted that his license was suspended, but claimed it was for a fine that he had not yet paid. He also informed Officer Simmons that he had a knife near his seat in the vehicle, which he maintained was a fishing knife he used to catch catfish. Appellant also indicated that he had this knife in the vehicle because he had been carjacked at gunpoint on some prior occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Appellant testified that he did not know that the revolver was inside his vehicle. He claimed that Green put the gun there. Appellant also testified that he spoke to Green about the gun, and at some point, apparently while they were in the vehicle, Green told him, \u201cI\u2019m dirty. Let me get out.\u201d Appellant further testified that \u201c[h]e had enough time to throw the gun out.\u201d Appellant maintained that he was not trying to evade Officer Simmons, and also testified, over objection, that he told Green that Green should have told him he had a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">On cross-examination by the State, appellant admitted that he had a prior theft conviction. On cross-examination by his co-defendant, Green, appellant admitted that the knife was both for fishing and for his protection. Appellant also testified that the knife was located on the side of his seat, and not underneath the seat. In rebuttal, Officer Simmons testified that he did not see a knife in plain view, and that he recovered the knife from underneath appellant\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">Appellant first contends that the trial court erred in the manner it conducted voir dire of the prospective jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>under <em>Wright v. State, </em>411 Md. 503, 983 A.2d 519 (2009),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and asks this Court to recognize plain error on this issue. The State responds by conceding that the voir dire in this case was error under <em>Wright, </em>but that, absent an objection by appellant\u2019s counsel, that error does not amount to plain error requiring reversal. For the following reasons, we agree with the State and decline to exercise plain error review of appellant\u2019s first question.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Prior to jury selection, the parties discussed the proposed voir dire, and appellant\u2019s counsel indicated he did not object to the State\u2019s voir dire. The trial court then informed the parties the manner it intended to conduct voir dire as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">All right. Since nobody has any objection of each others [sic] questions, what I will do is, I will merge them all into a single paragraph and ask all the questions at one time. At the end of the voir dire we\u2019ll bring each juror up to the bench and we\u2019ll ask them if they have any response to the questions. We\u2019ll take their responses and then each of you can take limited follow-up questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">And then we\u2019ll finish and we\u2019ll move to the next juror. At the end of the 50th juror, we\u2019ll then do challenge for cause. [Prosecutor], you\u2019ll go first. Indicate the summons number of the person you wish to challenge and pause. Each of you indicate if you agree or disagree. If anybody disagrees, I\u2019ll give you argument to the moving party and the disagreed party, then I\u2019ll rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">If everybody agrees, I\u2019ll grant the challenge \"without hearing any argument. Once we\u2019re done, [Prosecutor], we\u2019ll do [Defense Counsel for Green] the same way. Summons number, pause, agree or disagree, if disagree, moving party, opposing party, and then we\u2019ll do [Defense Counsel for Appellant] the same way. Once we\u2019ve eliminated those people who were challenged for cause, we\u2019ll select a jury by alternative challenge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Appellant did not object to the trial court\u2019s manner of conducting voir dire examination. Thereafter, the prospective jurors entered the courtroom, and the judge informed them as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">I\u2019m going to ask you a series of questions now designed to determine whether you would be unfair to any of the three parties involved in the case, or otherwise unable to reach a unanimous verdict. I\u2019m going to ask all the questions in one paragraph. And then we\u2019ll have all 50 of you come to the bench and respond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">Counsel can ask follow-up questions and then from those questions and answers certain challenges will be made to get the panel down from 50 to 12. If you\u2019re not sure that information you possess is an answer, please volunteer that information. It\u2019s better for us to know too much than to know too little.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">Because if we try the case and you go into the Jury Room for you to deliberate, and you say \u201cI can\u2019t do this\u201d because of this or that, or any other reason, then we\u2019ve wasted the entire afternoon. If you say it to the lawyers at the bench now, it might generate a challenge and in that way we might be able to get a jury that\u2019s capable of reaching a unanimous verdict one way or the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">So with that in mind, let me start the questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The trial court then proceeded to ask all of the parties\u2019 agreed-upon voir dire questions collectively. After the court asked these questions as a group, counsel approached the bench and both defense counsel for appellant and for Green agreed that the court did not \u201cmiss any important questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Following this, the trial court called each prospective juror to the bench and asked whether that person had a response to the questions, whether that person had ever been in a courtroom before, and whether there was any other reason the person would be unfair to anyone involved in the case. In addition, appellant\u2019s counsel was permitted to ask questions of the prospective jurors at this time. The court then heard challenges and struck ten prospective jurors for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>After jury selection, appellant\u2019s counsel indicated that the panel and the alternate were acceptable. After the luncheon recess, and prior to opening statements, the court also excused one of the jurors and substituted the alternate in that juror\u2019s place. Appellant\u2019s counsel offered no objection to the substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Subsequent to the trial in this case, the Court of Appeals disapproved of a voir dire procedure that asked the venire questions collectively. In <em>Wright, </em>as in this case, the venire was asked, \u201cas a group, a roster of seventeen questions.\u201d 411 Md. at 506, 983 A.2d 519. After the collective questioning, each venireperson was called to the bench and asked \u201cif he or she had any information in response to the voir dire questions\u201d and \u201cif he or she could be fair and impartial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defense counsel objected, arguing that lumping all seventeen voir dire questions together frustrated the ability of the jurors to remember all of the questions. <em>Id. </em>at 507, 983 A.2d 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The Court of Appeals agreed, explaining: \u201cThe presentation of a lengthy roster of questions to the venire, without providing the opportunity to answer each question as it was posed, required each venireperson to comprehend and retain far too much information to guarantee that the questions were answered properly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509, 983 A.2d 519. The Court noted that voir dire was \u201cfive and a half minutes of continuous questioning, without pause,\u201d which \u201cresulted in substantial delay between presentation of the questions and the answers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512, 983 A.2d 519. Accordingly, the Court held that \u201cthe selected voir dire method may have obscured relevant information from the trial court\u2019s view by failing to ensure that the jurors on the venire made reasonably full disclosures. The trial court was therefore working with an incomplete understanding of the jury pool.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513, 983 A.2d 519; <em>see also Height v. State, </em>190 Md.App. 322, 326, 330-31, 988 A.2d 1054 (2010) (concluding that, in a case where defendant objected to the method of conducting voir dire at the start of the process, jury selection procedure was \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to that used in <em>Wright </em>and was unconstitutional).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Unlike in this case, in both <em>Wright </em>and <em>Height, </em>defense counsel objected to the manner in which the trial court conducted voir dire. <em>See Wright, </em>411 Md. at 506-07, 983 A.2d 519; <em>Height, </em>190 Md.App. at 326, 988 A.2d 1054. Here, appellant\u2019s counsel did not object to the manner of conducting voir dire, either before or after the voir dire was completed. Further, after jury selection, appellant\u2019s counsel agreed that the jury and alternate were acceptable. Accordingly, the issue is unpreserved for appellate review. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court----\u201d); <em>accord Robinson v. State, </em>404 Md. 208, 216, 946 A.2d 456 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Apparently recognizing the procedural default, appellant asks this Court to consider the issue as plain error. After the briefs were filed in this case, this Court decided <em>James v. State, </em>191 Md.App. 233, 991 A.2d 122 (2010). One of the issues presented in that appeal concerned whether a voir dire procedure that violated the Court of Appeals\u2019s opinion in <em>Wright </em>constituted plain error. <em>James, </em>191 Md.App. at 245-46, 991 A.2d 122. We concluded that it did not. <em>Id. </em>at 246, 991 A.2d 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">As is well-established, our discretion to recognize plain error is plenary. <em>See McMillan v. State, </em>181 Md.App. 298, 359, 956 A.2d 716 (\u201c[W]hen a defendant fails to object, an appellate court possesses \u2018plenary discretion to notice plain error material to the rights of a defendant, even if the matter was not raised in the trial court.\u2019 \u201d) (Citation omitted), <em>cert. granted, </em>406 Md. 744, 962 A.2d 370 (2008). Further, an appellate court \u201cwill review the unpreserved claim only where the unobjected to error can be characterized as \u2018compelling, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>extraordinary, exceptional, or fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial\u2019 by applying the plain error standard.\u201d <em>Abeokuto v. State, </em>391 Md. 289, 327, 893 A.2d 1018 (2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In <em>James, </em>we declined to apply plain error to a voir dire procedure that was error under <em>Wright. </em>There, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acc\">We decline to exercise our discretion in this case to notice plain error in the trial court\u2019s voir dire. Although an appellate court may address an unpreserved issue to \u201ccommunicate a desired message to the bench and bar that might otherwise go unsent,\u201d <em>McMillan, </em>181 Md.App. at 360 [956 A.2d 716], the Court of Appeals has already spoken clearly in <em>Wright, </em>obviating the need for further appellate exploration of this issue. Furthermore, the \u201cerror\u201d of which appellant complains was not \u201cplain\u201d at the time of trial in this case. <em>Cf. Height, </em>185 Md.App. at 332-33 [970 A.2d 921] (\u201cit has been held consistently that there is nothing improper about a trial judge\u2019s questioning prospective jurors as a group.\u201d). An error would not be \u201cplain\u201d unless it is wrong under current law. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734 [113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508] (1993). At the time of the trial in the case before us, Maryland\u2019s appellate courts had yet to address whether the manner in which the voir dire was conducted was error. No extraordinary circumstances are present in the case before us to invoke our discretion to address an unpreserved claim of error that has since been addressed by the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\"><em>James, </em>191 MdApp. at 247, 991 A.2d 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Similarly, we conclude that appellant\u2019s claim is not so compelling or extraordinary that it requires review absent an objection at trial. Accordingly, we decline to exercise our discretion to recognize plain error on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Appellant next asserts that the trial court erred in responding to a jury note asking for a copy of the statute applicable to Count One, wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>one\u2019s person, by supplying the jury with a copy of said statute. The State responds that the trial court properly exercised discretion in providing a copy of the statute to the jury. We conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in this case, and, alternatively, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Here, the record indicates that the jury sent the court a number of notes after deliberations began. We observe that, among the first questions the jury asked, was a \u201crequest to review transcript.\u201d The trial court informed the jury that there was no transcript, but they could hear a tape recording of any testimony they wished to hear. The next day, the jury then returned the note at issue here. That note provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">1. Wear, carry, and transport a handgun. \u201c3 items.\u201d Not wear, carry, or transport</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">Clarify please, we are having difficulty with the terminology. Does it have to be all 3? Can a passenger transport?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">2. Officer Simmons\u2019 initial testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">3. Possess \u2014 Define please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">4. Send in statues [sic] (written) that you read for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">Count 1 Jefferson</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">\u201c 1 Green</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">\u201c 2 Green</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-14\">There is an error on Kenneth Jeffersons \u201c# 5 is # 4\u201d document.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-15\">The trial court asked for suggestions from the parties, and appellant\u2019s counsel first replied that \u201cit is my understanding that it does not need to be all three\u201d and that \u201ca passenger can transport a handgun.\u201d After Green\u2019s counsel disagreed and suggested the jury had to find all three, <em>i.e., </em>wear, carry, and transport, under the indictment, Green\u2019s counsel and the court mentioned the request for copies of the statutes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL FOR GREEN]: What\u2019s interesting to me is this Question Number 4, asking for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>statute. In this particular case, the jury is not a jury on the law, and has to receive your instructions and follow them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\">THE COURT: I think they\u2019re curious as to the interrelationship between the \u201cor\u201d and the \u201cand.\u201d And that\u2019s why they want to see the statute.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">After hearing from the State as to the other questions in the note, the trial court returned to the issue of providing copies of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">THE COURT: I\u2019m going to tell them that the Statute says \u201cor\u201d, however, the State has held itself to the burden of proving \u201cand\u201d because of the way they worded the indictment. And then I\u2019ll define each of the three words under the normal English meaning. And there\u2019s no case law defining \u201cwear, carry, and transport,\u201d with one exception. There\u2019s one annotation that I\u2019ll read as soon as I find it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL FOR GREEN]: And, Your Honor, as far as a passenger transporting, I agree with the State on that proposition, too, if you had the word \u201cknowingly\u201d transport.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">THE COURT: Yeah, but they\u2019re not looking for the definition of \u201cknowingly transport\u201d. That\u2019s Count 3. They didn\u2019t ask for Count 3. They only asked for the statute for Count 1 and, 1, 2. Count 1 for one man is Count 2 for the other man.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">The court then indicated it would provide copies of Section 5-133(b) of the Public Safety Article, with respect to the jury\u2019s request concerning a count charged solely against appellant\u2019s co-defendant Green, and Section 4-203 of the Criminal Law Article, which concerned both appellant and Green. <em>See </em>Md. Code (2002, 2009 Supp.), \u00a7 4-203 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d); Md.Code (2003), \u00a7 5-133(b) of the Public Safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Article. (\u201cP.S.\u201d). Green\u2019s counsel again objected on the grounds that the statute used the word <em>or, </em>in describing the crime of wear, carry, or transport, and the indictment charged him with wear, carry <em>and </em>transport, and the court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">THE COURT: Well, they asked for copies of the statutes. I\u2019m going to tell them verbally what I\u2019m going to tell them. But I\u2019m also going to tell them that by wording the indictment the way that they have on their verdict sheet, the State has held themself to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL FOR GREEN]: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">THE COURT: \u2014 to a verb.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL FOR GREEN]: Well, I remove my objection. That makes sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">After the court further informed the parties about its intent to instruct the jury with a portion of C.L. \u00a7 4-203, as well as a portion of an opinion from the Attorney General, counsel for Green clarified and renewed his earlier objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL FOR GREEN]: If you decide to send statutes back, I certainly agree you picked the correct statutes. They\u2019re correct, portions of the statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL FOR GREEN]: But I would object to statutes being sent back, not because you haven\u2019t picked the right ones and the right portions, just on the concept that they should not be given the statutes. They should be given the law from you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">Then, after the court read Maryland Rule 4-326 into the record, and after recognizing that this Court held in <em>Hebb v. State, </em>44 Md.App. 678, 410 A.2d 622 (1980), that it was error for the trial court in that case to send the <em>Maryland Criminal Jury Instructions and Commentary </em>into the jury room, the trial court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-14\">THE COURT: ... I think, however, if you give them the applicable, a copy of the applicable portion of the statute, all you\u2019re doing is reducing instruction to writing, or a portion of instruction to writing. And I don\u2019t see any prejudice. So <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>I\u2019m going to honor their question, so that they digest what I tell them verbally in a way that\u2019s most user friendly to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL FOR GREEN]: I understand, Your Honor. And I understand the basis of your decision. I would just like to note my objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">THE COURT: Okay. It\u2019s noted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: For the record, Your Honor, I would also object\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: \u2014 as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">After, the jury returned to the courtroom, the court distributed a copy of the pertinent statutes, stating: \u201cWe haven\u2019t given you the entire Statute, but we\u2019ve given you the applicable part of the Statute minus extraneous matter that is not relevant to this particular case.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court then responded to the jury\u2019s note, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-11\">First of all, the instruction is Defendant is charged with a crime of carrying a handgun. In order to convict the Defendant, the State must prove the Defendant wore, carried, or transported a handgun on or about his person. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>then it defines handgun, which I won\u2019t go through again. Handgun on or about a person, if it\u2019s within his reach and available for that person\u2019s immediate use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">Now, in this particular indictment, the State has assumed a greater burden than the Statute requires because it\u2019s charged the Defendants with wearing, carrying, and transporting a handgun. So the State has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the Defendants wore, carried, transported a handgun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The court then: provided definitions of \u201cwear,\u201d \u201ccarry\u201d and \u201ctransport;\u201d cited an Attorney General\u2019s opinion concerning whether the crime applied to passengers in a vehicle; discussed the \u201cknowingly\u201d element of transporting a handgun in a vehicle; and, defined \u201cpossession.\u201d The jury then was informed that Officer Simmons\u2019 testimony would be replayed after the jury returned from lunch.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">On appeal, appellant begins his analysis by citing portions of Maryland Rule 4-325, which provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he court shall give instructions to the jury at the conclusion of all the evidence and before closing arguments and may supplement them at a later time when appropriate.\u201d Md. Rule 4-325(a). Further, Maryland Rule 4-325(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGP\">(c) How given. The court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding. The court may give its instructions orally or, with the consent of the parties, in writing instead of orally. The court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Generally, whether to give the jury a supplemental instruction is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>See Lovell v. State, </em>347 Md. 623, 657, 702 A.2d 261 (1997); <em>see also Cruz v. State, </em>407 Md. 202, 210, 963 A.2d 1184 (2009) (\u201cTrial courts have discretion in deciding whether to give a jury supplemental instructions in a criminal cause.\u201d). A trial court\u2019s decision to give a supplemental instruction ordinarily \u201cwill not be disturbed on appeal, absent a clear abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>discretion.\u201d <em>Roary v. State, </em>385 Md. 217, 237, 867 A.2d 1095 (2005). However, \u201cwhen a jury asks a question that reflects confusion on an issue, the trial judge \u2018must respond\u2019 to the question \u2018in a way that clarifies the confusion\u2019 if \u2018the question involves an issue central to the case.\u2019\u201d <em>Lee v. State, </em>186 Md.App. 631, 665, 975 A.2d 240 (quoting <em>State v.

State, </em>287 Md. 675, 685, 414 A.2d 1266 (1980)), the appropriate response to a jury question is dependent upon many factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">\u201cClearly, the person in the best position to weigh these \u2018facts and circumstances\u2019 is the trial judge. From his vantage point he has the opportunity to surmise which of the phrases in his instructions have been absorbed and which should be embellished or repeated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\"><em>Oliver, </em>53 Md.App. at 505, 454 A.2d 856 (quoting <em>Kelly v.

Electronically recorded instructions or oral instructions reduced to writing may be taken into the jury room only with the permission of the court.

The court may impose safeguards for the preservation of the exhibits and the safety of the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Additionally, Maryland Rule 4-326(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">(c) Jury request to review evidence. The court, after notice to the parties, may make available to the jury testimony or other evidence requested by it.

Furthermore, we have found no case law in Maryland addressing the question presented.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Appellant directs our attention to <em>Hebb, </em>a case cited by the trial court in its discussion of this issue. In <em>Hebb, </em>after the jury had deliberated and returned guilty verdicts on charges of second degree rape and assault, it was learned that a copy of the <em>Maryland Criminal Jury Instructions and Commentary </em>was taken into the jury room during deliberations. <em>Hebb, </em>44 Md.App. at 679, 410 A.2d 622. After this discovery, the trial court denied Hebb\u2019s motion for a mistrial. <em>Id. </em>at 680-81, 410 A.2d 622. On appeal, the State conceded having the instructions book in the jury room was error, but that it amounted to harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 681, 410 A.2d 622. This Court disagreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">The <em>Maryland Criminal Jury Instructions and Commentary </em>represents an attempt to devise standard jury instructions covering virtually every aspect of a criminal case. It contains suggested instructions, each accompanied by a discussion of relevant cases and legal commentary, with respect to each of the major substantive offenses, including the various sex offenses, and to various other procedural or penumbral matters such as mistaken identity (\u00a7 5.10), intent (\u00a7\u00a7 3.01-3.06), credibility (\u00a7 2.06), child witness (\u00a7 2.04), and even the \u201cAllen\u201d charge (\u00a7 1.13). As Judge Digges, of our Court of Appeals, observed in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Foreword to the book, it is a worthwhile publication intended to serve the lawyer as a tool in preparing suggested instructions. But, at the same time, it is a treasurehouse of confusion and misinformation if given to a jury for its perusal without any constraint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 683-84, 410 A.2d 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\"><em>Hebb </em>is clearly distinguishable from this case. The court\u2019s exhibit here was a written copy of law with respect to Count One of the indictment, charging appellant with wearing, carrying, and transporting a handgun on or about his person. It was not, as in <em>Hebb, </em>a document including annotations and cites to other statutes likely to have confused the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">We conclude in this case that providing the jury with a written copy of the statutes, specifically C.L. \u00a7 4-203 concerning Count One of the indictment, was no different than providing a written copy of an oral jury instruction permitted by Rule 4-326(b). We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Prior cases have held that a trial court may read a statute to the jury as part of its instructions to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">It is without question that a trial court may read to the jury the applicable provisions of those statutes which pertain to the crime or crimes charged, and advise the jury that the legal effect of the evidence admitted at the trial is to undertake to bring the accused within the operation of such penal statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-10\"><em>Dillon v. State, </em>277 Md. 571, 582, 357 A.2d 360 (1976); <em>see also Pearlstein v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 507, 517, 547 A.2d 645 (1988) (holding there was no error when, instead of giving instructions in the form requested by appellant, trial court read verbatim from the language of the statute), <em>cert. denied, </em>314 Md. 497, 551 A.2d 867 (1989); <em>Cardin v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 200, 219, 533 A.2d 928 (1987) (concluding that reading the statute was sufficient and stating that \u201cthe statutory language was not so technical or complicated as to confuse the jury, but instead was quite straightforward and lucid\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>312 Md. 126, 538 A.2d 777, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 827, 109 S.Ct. 78, 102 L.Ed.2d 55 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>In the case at bar, the trial court thus could have read C.L. \u00a7 4-203, or portions thereof, to the jury during its initial instructions to the jury. That instruction could have been electronically recorded or otherwise reduced to writing and taken into the jury room under Maryland Rule 4-326(b), with permission of the trial court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It follows then that the trial court could also respond to a jury note requesting a supplemental instruction by reading a statute and sending a written copy of that statute to the jury room during deliberations. Considering that the jury had expressed some \u201cdifficulty with the terminology\u201d in their note, we hold that the trial court did not err by responding to the jury\u2019s request by sending a copy of the pertinent statute to the jury room.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Moreover, even if we were to conclude that the court erred, the error in this case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976) (error will be harmless when reviewing court, upon independent review, is able to declare a belief beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the verdict). In <em>Imes v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 176, 855 A.2d 381, <em>cert. denied, </em>384 Md. 158, 862 A.2d 994 (2004), a tape recorded interview of Imes\u2019 co-defendant was admitted into evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 181, 855 A.2d 381. A transcript was also handed to each juror so that they could follow along while the tape was played during trial. <em>Id. </em>Copies of the transcript were not retrieved from the jury, and several jurors took their copies into the jury room. <em>Id. </em>This Court concluded that the error in permitting jurors to take the unadmitted transcript into the jury room was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 183, 855 A.2d 381. In reaching that conclusion, we stated that \u201cthe transcript at issue in the case at bar \u2018only confirmed in writing what the jury already heard\u2019 in open court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182, 855 A.2d 381 (quoting <em>Vaughn v. U.S., </em>367 A.2d 1291, 1295 n. 8 (D.C.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Here, with respect to the wearing, carrying, and transporting a handgun counts, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">The next crime for which both defendants are charged is transporting a handgun in a vehicle. Each defendant is charged, and this had to do with a gun, in order to convict the defendant, the State must prove, one, defendant wore, carried, or knowingly transported a handgun in a vehicle, and that the defendant did so while traveling on public roads, highways, waterways, airways, or parking lots.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">A handgun is a pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed on or about the person and which is designed to fire a bullet by the explosion of gunpowder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">Another count which is somewhat redundant, is wear, carry, or transporting a handgun. In order to prove the defendant wore, carried, or transported a handgun on or about his person, a handgun is a pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed on or about the person and which is designed to fire a bullet by explosion of gunpowder. A handgun is on or about a person which is within his reach and available for that person\u2019s immediate use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">In addition, the court explained this count further when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">So wear means like wear your clothes. Carry means like I\u2019m carrying a basket of laundry. Transport means to move from one place to another. So these two crimes here are addressed. One is on the person. Did either of these people wear, carry, transport a handgun on their person. And then because people can have stuff in their vehicle that they\u2019re transporting that they don\u2019t know about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">They made the element a little bit stronger and they said in order to convict somebody of having something in their vehicle, you have to wear, carry, or knowingly transport the item in the vehicle. So those are the, which we call the \u201cout in public\u201d verbs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">Similarly, there is little difference between these instructions and the copy of C.L. \u00a7 4-203 provided to the jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Moreover, the court gave additional instructions in response to the jury note and specifically informed them that, whereas the statute used the word \u201cor,\u201d in describing the crime of wear, carry, or transport a handgun, \u201cthe State has assumed a greater burden than the Statute requires because it\u2019s charged the Defendants with wearing, carrying <em>and </em>transporting a handgun.\u201d (Emphasis added). Accordingly, the copy of the statute confirmed in writing what the jury had already heard when the trial court instructed the jury, and any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Finally, appellant asserts that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun on or about his person because the gun was found underneath the passenger seat and therefore was not \u201cin such proximity to him as would make it available for his immediate use.\u201d The State responds that this argument is meritless and that it was for the jury to determine whether appellant was in possession of the handgun. We concur.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">In deciding any claim relating to the sufficiency of the evidence, the appropriate inquiry is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v.

State, </em>141 Md.App. 371, 379-80, 785 A.2d 836 (2001) (holding that jury could find that appellant was in constructive possession of the weapon). \u201cIt has long been established that the mere fact that the contraband is not found on the defendant\u2019s person does not necessarily preclude an inference by the trier of fact that the defendant had possession of the contraband.\u201d <em>Suddith, </em>379 Md. at 432, 842 A.2d 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Here, in addition to finding a knife in appellant\u2019s vehicle that appellant claimed he kept for both \u201cfishing\u201d and \u201cprotection,\u201d Officer Simmons recovered a loaded .38 caliber revolver underneath the passenger side seat of the vehicle appellant was driving. The butt of that handgun was facing outward towards the passenger seat. Officer Simmons also agreed with the prosecutor\u2019s question that a person located either in the driver\u2019s side seat or the passenger\u2019s side seat could \u201creach either of the weapons as they were recovered on June 23rd, 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In addition to these facts, as noted, appellant was the driver of the vehicle.

Further, \u201c[a] rational fact-finder may infer that, generally, an owner/driver of a vehicle has knowledge of the contents of that vehicle.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>374 Md. at 559, 823 A.2d 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">From this evidence, we conclude that a rational juror could find that appellant had knowledge of, as well as dominion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>control over, the gun recovered underneath the passenger seat in the vehicle he was driving. Moreover, the loaded gun was in close proximity to appellant\u2019s person and was available for immediate use.

Count One of the indictment charges that co-defendants Green and appellant \"unlawfully did WEAR, CARRY and TRANSPORT a HANDGUN, to wit: .38 caliber Smith and Wesson Revolver upon and about his person, in violation of Criminal Law Article, Section 4-203 of the Annotated Code of Maryland; against the peace, government and dignity of the State.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b227-12\">. A copy of the statute is included with the record on appeal as Court's Exhibit 1. Pertinent to Count One of the indictment charging appellant with wearing, carrying and transporting a handgun, the exhibit cites C.L. \u00a7 4-203, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-13\">\u00a7 4-203. Wearing, carrying, or transporting handgun-Prohibited (a)(1) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a person may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-14\">(1) wear, carry, or transport a handgun, whether concealed or open, on or about the person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-15\">(ii) wear, carry, or knowingly transport a handgun, whether concealed or open, in a vehicle traveling on a road or parking lot generally used by the public, highway, waterway, or airway of the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-16\">(iii) violate item (i) or (ii) of this paragraph while on public school property in the State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-17\">(iv) violate item (i) or (ii) of this paragraph with the deliberate purpose of injuring or killing another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-18\">(2) There is a rebuttable presumption that a person who transports a handgun under paragraph (l)(ii) of this subsection transports the handgun knowingly.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b231-7\">. There are a few cases outside of Maryland that address the issue presented in this case. <em>See Getty Petroleum Mktg., Inc. v. Capital Terminal Co., </em>391 F.3d 312, 332 n. 26 (1st Cir.R.I.2004) (Lipez, J., concurring) (stating that \"the judge has broad discretion to give the jurors copies of statutes for their deliberations, or decline to do so, as she sees fit\u201d); <em>United States v.

In <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 549, 823 A.2d 664 (2003), the Court of Appeals acknowledged that cases dealing with the illegal possession of narcotics might assist the analysis of cases involving handguns, specifically, transporting a handgun, stating \"because to prove possession in those types of cases, actual or constructive dominion or control over the contraband must be proven and knowledge, generally, may be evidence in the determination of dominion and control.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
