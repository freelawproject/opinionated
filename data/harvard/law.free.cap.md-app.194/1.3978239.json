After merging the false statement conviction, the court sentenced appellant to ten years\u2019 incarceration for the perjury offense, with all but five years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">The underlying convictions arose from appellant\u2019s submission on January 24, 2008, of a Maryland State Police Application and Affidavit to Purchase a Regulated Firearm (the \u201cApplication\u201d), in which Furda represented, under oath, that he had never been \u201ccommitted to a mental institution.\u201d At that time, Furda knew that, in connection with a case in which he had pleaded guilty to violation of a Final Protective Order, under \u00a7\u00a7 4-506 and 4-509 of the Family Law Article, the circuit court had recently issued an Order denying his request for the return of his firearms. In the Order, the court found that Furda was barred, under federal law, from possessing a firearm, because his emergency mental health evaluation in 2003 constituted an involuntarily commitment to a mental institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">From Furda\u2019s arguments in his brief, we distill the following questions:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>1. Was the evidence sufficient to convict appellant of perjury and false statement, when the State\u2019s only evidence that appellant had previously been committed to a mental institution was a circuit court order that was \u201cclearly in error\u201d and when appellant was never found to be committed under Maryland law and he therefore truthfully responded to the Application?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">2. Did the court err by improperly shifting the burden of proof to appellant and by usurping the prosecutorial function?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">3. Did the court err in denying appellant\u2019s request to take judicial notice of medical records in the file?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\">4. Did the court err or abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s Motion for New Trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">For clarity, we shall refer to this matter as the \u201cPerjury Case,\u201d and we shall refer to the domestic violence proceedings as the \u201cProtective Order Case.\u201d The Protective Order Case is the subject of a companion appeal, in which Furda challenged the circuit court\u2019s Order that his emergency mental evaluation in 2003 constituted a commitment, so as to bar his possession of any regulated firearms. <em>See Furda v. State, </em>193 Md.App. 371, 997 A.2d 856 (2010).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree with Furda in the companion appeal; we have concluded that the court erroneously determined that Furda\u2019s admission amounted to a commitment under federal law. Nevertheless, we conclude that the court\u2019s error in the Protective Order Case does not exonerate appellant in the Perjury Case. Therefore, for the reasons explicated below, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">The story of this case begins with domestic problems between appellant and his former wife, Karen Furda. According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>to an \u201cIncident Report\u201d submitted on February 28, 2003, by a Deputy Sheriff for Montgomery County,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Sheriffs Office served Mr. Furda on February 27, 2003, with a petition for an emergency mental evaluation, initiated by Ms. Furda, and with \u201ca temporary protection order\u201d (Case No. 0601 SP006212003), issued by the District Court for Montgomery County, also in response to a petition filed by Ms. Furda. Ms. Furda claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellant had several guns in the house, and she consented to a search of the home. During the search, the Sheriffs seized many weapons, including fifteen rifles, one handgun, and a large quantity of ammunition. The items are detailed on a \u201cSeized Property/Evidence Log\u201d prepared by the Sheriffs Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">On February 27, 2003, Furda was transported to Montgomery General Hospital (the \u201cHospital\u201d) for an emergency mental health evaluation. From there, he was transferred to Potomac Ridge Behavioral Health (\u201cPotomac Ridge\u201d). He was discharged on or about March 4, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">According to the record, Ms. Furda obtained a Final Protective Order against Mr. Furda on March 6, 2003. It stated, in part: \u201cWhile this Protective Order is in effect you may be subject to a federal penalty under the 1994 amendment to the Gun Control Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 922(g)(8), for possessing, transporting, or accepting a firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">On January 31, 2005, Ms. Furda applied for a Statement of Charges, accusing appellant of violating another Final Protective Order, dated September 21, 2004, by contacting her and threatening her.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result, on March 3, 2005, Furda was charged in a one-count Information with</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>failing] to comply with [the Protective Order] ... dated September 21, 2004, issued under Section <em>4 </em>\u2014 506 of the Family Law Article, that ordered the respondent to refrain from contacting and attempting to contact Karen Furda, by contacting her in writing, and is a subsequent offender, in violation of Section 4-509 of the Family Law Article against the peace, government, and dignity of the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-4\"><em>See State v. Furda, </em>Case No. 101933, Circuit Court for Montgomery County. As we indicated, at a hearing on July 26, 2005, appellant pleaded guilty to one count of \u201cProtective Order \u2014 Fail to Comply/Subsequent Offender.\u201d The court sentenced him to a suspended, one-year term of incarceration and two years of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">On September 13, 2006, while Furda was still on probation in the Protective Order Case, he filed a \u201cMotion\u201d in that case, pro se, seeking the return of his archery equipment and \u201cother related items. Buck skinning knives, Bows, Arrows, Arrow Release [and] fanny packs,\u201d which had been seized during the search of his home in February 2003. According to the docket entries, the court denied the Motion, without prejudice, on November 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">On July 30, 2007, a few days after appellant completed his two-year probation in the Protective Order Case, he filed another \u201cMotion,\u201d also pro se, asking for the \u201crelease of all [his] property held for safe keeping by the Montgomery County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\u201d The State opposed the Motion. On October 31, 2007, before the court ruled on the second Motion, appellant, through counsel, filed a \u201cMotion To Return Property,\u201d in which he sought the return of all the property seized by the Sheriffs in 2003, including his firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The court (Harrington, J.) held a motion hearing on November 7, 2007, at which appellant was present. In open court, the court agreed to the release of various items, but otherwise took the matter under advisement. On the same date, the circuit court issued an \u201cOrder\u201d (docketed November 9, 2007), denying appellant\u2019s motion for the return of his firearms. The Order noted that appellant sought the return of \u201cfirearms and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>ammunition seized by the Office of the Sheriff for Montgomery County ... at the time a Domestic Violence Protective Order was served\u201d on appellant. Moreover, the court noted that the Protective Order had \u201cexpired and probation arising from a related criminal case is now closed.\u201d The Order also said: \u201cAll items appearing on the inventory that are not firearms or ammunition have already been or will be returned to the Defendant by agreement of the State and pursuant to Court order....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Of import here, the court determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-6\">Upon the evidence presented, the Court finds that Defendant Mark Furda is considered a prohibited person under 18 U.S.C. Section 922(g)(4) as a result of having been involuntarily committed to a mental institution and is thereby prohibited from possessing firearms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">The court also concluded that appellant was prohibited from possessing firearms under Montgomery County Code \u00a7 57-9(d) (2004). However, the court did not address whether appellant was barred from possessing firearms under State law. The Order concluded: \u201cORDERED, that [Furda\u2019s] Motion to Release Personal Property be and the same hereby is DENIED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">We pause to review 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 (2005), which provided, in part (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-9\">\u00a7 922. Unlawful acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-10\">(a) It shall be unlawful\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-11\">(6) for any person in connection with the acquisition or attempted acquisition of any firearm or ammunition from a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector, knowingly to make any false or fictitious oral or written statement or to furnish or exhibit any false, fictitious, or misrepresented identification, intended or likely to deceive such importer, manufacturer, dealer, or collector with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale or other disposition of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>firearm or ammunition under the provisions of this chapter^]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">(g) It shall be unlawful for any person\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">(4) <em>who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed to a mental institution</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">On December 3, 2007, appellant moved for reconsideration of the Order of November 7, 2007. Judge Harrington denied his motion by \u201cOrder Of Court\u201d dated January 15, 2008 (docketed January 16, 2008). On February 13, 2008, appellant noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals with respect to the Protective Order Case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">In the interim, on January 24, 2008, appellant went to Gilbert\u2019s Guns and applied for the purchase of a Ruger Mark III, \u201ca .22 pistol handgun, semiautomatic.\u201d Based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>information he provided in the Application, Furda was charged on March 26, 2008, with perjury and false statement. In particular, Count One alleged that Furda \u201cwillfully and falsely [made] an affirmation that he had never been committed to a mental institution----,\u201d while Count Two alleged that Furda \u201cknowingly [gave] false information, and [made] a material misstatement on [the firearm] application____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">During discovery in the Perjury Case, and pursuant to the State\u2019s request, a subpoena was issued on May 13, 2008, to Potomac Ridge, commanding the production of \u201ccertified medical records for patient Mark Furda ... treatment dates: 2/28/03 thru 3/5/03.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On June 23, 2008, the State moved to compel production of the records. In its response, Potomac Ridge claimed that it could not produce the medical records, except \u201c \u2018in accordance with a Court Order,\u2019 or \u2018as otherwise provided by law\u2019.... \u201d On August 8, 2008, the court (Mason, J.) ordered Potomac Ridge to submit the records to the court, under seal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">At the trial on August 20, 2008, the State offered several exhibits, without objection.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They included a copy of the docket entries from the Protective Order Case; the Order in the Protective Order Case dated November 7, 2007; the Order Of Court dated January 15, 2008, denying appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration; the Application that appellant signed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>January 24, 2008; an Affidavit from the Custodian of Records for the Maryland State Police Firearms Registration Section; and appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The Affidavit that appellant signed on January 24, 2008, was central to the Perjury Case. The Application cautioned: \u201cContact an attorney prior to completing this form if you have any questions.\u201d Three of the sixteen questions on the Application are of particular significance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">7. Have you ever spent more than 30 consecutive days in any medical institution for treatment of a mental disorder or disorders? (If a physician\u2019s certificate, issued within 30 days prior to the date of this application, certifying that you are capable of possessing a regulated firearm without undue danger to yourself, or to others, is attached to this application, then answer \u201cN/A\u201d for Not Applicable.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">8. <em>Have you ever been adjudicated mentally defective or have you been committed to a mental institution? </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-8\">12. Did you answer \u201cYES\u2019 to any of the above questions? (If you answered \u201cYES\u201d to any of the above questions, you are prohibited by law from purchasing and/or possessing a regulated firearm____ If you answered YES\u2019, DO NOT proceed any further with this application).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">Question 12 made clear that, if appellant answered \u201cYes\u201d to Questions 7 or 8, he would not have been permitted to buy the gun. Appellant answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions 7 and 8, despite his knowledge that, in the Protective Order Case, Judge Harrington had found that, under federal law, he was ineligible to possess firearms because he had been \u201cinvoluntarily committed to a mental institution.\u201d Furda signed the Application on the line for \u201cSignature of Transferee/Voluntary Registrant and Transferor.\u201d Directly above the signature line, the text of the form provided: \u201cI, the below signed Transfer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>ee/Voluntary Registrant, certify under penalty of perjury that the above answers are true and correct and that <em>1 am not prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing a regulated firearm </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The State called one witness, Brian David Penko. He stated that on January 24, 2008, he worked at \u201ca firearms range\u201d and as general manager of Gilbert\u2019s Guns, \u201ca retail store\u201d that sold \u201c[fjirearms, holsters, accessories.\u201d Penko recalled that appellant went to Gilbert\u2019s Guns on that date to purchase a Ruger Mark III, \u201ca .22 pistol handgun, semiautomatic.\u201d Appellant spent \u201cmaybe 45 minutes to an hour\u201d talking with Penko\u2019s \u201cboss,\u201d store owner Charles Richard Gilbert, Jr. When asked if Furda had shown him \u201cany documents relating to anything other than the purchase,\u201d Penko replied: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">According to Penko, appellant was provided with \u201cMaryland State 77R, parts 1, 2, and 3,\u201d i.e., the Application, which included sixteen questions. Penko indicated that he had \u201cfilled out\u201d or helped \u201chandgun purchasers\u201d complete an application a \u201c[cjouple hundred\u201d times. Penko stated that he told appellant \u201cto read each question carefully, answer each question correctly, and initial on each line, on each question. And then sign and date down at the bottom.\u201d Appellant initialed next to each question and signed the Application in Penko\u2019s presence. Penko also signed the Application, in appellant\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The prosecutor asked whether appellant \u201cappealed] to understand what he was doing,\u201d and Penko answered: \u201cYes.\u201d When asked whether appellant \u201cappeared] to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs or anything\u201d or made \u201cany comments about the application,\u201d Penko said: \u201cNo.\u201d After appellant completed the Application, Penko \u201cforwarded it to the State Police,\u201d via facsimile. According to Penko, on February 5, 2008, the State Police \u201cdisapproved\u201d the Application. As a result, appellant never obtained the firearm that he sought to purchase on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The State rested, and appellant moved for a judgment of acquittal. He argued: \u201cOn the perjury charge specifically, it\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>very clear that It has to show that the writing contained a false statement. And that the statement was given willfully \u2014 .\u201d Defense counsel conceded that, in the Order of November 7, 2007, the court \u201cfound that [appellant] was committed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922.... \u201d But, he argued that the Order was issued in \u201ca civil matter\u201d with a \u201cdifferent standard of proof.\u201d Moreover, defense counsel maintained that there was no evidence that appellant \u201cknew the statement was false,\u201d and insisted that \u201cthere still has to be some evidence that the statements were false.\u201d The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Appellant testified in his own defense. In his view, he \u201cwas in no way, shape, or form prohibited from purchasing, owning, or firing a firearm.\u201d He recalled that on January 24, 2008, he went to Booth\u2019s office before he went to Gilbert\u2019s Guns, and \u201cby everything [appellant and his counsel] had read and seen [appellant] was in fact not a prohibited] person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Furda explained that he sought \u201cto purchase a Mark III Ruger pistol, .22 caliber,\u201d and brought his \u201creconsideration motion\u201d with him to the store to show \u201cthat [he] had not been committed nor was [he] a mental defective.\u201d He testified that he \u201cshowed [the motion for reconsideration] to the owner, Dick Gilbert\u201d and \u201chad it sitting on the counter\u201d when he spoke with Penko. At that time, appellant was unaware that the motion had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Insisting that he was \u201c[absolutely in the right\u201d with regard to whether he could purchase a firearm, Furda explained: \u201cI am not a felon. And I have never been mentally adjudicated nor have I ever been committed.\u201d He concluded: \u201cSo thereby and all the law, I should be in fact a person that should be allowed to purchase a regulated firearm.\u201d Appellant also stated that, after his Application was denied, he appealed the denial and appeared before an administrative law judge in that matter.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> No administrative ruling had been issued as of the time of the trial in the Perjury Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Claiming that he had never been committed to a mental institution, Furda said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\">I was submitted to an emergency evaluation petition through the courts by my now ex-wife.... [She] filed a motion or [sic] false statements ... saying that I had threatened her and the children, which I had never done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">... [T]he Montgomery County Sheriffs Department was sent to my house, and did take me to Montgomery General----I was then transferred to Potomac Ridge for the I guess 72-hour evaluation that is allowable by the courts ... I had ... read the discharge [which] stated that the doctor had a dilemma as to whether or not to commit me. However, there was no psychosis, no withdrawals, or bad presence, or anything like that. And that without any type of hearing or any adjudication I was released.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">On cross-examination, appellant agreed that he \u201cread each and every question\u201d on the Application, understood the Application, and understood that he was filling it out \u201cunder penalty of perjury.\u201d Furda conceded that he attended the motion hearing in the Protective Order Case on November 7, 2007. However, he claimed that, prior to his \u201capplication to purchase the firearm,\u201d he \u201chad not seen\u201d the Order issued on November 7, 2007. The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: [Yjou\u2019re saying that your lawyer never showed it to you? ... And your lawyer never told you about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-10\">[APPELLANT]: Correct. He, what was mentioned to me was that in fact I am not [a prohibited person] and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>guns are not being returned was political not by, by meaning of the law correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: He never told you about Judge Harrington\u2019s order? That\u2019s your testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: And you\u2019ve never seen it, that\u2019s your testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">[APPELLANT]: I\u2019ve seen it since. I had not seen it prior to going in and filling out the application to purchase the weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">The following colloquy is also noteworthy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Isn\u2019t it true, Mr. Furda, that you had the reconsideration in your hand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-12\">[APPELLANT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: You just testified under oath that you went in there with a motion for the reconsideration of Judge Harrington\u2019s order. You said you had that in your hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-14\">[APPELLANT]: I had the reconsideration which stated that in fact I had not committed, been committed and was released.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: So you knew when you went in there that Judge Harrington had denied your request for the return of firearms, because you had the reconsideration that your lawyer filed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-16\">[APPELLANT]: That I hadn\u2019t been committed, yes. [PROSECUTOR]: So ... you had this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-17\">[APPELLANT]-: That I had not been ever committed and I have not, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-18\">[PROSECUTOR]: And you understood that reconsideration means that you\u2019re asking Judge Harrington to reconsider her denial of your request, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-19\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: So you kn[e]w, then, because you had the reconsideration that you were a prohibited] person, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-4\">[APPELLANT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: You\u2019re also aware that Judge Harrington did find that you were committed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">[APPELLANT]: At this point, she, I, I don\u2019t know how she read it, but I wasn\u2019t, so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Further, the prosecutor asked appellant if he \u201cknew that Judge Harrington had denied [his] request to return [his] firearms because [he was] a prohibited] person from possession.\u201d Appellant responded: \u201cNo, legally I\u2019m not prohibited. If I\u2019ve never been committed, I am not a prohibited] person.\u201d Appellant did not agree with the prosecutor that, \u201csince [he] knew that Judge Harrington had denied [his] request to return [his] firearms that Judge Harrington had found that [he] had been involuntarily committed to Potomac Ridge and that [he was] prohibited from possessing firearms ... [.]\u201d But, appellant conceded that he \u201ctalked\u201d to his attorney about moving to reconsider the Order of November 7, 2007, and \u201cagreed to enter for a reconsideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">On redirect, appellant testified that he had not seen the Order of January 15, 2008, denying the motion for reconsideration, when he completed the Application. Appellant indicated he was brought from the Hospital to Potomac Ridge in \u201can ambulance, no[t] [by] law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Michael Patrick Flynn, who identified himself as appellant\u2019s brother, testified that he went to Gilbert\u2019s Guns with appellant on January 24, 2008. He recalled that appellant spoke with Mr. Gilbert for \u201c[approximately a half hour, 45 minutes\u201d and \u201cshowed him ... the reconsideration papers for the release of his firearms.\u201d Flynn said that, when he went with appellant to Gilbert\u2019s Guns, he and appellant both \u201cthought that [the circuit court\u2019s ruling] was political.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">Booth also testified. He stated: \u201c[A]t some point we have [sic] received the order denying the motion for return of property.... Judge Harrington\u2019s order.\u201d Contrary to appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>lant\u2019s testimony, Booth claimed that he informed appellant of the Order of November 7, 2007. But, he also claimed that he told appellant that he did not believe he was \u201cineligible\u201d to purchase a firearm. The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\">[THE COURT]: <em>Did you share the contents of Judge Harrington\u2019s ruling with your client?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">[BOOTH]: <em>Yes, I did, Your Honor____And then we filed a motion for reconsideration </em>.... <em>on December 3rd, 2007 </em>____And we did not receive a denial of that and at some point over several conversations with Mr. Furda, he had asked me if he could go out and purchase or possess a <em>firearm____And I told him, based upon my research, I didn\u2019t see any reason that he was </em>ineligible.... <em>And I may have also cautioned that, you know, that was my opinion, but that I saw nothing. </em>He asked for a copy of the motion and I gave Mr. Furda a copy of the motion____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-11\"><em>I did not receive a copy of the denial of the motion for reconsideration until after Mr. Furda had called me and told me he had been arrested </em>.... That was the first time that I\u2019d seen that the motion for recon [sic] had actually been denied. I know that the, I guess it\u2019s dated like January 16th, and he apparently went down to the gun shop on January 24th.... It would have been my belief that the motion was still pending at that time. And I, you know, if he had asked me \u201cDid we receive an opinion yet?\u201d that would have been my answer is that we have not received an opinion at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">The following colloquy is also noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... [D]on\u2019t you think that you had an obligation, regardless if the Court didn\u2019t send it, to just kind of keep your finger on the pulse of your motion? ... Isn\u2019t that like a lawyer\u2019s duty of diligence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-14\">[BOOTH]: At some point, well, we had filed it back on December 3rd. And I know at some point I did call and asked what\u2019s happening with it and was told that it was still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>pending. Now that probably would have been, you know, maybe before Christmas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-4\">[PROSECUTOR]: <em>Now, you had like you said (unintelligible) you discussed Judge Harrington\u2019s order with your client?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\">[BOOTH]: <em>Yes, the first order.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: <em>Right. Unquestionably then Mr. Furda understood that Judge Harrington ruled that he was a prohibited] person because he was involuntarily committed, correct?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">[BOOTH]: <em>That would be the essence of Judge Harrington\u2019s order.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: <em>And you discussed that with him? </em>[BOOTH]: <em>Correct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: <em>Now he understood it and directed you to file your motion for reconsideration?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\">[BOOTH]: <em>That\u2019s correct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... [Y]ou never told him did you to violate Judge Harrington\u2019s order, correct? I mean you never said that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-12\">[BOOTH]: No, I never said that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: You didn\u2019t agree with Judge Harrington\u2019s order, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-14\">[BOOTH]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: <em>But you understand that, until the Court of Special Appeals rules, it\u2019s still in effect?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-16\">[BOOTH]: <em>That\u2019s correct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-17\">[PROSECUTOR]: <em>And under the terms of that order he could not go buy a firearm, correct?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-18\">[BOOTH]: <em>That\u2019s correct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-19\">[PROSECUTOR]: <em>And you never told him that he could? </em>[BOOTH]: <em>No, I never told him that he could.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: ... <em>[Y]ou would have never told, him he could go and buy a gun when Judge Harrington said no guns for a prohibited] person, correct?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">[BOOTH]: <em>I would have cautioned him against it. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">\u201c[0]ne way to have truthfully filled out the application was that, when you got to question 8, you could instead of saying \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d you could say, \u201csee footnote.\u201d The footnote says, \u201cThis is what Judge Harrington said. I think she\u2019s wrong. In fact, I\u2019ve appealed her all the way to the Supreme Court of Mars. But here are the facts. So I\u2019m not making a false statement and I\u2019m not misleading anybody,\u201d correct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Booth reasoned that he was \u201cnot conversant enough with that form to even know there\u2019s a footnote section.\u201d The court replied: \u201cEven if there\u2019s not, you take a separate piece of paper, you write out whatever it is you think they need to know and you attach it. It just seems to me folks have been doing that for the last 70 years in responding to recent federal forms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">Furda was recalled. He said that he was not aware of a footnote section on the Application, explaining: \u201cIt was yes/no answers as far as I\u2019ve ever filled one out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">Defense counsel informed the court that \u201cthere are apparently documents from Potomac Ridge, which are currently under seal\u201d and that were part of the Protective Order Case. The trial judge said that he had not \u201clooked at them,\u201d nor had he \u201clooked at that file,\u201d explaining: \u201c[N]obody asked me to do anything, so I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Defense counsel said: \u201cWell, that\u2019s fine, Your Honor.\u201d Nevertheless, he asked the court to take judicial notice of \u201cfive or six pages\u201d of the Potomac Ridge records. The State informed the court that \u201cthat file is up at the Court of Special Appeals,\u201d and that the prosecutor had \u201cadvised Mr. Booth that the Court of Special Appeals was not going to send it back to Montgomery County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>for this hearing even though I asked them to.\u201d The following exchange is noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">THE COURT: Well, here are my practical problems. I don\u2019t have [the records], so I can\u2019t see them. Putting that aside, I don\u2019t know what they say, so I don\u2019t know whether there would be any objection to my reading them. But I don\u2019t physically \u2014 you want me to call Chief Judge Krauser and ask him to send something to me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I have the pages if Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">THE COURT: Well, is there an objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">[PROSE CUTOR]: There is an objection, Your Honor.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Appellant did not make a proffer as to the content of the Potomac Ridge records. In declining to take judicial notice of the records, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-10\">Well, this is where I am.... [T]his is a perjury charge. This is a false statement charge. It seems to me that if there\u2019s been a judicial determination that something happened, even if that judicial determination is wrong, okay, and a question says, has it happened, the issue is was there proper disclosure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-11\">That was really my question to you is I understand that your client in his heart believes Judge Harrington is wrong. There\u2019s a judicial determination made and even if it\u2019s not correct, it was made....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-12\">... If Judge Harrington said he\u2019s been committed, and somebody said have you ever been committed, it would be difficult, not impossible, difficult to answer no to the question and have the no be truthful, even if you didn\u2019t agree with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Just like in a bank robbery case, you are convicted of the crime, but you\u2019re innocent. And later you could prove it and all these things. But in filling out an application to Lockheed Martin and an application for security clearance, they\u2019re going to ask you have you ever been convicted of a felony. You have to say, under my hypothetical, yes, comma but see the 42 attachments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">It doesn\u2019t have to be necessarily a place that says, please enter your footnotes here. People file federal income tax returns all the time, all the time with extra footnotes, pages, statements of position, explanations, so as to make, to avoid what some argue is the perjury trap.... Or you can do all kind of things. But you can\u2019t just say, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">So that\u2019s a long-winded way of saying that here\u2019s my problem with taking judicial notice at this time. One, I don\u2019t have the documents. Two, they may or may not be hearsay, possibly....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Thereafter, the defense rested, and the parties proceeded to closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">The State explained that appellant \u201canswered no to question no. 8, that is the basis of the case, that is the basis of the prosecution of that statement is demonstrably false----\u201d With regard to willfulness, the State pointed to the Order of November 7, 2007, and argued: \u201cMr. Furda knew exactly what he was doing and kn[e]w that he could not legally possess firearms and was prohibited from possessing them.\u201d The State added: \u201cWhen someone says, you can\u2019t do this or you can\u2019t do that, and a person just ... disagrees with it. But when a person ... in authority [says] that[,] there\u2019s an obligation to follow through on that and obey that order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">Defense counsel countered that \u201cthe bottom line is [appellant] was firmly convinced that he was eligible to purchase a firearm.\u201d In response to the court\u2019s inquiry as to whether appellant\u2019s belief had to be \u201cobjectively reasonable,\u201d defense counsel answered: \u201cI think it is in this [case] objectively reasonable.\u201d Further, defense counsel said that if appellant had a subjective belief that he was answering truthfully, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>court should acquit him. He also complained that \u201cJudge Harrington\u2019s ruling was made as a result of a motion hearing, 15 minutes per side. And that\u2019s it. And there was no testimony.... It\u2019s a civil order.\u201d Further, defense counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">Mr. Furda did not make a false statement willfully. [H]e firmly believes that the order is wrong. That he was not committed and that he was able to say that on this sheet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">And, you know, footnote notwithstanding, he did attempt to provide some explanatory basis for it, being the motion which he took to the shop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The court found the following \u201cas a first-level fact\u201d (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">[A]t the time that Mr. Furda filled out the application for possessing a firearm, ... he had been committed involuntarily to a mental institution .... [and] he knew not only that he had been involuntarily committed to a mental institution, <em>he knew that there had been a finding to that effect by the Circuit Court </em>for Montgomery County, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">... <em>[A]t the time Mr. Furda filled out his application for firearms on January 21 [sic], 2008, he knew that Judge Harrington\u2019s order that was [docketed] on November 9, 2007, had not been vacated, modified, stayed, or overturned. That is to say, he knew it was in effect.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\"><em>... </em>[H]e had asked, through counsel, did Judge Harrington reconsider her decision. But <em>he knew at the time that he filed his application on January 2U, 2008, that he knew at the very least that Judge Ha,rrington had not granted his request.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-11\"><em>... </em>Mr. Furda made a false statement on his application of January 24, 2008, when he said in answer to question 8, that he had never been committed to a mental institution. He knew that was false.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-12\">... Mr. Furda attempted to deceive the Maryland State Police in answering question 8 falsely because he wanted a gun and he didn\u2019t want to put down the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>As to the perjury charge, the court found that \u201cMr. Furda\u2019s conduct was willful.\u201d It said: \u201cThe Court finds that he ... willfully, knowingly, and frankly voluntarily made a false statement as a material fact knowing that it was false.\u201d Further, the court determined that \u201csubjectively Mr. Furda did not have a good faith, honest belief that the contents of his affidavit were true.\u201d Indeed, the court said: \u201cI find as a fact to the opposite. He knew they were false. He didn\u2019t care.\u201d The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">I find that the State has proven each and every material [fact]. <em>I also find that the misstatement, the false statement was not the result of confusion or an honest mistake. Mr. Furda knew full well what Judge Harrington had ruled. </em>Mr. Furda knew darn well that he had been involuntarily committed to Potomac Ridge. He was not free to leave during that time period. He knew it. It\u2019s a fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">I find that he knew the statement was false at the time it was given. I find that it was material and that he intended to induce the State Police to give him a gun permit because he wanted a gun. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">With respect to the false statement charge, the court found that Furda \u201cknowingly gave false information and knowingly made a material misstatement\u201d and that \u201che had the specific intent to violate the law ... at the time he did it beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Rejecting the defense of reliance on counsel, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">I am persuaded by the evidence that the defense of counsel defense or the reliance of counsel defense is factually inapplicable to this case. I find as a fact he did not rely on any advise [sic] of counsel when he filled out the application. So I recognize the legal applicability of it but reject it on the facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-10\">For all those reasons I find the defendant guilty on both counts of the criminal information....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Defense counsel then informed the court: \u201cMr. Furda has asked me if he could ... mention to the Court ... that when he did go to Gilbert\u2019s and he did have the motion ... he did ask if it could be attached to the application.... And he was told at Gilbert\u2019s, \u2018No, that\u2019s not the way it\u2019s done.\u2019 \u201d The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-4\">Well, respectfully, I didn\u2019t hear that from the stand and that was his time to say it. And, respectfully, probably nobody could have stopped him from writing. I know there may not be a section on it that says \u201cPlease write footnotes here,\u201d but just like there\u2019s no such statement on U.S. Income Tax Returns or other statements made to federal agencies, people have been doing it for years to avoid what we have here. It\u2019s not rocket science. It\u2019s not novel. It\u2019s not hindsight by 20/20. It\u2019s people are careful when you make a statement to a federal or state agency that it\u2019s scrupulously true. But anyway, all right, you\u2019ve told me that. He doesn\u2019t need to tell me that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">On September 2, 2008, appellant filed a Motion for New Trial, which the State opposed. After a hearing on October 14, 2008, the court denied the motion (docketed October 16, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">At sentencing on October 30, 2008, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">The Court is most troubled by this case because the Court finds that Mr. Furda totally lacks any credible or cognizant amount of acceptance of personal responsibility....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">The Court also finds that Mr. Furda did not testify candidly when he testified during his trial. He told me then, he told me now, he was not aware of Judge Harrington\u2019s order. To be blunt, I do not believe him....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">He has a history and pattern of knowingly, willfully, intentionally, disobeying lawful orders of judges of the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In essence, appellant contends that the evidence was legally insufficient to convict him of perjury or false statement because, in the Protective Order Case, the court erred in finding that, under federal law, he had been \u201cinvoluntarily committed to a mental institution.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Appellant complains that he \u201cwas charged with perjury and false application under Maryland State law for supposed violations of State law while filling out a Maryland State firearm form,\u201d yet the Order of November 7, 2007, \u201cdeclar[ed] him to be a prohibited person pursuant ... to Federal law.\u201d In Furda\u2019s view, the federal prohibition, if any, could not \u201cbe used to convict him for improperly filling out his State form[.]\u201d In Furda\u2019s view, the State erred in prosecuting him under Maryland law, because he \u201cwas never found to be \u2018committed\u2019 under Maryland State Law,\u201d and \u201cthe State conceded that [appellant] was not barred under State law.\u201d According to Furda, he was merely \u201cguilty\u201d of \u201cdisobeying a Court Order\u201d ... not perjury or providing false information____\u201d He claims that the Order of November 7, 2007, was \u201cissued in a Civil Matter,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and was merely \u201cthe product of argument but had no sworn witnesses and no independent testimony submitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Further, appellant suggests that the Application did not make clear whether he was to answer Question 8 as it pertained to Maryland law or federal law. Claiming that \u201che lacked expertise about statutory schemes to know that the question pertained to both federal and State law,\u201d appellant maintains that \u201cthere is nothing in State law that prohibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>him from applying for a firearm,\u201d and his statement on the Application that he \u201chad never been committed\u201d was truthful under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Furda continues: \u201cThere was simply no evidence presented by the Government to show the required specific intent on the part of Mr. Furda to lie.\u201d To the contrary, argues Furda, the court recognized that appellant \u201c \u2018believed Judge Harrington is wrong.\u2019 \u201d Therefore, appellant claims that \u201che did not willfully lie on the form\u201d and <em>\u201cdid not have </em>the requisite intent to commit perjury.\u201d With regard to the false statement charge, appellant argues that there was \u201cno evidence presented that clearly demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that there had been a \u2018false statement,\u2019 \u201d because there was no evidence that he was either \u201ccommitted\u201d or a \u201cmental defective,\u201d and the only evidence presented by the State as to this issue was \u201cthe seriously flawed Court Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Mindful that the court below \u201csuggested\u201d that appellant could have provided more than a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno\u201d answer in response to Question 8, by adding a footnote or an attachment to his Application, appellant insists that \u201cthe State never proved beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr. Furda was allowed to either attach documents to the Application, or that there was a comment section where the Defendant could explain his answers.\u201d In appellant\u2019s view, it was the State\u2019s burden to present evidence that such footnotes or attachments were permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">According to the State, \u201cthe fact that Judge Harrington found that Furda had been \u2018committed\u2019 is sufficient evidence of \u2018commitment\u2019 to sustain Furda\u2019s convictions for perjury and misstatement in a firearms application \u2014 regardless of whether Judge Harrington\u2019s conclusion was correct or valid.\u201d In its view, \u201cit is not relevant whether Judge Harrington\u2019s Order was unsupported by the facts, erroneous in its legal conclusion, or void for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d Rather, argues the State, \u201cthe fact that the Order finding that he had been \u2018committed\u2019 was in effect at the time Furda filed his firearms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>application constituted sufficient proof of the falsity of Furda\u2019s statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Moreover, the State underscores that \u201cthe federal law proscribing false statements in firearms applications is construed broadly to effect full and honest disclosure.\u201d In support of its position that \u201cthere was abundant evidence of Furda\u2019s knowledge that he had been committed,\u201d and that Furda \u201canswered [the Application] falsely in order to deceive the Maryland State Police into approving his application,\u201d the State points to \u201cFurda\u2019s testimony ... that he had been involuntarily transferred and admitted to Potomac Ridge\u201d; Furda\u2019s presence at the motion hearing on November 7, 2007; defense counsel\u2019s \u201ctestimony that he \u2018share[d] the contents of Judge Harrington\u2019s order with [his] client\u2019 ... and that he had discussed with Furda that he was a prohibited person because Judge Harrington\u2019s Order had deemed him committed\u201d; Furda\u2019s admission that he thought his motion for reconsideration of the Order of November 7, 2007, was pending when he submitted the Application; the \u201cevidence that Furda spent 45 minutes in the gun store\u201d discussing the motion for reconsideration with the store owner; and \u201cFurda\u2019s testimony that he understood that persons who had been committed were ineligible to hold firearms.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The State also disputes Furda\u2019s argument that Question 8 on the Application (\u201cHave you ever been ... committed to a mental institution?\u201d) was \u201cso ambiguous in terminology that [Furda] cannot be found guilty as a matter of law, because even if false under federal law, his answer was truthful under Maryland law.\u201d It asserts that, \u201cin the light most favorable to the State, there was ample evidence that Furda understood the form\u2019s use of \u2018commitment\u2019 to include any person, like him, who had been determined by a judge to have been \u2018committed.\u2019 \u201d In this regard, it posits that because Furda \u201cattended the hearing before Judge Harrington, and discussed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>counsel the Order and Motion for reconsideration, there is a reasonable inference that Furda ... understood Question 8\u2019s reference to commitment to mean commitment within the meaning of the federal statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">In addition, the State contends that the \u201cobjective context of the question\u201d removed any alleged ambiguity, because the Application \u201cmade clear that its purpose was to elicit disclosure of any and all conditions that would lawfully prohibit a person from buying a firearm.\u201d The State also points out that the word \u201ccommitment\u201d was not used in a technical sense in the Application, and is \u201ca term of common understanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">According to the State, the false application \u201cstatute encompasses a broader range of statements than does the perjury statute.\u201d Because statements need not be false to be misstatements, the State maintains that the false application statement may stand even if the evidence of perjury was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Appellant replies: \u201cIt would be a miscarriage of justice for this Court to follow the State\u2019s suggestion ... that even if Judge Harrington\u2019s Order was found to be invalid, which this Court should find [in the companion appeal], that it should, nevertheless, still provide the basis for his conviction.\u201d According to Furda, \u201cif the Order is found to be not valid or not legally binding, then the interest of justice would demand that it cannot be the basis for the criminal conviction ... of Mr. Furda.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">We have already quoted portions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922.

Perjury is the deliberate making of a false affidavit. An affidavit is a written document, the contents of which are affirmed to be true under penalty of perjury. In order to convict the defendant of perjury by affidavit, the State must prove:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-13\">(1) that the defendant declared under the penalty of perjury that a written document was true;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-14\">(2) that the writing contained a false statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-15\">(3) that the false statement was given wilfully, rather than as a result of confusion or honest mistake;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-16\">(4) that the defendant knew the statement was false at the time it was given; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>(5) that the false statement was material, that is, it related to the reason why the affidavit was prepared.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">As the Court of Appeals noted in <em>McGarvey v. McGarvey, </em>286 Md. 19, 25, 405 A.2d 250 (1979), perjury involves a \u201ccorrupt sworn statement made without sincere belief in its truthfulness.... \u201d <em>See also Palmisano v.

Hence, it is the intent that is punished, not the result.\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Ordinarily, \u201cstatements which present legal conclusions are considered opinion, and cannot form the basis of a perjury conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Endo, </em>635 F.2d 321, 323 (4th Cir.1980). Moreover, perjury usually applies only to adjudicative facts; generally, \u201c \u2018it is doubtful that false testimony\u2019 \u201d as to \u201c \u2018ultimate facts\u2019 \u201d can support a perjury conviction, because ultimate facts, which involve \u201c \u2018legal definitions\u2019 \u201d applied to facts, are ordinarily \u201c \u2018beyond the realm of common knowledge....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">C.L. \u00a7 9-101 does not define \u201cwillfully,\u201d nor does P.S. \u00a7 5-139 define \u201cknowingly.\u201d In <em>Greenwald v.

Levitt, </em>48 Md.App. 1, 10 n. 6, 426 A.2d 383 (1981) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Furda does not dispute that the evidence was sufficient to prove that he averred in an affidavit that he had never been committed to a mental institution; that the affidavit was part of a firearm application; and that the statement was material. But, he argues that the state did not establish the element of falsity, nor did it \u201cpresent any evidence that negated Mr. Furda\u2019s testimony about his own belief that he was correct\u201d that he was never committed. He also insists that the State never proved that he acted willfully or knowingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">As we have indicated, we have held in the companion appeal that, in the Protective Order Case, the court erred in its Order of November 7, 2007, by finding that appellant had been involuntarily committed to a mental institution within the meaning of federal law. The question is whether that error has any bearing in regard to the appeal in the Perjury Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In our view, the court\u2019s error in regard to the Order of November 7, 2007, does not control the outcome of the Perjury Case. Appellant was not entitled to represent on the Application that he had never been \u201ccommitted.\u201d For reasons elucidated below, the evidence was sufficient for a factfinder to conclude that Furda knowingly and willfully made a false statement in the Application.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">In the Protective Order Case, the court held a hearing on November 7, 2007, to consider, <em>at appellant\u2019s request, </em>his motion for the return of his weapons. Appellant was present at the hearing. On the same date, the court issued its Order, finding that Furda was prohibited under federal law from possessing firearms because he had been \u201cinvoluntarily committed to a mental institution.\u201d Appellant was apprised of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>court\u2019s ruling and asked the circuit court to reconsider it. Furda thought that the motion for reconsideration was still pending when he signed the Application on January 24, 2008. Appellant\u2019s belief that his motion for reconsideration was still pending further established his knowledge that the Order of November 7, 2007, had not been vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Yet, despite Furda\u2019s knowledge of the Order of November 7, 2007; his knowledge of the pending motion for reconsideration; and his attorney\u2019s cautionary advice, Furda answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 8 on the Application, asking whether he had ever been \u201ccommitted to a mental institution.\u201d It is telling that Furda clearly understood that he would not be approved for the purchase of the firearm unless he answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 8. Moreover, Furda never testified that he believed that he was at risk of committing perjury or a false statement unless he answered \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">To be sure, appellant disagreed with the circuit court\u2019s ruling of November 7, 2007. Nevertheless, it is beyond dispute that Furda knew his answer was directly contrary to Judge Harrington\u2019s ruling. Until such time as the Order of November 7, 2007, was stayed, reversed, or vacated, it was conclusive and binding on Furda. That it is the cornerstone of our judicial process. Therefore, appellant could not deliberately disregard that Order by answering Question 8 in a way that was contrary to the Court\u2019s ruling, even if he personally believed it was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u201cIt is beyond question that obedience to judicial orders is an important public policy.\u201d <em>W.R.

City of Birmingham, </em>388 U.S. 307, 87 S.Ct. 1824, 18 L.Ed.2d 1210 (1967), is persuasive. In that case, an Alabama court enjoined the petitioners from participating in public demonstrations and civil rights marches on the streets, without a permit. The permit had been previously denied, and no further request was made for a permit after the injunction was issued. Nor did the petitioners move to challenge or dissolve the injunction. Instead, the petitioners disobeyed the injunction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>were later found guilty of contempt. In affirming the convictions, the lower courts refused to consider the petitioners\u2019 constitutional challenges to the injunction or the underlying ordinance on which it was based. <em>Id. </em>at 308-313, 87 S.Ct. 1824.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">When the case reached the Supreme Court, it said, <em>id. </em>at 315, 87 S.Ct. 1824:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">In the present case ... we are asked to hold that this rule of law, upon which the Alabama courts relied, was constitutionally impermissible. We are asked to say that the Constitution compelled Alabama to allow the petitioners to violate this injunction, to organize and engage in these mass street parades and demonstrations, without any previous effort on their part to have the injunction dissolved or modified, or any attempt to secure a parade permit in accordance with its terms____[W]e cannot accept the petitioners\u2019 contentions in the circumstances of this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Notably, the Supreme Court acknowledged \u201csubstantial constitutional issues\u201d concerning the ordinance. <em>Id. </em>at 316, 87 S.Ct. 1824. But, it noted, <em>id. </em>at 316-17, 87 S.Ct. 1824, that the petitioners \u201cdid not even attempt to apply to the Alabama courts for an authoritative construction of the ordinance. Had they done so, those courts might have given the licensing authority granted in the ordinance a narrow and precise scope.... \u201d Similarly, it discerned legitimate issues concerning \u201cthe breadth and vagueness of the injunction....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317, 87 S.Ct. 1824. Nevertheless, the Court said, <em>id.: </em>\u201cBut the way to raise that question was to apply to the Alabama courts to have the injunction modified or dissolved. The injunction in all events clearly prohibited mass parading without a permit, and the evidence shows that the petitioners fully understood that prohibition when they violated it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Of import here, the Supreme Court squarely rejected the petitioners\u2019 claim that they were \u201cfree to disobey the injunction\u201d because of its constitutional defects. <em>Id. </em>Looking to other cases previously decided by the Supreme Court, it said, in words that resonate here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>These precedents clearly put the petitioners on notice that they could not bypass orderly judicial review of the injunction before disobeying it____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\">The rule of law that Alabama followed in this case reflects a belief that in the fair administration of justice no man can be judge in his own case, however exalted his station, \u2022 however righteous his religion[ ] This Court cannot hold that the petitioners were constitutionally free to ignore all the procedures of the law and carry their battle to the streets. One may sympathize with the petitioners\u2019 impatient commitment to their cause. <em>But respect for judicial process is a small price to pay for the civilizing hand of law, which alone can give abiding meaning to constitutional freedom.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ar-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 320-21, 87 S.Ct. 1824 (emphasis added). <em>See also Howat v. Kansas, </em>258 U.S. 181, 189-90, 42 S.Ct. 277, 66 L.Ed. 550 (1922) (stating that an injunction must be obeyed, \u201chowever erroneous the action of the court may be.... [I]t is for the court of first instance to determine the question of the validity of the law, and until its decision is reversed for error by orderly review ... its orders ... are to be respected____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\"><em>Lewis v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 55, 100 S.Ct. 915, 63 L.Ed.2d 198 (1980), makes a similar point in a case involving guns. There, the Supreme Court considered whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction, \u201cflawed because he was without counsel,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 56, 100 S.Ct. 915, could nonetheless \u201cconstitute the predicate\u201d for a conviction under \u00a7 1202(a)(1), as amended, of Title VII of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202(a)(1). That provision bars possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. In reviewing the legislative history of the provision in issue, the Court said, <em>id. </em>at 62, 100 S.Ct. 915: \u201c[W]e find nothing to suggest that Congress was willing to allow a defendant to question the validity of his prior conviction as a defense to a charge under \u00a7 1202(a)(1).\u201d The Court added, <em>id. </em>at 63, 100 S.Ct. 915:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">The legislative history ... affords no basis for a loophole, by way of a collateral constitutional challenge, to the broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>statutory scheme enacted by Congress. Section 1202(a) was a sweeping prophylaxis, in simple terms, against misuse of firearms. There is no indication of any intent to require the Government to prove the validity of the predicate conviction.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The Supreme Court also said: \u201cFinally, it is important to note that a convicted felon is not without relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 100 S.Ct. 915. It pointed out that a disqualified person could seek relief directly under the statute. And, of particular import here, the Supreme Court said, <em>id.: </em>\u201cAlso, petitioner, before obtaining his firearm, could have challenged his prior conviction in an appropriate proceeding in the ... State courts.\u201d As if to emphasize that point, the Court reiterated, <em>id. </em>at 67, 100 S.Ct. 915: \u201cAgain, it is important to note that a convicted felon may challenge the validity of a prior conviction ... before obtaining a firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\"><em>Lewis </em>underscores our point. Appellant was not without a remedy. Apart from any recourse under the federal statute, appellant lodged an appeal to this Court and could have awaited the result of that appeal before submitting the Application. Moreover, if the government is not required to prove the validity of a prior conviction in order to achieve a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202(a), it follows that the validity of Judge Harrington\u2019s Order was not dispositive of whether appellant falsely answered Question 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\"><em>United States v. Graves, </em>554 F.2d 65 (3rd Cir.1977), is also informative as to this point. In a state court, the defendant was convicted of larceny, a crime \u201cpunishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67. Graves never challenged the conviction. <em>Id. </em>About a year later, he was indicted, <em>inter alia, </em>for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6) \u201cin connection with the purchase of a shotgun when he certified on a registration form that he had not been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term of at least one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>year although, in fact, he knew that he had been.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, he was indicted on one count for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202(a)(1), barring possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Prior to trial, Graves moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the larceny conviction \u201chad not been constitutionally obtained,\u201d <em>id., </em>because he was a juvenile when he was arrested and he was denied various \u201cprocedural safeguards mandated by due process____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67-68. In his view, the constitutionally defective conviction could not be the basis for criminal liability. <em>Id. </em>at 68. The district court rejected Graves\u2019s argument and convicted him. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">On appeal, the Third Circuit said: \u201cInspection of \u00a7 922(a)(6), and Title IV [of the Gun Control Act of 1968] as a whole, suggests that a person who is a convicted felon must divulge the fact of his conviction, regardless of whether or not he believes it to be unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 71. According to the court, although \u201csuch an interpretation of [\u00a7] 922 tangentially implicates a conviction which may at some future time be deemed constitutionally infirm ... two components of Title IV strongly indicate that Congress intended that such a conviction could conduce to liability under the statutes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">Noting that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h)(1) [now (n) ] prohibits firearm possession for persons under indictment for a crime punishable by a term exceeding one year, despite the presumption of innocence, <em>id. </em>at 71-72, the court said, <em>id. </em>at 72:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ\">Section 922 would appear to provide some evidence of Congressional intent concerning the issues in this case. This is so since there are a number of similarities between an indictment and a conviction claimed to be unconstitutional. <em>Both may result in the eventual vindication of the defendant, thereby dissolving the disability with respect to firearms. The restriction in either case may be only a temporary one which will be removed when a court frees the defendant from the scrutiny of the criminal justice system </em>or when the executive branch grants a dispensation. To argue, as does Graves, that Congress intended to impose no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>disability on persons with outstanding convictions that they assert are unconstitutional, but to impose a disability on persons under indictment, would be to charge the legislative framers with a manifest inconsistency. We cannot discern that Congress sought to design such an asymmetrical statutory scheme. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">The <em>Graves </em>Court also said, <em>id. </em>at 75:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\"><em>The most obvious way for a person to remove doubts about his ability to deal with guns properly is to challenge the source of the doubts </em>\u2014 namely, <em>the prior conviction. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that Congress expected a convicted felon to undergo the relatively modest inconvenience of a restriction on firearms use until he has obtained a judicial invalidation of his conviction or has secured an executive authorization lifting that restriction. </em>To divine any other objective on the part of Congress might undercut the safeguards afforded by the Gun Control Act and increase the exposure of the public to continuing threats of crimes of violence. This we are unwilling to do. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The logic of the cases discussed above applies here. Appellant asked the circuit court in the Protective Order Case to determine whether he was entitled to the return of his weapons. He obtained an adverse ruling, as we have discussed, with which he rightfully disagreed. Clearly, appellant was entitled to challenge the ruling by way of an appeal. But, he could not flout a judicial determination with which he disagreed. Before making a representation on the Application, under oath, that was contrary to the court\u2019s ruling, he should have \u201cundergone] the relatively modest inconvenience,\u201d <em>id., </em>of awaiting the outcome of his appeal he took to challenge the ruling. That is what our judicial process required.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">In considering whether Furda was entitled to answer Question 8 consistent with his personal belief that he was not committed, <em>United States v. McFadden, </em>211 F.Supp.2d 234 (D.Me.2002), is relevant. It highlights the significance of Furda\u2019s knowledge of the status of his admission to a mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>health facility \u2014 i.e., that, according to the court, it constituted a commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In <em>McFadden, </em>the defendant answered \u201cin the negative\u201d as to a question on a federal form asking whether he had ever been committed to a mental institution. <em>Id. </em>at 234. He was subsequently charged with \u201cknowingly making a false statement in connection with the purchase of firearms,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6), and with possession of firearms after \u201chaving been committed to a mental institution,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4). <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The facts showed that McFadden \u201cwas presented on February 20, 1998, at Rusk State Hospital on a Mental Health Warrant For Emergency Detention issued by a Texas Magistrate, and on an Application for Detention of a Person as Mentally 111 made by a Texas peace officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234-35. He was detained upon a physician\u2019s finding that he was mentally ill and likely to cause serious harm to himself and others. <em>Id. </em>at 235. A judge issued an Order of Protective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Custody on February 23, 1998, and a probable cause hearing was held on February 26, 1998. <em>Id. </em>McFadden was released on February 26, 1998, based on the decision of his treating physician. <em>Id. </em>at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The court concluded that, at the time McFadden was in possession of the weapons, he was \u201ca person within the scope of the broad \u2018prohibition against ownership of firearms by \u201cmentally unstable\u201d or \u201cirresponsible\u201d persons,\u2019 \u201d and thus violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4). <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). However, the court acquitted the defendant under \u00a7 922(a)(6). Of import here, it reasoned, <em>id. </em>(italics and boldface added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\"><em>There is no evidence in the record from which the Court can conclude, </em>beyond a reasonable doubt or otherwise, <em>that this Defendant knew that the proceedings he had undergone in Cherokee County, Texas constituted a commitment </em>under the provisions of the statute pursuant to which he is charged with that [false statement] offense. <em>The most that can be said from the evidence is that he knew that he had been through a, proceeding in Texas resulting in his detention at a mental institution.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\"><em>There is nothing to show, however, that thereafter at any time he was advised or otherwise came by knowledge that those proceedings and that detention constituted a commitment under the federal statute. </em>Indeed, it is appropriate to note that various panels of federal appellate judges cannot agree as to whether particular emergency detention proceedings on the basis of alleged mental illness constitute \u201ccommitments\u201d under the federal statute.... <em>It strains too far to expect, in the absence of clear proof of his knowledge of that fact, that this Defendant would have a discrete understanding at the time he executed the affidavit in question that the circumstances of the prior Texas proceedings constituted a commitment </em>which required him to answer the pertinent question in the affirmative or be guilty of a felony offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">If Furda had merely been hospitalized or detained for evaluation in 2003, and then, without having obtained a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>ruling, applied for a firearm, his answer of \u201cNo\u201d to the question \u201chave you been committed?\u201d would be akin to the facts in <em>McFadden. </em>Under that scenario, it might be difficult for the State to establish whether Furda knew his hospitalization was a \u201ccommitment.\u201d The facts of this case are markedly different, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In contrast to the defendant in McFadden&gt; appellant was expressly \u201cadvised\u201d by the court in the Protective Order Case, and thus \u201ccame by knowledge,\u201d in the way of the Order of November 7, 2007, that his emergency mental health evaluation constituted a commitment. Indeed, it was Furda who, in the Protective Order Case, asked the court to return his weapons, which required the court to determine whether appellant had previously been committed. The court ruled that Furda was barred under federal law from possessing the weapons, because he had been committed. In the Perjury Case, Judge Rubin found that appellant knew of that ruling at the time he completed the Application; the evidence showed \u201cclear proof\u2019 of appellant\u2019s knowledge that a court regarded his previous hospitalization as a commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Moreover, the evidence in the Perjury Case indisputably showed that appellant had a \u201cdiscrete understanding\u201d of Judge Harrington\u2019s ruling. Indeed, Furda asked his attorney to file a motion for reconsideration, and took that motion with him to Gilbert\u2019s Guns. In addition, his attorney discussed with appellant that Judge Harrington had \u201cruled that [Furda] was a prohibited] person because he was involuntarily committed ...,\u201d and \u201ccautioned\u201d Furda against trying to buy a gun. And, the Application made clear that the answer of \u2018Tes\u201d to Question 8 would preclude appellant\u2019s purchase of the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Appellant claimed that he was unaware that, in the Protective Order Case, the court had denied his motion for reconsideration when he signed his Application.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> That fact is of no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>consequence. Even if Furda believed the motion for reconsideration was still pending, that would also mean that Furda knew the court\u2019s initial determination (i.e., that Furda had been committed) remained in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Other cases are worthy of mention. We pause to review them.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">In <em>United States v. Seidenberg, </em>420 F.Supp. 695 (D.Md. 1976), <em>aff'd, </em>577 F.2d 738 (4th Cir.1978), cert. <em>denied, </em>439 U.S. 903, 99 S.Ct. 268, 58 L.Ed.2d 249 (1978), the defendant was committed to a mental institution operated by the State of Maryland. <em>Id. </em>at 696. Years later, he \u201cacquired firearms from federally licensed dealers,\u201d and was subsequently charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6) with having \u201cknowingly made a false and fictitious statement likely to deceive such dealer with respect to a material fact as to the lawfulness of the sale, by signing a sworn statement\u201d that he had never been adjudicated mentally defective or committed to a mental institution. <em>Id. </em>The defendant moved to dismiss the charges, alleging that his prior commitment was invalid because it \u201cwas unconstitutional and that, therefore, such commitment must be treated as nonexistent for purposes of any alleged violations of section 922(a)(6).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court denied the motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 698. It noted that, under \u00a7 922(a)(6), \u201cthe core of the offense is the making of a false statement about a prior conviction....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697. Therefore, under \u00a7 922(a)(6), \u201ca statement might well be deemed false even if subsequent to the making of the statement the prior conviction should be determined to be constitutionally invalid.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The court looked for guidance to the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Cassity v. United States, </em>521 F.2d 1320 (6th Cir.1975). In <em>Cassity, </em>the defendant answered \u201cno\u201d on a firearms application that asked if he had ever been convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year in prison, even though he had been so convicted. <em>Id. </em>at 1321. Cassity claimed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>conviction was void because it resulted from a plea tendered without counsel, in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>Id. </em>The Sixth Circuit said, <em>id. </em>at 1323 (italics and boldface added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\"><em>[W]e are satisfied that \u00a7 922(a)(6) compels disclosure of all convictions which have not been set aside, whether ultimately shown to have been valid or not. </em>That section penalizes Cassity for making a false statement. It penalizes him not for being a convicted felon, but for failing to tell the truth about the conviction. <em>We think it apparent from the language employed that Congress intended to provide a scheme of regulation by compelling full and honest disclosure. </em>The section applies not merely to convicted felons, but to \u201cany person\u201d <em>and broadly forbids \u201cany false or fictitious ... statement ... intended or likely to deceive ... </em>with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale ...\u201d We are unable to believe that Congress intended that a prospective purchaser of a firearm under this section is entitled to conceal the fact of a prior conviction, even if a claim of constitutional invalidity is subsequently established. <em>Nor can we believe that any person \u00f1lling out the requisite form would conclude that he was not required to make disclosure under such circumstances.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Of import here, the Sixth Circuit reasoned, <em>id. </em>(emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">We conclude ... that the careful statutory scheme of gun control Congress has provided would be seriously jeopardized if a person convicted of a felony could, when purchasing a firearm, make the statement that he had never been convicted of such felony <em>based upon his own subjective belief </em>that his conviction was constitutionally defective <em>where such conviction had not prior thereto been set aside. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">In <em>United States v. Vice, </em>562 F.2d 1004 (5th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 951, 98 S.Ct. 1578, 55 L.Ed.2d 801 (1978), when the defendant purchased a firearm, he \u201cstated that he had never been convicted by any court of a crime punishable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>by a prison term exceeding one year when in actuality he had been convicted of such a crime by a state court.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1005. He was later charged federally with \u201cknowingly making a false statement in the acquisition of a firearm,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6). Following his indictment, but prior to the trial of the federal offense, the state court that had convicted Vice \u201cvoided that conviction on constitutional grounds as of the date of the conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the defendant was convicted of the false statement charge in federal court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">On appeal, the defendant argued that \u201cthe statement made while acquiring the firearm was not false since the original [state] conviction had been set aside and declared void as of a date prior to the firearm transaction and that therefore no violation of \u00a7 922(a)(6) had occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court rejected appellant\u2019s position, stating: \u201cThat the prior conviction was later set aside on constitutional grounds does not obviate the requirement imposed by \u00a7 922(a)(6) to tell the truth about the conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Citation and internal quotations omitted). Notably, the court also said: \u201cAt the time defendant made the statement and failed to reveal the existence of a prior conviction, the statement was false.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\"><em>United States v. Liles, </em>432 F.2d 18 (9th Cir.1970), is also noteworthy. There, the defendant was convicted of a felony in February 1969. <em>Id. </em>at 19. While his appeal was pending, he was released on his own recognizance. <em>Id. </em>In the Fall of 1969, Liles was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202(a), for which he was convicted on February 26, 1970. <em>Id. </em>However, one day before he was convicted under \u00a7 1202(a), his February 1969 conviction was reversed; the \u00a7 1202(a) charge was based on that conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">On appeal as to the \u00a7 1202(a) conviction, Liles argued that \u201cCongress intended to punish possession of firearms only by those whose convictions were eventually sustained at the end of the appellate process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. Given that the underlying 1969 conviction was reversed, Liles argued that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>\u00a7 1202(a) conviction could not stand. <em>Id. </em>The court rejected that argument. <em>Id. </em>Noting that \u201cCongress\u2019 deep concern about the easy availability of firearms\u201d led it to prohibit possession by \u201cthose who Congress had reason to believe pose a greater threat to community peace than does the public generally,\u201d <em>id. </em>(citation omitted), the court concluded that Congress had no intention to exempt from the statute \u201cone whose status as a convicted felon changed after the date of possession, regardless of how that change of status occurred.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The cases discussed above lead us to disagree with the dissent that appellant was placed in the \u201cuntenable position\u201d of having to answer Question 8 in a way that conflicted with his personal belief that he had not been committed to a mental institution. In the context of this case appellant\u2019s personal belief was not controlling. When appellant signed the Application, it was a FACT that he had been expressly informed, by a judicial Order, that his admission to Potomac Ridge amounted to a commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The dissent complains about the \u201cperversity of the result in this case,\u201d in which we uphold the convictions, despite our reversal of the circuit court\u2019s finding of commitment in the companion appeal. Our reversal of the lower court\u2019s determination in the companion appeal is of no moment to our analysis of Furda\u2019s conduct at the time that he completed the Apphcation. Rather, it is part of the orderly process of judicial review. Although our reversal is binding for now, it is not necessarily the last word as to the commitment issue. This is because our decision may be subject to further review by the Court of Appeals, and we cannot say if that Court will affirm our determination that appellant was not committed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> What we can say, unequivocally, is that, when Furda answered Question 8, under oath, the operative <em>fact </em>was the circuit court\u2019s ruling of November 7, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>We recognize that the Application did not ask appellant whether he had been found by a court to have been committed; it asked if he had been committed. Appellant maintains that he was not committed, and therefore his answer constituted a truthful response. But, the difference in the wording (were you found by a court to have been committed or were you committed) is a distinction without a difference under the circumstances attendant here. Appellant was obligated to answer \u201cYes\u201d to Question 8 until such time as Judge Harrington\u2019s finding of commitment was set aside. It is difficult to \u201cbelieve that any person filling out the [Application] would conclude that he was not required to make disclosure under such circumstances.\u201d <em>Cassity, </em>521 F.2d at 1323. Therefore, Judge Rubin was entitled to conclude that Furda\u2019s answer was deliberately deceptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">In our view, the \u201cliteral truth\u201d defense does not apply here. To be sure, \u201c \u2018[a] literally true answer, even though unresponsive or \u201cshrewdly calculated to evade,\u201d cannot form the predicate for a perjury conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Bollin, </em>264 F.3d 391, 411 (2001), <em>cert. denied, Gormley v. United States, </em>535 U.S. 989, 122 S.Ct. 1544, 152 L.Ed.2d 469 (2002). <em>See Bronston v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 352, 354, 362, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973); <em>United States v. Ahmed, </em>472 F.3d 427, 432 (6th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>551 U.S. 1132, 127 S.Ct. 2987, 168 L.Ed.2d 705 (2007). But, a response does not come within the literal truth defense merely because the defendant \u201c\u2018can postulate unstated premises of the question that would make his answer literally true.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bollin, </em>264 F.3d at 411 (citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\"><em>United States v. Endo, </em>635 F.2d 321 (4th Cir.1980), provides guidance. There, the defendant was charged with making a false declaration during the process of plea bargaining, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623. At a guilty plea proceeding, she had admitted, under oath, that she was guilty of mail fraud. Later, she sought to withdraw her plea, and stated, under oath, that she was not guilty. She was permitted to withdraw her plea and, at a later trial, was convicted. As a result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>contradictory assertions of guilty and not guilty, the defendant was also prosecuted on the false statement charge. <em>Id. </em>at 322. The trial court convicted, based on the inconsistency of the defendant\u2019s statements. The Fourth Circuit reversed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"al-dedup-0\">Writing for the court, Judge Murnaghan said, <em>id. </em>at 323:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6\">Appellant at the time she gave the inconsistent answers of \u201cguilty\u201d and \u201cnot guilty\u201d had not been convicted. Guilt is a question of legal status; a defendant is not guilty until a judge or jury has so declared. After the jury determined her guilt, a factual aspect had been added. Thereafter, a \u201cnot guilty\u201d answer would have been factually false, and so subject to prosecution. Prior thereto, however, it had not been decided whether or not she was guilty, so any answer, in contemplation of the law, had to be opinion, with no underlying factual component.1-]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-5\"><em>Endo </em>suggests that, if appellant had not previously been found to have been committed by Judge Harrington, his answer of \u201cNo\u201d to Question 8 would not support his convictions (assuming the evidence otherwise established that he believed his answer was the truth). But, once the court found as it did, appellant could not knowingly and wilfully represent to the contrary. At that point, \u201ca factual aspect had been added,\u201d which Furda could not disregard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">We also reject appellant\u2019s veiled suggestion that the Application was fatally ambiguous.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>P.S. \u00a7 5 \u2014 133(b)(7) bars possession of a regulated firearm by individuals who have been confined for more than thirty consecutive days to a facility for the treatment of mental disorders. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 10-101(e) of the Health-General Article (\u201cH.G.\u201d).

Camper pleaded guilty to a state misdemeanor charge of \u201ccarrying a loaded firearm in public without being the registered owner....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1074. Thereafter, on a federal criminal history questionnaire for employment, Camper checked \u201cno\u201d to a question asking whether he had \u201cbeen convicted of ... \u2018[u]nlawful possession ... of an explosive or weapon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting questionnaire). He was subsequently indicted for making a false statement to the government, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2), which \u201cprohibits giving false information in any matter within the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1075.

According to the court, Camper had indeed been convicted previously of unlawful possession under California law, and his answer \u201cwas therefore false, at least according to one reasonable interpretation of the question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1076-77. Although the court acknowledged that \u201canother, more restrictive meaning of \u2018unlawful possession\u2019 \u201d was possible, it found \u201cnothing in the context to suggest that the questionnaire\u2019s terms were to be defined by reference to anything other than common usage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The court concluded that \u201cthe questionnaire was not fundamentally ambiguous so as to preclude the possibility that questioner and answerer had the same meaning in mind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1078. Although it recognized that there were \u201ctwo plausible meanings\u201d to the phrase \u201cunlawful possession,\u201d it relied on \u201crelevant extrinsic evidence as to which construction Camper placed on the question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In particular, it considered that, when Camper pleaded guilty to the state offense, he had \u201cused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>the phrase \u2018unlawfully possessed\u2019 to refer to the offense [to which he pleaded guilty and] for which he was convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court determined that \u201ca reasonable finder of fact could conclude ... that the questionnaire asked, and Camper answered, a question about convictions for possessing a gun in an unlawful manner. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In <em>United States v. Boskic, </em>545 F.3d 69 (1st Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1393, 173 L.Ed.2d 593 (2009), the court considered whether the defendant falsely answered questions on his immigration forms. Notably, the court said: \u201c[R]esolving that issue requires us to consider [the defendant\u2019s] knowledge ... whether his answers were false depends on his understanding of the questions asked of him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\"><em>United States v. Good, </em>326 F.3d 589 (4th Cir.2003), is also pertinent. In that case, the defendant applied for a Security Identification Display Area (\u201cSIDA\u201d) badge at a Virginia airport, issued pursuant to Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d) regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 590. On the application, Good was asked: \u201cHave you ever been convicted or found not guilty by reason of insanity of the following listed crimes ... 22. Burglary, Theft, Armed robbery, Possession or Distribution of Stolen Property ... 26. Dishonesty, Fraud, or Misrepresentation ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant answered \u201cno\u201d to both question 22 and question 26. <em>Id. </em>About a year before, however, she \u201chad pleaded guilty to embezzlement,\u201d under Virginia law. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Good was charged with \u201cknowingly and willfully making a fraudulent statement in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2).\u201d Good sought to dismiss the indictment, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthat her statements were literally true because embezzlement was not a crime listed on the application ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Fourth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the indictment because the \u201cdefendant\u2019s statement was literally true....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">The court rejected the government\u2019s argument that the defendant\u2019s statements were false because embezzlement fell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>\u201cwithin the purview of disqualifying crimes of theft, fraud, dishonesty, and misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). It acknowledged that \u201cembezzlement is a felony <em>involving </em>dishonesty, fraud, and misrepresentation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 592, and recognized that the defendant had pleaded guilty to the crime of embezzlement. But, the court also said: \u201cEmbezzlement ... was not one of the crimes listed on the application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 591-92. The court reasoned: \u201cGiven the wording of the question and the crime for which the defendant was convicted, her answers on the application were thus literally true; the defendant has never been convicted of any of the crimes listed on the application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Here, Question 8 was quite broad. It lacked the degree of specificity on which the court relied in <em>Good. Cf. Bronston v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 352, 362, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973) (in the context of interrogation, stating that \u201c[pjrecise questioning is imperative as a predicate for the offense of perjury,\u201d and that \u201ca jury could not be allowed to consider a perjury charge where the allegedly false statement was \u2018literally true but not responsive to the question.... \u2019 \u201d); <em>United States v. Bonds, </em>580 F.Supp.2d 925, 931 (N.D.Cal.2008) (finding that \u201cthe indefinite time period did not make the question fundamentally ambiguous\u201d and stating: \u201cIf defendant\u2019s responses were false as he understood the questions, [any potential] conviction is not invalidated by the fact that his answer to the questions might generate a number of different interpretations\u201d) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">As we indicated, P.S. \u00a7 5-133(b)(7) prohibits possession of a regulated firearm by individuals who have been confined in a mental institution for more than thirty consecutive days. In contrast to Question 8, Question 7 of the Application was far more specific. It asked: \u201cHave you ever spent more than 30 consecutive days in any medical institution for treatment of a mental disorder or disorders?\u201d That question was clearly based on State law (P.S. \u00a7 5-133(b)(7)), and appellant could truthfully answer \u201cNo\u201d to Question 7, because his admission was only for a few days. But, the <em>very next </em>question on the Application asked about \u201ccommitment,\u201d generally, without any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>time limitation. There was no suggestion in the Application that Question 8 contemplated any specific duration of hospitalization, or that it was limited to State law. Rather, the question was broadly phrased.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Moreover, the term \u201ccommitment\u201d was not used in the Application in a technical sense. Because it was not defined, its common meaning would apply, particularly to a lay person. The common meaning of \u201ccommitment\u201d refers to \u201cconsignment to a penal or mental institution.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 250 (11th ed. 2004). <em>See United States v. Midgett, </em>198 F.3d 143, 147 (1999) (because Congress did not define the term \u201ccommitted,\u201d the court reads it in light of the common usage____In its broadest sense, to \u201ccommit\u201d means \u201cto place officially in confinement or custody.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1028, 120 S.Ct. 1440, 146 L.Ed.2d 328 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">In addition, we reiterate that, at the bottom of the Application, appellant signed his name, certifying \u201cunder the penalty of perjury that the above answers are true and correct and that <em>I am not prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing a regulated firearm.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Yet, he knew that the court had ruled that he was prohibited by federal law from possessing a regulated firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">When we apply the rationale of the cases cited above, we are satisfied that the question, \u201cHave you ever been ... committed to a mental institution,\u201d was not \u201cfundamentally ambiguous.\u201d To be sure, the question was posed on a Maryland State Police form, for the purpose of determining an applicant\u2019s eligibility to purchase a firearm in Maryland. <em>See Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Services v. Berg, </em>342 Md. 126, 138-39, 674 A.2d 513 (1996) (concluding that Maryland State Police could enforce federal law prohibiting firearm possession based on narcotics conviction, and therefore police could disapprove a firearm application submitted by a person prohibited under federal law). But, the Application did not specify that the applicant was to respond only under State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">In addition, the court below was entitled to consider the \u201ccontext\u201d and \u201cextrinsic evidence relevant to the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>understanding of the question.... \u201d <em>Camper, </em>384 F.3d at 1076. The context and extrinsic evidence unequivocally established Furda\u2019s knowledge that Judge Harrington had determined that he was prohibited under federal law from possessing regulated firearms because he had been committed to a mental institution. Armed with the knowledge of that ruling, Furda nonetheless proceeded to apply for the purchase of a gun and deliberately answered a question about commitment in a way that was directly contrary to the court\u2019s ruling and was intended to deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Appellant contends that the court \u201cimproperly shifted the Burden of Proof\u201d to appellant and \u201cimproperly usurped the prosecutorial function.... \u201d We pause to review additional facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">At the close of Booth\u2019s testimony, the court questioned him as follows:<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">[THE COURT]: But, approaching this perhaps from a different point of view, I take it you never told your client that he could make a false statement in an application, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">[BOOTH]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">[THE COURT]: So, putting aside for a moment whether your client agreed or disagreed with the decision of Judge Harrington, is it fair to say that if he was going to fill out an application, he would still have to answer it truthfully, even if he disagreed with what Judge Harrington said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">[BOOTH]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-11\">[THE COURT]: So one way to have truthfully filled out the application was that, when you got to question 8, you could instead of saying \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d you could say, \u201csee footnote.\u201d The footnote says, \u201cThis is what Judge Harrington said. I think she\u2019s wrong. In fact, I\u2019ve appealed her all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>way to the Supreme Court of Mars. But here are the facts. So I\u2019m not making a false statement and I\u2019m not misleading anybody,\u201d correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-4\">[BOOTH]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">[THE COURT]: But to have omitted the information that your client had in answering question 8 by omitting that, isn\u2019t the answer to question 8, as drafted, misleading? [BOOTH]: Actually, Your Honor, I\u2019m not 100 percent conversant] with question 8[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">[THE COURT]: Not following me? Okay. Question 8 says, which is I think the guts of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: It is indeed. The second phrase, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">[THE COURT]: It says, \u201cHave you ever been adjudicated mentally defective or have you been committed to a mental institution?\u201d It\u2019s a question. A person has the following choices: they can say \u201cyes,\u201d they can say \u201cno\u201d. Or they can do some combination of yes and no, but they can add explanatory material so as not to make their yes or their no materially misleading. So he could have said, \u201cNo, footnote, but see Judge Harrington\u2019s order, you know, 42 pages of explanatory material\u201d and we wouldn\u2019t be here probably because it wouldn\u2019t have been misleading. Or he could have said, \u201cYes, but see she\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m going to get it straightened out. And after you look at all the, you, State Police, look at all the facts you\u2019ll agree with me that I should have my gun.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">That was certainly an option open to Mr. Furda or somebody in Mr. Furda\u2019s position. Would it not have been to make such a disclosure like we use [sic] to do, I think they still do on documents submitted to the federal government when yes or no is not really the right answer? It\u2019s yes, comma, or no, comma. Or you don\u2019t answer yes or no. You just make your statement and the statement\u2019s true. Have a nice day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">What\u2019s the rocket science behind all this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">[BOOTH]: Your Honor, is there a question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>[THE COURT]: No, not really.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">[BOOTH]: I can tell you I\u2019m not conversant enough with that form to even know that there\u2019s a footnote section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8b\">[THE COURT]: Even if there\u2019s not, you take a separate piece of paper, you write out whatever it is you think they need to know and you attach it. It just seems to me folks have been doing that for the last 70 years in responding to recent federal forms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">During defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">[BOOTH]: As Your Honor heard the testimony from Mr. Furda and I think the bottom line is he was firmly convinced that he was eligible to purchase a firearm. I mean, he stated that today. I mean, to this day he is convinced. THE COURT: May I ask you a question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">MR. BOOTH: Certainly, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">THE COURT: Does his belief \u2014 does it not need to be objectively reasonable? ... Because, as the Supreme Court said in <em>Cheek,[</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>in adopting the good faith belief, but objectively reasonable standard, because the tax laws were so complicated. Does it not have to be objectively reasonable or, no offense, but will any delusion do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-10\">MR. BOOTH: No, Your Honor, and it\u2019s not delusional and I think it is objectively\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-11\">THE COURT: \u201cDelusion\u201d in quotes. I\u2019m not being critical. But, I mean, the Supreme Court has been clear in these cases that the confusion or mistake or whatever it is has to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>be objectively reasonable doesn\u2019t it? Or am I wrong? If I\u2019m wrong, straighten me out. This is your chance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">MR. BOOTH: Even accepting that, Your Honor, even if it is objectively reasonable, I would argue that in Mr. Furda\u2019s case it is reasonable. He is the actual person who was evaluated. He was a subject\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">THE COURT: So you\u2019re saying it doesn\u2019t have to be objectively reasonable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">MR. BOOTH: No, I\u2019m saying I think it is in this [case] objectively reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">MR. BOOTH: He certainly has reason enough to believe that Judge Harrington\u2019s order was wrong, in terms of whether he was ever committed or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">THE COURT: So you\u2019re saying that a good faith, albeit objectively unreasonable. But if I find that he subjectively believed that would acquit him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">MR. BOOTH: Certainly on the perjury charge, Your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-12\">MR. BOOTH: I mean, he was absolutely forthright here, Your Honor. I mean, he\u2019s certainly convinced that in this particular case that Judge Harrington, with all due respect to Judge Harrington, it was just that it\u2019s not a correct decision. And I think Your Honor raised the issue about the footnote. But as Mr. Furda testified, he didn\u2019t know about the footnote. But what did he do? He brought the motion for reconsideration that I had drafted to the gun shop. And by his testimony, as well as Mr. Flynn\u2019s\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATQ\">THE COURT: Well, let me get back to my unduly simple example. You represent Smith. Smith is tried for robbery. The evidence is scampy [sic] but the jury convicts Smith. Verdict, judgment of conviction entered, you take an appeal, sufficiency of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-13\">Before the Appellant [sic] Court hears your case and you win, by the way, Smith goes out and applies for a security clearance at Lockheed Martin and \u2014 knowing it\u2019s going to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>submitted to the DOD. So that gives the under perjury to the Federal Government and these things. Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Smith says, no, believing he\u2019s innocent and will prove it one day. Life is good. The jury got it wrong. The judge got it wrong. The Court of Appeals will straighten them out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-4\">Later, the Court of \u2014 after the submission of the application \u2014 later the Court of Appeals says evidence is insufficient as a matter of law. We apologize. We\u2019re really sorry. And here\u2019s a million dollars for your troubles. Smith later gets charged with perjury under federal law for making a knowing false statement on an application to the Defense Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">Good or not good?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">MR. BOOTH: I think it\u2019s been mooted out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">THE COURT: Really?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">MR. BOOTH: By the Appellant [sic] Court. There\u2019s a contrast here also, though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">THE COURT: The statement was knowingly false with me. The jury said guilty. The jury is wrong. Judge Harrington said, arguably, guilty. You say Judge Harrington\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s fine. But isn\u2019t that analogous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">MR. BOOTH: It is analogous and it\u2019s not. And the reason is, is, in your particular situation, in the Smith case he\u2019s had a trial. Presumably there\u2019s been testimony. Presumably there\u2019s been evidence, it\u2019s been in front of a jury or a judge hearing all of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">Judge Harrington\u2019s ruling was made as a result of a motion hearing, 15 minutes per side. And that\u2019s it. And there was no testimony. No one took the stand at that hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-12\">THE COURT: Well, let me go down the road that you\u2019ve decided to travel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-13\">Are you saying that, given the procedure [sic] posture as you\u2019ve outlined it, your client, if he had been in disagreement with Judge Harrington\u2019s ruling, would have been free to disobey the order? Because you know a quick 10-minute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>motions hearing, boom, boom, no trial, no witnesses, gone. Judge issues order. Can you ignore it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">MR. BOOTH: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">THE COURT: Well, what\u2019s the difference? You can\u2019t ignore the order, why doesn\u2019t it count?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">MR. BOOTH: Well, Your Honor, because, again, it\u2019s not the full panoply of rights that you had stated in your first hypothetical. It\u2019s a civil order. And it\u2019s issued as part of a motion to return property. So does it have to be obeyed? Yes. What\u2019s the penalty? Contempt. Violation of a Court order.... And in this particular case Mr. Furda\u2019s charged with perjury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">We turn to the parties\u2019 contentions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">In appellant\u2019s view, the court \u201cimproperly shifted the Burden of Proof\u2019 to appellant, because it \u201crepeatedly emphasized the fact that Mr. Furda never attached any explanation, regarding his evaluation period at Potomac Ridge, to the firearm application,\u201d thereby asking him \u201cto prove that [he] could not amend or explain [his] answers.\u201d Appellant complains that the court \u201cblamed\u201d him, \u201cin essence, for \u2018not doing something.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">According to Furda, \u201cthe burden should have been on the Government to show that attachments were allowed on the firearm application form, or [that] there was a comment section on the form that Mr. Furda failed to utilize.\u201d He alleges prejudice from the court\u2019s \u201cConstitutional error\u201d of \u201crequiring] the Defendant to demonstrate that he was not allowed to explain his answers (via a comment section or attachments).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">Appellant also complains that the court \u201crepeatedly faulted\u201d him for failing to subpoena Mr. Gilbert, the gun shop owner, to testify that the Application did not contain a comment section and that no attachments were allowed. According to appellant, \u201c[t]he judge thus imposed upon the Defense, the burden of persuasion, the burden of proof and the burden of going forward by requiring the Defense to produce a witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>In addition, appellant points out that the Application did not contain a \u201c \u2018comment\u2019 section ... nor is there any part of the form that tells an applicant he can attach documents to provide an explanation.\u201d He notes that he \u201cspecifically testified that he had brought the Motion for Reconsideration with him to the gun shop, ... that he spoke to Mr. Gilbert, at length, prior to filling out the form, ... and that he also had been told that attaching a document to the form was not allowed.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> He adds that Gilbert\u2019s affidavit, which appellant attached to his Supplement to Motion for New Trial, \u201ccorroborates the same information[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Appellant also contends that the court \u201cimproperly usurped the prosecutorial function\u201d by \u201cargufing] the Government\u2019s position\u201d with regard to \u201cseveral matters.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> And, he challenges the court\u2019s interjections in defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, during which the court \u201cdebated at length with Defense Counsel about his arguments.\u201d Further, he complains that the court \u201ccontinued the role of advocate\u201d at the hearing on appellant\u2019s Motion for New Trial. Thus, Furda insists that the court denied him \u201cthe fair trial that is his Due Process right under the U.S. Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The State counters that \u201cFurda received a fair trial, in accordance with the Constitution\u2019s Due Process requirements.\u201d It maintains that \u201c[t]he trial court properly required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the prosecution to shoulder the burden of proof at trial\u201d and \u201cconducted the trial in an impartial manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Moreover, the State argues that the court engaged in typical exchanges with counsel, in which it \u201carticulate[d] its understanding of the law, pose[d] hypotheticals, and forthrightly point[ed] out what may be weaknesses in [appellant\u2019s] case.\u201d But, in its view, the court did not do anything that \u201cwould cause a reasonable person to question [its] partiality.\u201d In any event, the State argues that appellant\u2019s allegation of partiality \u201cis not preserved,\u201d because \u201cFurda never lodged an objection to what he now claims is improper conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Appellant responds that \u201cthe Defense did object by arguing, at length, and repeatedly, with the Trial Judge over his comments and his remarks.\u201d Moreover, appellant asserts that \u201cbecause the Trial Judge was not asking a question, an objection would have been inappropriate, particularly in a bench trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">We agree with the State that the issues of bias and lack of partiality are waived. Notably, the judge asked if he could pose a question to appellant, and defense counsel said \u201clet\u2019s hear the question.\u201d Thereafter, defense counsel never objected to the question that was posed. The judge also asked if he could question defense counsel during closing argument, and defense counsel consented. As the Court has said, \u201cordinarily the failure to object will only be countenanced in those instances in which the judge exhibits repeated and egregious behavior of partiality, reflective of bias. Failure to object in less pervasive situations may not have the same result, nor will we necessarily intervene.\u201d <em>Diggs v. State, </em>409 Md. 260, 294, 973 A.2d 796 (2009). <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 8-131.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Even if preserved, the contention lacks merit. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Certainly, \u201c \u2018an impartial and disinterested judge\u2019 \u201d is \u201c \u2018fundamental to a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial----\u2019\u201d <em>Diggs, </em>409 Md. at 287, 973 A.2d 796 (citations omitted). Therefore, \u201c \u2018[i]f a judge\u2019s comments during [the proceedings] could cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality of the judge, then the defendant has been de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>prived of due process and the judge has abused his or her discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289, 973 A.2d 796 (quoting <em>Archer v. State, </em>383 Md. 329, 357, 859 A.2d 210 (2004) (other citations and quotation marks omitted)). But, there is no blanket rule prohibiting a trial court from questioning witnesses or counsel, particularly at a bench trial. Even in the context of a jury trial, this Court recently stated that it is \u201cwell-settled\u201d that a judge has discretion to question witnesses, noting that the \u201cprincipal justification\u201d for such questioning is \u201cto clarify issues in the case.\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>182 Md.App. 444, 480, 957 A.2d 1139 (2008). Nevertheless, trial judges must exercise this discretion sparingly, \u201clest they compromise their roles as impartial arbitrators in the eyes of the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482, 957 A.2d 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">In <em>Smith, </em>182 Md.App. at 489, 957 A.2d 1139, this Court noted that there is a \u201c \u2018fine line between assisting the jury by bringing out facts and \u201csharpening the issues,\u201d which is permissible, and influencing the jury\u2019s assessment of facts or of a witness\u2019s credibility by indicating his own opinions, which is not permissible.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Leak v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 353, 363-64, 579 A.2d 788 (1990)). The number of questions asked is not dispositive of the issue. Rather, it is \u201cthe degree to which these questions risked influencing the jury\u201d regarding \u201cwhat appeared to be the trial court\u2019s \u2018point of view\u2019 with respect to the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. See also Vandegrift v. State, </em>237 Md. 305, 311, 206 A.2d 250 (1965) (\u201cThe questioning by the trial judge showing his disbelief of the witnesses] testimony was beyond the line of impartiality over which a judge must not step.\u201d). In this case, of course, there was no jury, which weakens appellant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><em>Diggs, supra, </em>409 Md. at 260, 973 A.2d 796, also provides guidance. There, the Court of Appeals reversed the convictions of two defendants based on the trial judge\u2019s extensive questioning at a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>at 295, 973 A.2d 796. The judge \u201celicited key elements of the State\u2019s case,\u201d including \u201claying the foundation\u201d for one of the charges and \u201cestablish[ing] the chain of custody of the drugs after the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>failed to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293, 973 A.2d 796. The judge also extensively questioned a defense witness in a way that conveyed the judge\u2019s disbelief of the testimony, including asking the witness if she was \u201ccomfortable with\u201d her testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 266-67, 973 A.2d 796. The Court of Appeals determined that the trial judge \u201cacted as a co-prosecutor\u201d by questioning the witness in a manner that implied a disbelief in the defense, and this partiality and bias denied the defendants their right to a fair and impartial trial. <em>Id. </em>at 293-95, 973 A.2d 796. The Court said: \u201c \u2018A fair jury in jury cases and an impartial judge in all cases are prime prerequisites of due process. It is a maxim that every litigant, including the State in criminal cases, is entitled to nothing less than the cold neutrality of an impartial judge....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288, 973 A.2d 796 (quoting <em>Archer, </em>383 Md. at 356, 859 A.2d 210 (citation and quotation marks omitted)). <em>See also Jefferson-El v. State, </em>330 Md. 99, 106, 622 A.2d 737 (1993) (stating that judges\u2019 \u201cconduct during a trial has a direct bearing on whether a defendant will receive a fair trial because their opinion or manifestations thereof usually will significantly impact the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In this case, the judge was the fact finder. There was no jury that could have inferred bias from the judge\u2019s discourse with the witnesses and counsel, nor danger that the judge\u2019s conduct would \u201c \u2018impact the jury\u2019s verdict\u2019 \u201d or impinge on the jury\u2019s \u201c \u2018province ... to decide the guilt or innocence of the defendant.\u2019\u201d <em>Diggs, </em>409 Md. at 289, 973 A.2d 796 (citation omitted). Moreover, there was nothing whatsoever about the court\u2019s questions or the colloquy with counsel suggesting bias or partiality. To the contrary, the judge, who was tasked with ascertaining the facts and construing the law, was fully engaged in an attempt to understand the testimony and appellant\u2019s position. The colloquy displayed the careful, reflective consideration that the trial process is intended to achieve.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In sum, the transcript reveals a judge who was immersed in a thorough analysis of the issues raised by the parties. His thoughtful questions and his colloquies with counsel demonstrate that he was attempting to understand and resolve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>thorny issues presented by this case that he, as the fact finder, had to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">The remaining contentions also lack merit. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">It is well settled that, \u201c \u2018under the Federal Constitution, as well as the law of Maryland, the burden is on the State to prove all elements of the alleged crime and to do so beyond a reasonable doubt[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Bennett v. State, </em>283 Md. 619, 625, 392 A.2d 76 (1978) (citation omitted). As the Court said in <em>Montgomery v. State, </em>292 Md. 84, 91, 437 A.2d 654 (1981): \u201cThere are certain bedrock characteristics which distinguish our system from most others throughout the world and which are indispensable to the integrity of every criminal trial ..., [one of which is that] [t]he State has the burden to produce evidence of each element of the crime establishing the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d Thus, it is unconstitutional to \u201c \u2018impose[ ] upon a defendant a burden of proving, by any standard, his innocence as to any element of a crime....\u2019\u201d <em>Bennett, </em>283 Md. at 624, 392 A.2d 76 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Appellant argues that it was the duty of the prosecution \u201cto produce a witness to testify that comments could be added and explanations could be attached to the form, but the Trial Court held it against the Defense for not providing a witness to say \u2018comments cannot be made on and items cannot be attached to the form.\u2019 \u201d Pointing to <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009), appellant avers that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court is very clear that this simply is not the correct allocation of the burdens; simply because the Defense has the ability to subpoena witnesses does not require them to put on the Government\u2019s case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">It was readily apparent that the Application did not have a comments section. As the State aptly points out, \u201c[t]he judge\u2019s observations that Furda could have attached explanatory material ... did not shift the burden of proof.\u201d Rather, the court \u201cwas simply commenting on the evidence that was in the record, and the inferences that could be drawn from it,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>but \u201cthese comments do not show that the judge shifted the burden of proof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>is also misplaced. In that case, the trial court admitted into evidence affidavits that \u201creport[ed] the results of forensic analysis which showed that material seized by the police and connected to the defendant was cocaine.\u201d 129 S.Ct. at 2530. On appeal, the defendant argued that the affidavits of the analysts were testimonial, and thus were subject to the defense\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. <em>Id. </em>Because the analysts were not called as witnesses by the prosecution, the defendant insisted that the admission of the affidavits violated the Confrontation Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 2531. The Commonwealth countered that there was no Confrontation Clause violation because the defendant could have subpoenaed the analysts. <em>Id. </em>at 2540. The Court rejected that argument, noting that the subpoena power \u201cis no substitute for the right of confrontation. Unlike the Confrontation Clause, those provisions are of no use to the defendant when the witness is unavailable or simply refuses to appear.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Here, in contrast to <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the State made no attempt to introduce affidavits in lieu of witnesses. Moreover, the trial court did not put the onus on appellant to present the gun shop owner as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">In addition, the State met its burden of proof by offering the Application, which stated that a \u201cphysician\u2019s certificate\u201d could be attached to it, thereby providing sufficient evidence from which the trier of fact could infer that other documents or explanations could have been attached. Furda was not convicted of committing perjury or making a false statement because he did not provide an explanation; rather, he was convicted under C.L. \u00a7 9-101 and P.S. \u00a7 5-139(a) for knowingly, willingly, and falsely answering \u201cNo\u201d to Question 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">Appellant complains that the court \u201cimproperly denied a defense request to take Judicial Notice of records which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>were already part of the case-file.\u201d He insists that the Potomac Ridge records \u201cwere critical ... because they clearly showed that Mr. Furda was only \u2018evaluated\u2019 [and] that he never was \u2018admitted\u2019 nor \u2018committed,\u2019; and, that no hearing was ever held.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The State counters: \u201cThe trial court properly exercised its discretion not to consider Furda\u2019s medical records,\u201d because \u201cFurda did not make arrangements for the records, or copies of the records, to be available on the day of trial.\u201d It notes that the medical records \u201chad been subpoenaed and placed under seal\u201d in the Protective Order Case, and \u201cFurda had received a copy of these records in open court during the hearing on his petition to recover firearms.\u201d The State also argues that any error was harmless, because \u201cFurda\u2019s testimony about his hospitalization ... which the judge appeared to credit, was substantially consistent with the medical records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Maryland Rule 5-201 is captioned \u201cJudicial notice of adjudicative facts.\u201d Md. Rule 5-201(d) states: \u201cA court shall take judicial notice if requested by a party and supplied with the necessary information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In <em>Lerner v. Lerner Corp., </em>132 Md.App. 32, 750 A.2d 709, <em>cert. denied, </em>360 Md. 275, 757 A.2d 810 (2000), Lerner filed a motion asking this Court to \u201ctake judicial notice of Lerner Corporation\u2019s offer to sell stock\u201d and an \u201corder\u201d and \u201cnotice of judgment\u201d entered by the circuit court in a prior proceeding among the parties, so that \u201cthis Court [would have] a full chronology of the dispute among the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40, 750 A.2d 709. The Court granted the motion as to the order and notice of judgment, but refused to take judicial notice of the offer to sell stock because it was \u201cnot a part of the record, and its accuracy is subject to reasonable dispute and cannot be as readily and accurately ascertained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41, 750 A.2d 709. We explained, <em>id. </em>at 40-41, 750 A.2d 709:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">The doctrine of judicial notice substitutes for formal proof of a fact \u201cwhen formal proof is clearly unnecessary to enhance the accuracy of the fact-finding process.\u201d <em>Smith v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>Hearst Corp., </em>48 Md.App. 135, 136, 426 A.2d 1 (1981). A court may judicially note facts that readily can be determined by examination of a source whose accuracy cannot be reasonably questioned. Md. Rule 5-201(b). Included among the categories of things of which judicial notice may be taken are \u201cfacts relating to the ... records of the court.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>48 Md.App. at 136 n. 1, 426 A.2d 1. In McCormick\u2019s treatise on evidence, it is said to be \u201csettled, of course, that the courts, trial and appellate, take notice of their own respective records in the present litigation, both as to the matters occurring in the immediate trial, and in previous trials or hearings.\u201d <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 330, at 766 (2d ed. 1972), <em>quoted with approval </em>in <em>Irby v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 580, 586, 505 A.2d 552 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>308 Md. 270, 518 A.2d 732 (1987).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Appellant did not offer the records. The judge\u2019s decision not to take judicial notice of the medical records does not establish that the court would have barred their admission in evidence, had appellant offered them. Even assuming, <em>ar-guendo, </em>that the Potomac Ridge records were the proper subject of judicial notice, they were not pertinent to the disposition of the Perjury Case. This is because the court was not assessing the merits of Judge Harrington\u2019s Order; that is the subject of a separate appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Appellant contends that the court committed \u201creversible error\u201d when it denied his Motion for New Trial under Md. Rule 4-331.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We pause to review additional facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Appellant filed a Motion for New Trial on September 2, 2008, pursuant to Md. Rule 4-331(a). He complained that the State \u201cdid not produce any independent evidence other than the Court Order to demonstrate that Mr. Furda had been committed under the Federal, State, and County definitions of \u2018commitment.\u2019 \u201d Further, he argued that the court could not rely on the Order of November 7, 2007, as it was \u201cthe result of a civil motion hearing,\u201d for which there was \u201cthe total absence of live testimony, no ability to cross examine, and a lower standard of proof....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Furda also insisted that the emergency evaluation was not a commitment. In addition, he contended that State law preempted Montgomery County Code \u00a7 57-9(d) (2004), pertaining to the regulation of firearms, and thus the court erred in convicting him under County law. Further, appellant maintained that, at the time he applied to purchase a firearm, he and his counsel were unaware that his motion for reconsideration had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Appellant attached the Potomac Ridge records to his Motion for New Trial. The documents included a Notice of Hearing, which stated that appellant\u2019s \u201cinvoluntary admission [was] being sought because [he] presented] a danger to the life or safety of the individual or of others.\u201d In addition, appellant attached the \u201cContinuing Care/Discharge Planning form, which indicated that appellant was admitted on February 28, 2003, and released on March 4, 2003. It provided: \u201cSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: No Access to substances or fire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>arms.\u201d Furda also attached a Discharge Summary, signed by attending physician Joseph Marnell, M.D. on March 13, 2003, which indicated that appellant was discharged on March 4, 2003, with diagnoses of \u201cPsychosis, NOS [i.e., not otherwise specified], probably drug-induced,\u201d and \u201cAmphetamine Dependency.\u201d It also provided that appellant was \u201cevaluated and involuntarily committed\u201d at Potomac Ridge. Dr. Marnell elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\">The patient refused to sign in on a voluntary basis. I was confronted with the dilemma of whether to try to pursue an involuntary commitment against him as the hearing was to occur on the day of discharge.... I have no grounds for detaining the patient at this time. There is no evidence of psychosis, confusion or withdrawal.... I emphasize the patient is completely responsible for his actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The State opposed appellant\u2019s motion, contending that, for purposes of purchasing firearms, appellant was a \u201cprohibited person\u201d under federal law. According to the State, the records appellant attached were the same records that the trial court declined to judicially notice. Moreover, the State argued that the records were not the proper subject of Md. Rule 4-331(c), because appellant had possession of copies and could have offered them at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">On October 14, 2008, appellant filed a Supplement to Motion for New Trial, noting that his Motion for New Trial was filed pursuant to Md. Rule 4-331(a), and stating that if the Supplement did not fall within the deadline of Md. Rule 4-331(a), it should be considered as a motion pursuant to Md. Rule 4-331(b). Furda pointed to his testimony that \u201che attempted to attach the Motion for Reconsideration to his application,\u201d but he was unable to attach documents \u201cto this application to explain his situation,\u201d because the gun shop owner, Gilbert, said that attaching documents \u201cis simply not done.\u201d Appellant attached to the Supplement an affidavit from Gilbert to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">At a motion hearing on October 14, 2008, defense counsel argued that, \u201cin the interest of justice,\u201d the court had \u201cenough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>leeway\u201d under Md. Rule 4-331(a) to consider the additional evidence. Nevertheless, he said: \u201cI\u2019ll have to concede that this evidence did exist at the time, because it had been brought out in the underlying case. And it did not come into evidence in the case that is distinctly before Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The court indicated that, under Md. Rule 4-331(a), a trial court could not consider new evidence. It observed that defense counsel asked \u201cvery generally\u201d for the court \u201cto sort of take judicial notice of court records\u201d; the documents were not \u201cmarked and tendered into evidence____\u201d Nonetheless, the court considered the documents, observing that the attending physician who discharged appellant from Potomac Ridge said that Purda\u2019s \u201cfinal diagnosis\u201d was \u201cpsychosis\u201d and \u201chis final medication [was] Ziprexa.\u201d Moreover, the discharge papers indicated \u201cno guns____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Further, the court considered that \u201cCongress ... did not provide a definition\u201d for \u201ccommitment to a mental institution,\u201d but noted that \u201cregulations in 27 C.F.R.\u201d provide that \u201cthe term does not include a person in a mental institution for observation or a voluntary admission to a mental institution.\u201d The court determined that Potomac Ridge\u2019s \u201conly authority to keep [Furda] against his will is [H.G. \u00a7] 10-625[ (a) ][<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>]. So at least implicitly that\u2019s what they did.\u201d The court observed, however, that the word \u201ccommitment\u201d does not appear in H.G. \u00a7 10-625. It reasoned that the word is \u201ctoo harsh,\u201d and the Legislature used \u201c \u2018admission\u2019 because ... it feels better. It\u2019s the same damn thing, to be blunt.\u201d The court concluded: \u201cIt\u2019s an emergency involuntary commitment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">The court also determined that Gilbert\u2019s affidavit did not constitute \u201cnewly discovered evidence!.]\u201d Defense counsel conceded that he did not subpoena Mr. Gilbert, and the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>noted that \u201cMr. Gilbert was not either at trial or here today for cross-examination by the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In denying the motion, the court said: \u201c[T]he documents in issue do not qualify as newly discovered evidence.... Here, every single thing I\u2019ve been shown existed at the time of trial. So this case does not get the benefit of that exception to the rule.\u201d Further, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">One simply cannot knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally disregard the order of a Circuit court judge and the clear import of that order, when signing a document under the penalties of perjury, when what you say in the document is flatly opposite of what the Judge said \u2014 you can do it, but not with impunity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">On appeal, appellant insists that the court abused its discretion by refusing to grant a new trial to consider the Potomac Ridge Records and Gilbert\u2019s affidavit. He posits that, \u201cwhen dealing with a criminal case, \u2018a Trial Judge\u2019s discretion to deny a Motion for New Trial is much more limited than under other circumstances.\u2019 \u201d In his view, \u201ca Trial Judge \u2018has virtually no discretion to refuse to consider newly discovered evidence that bears directly on the question of whether a new trial should be granted\u2019 \u201d or that \u201c \u2018clearly indicates that the jury has been mislead [sic].\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The State observes that this Court generally reviews such denials only \u201c \u2018under the most extraordinary or compelling of circumstances.\u2019 \u201d In the State\u2019s view, the circumstances here are \u201cremarkable only because they could so easily have been avoided.\u201d (Citation omitted.) In particular, the State points out that \u201cFurda conceded that the medical evidence [was] not newly discovered\u201d and that \u201cGilbert had not been subpoenaed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">It is well settled that a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial is generally subject to review for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Campbell v. State, </em>373 Md. 637, 665, 821 A.2d 1 (2003). In some instances, however, an appellate court reviews for error the denial of a motion for a new trial. <em>See Merritt v. State, </em>367 Md. 17, 30-31, 785 A.2d 756 (2001). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>our view, the circuit court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s new trial motion Trial. The Potomac Ridge records and Gilbert\u2019s affidavit did not constitute \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d because Furda knew of Gilbert and the Potomac Ridge records at the time of trial. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-331(c); <em>Ramirez v. State, </em>178 Md.App. 257, 282, 941 A.2d 1141 (2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 Md. 561, 979 A.2d 708 (2009).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The Motion for New Trial is not a vehicle to obtain the proverbial \u201csecond bite at the apple.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

In the exercise of our discretion, we decline to dismiss the appeal on this basis. <em>See Simmons v.

According to the State, it had provided appellant with copies of the records. In any event, during the hearing on Furda\u2019s Motion for New Trial, the court reviewed the medical records that Furda attached to his motion. Evidently, it was not persuaded that the records would have changed the outcome had they been introduced during the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b95-7\">MEREDITH, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AGB\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Is an affiant obligated to respond to a question on a form by providing an answer the affiant believes is factually false in order to avoid committing the crime of perjury? The result in this case places a person in the untenable position of having to state under oath that something is true \u2014 namely, in this case, that Furda had in fact \u201cbeen committed to a mental institution\u201d \u2014 even though the person does not believe the truth of that statement, in order to avoid committing the crime of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">In my view, an affiant does not commit the crime of perjury by swearing that a statement is true unless the affiant subjectively believes that the statement is in fact not true. The essential element of both of the crimes of which Furda was convicted is a false statement. In this case, the State argued to the trial court that Furda\u2019s answer to Question 8 was \u201cthe basis of the case\u201d because the answer was \u201cdemonstrably false.\u201d The trial court agreed that \u201cMr. Furda knew darn well that he had been involuntarily committed to Potomac <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Ridge. He was not free to leave during that time period. He knew it. It\u2019s a fact.\u201d As the majority opinion points out, however, both the State and the trial judge were incorrect in their assertions that Furda had been committed to a mental institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Yet, despite the fact that Furda was correct in asserting that he had never been committed to a mental institution, the majority opinion concludes that his correct assertion was nevertheless an act of perjury. According to the circuit court and the majority opinion in this case, the answer to Question 8 that would have avoided a finding of guilt on the charge of perjury was \u201cyes\u201d even if Furda believed that it would have been a false statement for him to swear that he \u201cha[d] been committed to a mental institution.\u201d I would hold that it was reversible error for the trial court to find, based upon the evidence in this case, that Furda \u201cwillfully and falsely ma[d]e an oath or affirmation as to a material fact ... in an affidavit.\u201d For the same reason, I would also reverse the conviction for making a false statement of fact in a firearm application.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">If Question 8 had asked whether any court had ever ruled that the applicant had been committed to a mental institution, then I would agree that, under the circumstances of this case, Furda\u2019s answer of \u201cNo\u201d to that question would have supported the convictions. But Question 8 did not ask about any prior court interpretations or rulings. It asked instead: \u201cHave you ever been ... committed to a mental institution?\u201d If Furda believed that the correct answer to that question was \u201cno,\u201d then he should not be found guilty of perjury for having provided what he believed was the correct answer to that question, notwithstanding the fact that a judge had expressed a contrary opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The point is illustrated by a hypothetical case, in which a person is convicted of a robbery that the person knows he did not commit. If asked to answer under oath if he had ever been convicted of a robbery, the correct answer would be \u201cyes,\u201d even if the conviction was being appealed. But, if asked to answer under oath whether he had in fact committed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>robbery, the truthful answer that would not be perjurious would be \u201cno,\u201d regardless of the fact that some court had found otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Remarkably, the majority opinion asserts: \u201cIn the context of this case appellant\u2019s personal belief was not controlling.\u201d It seems to me that, in the context of a criminal prosecution on the charge of willfully making a false representation, the defendant\u2019s personal belief would indeed be a controlling factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">I cannot agree with the assertion made in the majority opinion that, \u201c[ujnder the circumstances attendant here, appellant was obligated to answer \u2018Yes\u2019 to Question 8 until such time as the court\u2019s finding of commitment was set aside.\u201d To me, that position is tantamount to saying that a person must commit perjury to avoid committing perjury. In my view, it distorts the obligation of the oath if we say that a witness is required to put aside personal beliefs and testify, under threat of criminal penalty, to a version of facts that is at odds with the witness\u2019s own subjective view.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Although the majority opinion devotes many pages to cases that discuss the need for obedience to court orders, cases involving contempt proceedings and injunctions have little to do with the specific question before the Court in this case, namely, whether Furda committed the crimes of perjury and false statement. Regardless of whether Furda displayed appropriate deference to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, or whether he is a person who should have possession of firearms, in this case, Furda was neither cited for contempt nor charged with illegal possession of a firearm. The sole specific allegation of criminality in this case is that Furda illegally gave a false answer on a form when he answered, correctly, that he had never been committed to a mental institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The perversity of the result in this case is compounded by the fact that our Court now agrees that Furda was correct when he swore that he had never been \u201ccommitted to a mental institution.\u201d It cannot be said that the representation he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>made on the form \u2014 \u201cNo,\u201d I have not \u201cbeen committed to a mental institution\u201d \u2014 -was a false statement of fact. His answer was literally true, and that is normally a complete defense to a charge of perjury. In -view of our conclusion that the circuit court erred in making its November 7, 2007, ruling that Furda <em>had </em>been \u201cinvoluntarily committed to a mental institution,\u201d I do not see how these convictions can stand. If, as we hold in the companion case, the correct answer to Question 8 truly was the one given by Furda \u2014 namely, that he was never \u201ccommitted\u201d \u2014 he should not be found guilty of perjury and false statement for having provided a correct answer to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">I therefore dissent from Section II of the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
