Sims, who was eighteen at the time of the offenses, was sentenced to a total of thirty years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">On appeal, we must determine, <em>inter alia, </em>whether the trial court erred by permitting the State to introduce at appellant\u2019s trial a redacted version of his pretrial alibi notice, even though appellant did not testify or present a defense case. Appellant poses the following three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-11\">1. Is Mr. Sims entitled to a new trial because the trial judge erroneously permitted the prosecution to introduce to the jury Mr. Sims\u2019s pretrial alibi notice even though Mr. Sims did not testify or call any witnesses at trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-12\">2. Is Mr. Sims entitled to a new trial because the trial judge acted as a co-prosecutor by asking questions that improved and expanded upon prosecution witness testimony? <em>See Diggs v. State, </em>409 Md. 260, 973 A.2d 796 (2009).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>3. Is Mr. Sims entitled to a remand for the purpose of seeking a sentencing revision (Md. R. 4-345(e)(l)(B)) and a sentencing redetermination from a three-judge panel (Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-102 &amp; Md. R. 4-344) because his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to take advantage of either procedure, even though the eighteen-year-old Mr. Sims was sentenced to the statutory m\u00e1ximums resulting in thirty years in prison?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer Question 1 in the affirmative. Therefore, we shall reverse and remand for a new trial. Our disposition of the first issue makes it unnecessary for us to address the remaining questions, as they are not likely to recur on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">On August 9, 2007, appellant was charged with the first-degree murder of Paul Cornish on June 30, 2007. <em>See </em>Md. Code (2002), \u00a7 2-201 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d). He was also charged with use of a handgun in the commission of a felony and crime of violence, in violation of C.L. \u00a7 4-204; and wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun, in violation of C.L. \u00a7 4-203. E.D. Eshmont entered an appearance as defense counsel on August 31, 2007. Eshmont was replaced on January 30, 2008, when Audre Davis-Robinson, Assistant Public Defender, entered her appearance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, on February 5, 2008, Davis-Robinson filed a Notice of Alibi Witnesses, pursuant to Md. Rule 4-263(d)(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It listed eleven names and addresses, including that of appellant\u2019s father, Perry Simms, Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The trial was held six months later, in August 2008. What follows is a summary of the evidence adduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>On the evening of June 30, 2007, shortly before 9:00 p.m., Apollo Thompson and the victim were at the corner of Lloyd and Granby streets in Baltimore City. Thompson testified that they were \u201cjust hanging right there getting ready to go to the club. We was drinking.\u201d While there, they noticed a man riding his bicycle on Granby Street. Thompson recounted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB9\">We was looking at him to see who it was. We didn\u2019t recognize the dude. I wasn\u2019t really paying him no mind but Paul was and him and the dude was having some strong eye contact.... And Paul was saying something like, you know, who the fuck is that? What the fuck is he looking at?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The person on the bicycle made a left turn on Lloyd Street and disappeared from view. Thompson stated: \u201cI walked to the corner to see where he was at.\u201d Thompson recalled, \u201che\u2019s still right there. He didn\u2019t go no where.\u201d According to Thompson, Cornish \u201cwas like let\u2019s go see what the fuck his problem is.\u201d Thompson continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">After he said that, I was like \u201cwell, come on.\u201d Then we started walking across the street. Once we got to the corner, I approached the dude first on the bike \u2018cause I was walking in the front. And I walked right up to him and I put my finger in his face and I looked at Paul and said \u201cthis nigger right here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">After I said that, the dude dropped down the bike said \u201cthis nigger right here what?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Thompson was asked how close he was to the person on the bicycle. He answered: \u201cLike right next to him, like two feet.\u201d Thompson claimed that the man on the bicycle got off of his bike and pulled a gun out and kept repeating, \u201c \u2018this nigger right here what?\u2019 \u201d Thompson stated: \u201cAnd we just saying \u2018all right, ain\u2019t no problem. Chill out. Chill out.\u2019 \u201d Thompson \u201cran across Lloyd Street, across Granby Street, into the parking lot on the other side of Lloyd Street. On the opposite corner where he was at.\u201d Thompson denied that he (Thompson) had a knife in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">After Thompson started running, he heard \u201cfive or six\u201d gunshots. Thompson explained that he did not see Cornish as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>he was running away because Thompson\u2019s \u201cback was turned.\u201d When he returned to the comer a few seconds later, he saw Cornish on the ground with blood coming from his leg. Cornish was transported to Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he died of his gunshot wounds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Thompson testified that after he left the hospital, he \u201cwent back down to the area, Lloyd and Granby\u201d because that was where his car was parked. According to Thompson, he did not speak to the police because \u201cthat just ain\u2019t what people do \u2018round the way.\u201d Thompson was not contacted by the police until June 1, 2008. He gave a statement to Baltimore City Police Detective Juan Diaz.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">On direct examination, the prosecutor did not ask Thompson if he could identify Mr. Sims. On cross-examination, however, Thompson was asked if Mr. Sims was \u201cthe man who was on the bike that night[.]\u201d Thompson responded, \u201cNo.\u201d He agreed that Sims \u201cis lighter than the man who was on the bike[.]\u201d On redirect, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">[PROSECUTOR:] ... When you testified, did you indicate that the person sitting at the table is not the person who was on the bike or did you testify under oath that you are not sure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">[THOMPSON:] I said it don\u2019t look like him. That\u2019s what I said I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did you say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac7\">[THOMPSON]: I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">[PROSECUTOR:] Court\u2019s indulgence. And then counsel questioned you about how long you had an opportunity to see the person on the bike as they rode down Granby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Street. When you first saw, total, how much time did you spend looking at the man on the bike on Granby Street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">[THOMPSON:] Face I just had like a couple quick glances, like maybe two or three seconds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Brent Huggins testified that on the night of June 30, 2007, he was outside of his residence, located at the corner of Lloyd and Granby, with his sister, Montcreal;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> his cousins; and a couple of \u201chomeboys.\u201d Sims arrived on a bicycle and spoke to Ms. Huggins. About five or ten minutes later, \u201ctwo men approach, comes around the corner, very awkward \u2014 very peculiar, and (Unintelligible) approaches Perry Simms.\u201d Huggins knew one of the two men as \u201cApollo.\u201d He testified: \u201cI noticed Perry starting to back up while he was on his bike. And they continued to approach him. After they continue[d] to approach him, he suddenly started to drop the bike.\u201d Huggins recounted that Sims \u201cwarned them not to come closer. However, they kept coming. They would not stop.\u201d Sims then \u201cpulled a weapon out\u201d and \u201cthey still continued to come forward. And he wasn\u2019t pointing or aiming it at them at all, at first. It was just basically down, but they continue to come.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Huggins continued: \u201cOnce they kept coming he aimed, and then that\u2019s when they decided to start walking away.\u201d Huggins noted that \u201cit was as if they didn\u2019t care, so they kept coming, ready to attack him. So he \u2014 after they kept coming, he aimed. Not at them. He was just \u2014 he just shot.\u201d He added that, at the time that the gunfire was initiated, the two men were \u201cbacking up,\u201d away from Sims. Huggins indicated that, at the time, \u201cMontcreal was ... in the doorway\u201d and \u201cnot in reach of Perry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">When asked if he saw Sims shoot anyone, Mr. Huggins said: \u201cNo, I did not see him shoot him.\u201d Huggins also agreed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>he did not \u201cknow ... if someone was shot at all.\u201d Further, Huggins said: \u201c[H]e was not aiming at anybody, pretty much.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">In addition, Mr. Huggins testified: \u201c[0]nce I heard \u2014 once he shot, that was it. I was gone. I don\u2019t know what happened after that.\u201d Mr. Huggins explained that he \u201cfled the scene\u201d because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be a part of none of that.\u201d He also claimed that he did not contact the police that night to report what he saw because he was \u201cscared[,] ... frightened[,] ... didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The State introduced a photo array shown to Mr. Huggins by Detective Diaz on July 10, 2007. Mr. Huggins had identified Sims as \u201cthe person who committed the crime.\u201d On the back of the photo array, Mr. Huggins wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">This person is someone who makes surprised [sic] appearances at the basketball club. From what I\u2019ve seen, he\u2019s not a person who would commit a crime such as this. The crime happened out of self-defense. This whole crime wouldn\u2019t have happened if the two men wouldn\u2019t have approached him at the first place. I know him as Perry. Once approached by the two men, he pulled out a handgun, not to kill but to send a warning to back off. He had a look that may have seemed scared and confused, and out of desperation he fired the gun. After the first shot, I don\u2019t know what happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">Mr. Huggins saw Mr. Thompson with a knife \u201con his hip, on his pants,\u201d but Thompson never removed the knife from his pants. However, when questioned by the police on July 10, 2007, Huggins did not indicate that Mr. Thompson had a knife. He explained that he was \u201cconfused, scared, you know, I didn\u2019t know what was happening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">The State showed Mr. Huggins the statement he gave to the police on July 10, 2007. Mr. Huggins read from it as follows: \u201c \u201cWhat made it seem like [Sims] wasn\u2019t going to kill no one is he moved the young lady Montreal [sic] out of the way\u2019 \u2014 I mean \u2018out of the way so that she wouldn\u2019t get hurt.\u2019\u201d Mr. Huggins explained the discrepancy between his earlier testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>mony, in which he indicated that Montcreal was out of \u201creach of Perry,\u201d and his statement of July 10, 2007, as follows: \u201cThat\u2019s when everything was fresh in my mind. Some of it\u2019s not even fresh in my mind anymore.\u201d Upon review of his statement, he recalled that when Thompson and Cornish approached Sims, Thompson asked, \u201c \u2018Is that him?\u2019 \u201d and Cornish answered: \u201cYes, that\u2019s him, that\u2019s the one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Montcreal Huggins testified that she and Sims \u201cwere friends\u201d in 2007, but appellant had been her boyfriend in 2005. She indicated that on the evening of June 30, 2007, she was at her residence at the corner of Lloyd and Granby Street, \u201coutside standing on the porch\u201d with her brother, Brent; her cousin; and her cousin\u2019s friends. She saw Sims ride \u201con his bike,\u201d \u201cpast [her] house.\u201d He then \u201ccame over and he asked [her] how [she] was doing and [they] continued to have a conversation.\u201d She explained that, \u201c[i]n the middle of the conversation Apollo [Thompson] and Paul [Cornish] came around the comer and then ... they stopped in front of [Sims] and they \u2014 basically it was a problem.\u201d Ms. Huggins stated: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the situation was but it was conflict.\u201d She continued: \u201c[T]hey walked up to him and ... well, Mr. Thompson said, \u2018Is this the nigger right here?\u2019 He stated that to Paul.\u201d At the time, Ms. Huggins was about three or four feet away from Sims. Ms. Huggins testified that Cornish and Thompson \u201ccontinued to get closer and as they got closer ... [Sims] lifted up his shirt.\u201d At that time, Ms. Huggins saw a \u201cgun.\u201d She claimed that Cornish and Thompson \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything. They just still stood there.\u201d Sims \u201cwarned them that he had a gun because Mr. Thomas [sic] ... had a weapon also.\u201d According to Ms. Huggins, Thompson was carrying a knife \u201c[o]n his hip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Ms. Huggins recalled that Thompson and Cornish were within \u201carm\u2019s reach\u201d of Sims, and she was about \u201cfour or five feet\u201d from Sims when he \u201cpulled out the gun.\u201d Cornish and Thompson then \u201cran off,\u201d with \u201c[t]heir back ... towards [Sims] as they ran away.\u201d She \u201cwas going into [her house].\u201d While inside, she heard two gun shots. However, she said: \u201cI didn\u2019t see him shoot the gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>About an hour after the shooting, appellant called Ms. Huggins and apologized for \u201cput[ting] [her] in harm\u2019s way.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ms. Huggins indicated that \u201cthe defendant told [her] that a Mend of his ... was shot\u201d on June 29, 2007. When asked if the person\u2019s name was \u201cTim,\u201d Ms. Huggins replied that she didn\u2019t \u201crecall names.\u201d The following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZt\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. What area did the defendant tell you that the people who did something to Tim lived in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT6\">[MS. HUGGINS]: My neighborhood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: All right and just so the record is clear, this conversation that you\u2019re having with the defendant regarding Tim, is that after the shooting of Mr. Cornish?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFC\">[MS. HUGGINS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay---- In that same conversation with the defendant where he discussed something happening to his Mend Tim ... does the defendant explain to you why it is he came back down to Lloyd Street on the day of Mr. Cornish\u2019s shooting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">[MS. HUGGINS]: Yes. * * * He said that someone from our neighborhood had robbed and shot his friend and he was just coming down here to solve a problem. * * * He didn\u2019t come down here to fight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Later that night, Ms. Huggins was interviewed by Detective Diaz and another detective at the police station. She stated that she \u201cdidn\u2019t tell them that [she] knew who did the shooting. [She] didn\u2019t tell them anything.\u201d Additionally, she agreed that she did not tell police that Mr. Thompson had a knife. But, she told Detective Diaz and his partner that the person who fired the shots \u201cwas on a bike\u201d and \u201chad a hat on,\u201d although she did not \u201cremember seeing his face.\u201d She explained that she did not initially tell the police that Sims was the shooter because she \u201cdid not want to be involved\u201d and that she was \u201cprotecting [her]self.\u201d However, Ms. Huggins later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>acknowledged that, during her first police interview, she told police that she \u201csaw the flash or the flare of the gun\u201d as it was fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">According to Ms. Huggins, on July 9, 2007, \u201cOfficer Diaz and his partner\u201d came to her house and told her \u201cthat they needed [her] down at the station.\u201d She claimed that Officer Diaz\u2019s partner began to \u201cthreaten\u201d her when he was in her home and then again at the police station. According to Ms. Huggins, \u201che told me that if I \u2014 he asked me did I like my neighborhood and he told me that if I liked where I live, he should \u2014 I should tell the truth because if I didn\u2019t, he would get me and my family put out.\u201d Ms. Huggins agreed that the detective also told her \u201cshe could be charged with a crime.\u201d After that threat, she identified appellant as the man she had seen on the bicycle with the gun.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The court asked Ms. Huggins: \u201cAs a result of these threats you gave a statement?\u201d Ms. Huggins answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The court then asked: \u201cWas your statement truthful or did you lie?\u201d Ms. Huggins replied: \u201cNo, I did not lie. I told them exactly what I saw.\u201d Ms. Huggins later acknowledged that she lied during her first interview, when she claimed she did not know the identity of the shooter. She stated: \u201c[I]t was a lie because I did know who he was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Ms. Huggins was shown a photo array during the second interview; she identified Sims as the shooter. On the back of the photo array, Ms. Huggins wrote: \u201c[P]erry is my ex-Boyfriend. [P]erry shot Paul.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Detective Diaz testified that appellant was arrested on July 13, 2007, was advised of his rights, waived them,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and made a recorded statement. It was played for the jury. In that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>statement, appellant claimed that, on the date of the crime, he was at his mother\u2019s home all day until he \u201cwent up Douglas projects\u201d at about 11:00 p.m. Appellant also claimed that, between 9:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., his mother blew out and braided his hair, and that his younger and older brothers were also at the house. In addition, Sims indicated that someone named Tim, who \u201clive up the street\u201d from appellant, had been shot that day.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant denied that he owned a bicycle. He also denied that he shot anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The State sought to play three recorded telephone conversations involving appellant, which took place during appellant\u2019s pretrial incarceration.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In connection with the ruling on the admissibility of the recorded telephone conversations, the court also discussed the defense\u2019s alibi notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The prosecutor advised the court that the defense had disclosed a list of \u201cabout 10\u201d alibi witnesses, and that, in one of the recorded telephone conversations, appellant referred to about twenty people who saw him at a party. Referring to the alibi notice, the court asked: \u201cAre you going to put that into evidence?\u201d The court then said: \u201c[I]f the alibi statement sounds to be probative, she\u2019s [i.e., defense counsel] the agent of the defendant, so it\u2019s admissible against him----\u201d The court also said to the prosecutor: \u201c[Y]ou should put the filing into evidence so that you can argue it to the jury.\u201d The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I would have an objection to that and ask for an opportunity to be heard\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">THE COURT: You\u2019ll be heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: \u2014 on that collateral issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQY\">THE COURT: All right. But if \u2014 well, why don\u2019t you tell me now. Why shouldn\u2019t your alibi statement \u2014 you\u2019re the agent of the defendant, why wouldn\u2019t that come in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atxf\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, the Defense has no burden to put any defense on. And the State bringing up the Defense\u2019s attorney filing a notice of alibi witnesses, shifts the burden that my client then has to rebut.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">THE COURT: Let me put on my Defense attorney hat for a minute. * * * She\u2019s not bound to put on an alibi defense. * * * She [i.e., the defense] just has to give you warning. * * * And suppose she as a careful lawyer says, all right, I better file [the alibi notice] this so I have the option of using it and decides not to do it. Then what\u2019s the relevance for the State to put it in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: The relevance for the State, whether she puts it in or not, is consciousness of guilt. The State\u2019s argument\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-11\">THE COURT: It could be. But how does that show consciousness of guilt? It\u2019s only consciousness of guilt if it\u2019s false. * * * The fact that she doesn\u2019t use it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s false. * * * The fact that she\u2019s not \u2014 how do you prove it\u2019s a false alibi. * * * At least it is an admission by counsel. * * * I mean counsel could say and the defendant could say, you know, I\u2019ve got these alibi -witnesses, but maybe they\u2019ve got criminal records, maybe the jury won\u2019t like them, so I\u2019m going to make a tactical decision not to put them on.

You feel me?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The State showed Detective Diaz State\u2019s Exhibit No. 30, which was a redacted version of the alibi notice that appellant\u2019s attorney had submitted on February 5, 2008. As noted, the alibi notice initially contained the names of eleven alibi witnesses. The redacted version contained only the name of appellant\u2019s father, and was in the form of a pleading, signed by appellant\u2019s attorney. Captioned \u201cNOTICE OF ALIBI WITNESS,\u201d it stated: \u201cPursuant to Maryland Rules of Procedure, 4-263(d)(3), Defendant is disclosing the name and address of the following witness:\u201d The Notice listed \u201cPerry Simms, Sr.\u201d along with his address.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The following testimony is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: During the investigation and approaching the trial date in this case, did there come a time that you received any documentation relating to Notice of an Alibi Witness on behalf of the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">[DETECTIVE DIAZ]: Yes ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: When you received the document that I\u2019m showing you, State\u2019s 30, does that document \u2014 what it that \u2014 what is the name on State\u2019s 30 that was disclosed on behalf of the defendant as an alibi witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>THE COURT: Basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Defense counsel sought to incorporate her earlier arguments. At the bench, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Your Honor, my objection is that the document [i.e., the redacted alibi notice], in and of itself, is tantamount to a pleading----* * * It\u2019s not evidence in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">THE COURT: Pleadings can be if there are admissions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: But they\u2019re \u2014 it\u2019s prepared by counsel, it\u2019s not....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-10\">THE COURT: It\u2019s an agent of a defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3s\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: That\u2019s correct and I just want it placed on the record so the Court knows. As I indicated previously, Mr. Sims was represented by another attorney. I picked up his case after [appellant] had been charged, had his indictment, had been arraigned. I did not enter my appearance in this case until January and as his attorney I felt duty bound to turn over whatever information I had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-11\">THE COURT: Understood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And it\u2019s not necessarily proper to assume the information I had came from the defendant and entering this Notice of Alibi Witness into evidence, I believe creates that aura that it came from him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-13\">THE COURT: On a personal level, I\u2019m sympathetic---but I, as I understand the law, an emaciate [sic] pleading can be an admission and when you enter into a pleading on his behalf, it is \u2014 can be an admission against him. The record should reflect that Exhibit 30 has been redacted so that only one name of the, I don\u2019t know, dozen that you submitted, is going to the jury and the reason and that one name is Perry Simms, Senior \u2014 . * * * [A]nd the only reason I\u2019m letting it in is because of the taped conversation which he says his father was out of town. I would not let in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>other names for all kinds of reasons so your objection\u2019s noted, appreciated, overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The testimony resumed, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: [W]hose name was provided as an alibi witness on behalf of the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">[DETECTIVE DIAZ]: I received Senior, Perry Simms, Senior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The State then offered State\u2019s Exhibit 30 into evidence. Appellant again objected, the court again overruled the objection, and the redacted alibi notice was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">After the prosecution rested,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> appellant rested. He did not testify or call any defense witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">The court and counsel discussed jury instructions, initially in chambers and then on the record.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In terms of argument as to the issue of alibi witnesses, the court limited the State to arguing only about appellant\u2019s mother and father.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">Immediately before giving \u201cformal instructions on the law,\u201d the court announced to the jury a \u201cpreliminary instruction on the evidence.\u201d It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">Ladies and gentlemen, there was some tapes played for you recently during the trial. And there was some references there to potential alibi witnesses, and I want to tell you to strike from your mind any references about alibi witnesses except as the testimony concerned the defendant\u2019s father and mother. Other than father and mother, you should strike it from the record and do not consider it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">In closing, defense counsel argued, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Mr. Simms gave a statement to Detective Diaz, and he told him I wasn\u2019t there. Not self defense. I had a gun, you had a gun, there are witnesses, weapons, two of them, one of me. He never said it was self defense. He said I wasn\u2019t there. It wasn\u2019t me. Were you listening? It has nothing to do with self defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In rebuttal, the State argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">Defense tells you [Ms. Huggins is my witness]. Please understand that just because I called somebody to the stand, that don\u2019t make them my witness. Please understand it\u2019s my burden to prove a case, so I\u2019ll get the witness here, but that doesn\u2019t make them my witness, okay? Montreal [sic] Huggins wasn\u2019t my witness. She was his witness. His witness, his girl. What does she say? I was threatened. I was threatened. Counsel tells you that when she went downtown that first night, she said she didn\u2019t know who did the shooting. You know why she said she didn\u2019t know who did the shooting? Because that\u2019s your witness. I\u2019m not saying he has any burden to prove anything. The burden is all mine. I got that. But I\u2019m trying to get you to understand about the motive with which people come to court. And just because I put her on the stand, doesn\u2019t mean that they have any (indiscernible) to me, to my cause.1 [<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">Appellant argues that he \u201cis entitled to a new trial because the trial judge erroneously permitted the prosecution to introduce his pretrial alibi notice.\u201d He posits that no state in the country permits the prosecution to \u201cintroduce an alibi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>statement against a non-testifying defendant who calls no witnesses.\u201d Sims asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">[introducing an alibi notice against a non-testifying defendant who calls no witnesses impermissibly converts a rule of discovery into a method for extracting admissions, invites the jury to draw a negative inference from the defendant\u2019s decision not to present a case, and calcifies the defendant\u2019s trial strategy before he has the benefit of seeing the prosecution\u2019s evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The State responds: \u201cWhile [Sims] did not testify or call witnesses, his defense was essentially an alibi defense.\u201d It maintains that the alibi notice was properly admitted because \u201cSims\u2019s defense at trial was that he was elsewhere at the time of the offense.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In addition, the State posits that the authorities suggesting that it is improper to introduce an alibi notice that has been \u201cwithdrawn\u201d are not apposite, because Sims does not claim that he withdrew his alibi notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Further, the State contends that the redacted alibi notice was \u201crelevant to a willfully false alibi.\u201d It argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">The taped phone calls gave the trial court a sufficient basis for concluding that the alibi as to his father was willfully false. Thus, the redacted alibi notice was properly admitted because Sims essentially presented an alibi defense and other evidence tended to show that, as to one name on the alibi notice, it was willfully false.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">We conclude that the circuit court erred or abused its discretion by permitting the State to introduce into evidence appellant\u2019s pretrial alibi notice, when appellant neither testified nor presented a defense case. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">An alibi is \u201c \u2018[a] defense that places the defendant at the relevant time of [the] crime in a different place than the scene involved....\u2019\u201d <em>Robertson v. State, </em>112 Md.App. 366, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>375, 685 A.2d 805 (1996) (citation omitted). <em>See Smith v. State, </em>302 Md. 175, 180, 486 A.2d 196 (1985). As one criminal scholar explains: \u201cThe presence of the defendant at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed is obviously an essential element of the prosecutor\u2019s case[.]\u201d Charles E. Torcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 27, at 273 (15th ed. 1993). When a defendant raises an alibi defense, \u201che is in effect denying the claim of the prosecution that he was present at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274. By claiming \u201cthat he was at another place at the time when the alleged crime was committed, the defendant is denying by necessary implication, if not expressly, the allegations set forth in the charge.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">To prove an alibi, \u201cthe testimony must cover the whole time in which the crime ... might have been committed.\u201d <em>Floyd v. State, </em>205 Md. 573, 581, 109 A.2d 729 (1954). However, an alibi defense is not an affirmative defense. <em>Robertson, </em>112 Md.App. at 375, 685 A.2d 805. Rather, it merely serves \u201cto negate an element of the crime,\u201d i.e., criminal agency. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the defendant does not bear the burden of proof on that issue. <em>See In re Parris W., </em>363 Md. 717, 728, 770 A.2d 202 (2001) (\u201cAn alibi is not an affirmative defense, and a defendant does not bear the burden of proving that he or she was elsewhere during the commission of the crime.\u201d); <em>Robinson v. State, </em>20 Md.App. 450, 459, 316 A.2d 268 (1974) (\u201cProof of an alibi, like any other defense testimony, is simply a means of controverting the State\u2019s effort to establish criminal agency.\u201d). <em>See also State v. Grady, </em>276 Md. 178, 184, 345 A.2d 436 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">To be sure, a defendant \u201ctraditionally has not [been] required ... to plead specifically his defense. A plea of \u2018not guilty\u2019 ordinarily brings into issue all possible defenses to the substantive charge.\u201d Wayne R. LaFave, et al, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 20.5(b) (5th ed. 2009) (\u201cLaFave\u201d). However, \u201cthe federal system and more than forty states require the defendant to give advance notice of his intent to raise an alibi defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Maryland is one of those states. <em>See Williams </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number><em>v. Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78, 83, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970) (\u201c[T]he privilege against self-incrimination is not violated by a requirement that the defendant give notice of an alibi defense and disclose his alibi witnesses.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">At the relevant time, disclosure of an alibi notice was governed by Maryland Rule 4 \u2014 263(d)(3).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Rule 4-263 is captioned \u201cDiscovery in circuit court.\u201d Subsection (d) was captioned \u201cDiscovery by the State,\u201d and pertained to the defendant\u2019s discovery obligations. Rule 4-263(d)(3) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A53\">(d) Discovery by the State. Upon the request of the State, the defendant shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">(3) Alibi witnesses. Upon designation by the State of the time, place, and date of the alleged occurrence, furnish the name and address of each person other than the defendant whom the defendant intends to call as a witness to show that the defendant was not present at the time, place, and date designated by the State in its request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In addition, under Maryland Rule 4-263(e), appellant was required to \u201cfurnish the discovery within ten days after service.\u201d As noted, appellant\u2019s attorney furnished the alibi notice soon after she entered her appearance in the case, some six months before the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">The Court of Appeals elucidated the reasons for the required alibi notice in <em>Taliaferro v. State, </em>295 Md. 376, 385-86, 456 A.2d 29 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 948, 103 S.Ct. 2114, 77 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1983):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">The reasons underlying a procedure that requires notice of an alibi defense are well stated in Epstein, <em>Advance Notice of Alibi, </em>55 J.Crim. L., Criminology &amp; Police Sci. 29, 31-32 (1964):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\"><em>\u201cOne. </em>Foremost is the idea that the statute prevents surprise. Alibi has been termed a \u2018hip pocket\u2019 defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>because of the ease with which it can be manufactured for introduction in the final hours of trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\"><em>Two. </em>The statute acts to deter false alibis because defendants know that the information furnished will be investigated before trial____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\"><em>Three. </em>Pretrial investigation results in a saving of money and trial time. This occurs in two ways. (1) If, after the investigation, the district attorney is satisfied that the alibi is true, the case should be dismissed; (2) the district attorney is not surprised at trial by the alibi defense, and there is no need for a continuance to investigate and prepare....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\"><em>Four. </em>Alibis which are presented at trial will be accorded more respect____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Rule 12.1(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure expressly bars the admission of an alibi notice against the person who provided the notice. It states: \u201cEvidence of an intention to rely on an alibi defense, later withdrawn, or of a statement made in connection with that intention, is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the person who gave notice of the intention.\u201d As one court has said in regard to D.C.Super. CtCrim. R. 12.1(f), which was modeled upon Fed.R.Crim.P. 12.1(f):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">Rule 12.1(f) apparently reflects the concern that the defendant not be harmed by this exception to the general concept that a defendant need not commit his or her defense to a particular course until the government has presented its entire case, so that the defense in no way aids the prosecution in its presentation. If the defendant could not freely withdraw an alibi defense, \u201cthe deprivation of flexibility, with the result that the defendant is forced to answer the government\u2019s case before it is presented, could be constitutionally suspect under traditional concepts of due process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>McKoy v.

Rule 4 \u2014 263(e)(4)) is silent as to the use of an alibi notice at trial. Moreover, we did not uncover any reported Maryland appellate decision that speaks to the precise issue presented here. Accordingly, we have looked for guidance from other jurisdictions that have addressed this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Many of our sister jurisdictions bar the prosecution\u2019s use of an alibi notice at trial when the defendant does not testify or present evidence. <em>See, e.g., People v.

A few cases have suggested that prosecutors may use a withdrawn alibi notice to impeach a defendant who takes any inconsistent position in his trial testimony.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The cases cited above are distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, because appellant never testified. As appellant puts it, the \u201cdebate\u201d concerning use of an alibi notice for impeachment \u201cis not implicated\u201d here, because appellant neither testified nor called any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">It is noteworthy that Maryland\u2019s alibi notice provision is included in the rules governing discovery. As we have seen, the defense is required, by rule, to provide notice of an alibi, before trial. Failure to do so may result in the waiver of the right to call an alibi witness. <em>Cf. Muhammad v. State, </em>177 Md.App. 188, 288, 934 A.2d 1059 (2007) (concluding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in preventing defendant\u2019s witness from testifying because of the defendant\u2019s belated disclosure of the witness), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 Md. 614, 943 A.2d 1245 (2008). Barring the right to call a witness is one thing; allowing the State to use an alibi notice against the defendant is another matter. We agree with appellant that \u201cintroducing an alibi notice against a non-testifying defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>who calls no witnesses impermissibly converts a discovery tool into a means of extracting admissions\u201d from a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">As one legal scholar observes, \u201cThe purpose of discovery is to permit preparation by the state, not to lock the defendant into a specific defense.\u201d Robert P. Mosteller, <em>Discovery Against the Defense: Tilting the Adversarial Balance, </em>74 Cal. L.Rev. 1567, 1650 (1986) (\u201cMosteller\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> To be sure, the pretrial alibi notice enables the State to investigate the information disclosed by the defense, while also deterring a fabricated, eleventh hour defense. <em>See Taliaferro, </em>295 Md. at 385-86, 456 A.2d 29. However, the purpose of Rule 4-263, which is a discovery rule, is not served by allowing the State to introduce an alibi notice at trial against a defendant who does not testify or present a defense case.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">If we were to adopt the State\u2019s view, the defense, in effect, would be forced to decide, before trial, whether to proceed with an alibi defense; if the defense initially elected to present an alibi defense, the State\u2019s position would mean that the defense would run the risk of adverse consequences if it later sought to change its trial strategy. In our view, this would jeopardize the hallowed principle that a defendant has no burden to prove his innocence. <em>See Brogden v. State, </em>384 Md. 631, 649, 866 A.2d 129 (2005) (\u201c[Pjetitioner did not put on any evidence at trial in his defense \u2014 he merely relied on a presumption of innocence, which he unquestionably is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>do.\u201d). Such a position would also infringe upon a defendant\u2019s constitutional and statutory rights to remain silent. <em>See </em>Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (\u201cThat no man ought to be compelled to give evidence against himself in a criminal case.\u201d); the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution (\u201cNo person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d); Md.Code (2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-107 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d) (\u201cA person may not be compelled to testify in violation of his privilege against self-incrimination. The failure of a defendant to testify in a criminal proceeding on this basis does not create any presumption against him.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Clearly, a defendant is entitled to make a last minute decision not to testify or put on a defense case. This would necessarily include the right to abandon an alibi defense, without the risk of the State\u2019s use of the alibi notice against the defendant. <em>Cf. Marshall v. State, </em>415 Md. 248, 261-62, 999 A.2d 1029 (2010) (concluding that State\u2019s rebuttal argument violated defendant\u2019s right not to testify at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">As we have seen, the trial court suggested that alibi notices are admissible pleadings, \u201cif there are admissions\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> contained within them. We disagree. <em>Shannon, supra, </em>88 Mich.App. 188, 276 N.W.2d 546, provides guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">In <em>Shannon, </em>the prosecution argued that the defendant\u2019s alibi notice was admissible because it was a pleading that \u201cmay be introduced into evidence as part of the \u2018public records\u2019 exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548. But, the court explained: \u201cAssuming, <em>arguendo, </em>the validity of this contention, it would only permit the lower court\u2019s action to survive an attack based upon hearsay and does not reach the issue of whether defendant is unfairly prejudiced by such practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court continued: \u201cThere are numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>motions, pleadings and briefs in a court file that may be public record, but would not be admissible at trial because of their prejudicial impact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In a footnote, the court added: \u201cFor example, motions to suppress illegally obtained evidence or to limit the permissible scope of impeachment, although part of the court record, are never admissible at trial because of their prejudicial nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">As we have seen, the State vigorously urges that the redacted alibi notice was admissible to show that Mr. Sims willfully concocted a false alibi. Yet, even if such a basis might support admission of an alibi notice in some circumstances, the State\u2019s theory of falsity was not clear from the evidence. We elaborate.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The prosecution relied on a phone call between appellant and his mother to support its claim that the alibi notice was false. There, appellant\u2019s mother reminded appellant that \u201cyour father went out of town ... and that\u2019s why you was over here with me.\u201d Both the State and the court were of the view that, if appellant\u2019s father was out of town, the alibi notice suggested that appellant falsely identified his father as an alibi witness. Yet, they overlook that evidence that Mr. Sims\u2019s father was out of town arguably <em>supported </em>appellant\u2019s alibi. Appellant contended that he was at his mother\u2019s house at the relevant time because his father was out of town, and thus he could not stay at his father\u2019s residence. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s identification of his father as an alibi witness was not inconsistent with his pretrial claim that he was not at the scene of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">We also reject the State\u2019s contention that it was entitled to use the alibi notice because Sims is the one who \u201cessentially\u201d put forth an alibi defense, notwithstanding his failure to present a defense case. In this regard, the State relies on Sims\u2019s pretrial, custodial statement to the police that he was at his mother\u2019s home at the time of the shooting; the recorded phone conversations involving appellant, made while he was incarcerated; and defense counsel\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Ordinarily \u201csomeone else must provide a defendant with an alibi.\u201d <em>Schmitt v.

But, in the context of a defendant\u2019s request for an alibi jury instruction, the defendant\u2019s uncorroborated testimony that he was elsewhere at the time of the crime is ordinarily sufficient to generate the issue of an alibi and justify an alibi jury instruction.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Smith, </em>302 Md. at 180-81, 486 A.2d 196; <em>Schmitt, </em>140 Md.App. at 27, 779 A.2d 1004; <em>Pulley v. State, </em>38 Md.App. 682, 688-91, 382 A.2d 621 (1978). Writing for this Court in <em>Robertson, </em>112 Md.App. at 382, 685 A.2d 805, Judge Harrell said: \u201c[T]he fact that an alibi defense is not an affirmative defense lends further support to the notion that the defendant, himself, need not introduce alibi evidence in order to generate the basis for an instruction on the issue.\u201d <em>Robertson </em>established that, even if a defendant does not testify or call an alibi witness, a defendant may rely on exculpatory testimony adduced from a prosecution witness, including a police officer to whom the defendant made a pretrial statement, to establish an alibi and then request an alibi jury instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 378-79, 685 A.2d 805. <em>See United States v. Hairston, </em>64 F.3d 491, 494-95 (9th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Webster, </em>769 F.2d 487, 490 (8th Cir.1985); <em>United States v.

Georgia, </em>194 Ga.App. 554, 390 S.E.2d 916, 918 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In this case, however, appellant did not pursue an alibi defense nor request an alibi jury instruction. In effect, the State\u2019s argument is tantamount to bootstrapping. It relies on evidence it introduced against appellant to establish its claim that appellant had an alibi defense, and it then argued that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>was entitled to refute that defense by use of appellant\u2019s pretrial alibi notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The State also suggests that its use of the alibi notice was proper because \u201cSims does not claim that he withdrew his alibi notice.\u201d We are not aware of any authority that requires a defendant who does not present a defense case to affirmatively withdraw an alibi notice in order to preclude the State from introducing it against him. Appellant posits that his defense attorney filed an alibi notice because it was \u201cconsistent\u201d with a \u201cprudent lawyer\u201d who \u201csimply wanted to make sure she had disclosed all potentially relevant witnesses.\u201d That is consistent with what appellant\u2019s counsel explained below; she told the judge that, when she entered the case, she felt \u201cduty bound\u201d to file the alibi notice. As appellant asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">That a defendant lists a particular witness on an alibi notice reflects only a judgment by counsel that the witness <em>may </em>have information relevant to <em>some aspect </em>of a <em>possible </em>alibi defense. Inviting a lay jury to draw any conclusions from such a document, at least where the defendant does not present an alibi defense, invites only misdirection and confusion. (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In support of its contention that \u201c[t]he trial court properly exercised its discretion in admitting the redacted alibi notice,\u201d the State points out that there is no statutory bar on admission of an alibi notice, and \u201cthe alibi-notice rule itself does not explicitly bar [its] admission.\u201d Moreover, according to the State, \u201cThe history of the alibi-notice rule reveals no intent to exclude such notices from evidence.\u201d In this regard, it relies on the minutes of a Rules Committee meeting in March 1975, which reflect a \u201cdiscussion of subsection 728 e3 <em>ALIBI WITNESSES </em>.... \u201d The State posits: \u201cA proposed Committee Note (that disclosures made under this rule were not intended to change the rules of evidence relating to admissibility) was considered, adopted, and then rejected.\u201d Because the Rules Committee \u201cdid not indicate explicitly that the alibi notice was not admissible,\u201d the State insists that \u201cit would be inappropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>ate to add such a provision in an appeal rather than a rulemaking proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">In reply, appellant asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">It is unclear what impact the proposed Note might have had, and it is impossible to know why the Committee did not adopt it. Those minutes certainly display no intent to make Maryland the only state in which an alibi notice is admissible against a defendant who does not testify or call a witness. Even if the Committee meant to leave open whether an alibi notice can be used for impeachment, that would not support admission where defendant presents no case \u2014 a circumstance in which <em>every other state </em>to have considered admission has rejected it. (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Based on our review of the minutes of the Rules Committee meeting in March 1975, we cannot say that the Rules Committee considered whether to permit the State to introduce an alibi notice as an admission of the defendant or to prove a false alibi in a case in which the defendant neither testified nor presented a defense case. It is not our province to expand the scope of the rule to include such a provision by implication, and we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\"><em>State v. Wiegmann, </em>350 Md. 585, 714 A.2d 841 (1998), provides guidance. There, the Court concluded that the rule in issue in that case did not implicitly confer certain powers upon a domestic master, and said, id. at 593, 714 A.2d 841: \u201c\u2018[T]he construction of the rule urged by the State would engraft upon the rule a meaning not evident from the plain text____\u2019 \u201d Because the rule in issue did not provide express authority to the master to detain a litigant for contempt, pending judicial review of the master\u2019s recommendations, the Court declined to expand the rule to authorize such power by implication. <em>Id. </em>The same rationale applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">In sum, in concluding that the court below erred, we are persuaded by the reasoning of the <em>Shannon </em>Court. Because we cannot improve upon it, we shall quote it, 276 N.W.2d at 548-49:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Informing the jury of defendant\u2019s failure to produce an alibi witness where he had previously given notice unduly denigrates defendant\u2019s case when he later chooses to present no evidence. At issue is the jury\u2019s ability to draw an impermissible inference of guilt from defendant\u2019s decision not to call an alibi witness and its relation to his involvement in the charged crime. A jury is left with the impression that by defendant\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to follow through with his alibi, guilt is rendered more presumable and apparent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">It is axiomatic that defendant\u2019s failure to testify may not be commented upon by court or prosecutor. Defendant is under no duty is take the stand or proffer evidence, but rather may remain silent protected by the presumption of innocence. This continuing presumption of innocence serves as the basis for the requirement that the state has a never-shifting burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The lower court\u2019s instruction to the jury in effect restricted this presumption by allowing the jury to make adverse inferences from the alibi witness\u2019s failure to testify. If no adverse inference can be drawn from defendant\u2019s election, we see no reason to permit it in cases where he further elects not to better defend himself, here, through an alibi witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">Further, there is no useful purpose served by informing the jury of defendant\u2019s original intention to produce an alibi and his subsequent decision not to call a supporting witness. The notice of alibi requirement was provided for the benefit and protection of the public. Its purpose is to enable the prosecution to investigate the merits of such a defense prior to trial, ... and not to alert the jury of the defendant\u2019s proposed defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">... Where a defendant testifies to an alibi and calls no additional witnesses to support it, the prosecution, by commenting on the nonproduction of corroborating alibi wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>nesses, is merely pointing out the weakness in defendant\u2019s case. When, however, the defendant produces no testimony to support an alibi, the prosecutor, by commenting on the nonproduction of alibi witnesses, is not exposing a weakness in defendant\u2019s case, but is rather improperly shifting the burden of proof to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">(Citations and footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The State claims that \u201cany error in admitting the redacted alibi notice was harmless in light of other evidence admitted that showed that Sims tried to obtain false alibi testimony from his father and other evidence at trial.\u201d Moreover, it points out that it \u201cdid not mention the alibi notice in the opening statement\u201d or in closing argument. Referring to the recorded telephone conversations, it contends that, \u201ceven without the alibi notice, the jury had evidence that [appellant] concocted a false alibi.... \u201d According to the State, \u201c[t]hose tapes were much more powerful evidence than a sheet of paper listing a name and an address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Furthermore, the State argues that \u201cthe other evidence at trial was strong.\u201d It cites the testimony of Brent and Montc-real Huggins, who testified that they saw Sims pull out a gun and heard gun shots; Sims\u2019s call to Montcreal after the shooting; the pretrial photo arrays, in which Brent and Montcreal Huggins identified Sims as the shooter; Montcreal\u2019s admission that she lied in her initial statement to police, when she claimed that she did not know who shot the victim; and \u201cthe taped phone calls ... reflecting a consciousness of guilt and an attempt to arrange false alibi testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Appellant contends: \u201cGiven the power of the alibi notice to mislead the jury, its introduction was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Characterizing the State\u2019s evidence against him as \u201cvery thin\u201d and \u201cweak,\u201d he argues that \u201c[t]he case turned on eyewitness testimony regarding whether Mr. Sims was the man on the bike who shot Mr. Cornish,\u201d and the State\u2019s case was \u201crefuted by \u2018the most credible\u2019 eyewitness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>resting instead on witnesses even the prosecution questioned and strained inferences from a single phone call.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Further, appellant contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">The redacted notice of alibi, which (as admitted evidence) went to the jury room, took the form of a pleading, with the name of the trial court on the top, the caption listing the case title just below that, and the signature of Mr. Sims\u2019s counsel at the bottom. It was offered <em>only </em>to show that Mr. Sims had supposedly concocted a false alibi. The jury was completely unaware of the discovery purposes served by alibi notices, or the practices of prudent defense counsel, and was instead left with only the view that listing the senior Mr. Sims but not calling him exposed an attempted fraud on the court. Furthermore, introducing the alibi notice inevitably invited the jury to speculate as to why Mr. Sims did not call his father or put on a defense, thus \u201cunduly denigrat[ing] [Mr. Sims\u2019s] case when he later [chose] to present no evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Shannon, </em>276 N.W.2d at 548.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In <em>Bellamy v.

State, </em>118 Md.App. 288, 298, 702 A.2d 781 (1997), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>352 Md. 707, 724 A.2d 65 (1999), cert. <em>denied, </em>528 U.S. 832, 120 S.Ct. 89, 145 L.Ed.2d 75 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">We conclude that the error of the court in allowing the State to introduce the redacted alibi notice was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In the first instance, the strength of the State\u2019s case was not so overwhelming as to render the error inconsequential.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thompson was standing within two feet of the shooter. Yet, he claimed at trial that appellant did not look like the shooter. The State also relied on the testimony of Montcreal and Brent Huggins. Although the jury was entitled to credit the portions of the witnesses\u2019 testimony favorable to the State, they also made statements that were favorable to appellant. In assessing their credibility, the jury could have been influenced by the admission of the alibi notice, which looked like an official court pleading, signed by appellant\u2019s own attorney. Although appellant had no burden to produce evidence, the jury could have drawn an impermissible inference of guilt based on appellant\u2019s failure to pursue a defense his own attorney had initially disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\"><em>State v. O\u2019Neal, </em>143 N.M. 437, 176 P.3d 1169 (App.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>143 N.M. 665, 180 P.3d 672 (2008), a harmless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>error/alibi case, stands in marked contrast to the case <em>sub judice. </em>In that case, the defendant was charged with multiple counts of \u201cunlawful killing of deer\u201d and related charges. <em>Id. </em>at 1170. Prior to trial, he submitted an alibi notice that \u201cindicated that Defendant was with John Brazeal and another person at Mr. Hernandez\u2019s house while the alleged crimes were being committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1171. In voir dire, O\u2019Neal\u2019s counsel indicated that he \u201cexpected to call Mr. Brazeal as a witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Then, during opening statement, the prosecutor said, without objection, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">\u201cLadies and gentleman, the State has been put on notice that the defense in this case will be an alibi \u2014 I wasn\u2019t there. It wasn\u2019t me. I was not with them when these crimes were committed. And a John Brazeal and a Casey Nunley have been listed as potential witnesses to establish that it was not Patrick O\u2019Neal who was involved in these cases. We\u2019ll see if they show up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In the defense\u2019s opening statement, defense counsel did not refer to the alibi witnesses. But, \u201che asserted generally\u201d that the defendant \u201cwas not present when the crimes took place.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">During the state\u2019s case-in-chief, the following exchange took place between the prosecutor and a witness who purportedly \u201cknew Mr. Brazeal,\u201d <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Mr. Fraser, in a document filed with this Court, [Defendant] has stated that he was present at Mr. Hernandez\u2019s ... house when you and Mr. Faulkner arrived with the deer in [Defendant\u2019s] pickup. Is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">[WITNESS]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: [The notice of alibi] also states that [defendant] was not with you when you and Mr. Faulkner unlawfully shot and killed these deer. Instead, he was at</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A81\">[Mr. Hernandez\u2019s] house watching movies with John Bra-zeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>[WITNESS]: That\u2019s also not true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">(Some alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Defense counsel moved for a mistrial. <em>Id. </em>The prosecutor argued that \u201chis reference to the notice of alibi did not prejudice Defendant because, even though Mr. Brazeal was not present to testify, the defense theory of the case continued to be that Defendant was not present during the commission of the crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>O\u2019Neal\u2019s counsel countered that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s references to Mr. Brazeal essentially forced Defendant either to be silent or to call a witness that the defense might not wish to call, which amounted to prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court denied O\u2019Neal\u2019s motion for a mistrial, <em>id., </em>and the prosecutor subsequently asked Mr. Hernandez a number of questions about Brazeal. <em>Id. </em>at 1172.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Thereafter, O\u2019Neal elected to testify, and \u201cthe prosecutor elicited ... that he was with Mr. Brazeal at Mr. Hernandez\u2019s house on the day of the incident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defense counsel again moved, unsuccessfully, for a mistrial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">On appeal, the court explained that, under Rule 5-802(E) of the New Mexico Rules Annotated, \u201c[t]he fact that a notice of alibi was given or anything contained in such notice shall not be admissible as evidence in the trial of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1173. The court concluded: \u201cGiven the clear language of Rule 5-508(E) ... the district court erred in allowing the State to introduce evidence regarding Defendant\u2019s notice of alibi.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the court found that the error was harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">The court rejected O\u2019Neal\u2019s argument that the violation of Rule 5-508(E) forced him to testify, noting that O\u2019Neal \u201cnever abandoned his alibi defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1174. It reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 1174-75:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">From the beginning of the case, the theory of the defense was that Defendant was not with the man who admitted to killing and gutting the deer. Defense counsel stated his intention to call Mr. Brazeal, both in the notice of alibi and during voir dire, and never indicated that the defense would not be relying on an alibi theory. To the contrary, defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>counsel stated during his opening statement that Defendant was not present when the crimes took place and did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement that referenced the alibi defense and Mr. Brazeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAbf\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s argument does not square with the fact that the defense\u2019s theory of the case never switched from alibi to some other defense. In light of the fact that the defense did not provide any witnesses to corroborate the alibi theory, it seems that Defendant would have had to testify in order to get any affirmative evidence of his alibi in front of the jury. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">* * * In the present case, Defendant manifested a commitment to his alibi defense well before and well after the State improperly introduced the evidence regarding the notice of alibi.[ ] Given these circumstances, we conclude that there is not a reasonable possibility that the evidence regarding the notice of alibi contributed to Defendant\u2019s convictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Here, unlike in <em>O\u2019Neal, </em>appellant never testified. Nor did appellant identify in voir dire any witnesses relevant to an alibi defense. Rather, in the defense requests for voir dire, appellant\u2019s attorney sought a question regarding \u201cthe jury\u2019s belief in self-defense.\u201d The court denied the request, stating \u201cthat\u2019s an element of the case.... \u201d Moreover, while we have not been provided with the defense\u2019s opening statement, the State does not claim that appellant\u2019s trial attorney mentioned an alibi in opening statement. In closing, defense counsel pointed to appellant\u2019s statement to Detective Diaz, in which appellant said: \u201c T wasn\u2019t there.\u2019 \u201d However, defense counsel had a right to comment on the evidence introduced by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Although the court did not propound an alibi instruction as it appears in Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 5:00, it told the jury not to consider any references to potential alibi witnesses, \u201cexcept as the testimony concerned the defendant\u2019s father and mother.\u201d As we see it, the court\u2019s attempt at a prophylactic instruction also served to highlight appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>lant\u2019s failure to pursue his alibi defense by calling his parents to explain his whereabouts. It is beyond cavil that appellant had no burden to call any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">In our view, the error in admitting the redacted alibi notice was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR A NEW TRIAL; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-14\">. Appellant was acquitted of first-degree murder and second-degree murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\">.

Tasha Greenberg, M.D., Assistant Medical Examiner, testified that the victim sustained two gunshot wounds. One was to the left buttock and the other was to the back. The bullet to the back went through several organs, including the liver, the diaphragm, and the inferior vena cava. She opined that the manner of death was homicide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\">.

Baltimore City Police Detective Vernon Parker testified that he accompanied Detective Diaz to Ms. Huggins\u2019s home on July 9, 2007. He denied making any threats to Ms. Huggins. Detective Diaz also denied making any threats to Ms. Huggins.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b319-10\">. <em>See Miranda v.

The court transcription refers to this person as \"Tina.\u201d But, the transcript prepared by the police identified the person as \u201cTim.\u201d In addition, Detective Anthony Kreafle testified that at 1:08 a.m. on June 30, 2007, Timothy Spearman was shot \"in the, the right thumb....\u201d The incident took place a few blocks from Lloyd and Granby streets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b320-9\">. Sergeant Monique Mitchell, the custodian of records for the Baltimore City Detention Center, testified that when an inmate makes an outgoing call, both the inmate and the call recipient hear a recording that says that \" \u2018this call is from a correctional institution and is subject to monitoring and recording.\u2019 \u201d The jury was provided with transcripts of the conversations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b322-14\">. We were unable to find any reference to Myrtle Beach in the transcripts of the recorded phone calls, or any call between appellant and his father. However, Detective Diaz indicated that there were multiple telephone calls; only three were played for the juiy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b327-14\">. The State called five additional witnesses, none of whose testimony is material to the issues before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b327-15\">. Appellant's counsel unsuccessfully moved for a mistrial, apparently based on the alibi issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b327-16\">. The court also determined to excise references to other witnesses in the tapes of the recorded telephone conversations, in the event that the jury requested the tapes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b328-12\">. Neither the State nor the defense discussed the issue of alibi in closing. Moreover, the court did not propound a jury instruction as to an alibi witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b329-10\">. The State recognizes that its claim of an \" 'elsewhere' defense\u201d was based on its use of appellant's pretrial statement to the police, the recorded phone conversations, as well as the closing argument of defense counsel, who \"argued that Sims was elsewhere.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b331-11\">.

Wisconsin subsequently adopted a rule governing the use of an alibi notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\">. Both appellant and the State rely extensively on Mosteller. According to the State, Mosteller argues that \" \u2018neither the fifth amendment nor the theory upon which prosecutorial discovery is based justifies impeachment except when the state is prejudiced in its ability to investigate an altered defense, or when either the discovery disclosure or the trial testimony is willfully false.' \u201d <em>Mosteller, </em>at 1649-50. (Emphasis in State\u2019s brief). The State relies on this point to assert that it was proper for the trial court to admit the redacted alibi notice \"because the evidence showed that, as to the listing of Sims\u2019s father, the notice was willfully false.\u201d But, Mosteller begins his discussion by indicating that \"a number of states permit discovery disclosures to be used to impeach the defendant when <em>his trial testimony </em>is inconsistent with his pretrial notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1649-50 (Emphasis added). Here, as we discussed, Sims did not testify. Therefore, the State's reliance on Mosteller is misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\">. The State quotes from 1 Edward J. Imwinkelried et al., <em>Courtroom Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 1718, at 759 (2005), stating that some \u201cjurisdictions treat any information <em>received [in </em>an alibi notice] as a fully admissible admission.\u2019\u2019 But, Imwinkelried does not provide any support for his assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b339-6\">.
