The court imposed a sentence of 30 years for the conviction of second degree murder and ten years consecutive for the conviction of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Appellant presents two issues for our review, which we have reworded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">1. Did the trial court err in allowing the State to elicit evidence of appellant\u2019s post-arrest, post-Miranda[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] silence and his request to speak to an attorney in order to rebut the impression created by the defense that appellant actively cooperated with the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">2. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in responding to appellant\u2019s claim that several State witnesses violated the court\u2019s sequestration order?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">On the evening of June 16, 2007, appellant shot Jeremy Elijah Yarbray. Mr. Yarbray collapsed and died in the parking area outside the residence at 159 Mahogany Drive in Cecil County, Maryland. When the police discovered Mr. Yarbray\u2019s body, a bag of cocaine was found in his hand. There was no dispute that appellant shot the victim, but the testimony differed regarding the events leading up to the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The residence at 159 Mahogany Drive was rented by Kate Archibald. She lived there with her daughter, her friend, Mary Jenna Webb, Ms. Webb\u2019s boyfriend, Jesse Kennedy, and Ms. Webb\u2019s two sons.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Mr. Kennedy testified that, on the evening of June 16, 2007, Derek Patton, appellant, and Matthew Jackson came to the residence. Appellant, who Mr. Kennedy had met a week or two earlier, wanted to buy cocaine. Mr. Kennedy made a call in an attempt to purchase drugs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A short time later, Mr. Yarbray arrived at the residence and spoke with appellant about a bag of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Mr. Kennedy testified that appellant and Mr. Yarbray began to argue, and a \u201cscuffle\u201d ensued. Appellant produced a handgun from his waistband, and he hit Mr. Yarbray two or three times in the face with the gun. Mr. Kennedy told appellant to let Mr. Yarbray go, and Mr. Yarbray eventually crawled out the front door and stumbled down the steps. Appellant opened the door and fired four or five shots at Mr. Yarbray. After the shooting, Mr. Kennedy went to the front door and saw \u201cblood all over [the] porch\u201d and sidewalk, and Mr. Yarbray was in the road \u201clying face down not moving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Derek Patton testified that, on the day of the shooting, he drove appellant and Mr. Jackson to Ms. Webb\u2019s residence. Mr. Kennedy made a phone call, and approximately 15 minutes later, the victim arrived at the residence. Appellant, who had been in the bathroom, exited the bathroom and stated to Mr. Yarbray: \u201c[D]o you remember me[?]\u201d Appellant then punched Mr. Yarbray in the face, and a fight ensued. Mr. Patton \u201cbroke up the fight\u201d because both the victim and appellant \u201cwere going for\u201d a gun on the floor. The victim then moved toward the door to leave the residence. Mr. Patton heard a shot and saw the victim fall, but he did not see who shot the victim. After the shooting, Mr. Patton ran from the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Matthew Jackson testified that, on the evening of the shooting, he went with appellant and Mr. Patton to Mr. Kennedy\u2019s residence to purchase some cocaine. At the residence, Mr. Kennedy \u201ccalled somebody.\u201d When Mr. Yarbray arrived a few minutes later, appellant was in the bathroom. He came out of the bathroom \u201cwith a gun in his hand,\u201d and he pointed it at Mr. Yarbray. Appellant stated: \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d Mr. Yarbray \u201cpushed his hands up in the air,\u201d and Mr. Jackson then ran out the back door. He \u201cheard a couple of shots,\u201d but he kept running.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Several witnesses outside the residence testified to their observations. Gene Salisbury, a neighbor, testified that he saw \u201ca guy fly out from about five doors up from me,\u201d and he \u201cheard two rounds of a heavy-caliber gun go off.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Another neighbor, age 14, testified that he saw appellant come out of the house \u201cshooting the guy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Robert Lloyd testified that he was driving to Charlestown with Mr. Yarbray, and Mr. Yarbray asked him to \u201cstop by\u201d the Mahogany Drive residence. Mr. Lloyd remained in the car. He observed Mr. Yarbray exit the house and fall down. He then saw a man exit the house and shoot Mr. Yarbray, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>he did not see his face. Mr. Lloyd drove away, and he did not report the shooting. He subsequently advised the police, however, that based on a photograph that appeared in a newspaper, he thought that appellant was the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">John Hardiman testified that, on June 18, 2007, two days after the shooting, while taking his dog for a walk, he discovered a handgun under his truck. He called 911 and advised the police. Mr. Hardiman identified the gun in the State\u2019s custody as the same gun he discovered under his truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Troy McDonough, a Corporal assigned to the Homicide Unit with the Maryland State Police, responded to Mr. Hardiman\u2019s residence and took custody of the gun. He observed \u201cdried blood on the trigger guard----\u201d Forensic analysis showed that appellant\u2019s DNA matched the DNA profile obtained from the hand grip and trigger guard of the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Joshua Jackson, a commercial driver, testified that, the day after the shooting, he encountered appellant at a gas station in New Jersey along his route. Appellant stated that he was waiting for his wife, and he asked to use Mr. Jackson\u2019s cell phone. Appellant advised that \u201che was getting away from a situation that he had hurt somebody.\u201d When Ms. Hamilton arrived, Mr. Jackson gave them a ride to a truck stop in Maryland, where they waited in Mr. Jackson\u2019s truck for their ride to pick them up. Mr. Jackson fell asleep; he woke up when several police officers ordered Mr. Jackson, appellant, and Ms. Hamilton out of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Mary Ripple, a medical doctor with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, testified as an expert in forensic pathology. Based on the autopsy that she performed, she determined that Mr. Yarbray\u2019s death was a homicide, and he died from \u201cmultiple gunshot wounds, and blunt force injury____\u201d Mr. Yarbray suffered one or two gunshot wounds to his upper body and two to his left thigh.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Dr. Ripple concluded that, based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>absence of \u201cstippling\u201d around the gunshot wounds, the gun was not fired from \u201cclose-range.\u201d Dr. Ripple located a bullet during the autopsy, which was provided to law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Mike Nickol, an employee with the Forensic Science Division of the Maryland State Police, testified as an expert in firearms and tool marks examination. He concluded that the bullet recovered from the victim\u2019s right arm was fired from the handgun the police recovered. He further concluded that the shell casing recovered from behind the residence was fired from the same gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">After the State rested, appellant moved for judgment of acquittal on the charge of first-degree murder, arguing that there was no evidence that the shooting was premeditated or committed with the specific intent to kill. The court denied appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Appellant then presented his case. Pamela Hamilton testified that she was romantically involved with appellant. The morning after the shooting, appellant called Ms. Hamilton and asked her to pick him up in New Jersey, stating that he wanted to turn himself in to the police. On her way to New Jersey, Ms. Hamilton experienced car problems, but she eventually arrived at the truck stop where appellant was waiting. Appellant advised her that he \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d and \u201cit did not happen the way people think that it happened.\u201d They rode with a truck driver back to Maryland. While waiting for a ride at a truck stop in North East, the police arrived; they arrested appellant and took Ms. Hamilton into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Appellant testified that, on the night of the shooting, he came out of the bathroom at Mr. Kennedy\u2019s residence and saw Mr. Patton fighting with Mr. Yarbray. He saw a handgun in the middle of the floor, and he tried to pick it up so the other men would not use it in the fight. Appellant and Mr. Yarbray grabbed the gun at the same time, and the gun accidently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>discharged three times. Appellant testified that he did not intend to pull the trigger. After Mr. Yarbray let go of the gun, appellant fired one bullet at the ground. Mr. Yarbray fell on the ground outside the house, and appellant walked out and \u201clooked because [he] was just in shock.\u201d Appellant then ran from the house and threw the gun in the woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">After he fled from the crime scene, a co-worker drove appellant to a truck stop in New Jersey. The co-worker gave appellant some work clothes because there was blood on his clothing. Appellant remained at the truck stop through the night, and the next morning, he called Ms. Hamilton. Appellant asked Ms. Hamilton to bring him back to Maryland \u201c[b]ecause [he] had time to think about what was going on and [he] needed to come to Maryland.\u201d Appellant testified that he intended to turn himself in and \u201cget the situation straightened out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Ms. Hamilton arrived at the truck stop in New Jersey in the afternoon. Appellant told her that \u201cit didn\u2019t happen like I\u2019m sure everybody is saying it happened.\u201d He testified that they were going to drive back to Maryland, where he intended to go to Ms. Hamilton\u2019s mother\u2019s house \u201c[b]ecause [he] had been up for almost two days and [he] wasn\u2019t prepared mentally or physically to deal with going to turn myself in instantly.\u201d Appellant\u2019s plan was to \u201c[t]ry to get some sleep and prepare to go talk to the police.\u201d Appellant and Ms. Hamilton rode with a truck driver back to Maryland, and while waiting for a ride at a truck stop in Maryland, the police arrived and arrested appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, counsel for appellant moved for judgment of acquittal, arguing that there was insufficient evidence of premeditation to support the charge of first-degree murder. The court denied appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">On April 7, 2008, the jury began deliberations. Later that day, the jury returned a verdict, finding appellant not guilty of first degree murder, but finding him guilty of second degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>murder, first degree assault, and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Appellant contends that \u201cthe trial court erred in allowing the State to introduce evidence that, when questioned after being arrested, Mr. Lupfer remained silent and asked to speak with an attorney.\u201d He asserts that this was error for two reasons. First, he argues that, although his testimony that he intended to speak with the police may have permitted the admission of this evidence \u201cas a matter of constitutional law,\u201d the Maryland appellate courts \u201chave uniformly held,\u201d pursuant to \u201cMaryland state-law principles,\u201d that a defendant\u2019s silence \u201cafter arrest, may never be introduced against the accused.\u201d Second, appellant asserts that, even if his testimony that he intended to give the police a statement opened the door to admit evidence of his failure to give a statement, it \u201cwas limited solely to the fact that [he] did not give a statement to the police.\u201d He contends that \u201cthere is no justification for allowing the State to introduce the fact that [he] invoked the assistance of counsel when questioned.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The State contends that \u201cthe trial court properly exercised its discretion in allowing the State\u2019s use of Lupfer\u2019s post-<em>Miranda </em>silence,\u201d arguing that the evidence was \u201cin fair response\u201d to appellant\u2019s \u201ctestimony that he fully intended to cooperate with police, turn himself in, and explain his side of the story regarding his claim that the shooting was an accident.\u201d With respect to appellant\u2019s claim that the court erred in admitting evidence that he asked to speak to an attorney, the State argues that this contention is not preserved for appellate review. Even if preserved, however, the State argues that the evidence was properly admitted \u201cto fairly respond and rebut his claim that he had every intention of fully cooperating with the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Appellant testified that, immediately after the shooting, he fled to New Jersey. He first testified, however, that he returned to Maryland the next day to \u201cgo talk to the police.\u201d Before he was able to contact the police voluntarily, they arrested him at the truck stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">After appellant\u2019s direct examination, the prosecutor approached the bench and proffered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">Your Honor, among other things that this defendant has said in the course of his testimony is that he intended to speak to police. In fact, after he was arrested he was questioned and he elected not to say anything to police. Ordinarily I could not comment upon that, but it appears to me that when a defendant such as Mr. Lupfer gives testimony that he intended to speak to police, even as he was in New Jersey according to his testimony, deliberating about the issue of turning himself in, I believe that he has now opened the door to that cross-examination. Before I go there, I just wanted to bring that matter to the bench.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Defense counsel disagreed with the argument that appellant was subject to cross-examination regarding his post-arrest silence, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">I don\u2019t think that he is. And the reason is because Mr. Lupfer originally did not think that there was going to be a serious charge such as murder brought against him. And when the police arrested him and told him that, he said, Oh, shit, this is more serious than I thought.... I better talk to my attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">The court ruled that the prosecutor could \u201cbring that out,\u201d stating: \u201cI think the door has been opened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor questioned appellant about why he wanted to come back to Maryland and the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-13\">[APPELLANT]: I told [Ms. Hamilton] it didn\u2019t happen like I\u2019m sure everybody is saying it happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: That\u2019s all you told her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">[APPELLANT]: Why would I \u2014 I don\u2019t know why. I can\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know why.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Well, you say that when you were up there \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: \u2014 thinking about coming back to Cecil County, that you were coming back to Cecil County because you wanted to turn yourself in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: You wanted to talk to the police, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2q\">[APPELLANT]: I wanted to get the situation straightened out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: You wanted to try to clear yourself, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-14\">[APPELLANT]: I wanted to get the situation \u2014 I\u2019m not sure of my intentions, but running was not my intention. It was just going to get worse and I knew that there is only one person that is going to say what needs to be said, and that was me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">The prosecutor then questioned appellant regarding what occurred after he was arrested. As set forth in more detail, <em>infra, </em>appellant testified that, \u201c[b]efore they slid the charges charging me with first degree murder,\u201d the police \u201cdid not give me a chance to say anything. And when I seen the charges, I asked for a lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-16\">The State then called Sergeant David Sexton as a rebuttal witness. The prosecutor asked Sergeant Sexton about his efforts to question appellant following his arrest, and Sergeant Sexton testified: \u201cI read him his advice of rights and he elected not to answer any questions. He said he would have to talk to a lawyer because those charges were very serious and he wanted to speak to a lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Generally, we \u201creview a trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence under the abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Longtin, </em>190 Md.App. 97, 133, 988 A.2d 20, <em>cert. granted, </em>414 Md. 330, 995 A.2d 296 (2010). When the admission of evidence involves a possible violation of a constitutional right, however, \u201cthis Court conducts its own independent constitutional analysis.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>415 Md. 22, 29, 997 A.2d 780 (2010). <em>Accord Arthur v. State, </em>193 Md.App. 446, 460-61, 997 A.2d 899 (2010) (\u201c[W]e determine <em>de novo </em>whether there was a constitutional violation \u2018by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>State v. Collins, </em>367 Md. 700, 707, 790 A.2d 660 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Post-Arrest, Post-Miranda Silence</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees a person accused of a crime the right to remain silent. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. V (\u201cNo person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself....\u201d). The Fifth Amendment is applicable to the States pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The admissibility in a criminal trial of a defendant\u2019s silence has been the subject of numerous cases. The analysis is different depending on the time when the silence occurred, and the State\u2019s purpose in eliciting the evidence. <em>See Grier v. State, </em>351 Md. 241, 252-60, 718 A.2d 211 (1998) (discussing analysis for admission of evidence regarding pre-arrest silence; post-arrest, <em>pre-Miranda </em>silence; and post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>silence). This case involves the admissibility of appellant\u2019s post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>As appellant notes, the Court of Appeals in <em>Grier, </em>351 Md. at 258, 718 A.2d 211, stated that post-arrest, post <em>-Miranda </em>silenee \u201cis inadmissible for any purpose.\u201d In making that statement, however, the Court cited to United States Supreme Court cases that held that post-arrest silence was inadmissible as substantive evidence of guilt or to impeach an affirmative defense at trial. <em>See Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 468 n. 37, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (\u201c[I]t is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege when he is under police custodial interrogation. The prosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation.\u201d); <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 619, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976) (silence after receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is inadmissible to impeach an affirmative defense raised at trial). <em>See also Griffin, </em>380 U.S. at 615, 85 S.Ct. 1229 (where defendant does not testify at trial, the Fifth Amendment precludes the government from using a defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence as substantive evidence of consciousness of guilt).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">As explained below, the Court of Appeals did not hold that <em>post-Miranda </em>silence was inadmissible in the situation where it is offered for a purpose other than as substantive evidence of guilt or to impeach an affirmative defense. Rather, the Court in <em>Grier </em>left that question open. We will address that issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">We begin our analysis with <em>Doyle, </em>wherein the Supreme Court addressed whether it was permissible for the State to impeach a defendant\u2019s affirmative defense at trial with his post <em>-Miranda </em>silence. In that case, the prosecutor cross-examined two defendants, who had remained silent after being advised of their <em>Miranda </em>rights, regarding why they had not told the police, as they testified at trial, that someone framed them. <em>Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 611, 613, 96 S.Ct. 2240. In holding this was error, the Court characterized silence after <em>Miranda </em>warnings as \u201cinsolubly ambiguous because of what the State is required to advise the person arrested.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617, 96 S.Ct. 2240. It explained that, \u201cwhile it is true that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings,\u201d and \u201cit would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 96 S.Ct. 2240.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The Supreme Court recognized, however, that the State is not prohibited from commenting on a defendant\u2019s post-Mz-<em>randa </em>silence in all cases. There are circumstances where a claim raised by the defense may justify reference to the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In <em>Doyle, </em>the Court recognized an exception to the general rule of inadmissibility of post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>silence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">It goes almost without saying that the fact of post-arrest silence could be used by the prosecution to contradict a defendant who testifies to an exculpatory version of events and claims to have told the police the same version upon arrest. In that situation the fact of earlier silence would not be used to impeach the exculpatory story, but rather to challenge the defendant\u2019s testimony as to his behavior following arrest. <em>Cf. United States v. Fairchild, </em>505 F.2d 1378, 1383 (C.A.5 1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 620 n. 11, 96 S.Ct. 2240. This exception has been explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">[I]f a defendant provided alibi testimony during trial, and further testified on direct examination that he <em>told </em>the police the same alibi during custodial interrogation, when, in fact, the defendant had exercised his right to remain silent during custodial interrogation, then such evidence of post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>silence is likely admissible for the State\u2019s limited purpose to respond to the defendant\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Andrew Y. Jezic, Frank Molony, William E. Nolan &amp; Hon. Patrick L. Woodward, Maryland Law on Confessions \u00a7 19.5, at 759 (2009-2010 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">The Supreme Court subsequently addressed another situation where reference to a defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence was permissible as \u201ca fair response to a claim made by defendant or his counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>485 U.S. 25, 32, 108 S.Ct. 864, 99 L.Ed.2d 23 (1988). In <em>Robinson, </em>defense counsel stated in closing argument that \u201cthe Government had unfairly denied respondent the opportunity to explain his actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27, 108 S.Ct. 864. The prosecutor advised the jury during his closing argument that Robinson, who did not testify at trial, \u201c \u2018could have taken the stand and explained it to you....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, 108 S.Ct. 864. The Supreme Court held that the prosecutor\u2019s comment did not violate Robinson\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 31-32, 108 S.Ct. 864. The Court noted that \u201cthe prosecutorial comment did not treat the defendant\u2019s silence as substantive evidence of guilt, but instead referred to the possibility of testifying as one of several opportunities which the defendant was afforded, contrary to the statement of his counsel, to explain his side of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32, 108 S.Ct. 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The Court explained why the prosecutor\u2019s comments did not violate Robinson\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201c[The] central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.... \u201d To this end it is important that both the defendant and the prosecutor have the opportunity to meet fairly the evidence and arguments of one another. The broad dicta in <em>Griffin </em>to the effect that the Fifth Amendment \u201cforbids ... comment by the prosecution on the accused\u2019s silence,\u201d must be taken in the light of the facts of that case. It is one thing to hold, as we did in <em>[Griffin], </em>that the prosecutor may not treat a defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to remain silent at trial as substantive evidence of guilt; it is quite another to urge, as defendant does here, that the same reasoning would forbid the prosecutor from fairly responding to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>argument of the defendant by adverting to that silence. There may be some \u201ccost\u201d to the defendant in having remained silent in each situation, but we decline to expand <em>Griffin </em>to preclude a fair response by the prosecutor in situations such as the present one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 33-34, 108 S.Ct. 864 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In <em>People v. Austin, </em>23 Cal.App.4th 1596, 28 Cal.Rptr.2d 885 (1994), <em>overruled on other grounds by People v. Palmer, </em>24 Cal.4th 856, 103 Cal.Rptr.2d 13, 15 P.3d 234 (2001), the Court of Appeal of California considered the \u201cfair response\u201d doctrine. In that case, defense counsel\u2019s questions to the officer who arrested Austin attempted to create an inference that Austin had not been permitted the opportunity to explain a damaging admission. <em>Id. </em>at 1610, 28 Cal.Rptr.2d 885. On redirect examination, the prosecutor asked the officer if, after advising Austin of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, he gave Austin the opportunity to make a full statement. <em>Id. </em>at 1610-11, 28 Cal.Rptr.2d 885. The officer replied that he had given Austin that opportunity, but Austin declined to make a statement. <em>Id. </em>at 1611, 28 Cal.Rptr.2d 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The California court noted that the Supreme Court cases <em>Griffin </em>and <em>Doyle </em>stood \u201cfor the principle it is fundamentally unfair for the state to afford defendants the right to remain silent and then use that silence against them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1611-12, 28 Cal.Rptr.2d 885. The court noted, however, that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s right to remain silent is a shield. It cannot be used as a sword to cut off the prosecution\u2019s \u2018fair response\u2019 to the evidence or argument of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1612, 28 Cal.Rptr.2d 885 (citing <em>Robinson, </em>485 U.S. at 32, 108 S.Ct. 864).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Finding no error with the prosecutor\u2019s questions regarding Austin\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">Austin sought to create the impression in the jurors\u2019 minds [that] the police had treated him unfairly by not giving him the opportunity to explain his damaging statement to Deputy Hartman and to use the fact he had invoked his right to remain silent to prevent the prosecutor from countering this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>impression. The Fifth Amendment protects defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. It does not protect his effort to exploit his silence by requiring the government also remain silent. Here, the prosecutor\u2019s purpose on redirect examination of Deputy Hartman was to correct the impression created on cross-examination Austin had not been afforded an opportunity to explain the apparently damaging statement he made to Hartman. There was no attempt to suggest defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent was substantive evidence of guilt nor to impeach a defense by bringing out Austin\u2019s postarrest silence. The rationale of <em>Griffin </em>and <em>Doyle </em>is inapplicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1612-13, 28 Cal.Rptr.2d 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Another scenario in which courts have held that a prosecutor properly may question a criminal defendant about post-<em>Miranda </em>silence, a situation relevant to what occurred in this case, is where the defendant\u2019s silence is introduced for the limited purpose of rebutting an impression created by the defendant that he cooperated fully with the police. For example, in <em>Fairchild, </em>505 F.2d at 1381, a case cited with approval by the Supreme Court in <em>Doyle, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit noted that <em>post-Miranda </em>silence is \u201cexcluded for the purpose of protecting certain rights of the defendant. It is not excluded so that the defendant may freely and falsely create the impression that he has cooperated with the police when, in fact, he has not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1383.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">In <em>Fairchild, </em>defense counsel established that Fairchild had voluntarily provided handwriting samples, and he attempted to create the impression that Fairchild had cooperated with the police when he asked: \u201c \u2018During the period of time that this investigation has been going on, to your knowledge has Mr. Fairchild cooperated fully with the FBI and U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in responding with anything that you all wanted?\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The court stated: \u201cAssuming the law would have excluded from evidence Fairchild\u2019s silence had he not broached the subject of cooperation, once he did broach it the bar was lowered and he discarded the shield which the law had created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>to protect him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Noting that a criminal defendant may waive his constitutional rights by his conduct, the court held that evidence of his <em>post-Miranda </em>silence \u201cwas admissible for the purpose of rebutting the impression which he attempted to create: that he cooperated fully with the law enforcement authorities.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Other courts similarly have held that evidence of a defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence is admissible to rebut an impression created by the defense that he or she cooperated with the police. For example, in <em>United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>461 F.3d 1338, 1349 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 1232, 127 S.Ct. 1308, 167 L.Ed.2d 120 (2007), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that \u201cevidence of, and argument referring to, O\u2019Keefe\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence was admissible for the purpose of rebutting the impression which he attempted to create: that he cooperated fully with the law enforcement authorities.\u201d The court stated: \u201c When a defendant attempts to convince a jury that he was of a cooperative spirit, <em>Doyle </em>does not tie the hands of prosecutors who attempt to rebut this presentation by pointing to a lack of cooperation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1348 (quoting <em>United States v. Reveles, </em>190 F.3d 678, 685 (5th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has also recognized this exception to the general rule that <em>post-Miranda </em>silence is inadmissible. In <em>United States v. Shue, </em>766 F.2d 1122, 1129 (7th Cir.1985), the court stated that, where a defendant creates an impression of general cooperation with the police after arrest, a court may allow the prosecutor to elicit evidence of the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence to rebut the impression of full cooperation. The court stated: \u201cA defendant should not be permitted to twist his <em>Miranda </em>protection to shield lies or false impressions from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>government attack.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> Accord Earnest v. Dorsey, </em>87 F.3d 1123, 1135 (10th Cir.) (\u201creference to post-arrest silence is permissible for rebuttal purposes when a defendant implies that he cooperated with the police\u201d) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1016, 117 S.Ct. 527, 136 L.Ed.2d 414 (1996). <em>See also State v. McIntosh, </em>358 S.C. 432, 595 S.E.2d 484, 491 (2004) (agreeing with principle that a defendant may open the door to evidence of post <em>-Miranda </em>silence by creating the impression that he cooperated with the police, but finding no assertion of cooperation in that case); <em>State v. Cockrell, </em>306 Wis.2d 52, 741 N.W.2d 267, 274 (App.) (recognizing that evidence that Cockrell cooperated with the police permitted the State to elicit that Cockrell declined to answer questions after his arrest), <em>review denied, </em>306 Wis.2d 46, 744 N.W.2d 295 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Here, appellant testified that, although he fled to New Jersey after the shooting, he returned to Maryland to turn himself in to the police. On cross-examination, before being questioned regarding his actions after arrest, appellant testified that he wanted to talk to the police \u201cto get the situation straightened out,\u201d stating that he \u201cknew that there was only one person that is going to say what needs to be said, and that was me.\u201d This testimony created the impression that appellant was cooperating fully with the police. Pursuant to the above authorities, it was not fundamentally unfair for the State to rebut this impression of cooperation and elicit evidence that appellant subsequently declined to talk with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Appellant does not appear to disagree with this conclusion; he does not attempt to distinguish the above authority or otherwise argue that it was unconstitutional for the State to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>elicit evidence of his <em>post-Miranda </em>silence under the circumstances of this case. Instead, he relies on state law, arguing that \u201c[t]he Maryland Declaration of Rights affords greater protections to the accused than the Fifth Amendment and, as a matter of Maryland law, evidence of the accused\u2019s post-arrest silence is never admissible.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights both protect the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Adkins v. State, </em>316 Md. 1, 6, 557 A.2d 203 (1989). Although \u201cto some extent, Maryland self-incrimination law grants greater protections to the individual than the Fifth Amendment,\u201d the Court of Appeals has made clear that \u201cthe privilege against self-incrimination protected by Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights <em>\u2018generally\u2019 </em>is <em>\u2018in pari materia\u2019 </em>with the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Marshall v. State, 415 </em>Md. 248, 259, 259 n. 4, 999 A.2d 1029 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Here, although appellant states generally that Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights has been construed more broadly than the Fifth Amendment in some instances, he has made no specific argument why this Court should construe the State constitution more broadly than the Fifth Amendment in regard to the issue presented in this case, <em>ie., </em>the constitutionality of admitting evidence of post-<em>Miranda </em>silence to rebut the impression created by the defense that the defendant cooperated fully with the police. Accordingly, we will not address this issue. <em>See Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 552, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999) (\u201carguments not presented in a brief or not presented with particularity will not be considered on appeal\u201d); <em>Hopkins v. Silber, </em>141 Md. App. 319, 338, 785 A.2d 806 (2001) (same).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Appellant\u2019s primary argument with respect to Maryland law is based on \u201cState evidentiary law.\u201d He cites <em>Wills v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 669, 677, 573 A.2d 80 (1990), for the proposition that \u201cevidence of an accused\u2019s post-arrest, <em>pre-Miranda </em>warning, silence for impeachment is inadmissible because the probative value, if any, of such evidence, is clearly outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice.\u201d In <em>Wills, </em>the Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">knowledge of the right to remain silent is widespread and it is likely that an accused\u2019s silence \u2014 even where <em>Miranda </em>warnings have not been administered \u2014 is merely an invocation of the right. Therefore, since \u201c[sjilence may be motivated by many factors other than a sense of guilt or lack of an exculpatory story,\u201d it carries little, if any, probative value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 678, 573 A.2d 80 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">In the present case, appellant\u2019s post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>silence was not admitted to show appellant\u2019s \u201csense of guilt or lack of an exculpatory story.\u201d Rather, it was used to rebut the impression created by appellant that he cooperated with the police. The prosecutor merely cross-examined appellant regarding whether he had the opportunity to give his version of the events to the police, as he testified he intended to do. Appellant testified that the police did not give him a chance to explain what happened before they gave him the charging document, at which time he asked for a lawyer. In response to appellant\u2019s testimony, the State called Sergeant Sexton as a rebuttal witness to explain that appellant was advised of the charges and then given the opportunity to make a statement, which opportunity appellant declined. The clear purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>this evidence was to rebut appellant\u2019s attempt to create the impression that he was actively cooperating with the police.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although <em>post-Miranda </em>silence may not be probative as substantive evidence of guilt or to impeach an affirmative defense, it was probative on an issue generated by the defense case in this case, whether appellant actively cooperated with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Appellant contends, however, citing to language in <em>Grier, </em>351 Md. at 258, 718 A.2d 211, that the Court of Appeals has held that post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda, </em>silence is inadmissible for \u201cany purpose.\u201d As indicated, however, the Court\u2019s statement in <em>Grier </em>cited as support <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 468 n. 37, 86 S.Ct. 1602, and <em>Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 619, 96 S.Ct. 2240, cases which held that <em>post-Miranda </em>silence was inadmissible as substantive evidence of guilt or to impeach an affirmative defense. The Court went on to discuss the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Robinson, </em>which, as discussed, held that it was permissible in some instances for the State to refer to a defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence as a \u201cfair response\u201d to an issue generated by the defense.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Grier, </em>351 Md. at 261-62, 718 A.2d 211. Although the Court concluded that the defense in that case did \u201cnothing to generate\u201d a response by the State regarding the defendant\u2019s silence, <em>id. </em>at 262, 718 A.2d 211, the Court did not hold that Maryland, as a matter of State law, would not adopt the reasoning in <em>Robinson. </em>Indeed, by considering whether the evidence was admissible under the \u201cfair response\u201d doctrine, <em>id., </em>the Court implicitly acknowledged that, or at least left open the issue whether, the \u201cfair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>response\u201d doctrine could permit the State to reference a defendant\u2019s post <em>-Miranda </em>silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">We hold that, although a defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence generally is inadmissible, the State may introduce such evidence when it is introduced in fair response to an issue that is generated by the defense regarding the defendant\u2019s interaction with the police. When a defendant creates the impression that he or she cooperated with the police, the State may introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence to rebut that impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Here, the evidence of appellant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence was introduced, not as substantive evidence of guilt or to impeach an affirmative defense, but to rebut the impression that appellant created regarding his intent to cooperate with the police. The trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Request to Speak with Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Appellant next argues that \u201cthe trial court erred in permitting the State to introduce the fact that [appellant], when questioned by police, asked to speak with an attorney.\u201d Specifically, he asserts that \u201c[t]he State\u2019s cross-examination of [appellant], and recall of Sergeant Sexton, was impermissible not only because it presented the jury with evidence of [appellant\u2019s] post-arrest silence, but \u2014 independent of that error, because it introduced evidence, through [appellant], that he \u2018asked for a lawyer,\u2019 and, through Sexton, that after [appellant] was Mirandized \u2018[h]e said he would have to talk to a lawyer because those charges were very serious and he wanted to speak to a lawyer.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The State argues that appellant\u2019s contention is not preserved for this Court\u2019s review. On the merits, the State contends that \u201cthe evidence that [appellant] wanted to speak with counsel rather than speak with police was as likewise relevant and admissible as his post-arrest silence, in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>fairly respond to and rebut his claim that he had every intention of fully cooperating with the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">To assess the State\u2019s preservation argument, we review defense counsel\u2019s response below to the admission of this evidence. After appellant testified, the prosecutor approached the bench and argued that, based on appellant\u2019s testimony that he intended to speak to the police, appellant had opened the door to cross-examination regarding his post-arrest silence. Defense counsel disagreed that appellant was subject to cross-examination regarding his post-arrest silence, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABn\">I don\u2019t think that he is. And the reason is because Mr. Lupfer originally did not think that there was going to be a serious charge such as murder brought against him. And when the police arrested him and told him that, he said, Oh, shit, this is more serious than I thought.... I better talk to my attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The court agreed with the State that it could ask about appellant\u2019s post-arrest silence. The State then proceeded to question appellant about his activities after his arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOO\">[PROSECUTOR]: Mr. Lupfer, after the police arrested you, they took you back to the police station, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY_\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: And they asked you if you wanted to talk about what had happened, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">[APPELLANT]: No, they did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection. I objected, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">[THE COURT]: The objection and the reason therefore is on the record. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: They asked you if you wanted to talk about what happened; is that correct, Mr. Lupfer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2T\">[APPELLANT]: No, sir. It\u2019s not correct. Would you like me to tell you what took place when I got there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATb\">[PROSECUTOR]: Well, I\u2019m sure they took your fingerprints and took your photographs. I mean, we know that so I\u2019m not interested in that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>[APPELLANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: But I\u2019m just wanting to know whether they offered you the opportunity to tell your side of the story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">[APPELLANT]: No. Before they slid the charges charging me with first degree murder, before they slid them charges in front of me, no, they did not give me a chance to say anything. And when I seen the charges, I asked for a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The State subsequently called Sergeant Sexton as a witness, and the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: What, if any, efforts did you make to question Mr. Lupfer about this case subsequent to arrest? And I take Mr. Brown\u2019s objection to be preserving the record for his earlier objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">[THE COURT]: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">[SERGEANT SEXTON]: When we brought him back to the barrack, we placed him in an interview room. I came in with another investigator, Corporal or TEC Bachtell. Basically I sat down with [appellant] and advised him that \u2014 I asked him, I said, [appellant], you know why you\u2019re here, but before I start asking any questions of you, I\u2019m going to read you your advice of rights, and I read them verbatim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">During that time [appellant] had asked me what he was being charged with. I told him he was being charged with murder as a result of what happened over in Timberbrook, and that\u2019s when I read him his advice of rights and he elected not to answer any questions. He said he would have to talk to a lawyer because those charges were very serious and he wanted to speak to a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApM\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did you lay a formal set of written charges in front of him at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-12\">[SERGEANT SEXTON]: Not at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, may I have a continuing objection so that it\u2019s clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-14\">[THE COURT]: Yes, you do. You do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\">[SERGEANT SEXTON]: Not at that time. After the 180, or the Form 180, which is the Miranda form, was signed, I laid the charging documents there and he actually read them after he had objected to answering any questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyI\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">We agree with the State that, based on the above, appellant\u2019s complaint about the admission of evidence that he asked for a lawyer is not preserved for appellate review. The State\u2019s proffer of the evidence it desired to elicit, as well as the questions asked, were designed to elicit testimony regarding appellant\u2019s silence after his arrest, to rebut appellant\u2019s testimony regarding his intention to talk to the police and \u201cget the situation straightened out.\u201d Although appellant made clear, at trial and on appeal, that he objected to the admission of evidence of appellant\u2019s post-arrest silence, he now raises a new contention of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">On appeal, he argues that, even if his testimony \u201copened the door\u201d to the admissibility of his silence, \u201c[i]n no way was the door opened wide enough to permit the different, and additional, fact that [appellant] invoked his right to counsel.\u201d This argument was not raised below. When appellant volunteered that he requested to speak with a lawyer, defense counsel did not object or otherwise alert the court that an analysis different from that regarding the admission of his silence was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The Court of Appeals recently discussed the requirement that a litigant sufficiently raise claims of error in the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">Maryland Rule 8-131(a) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any [] issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial eourt[.]\u201d The purpose of Md. Rule 8-131(a) is \u201c \u2018to ensure fairness for all parties in a case and to promote the orderly administration of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 189, 638 A.2d 107, 113 (1994) (quoting <em>Brice v. State, </em>254 Md. 655, 661, 255 A.2d 28, 31 (1969)). Fairness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>and the orderly administration of justice is advanced \u201cby \u2018requiring counsel to bring the position of their client to the attention of the lower court at the trial so that the trial court can pass upon, and possibly correct any errors in the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell, </em>334 Md. at 189, 638 A.2d at 113 (quoting Cl<em>ayman v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>266 Md. 409, 416, 292 A.2d 689, 693 (1972)). For those reasons, Md. Rule 8-131(a) requires an appellant who desires to contest a court\u2019s ruling or other error on appeal to have made a timely objection at trial. The failure to do so bars the appellant from obtaining review of the claimed error, as a matter of right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-5\"><em>Robinson v. State, </em>410 Md. 91, 103, 976 A.2d 1072 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Here, the questions propounded by the prosecutor were designed to elicit testimony about appellant\u2019s opportunity to tell his story to the police. At no time did the State\u2019s proffer, or questions asked, indicate an intent to elicit evidence of appellant\u2019s request for an attorney. When appellant, and thereafter Sergeant Sexton, volunteered that appellant requested to speak to an attorney, defense counsel was required, if he believed this evidence was inadmissible, to object or move to strike the testimony. <em>See State v. Jones, </em>311 Md. 23, 29, 532 A.2d 169 (1987) (where defense counsel objected to testimony of witness, but the actual testimony was different from that initially objected to, and defense counsel did not make an additional objection or move to strike to give the court the opportunity to rule on the admissibility of the new testimony, the issue not preserved). Counsel\u2019s failure to make his objection known renders this claim unpreserved for this Court\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Even if this issue was preserved for review, we would not find reversible error. In <em>Hunter v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 679, 573 A.2d 85 (1990), this Court held that \u201cit is impermissible for the State to offer evidence of, or comment upon, a criminal defendant\u2019s ... attempt, request, or desire to obtain counsel in order to show a consciousness of guilt.\u201d This Court stated that \u201c <em>\u2018frjeversal has been ordered </em>... <em>when the prosecution </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>has deliberately sought to capitalize on a request for counsel, </em>as by arguing the defendant must have had something to hide if he needed a lawyer before talking to the police.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 573 A.2d 85 (quoting <em>United States v. Daoud, </em>741 F.2d 478, 480 (1st Cir.1984)). <em>Accord Martin v. State, </em>364 Md. 692, 707, 775 A.2d 385 (2001) (finding error when \u201cthe State sought to draw an inference of guilt from petitioner\u2019s consultation with an attorney.\u201d). Other courts have recognized, however, that \u201c \u2018[incidental references have not led to reversal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hunter, </em>82 Md.App. at 687, 573 A.2d 85 (quoting <em>Daoud, </em>741 F.2d at 480). <em>Accord Qureshi v. State, </em>291 Ga.App. 708, 662 S.E.2d 806, 808 (2008) (no reversible error based on police officer\u2019s reference to Qureshi\u2019s invocation of his right to counsel where reference was \u201cfleeting,\u201d prosecutor did not comment on Qureshi\u2019s request in closing argument, and there was no reasonable likelihood that request for counsel contributed to the verdict).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Here, evidence that appellant consulted an attorney was not admitted to show consciousness of guilt. Rather, the testimony was volunteered in response to questions designed to show that, although appellant testified that he intended to cooperate with the police, he chose not to do so after he was in police custody. The two brief references to appellant\u2019s request for a lawyer fairly can be characterized as \u201cincidental\u201d or \u201cfleeting,\u201d and there was no mention of the request by the prosecutor in closing argument. Even if the issue was preserved for appellate review, we would find that it would not warrant reversal of appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Sequestration Order</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that the circuit court \u201cabused [its] discretion in failing to afford [appellant] a remedy after ruling that several of the State\u2019s witnesses violated the court\u2019s sequestration order.\u201d He argues that, after finding a violation of the court\u2019s order, \u201csome reasonable sanction ... was called for,\u201d and the court abused its discretion when it \u201cfailed to fashion any effective remedy\u201d for the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The State contends that the trial court \u201cdid not find a clear violation of the sequestration order,\u201d and even if there had been a violation, the degree of prejudice from any violation was unclear. Thus, it argues, the trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial to strike witness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Maryland Rule 5-615 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">(a) In general. Except as provided in sections (b) and (c) of this Rule, upon the request of a party made before testimony begins, the court shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses .... The court may order the exclusion of a witness on its own initiative or upon the request of a party at any time. The court may continue the exclusion of a witness following the testimony of that witness if a party represents that the witness is likely to be recalled to give further testimony.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAbIf\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">(d) Nondisclosure....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">(2) The court may, and upon request of a party shall, order the witness and any other persons present in the courtroom not to disclose to a witness excluded under this Rule the nature, substance, or purpose of testimony, exhibits, or other evidence introduced during the witness absence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">(e) Exclusion of testimony. The court may exclude all or part of the testimony of the witness who receives information in violation of this Rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">The purpose of a sequestration order pursuant to Rule 5-615 is \u201c \u2018to prevent ... [witnesses] from being taught or prompted by each other\u2019s testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tharp v. State, </em>362 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Md. 77, 95, 763 A.2d 151 (2000) (quoting <em>Bulluck v. State, </em>219 Md. 67, 70-71, 148 A.2d 433 (1959)). It is an attempt to avoid \u201c \u2018an artificial harmony of testimony that prevents the trier of fact from truly weighing all the testimony; it may also avoid the outright manufacture of testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Redditt v. State, </em>337 Md. 621, 629, 655 A.2d 390 (1995) (quoting <em>Hurley v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 348, 351-52, 251 A.2d 241 (1969)). <em>Accord Tharp, </em>362 Md. at 95, 763 A.2d 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">In this case, the court granted defense counsel\u2019s request to sequester all the witnesses. The court instructed the witnesses: \u201cDo not discuss the matter with anybody except the attorneys until the case is over.\u201d Defense counsel subsequently advised the court of a potential violation of the court\u2019s sequestration order. Counsel explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">Your Honor, I\u2019ve received a report, and there is a young woman who overheard a number of witnesses who testified yesterday, specifically Shannon Barr and ... Jenna Webb. They were \u2014 Todd Slayman \u2014 were all discussing their testimony with Derek Patton, who is another witness who was in the bull pen, and they were permitted to speak with him; and I need to bring this to your attention so that we can inquire as to what the nature of that conversation was. I think that Mr. Kennedy was present and overheard some part of the conversation. I do not have firsthand knowledge of it, but Ms. Pam Hamilton does.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Ms. Hamilton then testified to various conversations that she had heard among the witnesses, including: (1) a man with a \u201clong beard\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> was in the hallway talking about \u201cthe children being outside\u201d and that he saw \u201csomeone go to a truck\u201d;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (2) Ms. Webb discussed her testimony with Mr. Kennedy, in the presence of Mr. Jackson, Ms. Barr, and Mr. Slayman and his son, including that she had heard arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>and gunshots, but \u201cshe didn\u2019t see anybody\u201d; (3) Ms. Barr came out of the courtroom and told Mr. Slayman \u201cwhat she saw about Derek, Matt and [appellant] running out the door\u201d; and (4) Ms. Webb, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Jackson were speaking with Mr. Patton, but Ms. Hamilton could not determine what was being said. Ms. Hamilton testified: \u201cThey\u2019re all out there conversating about everything that\u2019s being said.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Defense counsel moved for a mistrial. He argued that \u201cthere has been a wholesale ignoring of your sequestration order.\u201d Counsel argued that, when the witnesses concluded their testimony, \u201cthe last thing they heard [ ] from you was not to discuss their testimony, and the first thing that they do when they get out in the hallway is to discuss their testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The prosecutor responded: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s been evidence established of a need for a mistrial.\u201d He stated that \u201cthere\u2019s been no inquiry made of any of these witnesses that [counsel for appellant] has alleg[ed] could be tainted. That would be, in my view, at least the first step before any further decisions could be entertained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The State then called Mr. Kennedy to the stand. Mr. Kennedy testified that he did not discuss Ms. Webb\u2019s testimony with her, and she did not discuss her testimony with anyone else. He further testified that he did not \u201coverhear\u201d anything from other witnesses. He did observe Ms. Webb speak to Mr. Patton, but the \u201conly thing that was said\u201d was that Mr. Patton \u201cwas supposed to be getting out Friday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYP\">Counsel for appellant challenged the accuracy of Mr. Kennedy\u2019s testimony. He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">There is no way that Ms. Hamilton would know what was said in here yesterday unless \u2014 unless she had overheard somebody talking about it; and there was information that she conveyed that is not in any of the police reports, that\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>not contained in any part of the investigation. You would have had to have been in this courtroom yesterday to have overheard it, for her to know what had been said.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The prosecutor argued: \u201cI just don\u2019t think there has been any prejudice or any taint here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In denying appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">From what I have heard so far on this particular issue, it does appear that there was a contravention of the sequestration order by virtue of people having some sort of discussions out in the hallway regarding testimony that had occurred in the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">The extent to which this took place is unclear; and I don\u2019t feel under the total circumstances of the facts in this case, that what happened elevates to such a statu[r]e to justify a mistrial at this junction of the proceedings; and I won\u2019t go into any more factual detail. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">So the motion for mistrial is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-10\">Mr. Bailiff, at this time we\u2019re going to take a break. You can let the jury have a break as well. What I do want you to do during the course of the recess, round up as many of the witnesses as you can out in the hallway. I don\u2019t want to do this in open court; but tell them that they are subject to sequestration, and if I receive any information whatsoever that they were having any discussions whatsoever about this case, any whatsoever, they\u2019re going to be brought in before me, given an opportunity to respond as to why they should not be held in contempt of court, and they are going to sit in jail for a week.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, defense counsel renewed his motion for a mistrial. Alternatively, he requested that the court \u201cstrike the testimony of the laywitnesses who talked to each other.... \u201d The court denied defense counsel\u2019s motions \u201cfor reasons previously stated.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>\u201cWhen there has been a violation of a sequestration order, whether there is to be a sanction and, if so, what sanction to impose, are decisions left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Redditt, </em>337 Md. at 629, 655 A.2d 390. <em>Accord Muhammad v.
