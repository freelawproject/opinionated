He alleged that GEICO \u201cunconstitutionally abridged [his] freedom of expression and association\u201d by directly settling an automobile collision claim with a person whom Ross, although not admitted to the Bar, was attempting to represent as an attorney-in-fact under a power of attorney.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Circuit Court for Prince <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>George\u2019s County dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, ruling that the power of attorney did not preclude GEICO from dealing directly with the claimant and did not permit Ross to perform legal services that amount to the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In his brief, Ross asserts that this Court \u201chas the power to determine whether preventing non-attorneys from providing information or services under power of attorney serves the public interest.\u201d In his view, \u201ca prohibition on power of attorney services does not serve the public interest.\u201d To the extent that the issue is before us, we disagree and reject Ross\u2019s contention that he has constitutionally protected \u201crights\u201d under the power of attorney in question to practice law. In sum, and as we explain below, we hold that the circuit court did not err in its determination that Ross\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted to appellant against GEICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The circuit court set forth the following summary, which based on our review of the record is an accurate account of the relevant events alleged in Mr. Ross\u2019s complaint and accompanying exhibits.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">On February 7, 2008, Leroy Skipper granted a power of attorney to Plaintiff Daniel H. Ross. (Compl. \u00b6 5.) On March 14, 2008, Plaintiff, who is not authorized to practice law (Compl. \u00b6 10.), filed a Complaint on behalf of Skipper in the District Court of Maryland for Prince George\u2019s County, Case No. 85222008. (Compl. Ex. J.) That Complaint alleged that Skipper\u2019s vehicle was struck by a vehicle operated by Neion T. Gaines on August 18, 2007 causing damages to Skipper\u2019s vehicle. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2-4.) The matter was transferred to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Case No. CAL 08-09993. (Compl. Ex. E.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">Plaintiff subsequently filed several pleadings on behalf of Skipper, including motions for sanctions and default. (Compl. \u00b6 16.) On July 2, 2008, Defendant Chakrabarti, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>staff attorney for GEICO Indemnity Company, insurer for Neion T. Gaines, filed an Answer to the underlying Complaint. (Compl. Ex. H.) In addition, Defendants alerted the Attorney Grievance Commission of the Maryland Bar that Plaintiff had filed an action in the District Court of Maryland under a Power of Attorney for another individual. (Compl. \u00b6 23.) In a letter dated July 10, 2008, Melvin Hirshman, Bar Counsel to the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland, wrote to Plaintiff advising him \u201c[t]hat the activity on your part constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d (Compl. Ex. G.) Hirshman warned Plaintiff that there \u201cis also a criminal penalty for one engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">On July 15, 2008, the Honorable Albert W. Northrup issued an Order as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">ORDERED, that under Maryland Rule 2-131 Daniel H. Ross appears to have no standing at this time to bring suit on behalf of Leroy Skipper. That Rule states \u201can individual may enter an appearance by an attorney or in proper person.\u201d A person with \u201cpower of attorney\u201d is not authorized to represent an individual or file suit on his behalf and sign pleadings on his behalf. The individual may file suit on his own behalf or have a licensed attorney do so on his behalf. Therefore, any motions filed by Daniel Ross are not properly before this court at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS1\">(Compl. Ex. B.) On August 1, 2008, Plaintiff and Skipper went to the office of defense counsel, Defendant, and while there, Defendant settled Skipper\u2019s claim with Skipper, agreeing to and signing a Notice of Dismissal of the underlying action, which was later filed in this Court on or about August 5, 2008. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28, 33.) Plaintiff now files a separate civil action against Defendants alleging a conspiracy to violate his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to exercise or enjoy powers of attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Mr. Ross\u2019s complaint sets forth three claims, all of which are labeled \u201cConspiracy to Interfere with Constitutional Rights.\u201d Although overlapping and repetitive, Ross\u2019s griev-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>anees essentially arise from GEICO\u2019s settlement with Skipper on August 1, 2008, Bar Counsel\u2019s admonishment against his unauthorized practice of law, and the circuit court\u2019s order applying Maryland Rule 2-131 in declining to consider any pleadings that he filed in the lawsuit he brought on Skipper\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">\u2022 In \u201cCLAIM ONE,\u201d Ross alleges a conspiracy by GEICO \u201cfrom approximately March 14, 2008, to approximately August 1, 2008,\u201d to deprive him \u201cof his rights to exercise and enjoy powers of attorney,\u201d thereby \u201creducing] Plaintiff to a badge of slavery so that, on purpose, and in effect, his right to exercise and enjoy powers of attorney would be arbitrarily and capriciously denied on account of money and status.\u201d As \u201cOVERT ACTS\u201d proving this conspiracy, Ross cites GEICO\u2019s failure to recognize his right \u201cto settle the principal\u2019s claims of damages and losses\u201d and the circuit court\u2019s July 15, 2008 order denying him \u201caccess to the Maryland Circuit Court on equal terms[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u2022 In \u201cCLAIM TWO,\u201d Ross alleges that GEICO complained to the Attorney Grievance Commission in order \u201cto injure, oppress, threaten and intimidate [him] in the free exercise and enjoyment of his powers of attorney,\u201d and that by \u201cfailing] to repudiate\u201d the circuit court\u2019s July 15, 2008 order \u201cdenying [him] equal access to the Maryland Circuit Court,\u201d GEICO was \u201cacting under color of\u2019 Maryland law to \u201creduce [him] to a badge of slavery by which [GEICO] again demonstrated that this non-barred plaintiff had no powers of attorney\u2019s rights which they need respect on August 1, 2008 to settle the principal\u2019s claims as pro se agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\u2022 In \u201cCLAIM THREE,\u201d Ross alleges that GEICO \u201cmisapplied Maryland Rule 2-131 to discourage and curtail [his] civil rights activities.\u201d According to Ross, Rule 2-131, \u201cas construed and misapplied by defendants to the plaintiff,\u201d \u201cpromotes a pecuniary monopoly that criminalizes freedom of expression and petition in the circuit court,\u201d \u201cserves no public interest,\u201d violated his First Amendment rights \u201cby unduly inhibiting protected freedom of expression and petition against corporate and governmental intrusion,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection by barring only \u201cperson[s] similarly situated [i.e., any plaintiff acting under powers of attorney] and proscribing] individious discrimination against persons with powers of attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The GEICO defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss Mr. Ross\u2019s complaint, or in the alternative for summary judgment, arguing that Mr. Ross failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. After a hearing, the circuit court agreed, ruling in a written opinion that \u201ca power of attorney does not authorize a lay person to practice law,\u201d that any conspiracy alleged by Ross \u201cdoes not rise to the level of a political and social expression\u201d that is constitutionally protected, and that he \u201clacks standing to sue\u201d on the ground that the claimant had \u201cfreedom to choose\u201d him as his representative in court. Ross noted this timely appeal challenging the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">If the circuit court\u2019s decision that Ross\u2019s complaint does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted was legally correct, we must affirm it. <em>See RRC Northeast, LLC v. BAA Md., Inc., </em>413 Md. 638, 643-44, 994 A.2d 430 (2010). We review the complaint on the basis of its averments and the exhibits referenced in and attached to it. <em>See id. </em>Like the circuit court, we must assume the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint, as well as reasonable inferences therefrom, and view such allegations in the light most favorable to Ross, as the party opposing the motion. <em>See id. </em>at 643, 994 A.2d 430. Dismissal is appropriate \u201cif the allegations and permissible inferences, if true, would not afford relief to the plaintiff, i.e., the allegations do not state a cause of action for which relief may be granted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">In his brief to this Court, Mr. Ross asserts four arguments stemming from his basic complaint that he was not permitted to act as Mr. Skipper\u2019s \u201cattorney.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As pleaded in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>the complaint, Ross believes that the power of attorney gave him a \u201cright\u201d to act as Skipper\u2019s \u201cagent\u201d for all purposes related to his claim arising out of his motor vehicle accident with GEICO\u2019s insured, including litigation, and that GEICO\u2019s direct settlement of Skipper\u2019s claim violated Ross\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to perform such \u201cservices\u201d under the power of attorney. According to Ross\u2019s complaint, GEICO and its two employees engaged in a conspiracy that resulted not only in this wrongful settlement of Skipper\u2019s claim, but also in Bar Counsel\u2019s warning against his unauthorized practice of law and in the circuit court\u2019s refusal to consider any pleadings he filed in the prior lawsuit brought on Skipper\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In our view, Ross\u2019s complaint rests on the factual and legal fallacy that the power of attorney gave him unrestricted exclusive authority to act on Skipper\u2019s behalf with respect to matters including \u201cInsurance Transactions\u201d and all \u201cClaims and Litigation.\u201d Despite efforts of opposing counsel, Bar Counsel, and the circuit court to explain to Mr. Ross that this power of attorney does not give him the right to dispense legal advice or to appear in court on Mr. Skipper\u2019s behalf, Ross either misunderstands or mischaracterizes his \u201cpowers\u201d and \u201crights\u201d under this document.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The power of attorney, <em>by its own terms, </em>gave Ross the right to act on Skipper\u2019s behalf <em>only \u201cto the extent that [Skipper was] permitted by law to act through an agent.\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>(Emphasis added.) It is undisputed that the law does not permit Skipper to either file lawsuits or appear in court through an agent who is not authorized to practice law in Maryland. Under Maryland Code, \u00a7 10-601(a) of the Business Occupations &amp; Professions Article (\u201cBOP\u201d), \u201ca person may not practice, attempt to practice, or offer to practice law in the State unless admitted to the Bar.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And practicing law is defined to include \u201cgiving legal advice,\u201d \u201crepresenting another person before a unit of the state government,\u201d \u201cpreparing ... [a] document that is filed in a court or affects a case that is or may be filed in a court,\u201d and \u201cgiving advice about a case that is or may be filed in a court[.]\u201d BOP \u00a7 10-101(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Thus, on the face of Ross\u2019s complaint, it is clear that the power of attorney did not give Ross the right to perform legal services such as filing a complaint and pleadings on behalf of Skipper, because Skipper was not \u201cpermitted by law to act through an agent\u201d who is not admitted to the Maryland Bar in filing those documents. To the extent that Ross\u2019s complaint alleges that GEICO committed various acts that violated his asserted \u201cright\u201d to perform legal services for Skipper under the power of attorney, the circuit court did not err in ruling that he failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">We reach the same conclusion regarding Ross\u2019s complaint about GEICO\u2019s direct settlement of Skipper\u2019s claim. By its terms, the power of attorney gave Ross authority <em>only to \u201cact in [Skipper\u2019s] name, place and stead in any way which [he himself] could do, if [he] were personally pres</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>ent[.]\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) There is absolutely nothing in that document, in Ross\u2019s complaint, or in the law to indicate that Skipper irrevocably abandoned his personal right to act on his own behalf in such matters. <em>See generally King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 105, 492 A.2d 608 (1985) (\u201ca power of attorney is a written document by which one party, as principal, appoints another as agent (attorney in fact) and confers upon the latter the authority to perform certain specified acts or kinds of acts on behalf of the principal\u201d). To the contrary, in his brief Ross \u201cconcedes that Mr. Skipper had the right to manage his own affairs on August 1, 2008,\u201d the date he settled his claim directly with GEICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Consequently, to the extent that Ross\u2019s complaint alleges that, under the power of attorney, he had a \u201cright\u201d to insist that GEICO deal \u201cexclusively\u201d with him, rather than dealing directly with Skipper, the circuit court did not err in ruling that he failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Alternatively, to the extent that Ross\u2019s complaint asserts that Mr. Skipper had a \u201cright\u201d to consult with him in the settlement negotiations, the circuit court did not err in ruling that Ross has no standing to complain about any injury allegedly suffered by Skipper (i.e., he has no right to complain that Skipper\u2019s rights were violated).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">As explained above, we agree with the circuit court that the power of attorney did not \u2014 and could not \u2014 convey to Mr. Ross either the right to give Mr. Skipper legal advice, represent Skipper in court, prevent GEICO and its employees from settling directly with Skipper, or pursue a claim that is personal to Skipper. Because Ross has no such rights under the power of attorney, GEICO could not have conspired to violate or interfere with such rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">In his brief to this Court, Ross does not attempt to shore up the legal or factual foundation for his claim that the power of attorney affords him the constitutionally protected right to represent Skipper. Instead, he asks that we overturn or disregard the longstanding prohibition against the practice of law by a \u201cnon-barred\u201d person such as himself because it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>in the public interest and therefore unconstitutional. Specifically, he posits that the proscription against the unauthorized practice of law violates his \u201c \u2018liberty interest\u2019 to provide information and services,\u201d as well as his \u201cright to choose\u201d and his rights to due process, equal protection, free speech, and \u201cpetition for a redress of grievances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">When his grievances are reduced to their essence, what Mr. Ross wants is the right to practice law in this State without meeting the educational, examination, and ethical standards established by the General Assembly and the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals has recognized that \u201c[t]he goal of the prohibition against unauthorized practice is to protect the public from being preyed upon by those not competent to practice law \u2014 from incompetent, unethical, or irresponsible representation.\u201d <em>In re Application of R.G.S., </em>312 Md. 626, 638, 541 A.2d 977 (1988); <em>see Kennedy v. Bar Ass\u2019n of Montgomery County, </em>316 Md. 646, 659, 561 A.2d 200 (1989). <em>See also Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hallmon, </em>343 Md. 390, 397, 681 A.2d 510 (1996) (citing this as the reason that lawyers are prohibited from assisting unauthorized persons to practice law). As this Court has explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ami-dedup-1\">the long history of legislation prohibiting the practice of law by nonlawyers makes clear [that] the prohibition is a matter of utmost importance to Maryland lawmakers. [BOP] Sections 10-206(a) and 10-601(a) employ mandatory language. Section 10-206(a) directs that before an individual may practice law in Maryland, \u201cthe individual <em>shall: </em>(1) be admitted to the Bar; and (2) meet any requirement that the Court of Appeals may set by rule.\u201d (Emphasis added.) ... Section 10-601(a) mandates that \u201ca person may not practice, attempt to practice, or offer to practice law in the State <em>unless </em>admitted to the Bar.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Violation of \u00a7 10-601(a) is a criminal offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-606(a)(3). Moreover, the court needs to be able to rely on an advocate\u2019s responsibility to act ethically in that advocate\u2019s dealings with the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-6\"><em>Turkey Point Property Owners\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Anderson, </em>106 Md. App. 710, 717-18, 666 A.2d 904 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>In the litigation context, it is particularly critical that courts can expect attorneys to conduct themselves with the heightened responsibilities that attend admission to the Bar. \u201cA lawyer, as a member of the legal profession, is a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system and a public citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice.\u201d Md. Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Prof. Conduct, Preamble \u00b6 [1]. Lawyers \u201cshould use the law\u2019s procedures only for legitimate purposes and not to harass or intimidate others.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Preamble \u00b6 [5]. Therefore, \u201c[a] lawyer shall not bring ... a proceeding, or assert ... an issue therein, unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous[.]\u201d Md.

Rule l-311(a). That signature, in turn,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-c\">constitutes a certification that the attorney has read the pleading or paper; that to the best of the attorney\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for improper purpose or delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Md.

Md. Rule l-311(c). \u201cNon-barred\u201d advocates like Mr. Ross offer no analogous protection to clients or the judicial system.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Although we credit Ross\u2019s allegation that Skipper is dissatisfied with the settlement he accepted from GEICO,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the facts alleged in the complaint established that this settlement occurred in the immediate aftermath of Ross\u2019s attempt to litigate on Skipper\u2019s behalf. To the extent Skipper may have a claim arising out of that settlement, that claim is personal to him and not to Ross. Ross\u2019s complaint, on its face, revealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>no factual or legal justification for his claims, and the circuit court was legally correct in ruling that it failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
