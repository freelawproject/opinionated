The court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the first degree murder conviction and a consecutive sentence of twenty years, five years without parole, on the conviction for use of a handgun.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Appellant presents the following issues for our review, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">1. Is the right to confrontation implicated: (a) when an inmate admits to another inmate in jail that he committed a crime; or (b) when the defendant, by his presence and his silence, adopts that admission as his own statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">2. Did the trial court err in admitting appellant\u2019s statements to Michael West because they were the \u201cfruit\u201d of an illegal arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">3. Was the evidence sufficient to support appellant\u2019s convictions? For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">On January 18, 2008, appellant was indicted, in three separate indictments, on five charges: (1) first degree murder; (2) conspiracy with Rodney Johnson to murder the victim; (3) unlawful use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence; (4) wearing, carrying and transporting a handgun upon his person; and (5) possession of a regulated firearm by a person previously convicted of a disqualifying crime. Appellant and Mr. Johnson initially were scheduled to be tried together, but the court ultimately severed the trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Suppression Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">On January 5, 2009, the court held a hearing on motions, including appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the gun seized from a car driven by appellant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Detective Milton Smith, III, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>member of the Baltimore City Police Department, testified that, on December 28, 2007, he was on patrol in an unmarked vehicle with Detectives Derek Phyall and Eugene Bush. At approximately 12:80 p.m., the officers observed that the driver of a black 2006 Mercedes Benz was not wearing his seatbelt, and the driver failed to come to a complete stop at a stop sign. The officers initiated a traffic stop of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Detective Smith approached the passenger side of the vehicle. He observed that the passenger\u2019s hands were visibly shaking \u201cin a nervous manner.\u201d Detective Smith asked the passenger his name, and at that point, a broadcast came over the police radio regarding a shooting at Church Square, which was approximately ten city blocks away.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The broadcast stated that a black male in a black hooded sweatshirt was seen fleeing the scene by foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">After the broadcast, the passenger, who was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, became more nervous. His hands began to shake uncontrollably, he started making erratic eye movements, and his chest was \u201cmoving through his shirt.\u201d In response to this behavior, Detective Smith asked the passenger if he had anything illegal on his person. The passenger replied in the negative, and the detective inquired if he \u201ccould check.\u201d The passenger removed his seatbelt, with his hands \u201cstill shaking vigorously,\u201d and he exited the car. Detective Smith conducted a pat down of the passenger, which revealed no weapons or drugs. Detective Smith identified Mr. Johnson as the passenger of the vehicle and appellant as the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Detective Phyall approached appellant on the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle. He informed appellant why he had been pulled over, and he asked for appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license and registration. Appellant appeared calm during this conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Detective Phyall testified that he did not call dispatch to ascertain the validity of appellant\u2019s license or registration because, approximately three to five minutes after the stop, he heard the broadcast regarding the shooting and the description of the fleeing suspect. Detective Smith alerted Detective Phyall that the passenger matched the description of the suspect. Appellant and Mr. Johnson were patted down, and they were seated on the curb. Detective Phyall asked appellant if there was anything in the car, and he testified that appellant consented to a search of the vehicle by stepping out of his vehicle with his hands in the air. He admitted, however, that no verbal consent was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Detective Phyall searched the car and found a gun inside the trunk. Once the gun was found, both appellant and Mr. Johnson were placed under arrest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Detective Bush testified that, during the traffic stop, he initially stood at the rear of the vehicle. After being alerted that the passenger matched the description of the alleged shooter, Detective Bush assisted Detective Phyall by conducting a pat down of appellant; no weapons or drugs were found. Detective Bush stayed with appellant and Mr. Johnson on the curb while Detective Phyall searched the vehicle. Detective Phyall found the gun \u201c[pjrobably several minutes after the vehicle was pulled over.\u201d Detective Bush then \u201ccleared\u201d the weapon by pulling out the magazine, taking the safety off, and bringing in the slide. As a result of these actions, a round was ejected from the gun\u2019s chamber.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">During cross-examination of the three detectives, appellant\u2019s counsel extensively questioned the officers regarding the timeline of events during the traffic stop. Specifically, counsel established that, although calls regarding the Church Square shooting came in at 12:38 p.m. and 12:40 p.m., it was not until 12:53 p.m. that a call came over the radio indicating that a suspect in a black hoodie was seen fleeing the scene. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>officers testified that the time periods written in the statement of probable cause, as well as that to which they testified in court, were approximations.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">The State argued that the initial stop of appellant and Mr. Johnson was a valid traffic stop. With respect to the subsequent search of the trunk, which uncovered the firearm, the State argued that the search was valid because the police had probable cause to believe that the vehicle contained evidence of a crime, based on the radio call regarding the shooting and that the passenger matched the description of the suspected shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that the detention was illegal, focusing on the length of the traffic stop. He asserted that the police did not have probable cause to believe that appellant was involved in criminal activity until 12:53 p.m., when they received the radio call with the description of the fleeing shooter. Appellant\u2019s counsel stated that \u201cthe detention was illegal [because] [t]hey should have been given a ticket for the seatbelt and sent on their way [and] [t]he fact that they were even in police custody at 12:53,\u201d 23 minutes after the initial stop, was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">On January 6, 2006, the day after the hearing, the court granted the motion to suppress. The court made factual findings that the stop occurred no later than 12:30 p.m., that the first call informing the officers about the shooting took place at 12:38 p.m., and that the call with the description of the shooter, which prompted the officers to ask appellant and Mr. Johnson to exit the car, occurred at 12:53 p.m. Stating that the officers failed to account for what took place between 12:30 p.m. and 12:53 p.m., the court found that, \u201cduring the time period that the vehicle was stopped, there was not the traffic stop activity of issuing a citation.\u201d The court stated that it could not \u201cfind any other legitimate investigatory reason for detaining the two for 15 to 23 minutes if they had no evidence of the shooting in the area before 12:53,\u201d and it concluded that the detention \u201cexceeded the scope of the purported reason for the traffic stop.\u201d The court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>the police did not have reasonable suspicion or probable cause to extend the stop until they learned of the shooting. Accordingly, it granted appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">On January 23, 2008, another motions hearing took place.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant first moved to suppress statements that he made in central booking to an individual named Michael West. Defense counsel argued that, but for the illegal traffic detention, appellant would not have been arrested and in custody to talk to Mr. West. Counsel argued that any statements to Mr. West should be excluded as \u201cfruits\u201d of the illegal detention.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The court denied appellant\u2019s motion, finding that appellant\u2019s conversations with Mr. West did not involve a state actor, and appellant\u2019s \u201cdecision to talk to Mr. West was an independent decision not related in any way to any illegal or unlawful contact by the Baltimore City Police Department.\u201d The court stated that appellant\u2019s decision to talk rendered his statements \u201coutside of the ambit of the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Appellant then argued that the court should exclude statements that Mr. Johnson made to Mr. West in central booking, arguing that these statements constituted inadmissible hearsay. The State argued that Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements were admissible under either of two hearsay exceptions: (1) statements of a co-conspirator; and/or (2) tacit or vicarious admissions. The court denied the motion with respect to all but one of the statements. As discussed in more detail, <em>infra, </em>it ruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>that Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements to Mr. West were made in the presence of appellant, who reasonably would have disagreed with the statements if untrue, and therefore, with one exception, Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements to Mr. West were admissible as tacit admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">On January 27, 2009, trial commenced. Baltimore City Police Officer William Keitz testified that, at 12:38 p.m. on December 28, 2007, he answered a call for a shooting at the Church Square Shopping Center. He immediately went to the shopping center and observed a black male lying on his back in front of the Stop Shop &amp; Save grocery store. The victim was bleeding and unresponsive, and Officer Keitz called for a medic. He found a head wrap and a bullet casing on the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Natalie Hoban, a crime lab technician for the Baltimore City Police Department Mobile Unit, responded to a call for a homicide. She and another evidence technician, Tech Payne, arrived at the scene at 2:40 p.m. Ms. Hoban marked the physical evidence found at the scene, including a head scarf, or do-rag, and a 9-millimeter cartridge casing. The cartridge casing was processed for latent prints, but no prints were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">David McDermott, a homicide detective with the Baltimore City Police Department, responded to the scene of the shooting with Detective Chester Norton at approximately 1:00 p.m. When they arrived at the scene, the victim had already been transported to the hospital, but Detective McDermott observed the head scarf and the cartridge casing. As the primary detective on the scene, Detective McDermott was responsible for directing police personnel, checking the area for evidence, and locating witnesses at the crime scene. He canvassed the area on foot, but he was unable to locate any witnesses or additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Dr. Donna Vincenti, an assistant medical examiner with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, was admitted as an expert in the field of forensic pathology. Dr. Vincenti conducted an autopsy on the victim\u2019s body on December 29, 2007. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>The victim sustained a gunshot wound to the head, and Dr. Vincenti testified that the cause of death was homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Detective Phyall testified about the traffic stop of appellant and Mr. Johnson, advising the jury that the vehicle was stopped between 12:00 and 12:30 p.m., approximately 12 blocks from the scene of the murder. His trial testimony generally was consistent with his testimony at the suppression hearing. Due to the court\u2019s ruling, however, he did not testify regarding the discovery of the handgun in the trunk or the subsequent arrest of appellant and Mr. Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Mr. Michael West testified about a conversation that took place between Mr. Johnson, himself, and appellant. Mr. West was arrested on December 28, 2007, and the next day, December 29, 2007, he was released to the day room in central booking, where he had a conversation with appellant and Mr. Johnson. Mr. West had known Mr. Johnson for approximately fifteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Mr. West testified that Mr. Johnson told him, with appellant standing within \u201carm\u2019s reach,\u201d that he and appellant had murdered the victim, a person Mr. West had known for years. Mr. Johnson told Mr. West that he and appellant were riding on Carlisle Street when they observed the victim. Appellant offered Mr. Johnson $15,000 to kill the victim, and Mr. Johnson replied: \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Appellant gave Mr. Johnson a gun, described by Mr. West as \u201ca nine.\u201d Mr. Johnson exited the car, wearing a black hoodie. He then returned to the vehicle, and placed the gun in the trunk. Appellant and Mr. Johnson drove away, but shortly thereafter, they were pulled over by the police for running a stop sign.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mr. West testified that appellant contributed to the conversation, denying that he ran the stop sign and commenting that, when they were pulled over, the police noticed that Mr. Johnson was visibly nervous.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>After the conversation in central booking, which lasted approximately 45 minutes to one hour, Mr. West contacted Detective Kershaw. He testified that he contacted the police because he \u201chad just found out [his] friend got killed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">That same week, Detective Kershaw picked up Mr. West and brought him to the homicide division. Mr. West identified Mr. Johnson and appellant in separate photo arrays. On the back of the photo array including appellant, Mr. West wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aid-dedup-0\">I know this man from central booking and he told me that he was the driver and the one who gave Row dog the gun that killed (TEE) and he also said he wanted to kill (TEE) his self but Row dog said he [would] do it and told Row dog if he do it he would give him $15[,]000 and he did. Michael West[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Mr. West testified that he was not offered any incentive by the State\u2019s Attorney to testify in this case. Although he was originally detained in the Maryland state system for a handgun violation, his case had been moved to federal court. He had entered into a plea agreement in federal court, where he was facing a sentence of 15 years to life. Mr. West testified that his plea agreement provided that the United States Attorney\u2019s Office could ask for less time if he assisted in the prosecution of others, but Mr. West understood that to mean a sentence in federal court, not state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Following Mr. West\u2019s testimony, the State rested its case. At the close of the State\u2019s case, appellant made a motion for judgment of acquittal on all counts, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction, because there was not sufficient corroboration of his confession to Mr. West. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Appellant did not testify in his own defense. Brendon Hurson, Mr. West\u2019s federal public defender, testified to the plea agreement that Mr. West entered into regarding his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>federal case. He explained that Mr. West entered into a cooperation agreement with the United States Attorney\u2019s Office whereby, based on Mr. West\u2019s cooperation, the government could make a motion to lower the sentencing guideline level in the federal court proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Following Mr. Hurson\u2019s testimony, appellant renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal. The court denied the motion. After jury instructions and closing arguments, the jury found appellant guilty on all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Right to Confrontation</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Appellant contends that the court erred in admitting Mr. West\u2019s testimony regarding statements that Mr. Johnson made to him at central booking. He argues that this testimony should have been excluded because it violated his \u201cright of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">The State contends that this claim is unpreserved for our review. Although conceding that appellant \u201cdid mention his right to confrontation in the context of arguing the inadmissibility of West\u2019s testimony,\u201d it asserts that \u201cthe thrust of his argument was that the testimony violated state rules against the admission of hearsay,\u201d and therefore, we should decline to address appellant\u2019s confrontation claim on appeal. On the merits, the State argues that the admission of Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements did not violate appellant\u2019s right to confrontation for either of two reasons: (1) the statements were not testimonial; and (2) adoptive admissions do not implicate a defendant\u2019s right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">As indicated, the admissibility of Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements to Mr. West, which implicated Mr. Johnson and appellant in the victim\u2019s murder, was addressed at the motions hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>January 23, 2009. Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements constituted inadmissible hearsay. He further argued that admitting these statements would be \u201cin complete violation of the confrontation clause,\u201d explaining that he would not be able to cross-examine Mr. Johnson regarding these statements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The State argued that Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements to Mr. West should be admitted as a tacit admission by appellant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Noting that appellant did not object to Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements to Mr. West about his involvement in the murder, the State argued: \u201c[Njormally if someone\u2019s accusing you of being a participant in a murder[,] [that] would certainly rouse your objection.\u201d Here, not only did appellant fail to object to Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements, he participated in the conversation and added some details. Thus, the State asserted, Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements constituted a tacit admission by appellant, <em>ie. </em>he \u201cwas agreeing with\u201d Mr. West.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Defense counsel argued that Mr. West needed to testify regarding the circumstances surrounding the conversation before the court could make a determination whether Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements could be deemed a tacit admission by appellant. The State arranged for Mr. West to be brought to court.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Mr. West testified to his conversation with Mr. Johnson and \u201cScoop,\u201d who he identified as appellant. He testified, consistent with his trial testimony, that Mr. Johnson told him that appellant pointed out the victim, stated that he would give Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Johnson $15,000 to kill the victim, and gave Mr. Johnson a gun. Mr. Johnson told Mr. West that he walked up behind \u201cT,\u201d shot him in the back of the head, and took off running. He returned to the car, dropped the gun in the trunk, and got in the passenger seat. He and appellant then left and were pulled over by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Mr. West testified that, during the time that Mr. Johnson was talking, \u201cJohnson was sitting down, [appellant] was standing right beside him, and [Mr. West] was standing in front of both of them,\u201d \u201carm-reach\u201d away. At no time did appellant express disagreement with anything Mr. Johnson said. Appellant occasionally participated in the conversation, adding that he provided the gun to Mr. Johnson, that he parked on the street waiting for Mr. Johnson after he killed the victim, and that Mr. Johnson was scared when the police stopped their car.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress Mr. West\u2019s testimony regarding Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements, indicating that the motion had \u201cevolved into the State\u2019s motion to admit the hearsay statements of Mr. Johnson made to witness West at the Baltimore City intake facility.\u201d The court ruled that Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements to Mr. West were admissible as a tacit admission, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">The Court finds, based on Mr. West\u2019s testimony, that Mr. Cox was present and heard the statement. Mr. West\u2019s testimony that Mr. Cox was joining in, adding in information about the statements clearly demonstrates that Mr. Cox heard Mr. Johnson\u2019s statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">Further, Mr. West\u2019s testimony that the men were within arms reach corroborates that even though there may have been noise in the facility Mr. Cox was able to hear the statements of Mr. Johnson. The Court finds that the statements are of a type that a reasonable person in Mr. Cox\u2019s position would have disagreed with the statements. The statements at issue, in essence, are that Mr. Cox solicited Mr. Johnson to murder T by offering him 15,000 dollars, giving him a gun, waiting for him in a vehicle, as Mr. Johnson allegedly went and shot T.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>A reasonable person, the court finds, in Mr. Cox\u2019s position would have objected to these statements being made in the presence of another party as they were statements which clearly implicated Mr. Cox in the offense of murder. In the face of these statements, Mr. Cox not only remained silent he joined in adding details, specifically according to Mr. West\u2019s testimony, Cox offered that he gave Rodney the gun and he was going to park and wait on Bond and Eager after he killed T.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Upon reviewing the <em>Henry [v. State, </em>324 Md. 204, 596 A.2d 1024 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 972, 112 S.Ct. 1590, 118 L.Ed.2d 307 (1992) ] case which is earlier than the commentary in Professor McL[ai]n\u2019s book, the <em>Henry </em>case requires the following!;] That the party heard and understood the other person\u2019s statement; at the time the party had a reasonable opportunity to respond; and under the circumstances a reasonable person in the party\u2019s position who disagreed with the statement would have voiced that disagreement. The facts clearly indicate that Cox had an opportunity to respond, that he heard and understood the statements, and as the Court has already found that he would have disagreed with the statements and failed to do so.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Preservation</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Before addressing the merits, we will address the State\u2019s preservation argument. Although acknowledging that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>appellant \u201cdid mention his right to confrontation\u201d in the circuit court, the State argues that the issue is not preserved because \u201cthe thrust of [appellant\u2019s] argument was that the testimony-violated state rules against the admission of hearsay.\u201d The State cites to <em>Collins v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 582, 602, 884 A.2d 181 (2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 Md. 501, 889 A.2d 418 (2006), in which this Court declined to address an argument regarding the constitutional right to confrontation where the sole argument raised at trial was based on hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The State\u2019s preservation argument is not supported by the record. Appellant clearly raised the issue of his right to confront the witnesses against him. Defense counsel argued that admission of Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements through Mr. West\u2019s testimony would be \u201cin complete violation of the confrontation clause\u201d because he could \u201conly cross examine Mr. West regarding the nature of these statements but not the declarant.\u201d Appellant adequately preserved this issue for appellate review.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Testimonial Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">On the merits, appellant\u2019s claim involves the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which provides that a defendant in a criminal trial has the right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. CONST, amend. VI. It \u201cguarantees a defendant\u2019s right to confront those \u2018who \u201cbear testimony\u201d \u2019 against him.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz v.

For example, in <em>United States v.

The Court held that the admission of the statements did not violate the Confrontation Clause because the statements were not formal statements, and they were not \u201celicited in response to government interrogation whose primary purpose was to establish facts potentially relevant to a criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 976. <em>Accord United States v.

Other jurisdictions, however, have addressed the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">In <em>State v.

The Appellate Court of Connecticut concluded that Ortiz\u2019s silence constituted an admission of guilt. <em>Id. </em>at 258. The court then addressed Ortiz\u2019s argument that permitting this adoptive admission to come into evidence violated his right to confrontation. <em>Id. </em>at 259. The court rejected that argument, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">Here, the defendant adopted Lebel\u2019s statement as his own; thus, the lack of opportunity to cross-examine Lebel does not violate the confrontation clause. <em>See United States v.

An adoptive admission is a statement that the defendant has adopted as his own. Thus the defendant himself is, in effect, the declarant.

A statement admitted as a tacit admission is a statement that the defendant has adopted as his or her own.

In this case, the circuit court held that the gun found in appellant\u2019s trunk was obtained by an illegal search, and it granted appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The exclusionary rule also applies \u201cto evidence that was the indirect product or \u2018fruit\u2019 of police conduct in violation of the fourth amendment.\u201d <em>Ferguson v.

Appellant relies on this authority in support of his contention that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his own statements made to Mr. West at central booking. He argues that his statement was the \u201cfruit\u201d of illegal police conduct, asserting that his arrest was based on the gun found pursuant to the illegal detention and search, and absent his \u201cunlawful arrest, he would never have been in a position to talk to Michael West.\u201d He further posits that \u201cthere is every reason to believe that West was acting as a state agent\u201d and \u201cwas working as an informant for the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The State argues that the motions court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, asserting that appellant\u2019s sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>sequent statement to Mr. West in central booking did not qualify as the fruit of an illegal arrest. It argues that appellant\u2019s statements to Mr. West were \u201cnot even remotely caused by\u201d illegal conduct, noting that they were \u201cseparated from the arrest in both time and circumstance\u201d and were \u201cnot instigated by the police or any other state actor.\u201d The State contends that, \u201cwhether it be based on attenuation or independent source, it was entirely proper for the motions court to conclude that Cox\u2019s admission to West was not a fruit of the asserted illegality.\u201d With respect to appellant\u2019s claim that appellant was a state actor, the State argues that appellant\u2019s failure to assert this argument below precludes him from advancing this argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">In denying appellant\u2019s motion, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">I have reviewed <em>Gibson versus State, </em>138 Md.App. 399 [771 A.2d 536 (2001),] and I, unfortunately I don\u2019t find [appellant\u2019s trial counsel] any support for the conclusion that but for the illegal detention and subsequent arrest of the Defendant he would not have been in the company of Mr. West at the central booking facility therefore his independent decision to make statements to Mr. West is covered by the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">The Court finds first as a fact that Michael West is not a law enforcement officer and that this was not a statement given in any way that could be characterized to a law enforcement since he\u2019s nothing but a citizen himself detained at the central booking facility. Additionally, the Court finds as argued by the State that the but for test with respect to the fruit of the poisonous tree has specifically been denounced, not substantiated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">The <em>Gibson </em>case sets forth in documents that the but for test is simply not the test....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">In this case, the conversation between Michael West and the Defendant in no way intrudes on the Defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights as the Court has found that Michael West is a private citizen. The Court further finds that as [the Prosecutor] argued the but for test is not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>applicable test and that in this case the decision to talk to Mr. West was an independent decision not related in any way to any illegal or unlawful contact by the Baltimore City Police Department and that this decision simply places Mr. Cox\u2019s statements to Mr. West outside of the ambit of the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">When reviewing the circuit court\u2019s ruling denying a motion to suppress, we \u201c \u2018consider only the facts and information contained in the record of the suppression hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v.

The attenuation doctrine is a method to determine \u201cwhether there exists a strong enough causal connection between the primary taint and the challenged evidence to require the exclusion of that information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286, 909 A.2d 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">In <em>Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 603-04, 95 S.Ct. 2254, the Supreme Court set forth a three-part test to consider in an attenuation analysis. The factors include: \u201c1) the proximity between the actual illegality and the evidence sought to be suppressed; 2) the presence of intervening factors; and 3) the flagrancy of the governmental misconduct involved in the case.\u201d <em>Miles, </em>365 Md. at 522, 781 A.2d 787. No single factor is dispositive; rather, the court must balance the factors in the attenuation analysis. <em>Cox v. State, </em>397 Md. 200, 219, 916 A.2d 311 (2007) (citing <em>Ferguson, </em>301 Md. at 553, 483 A.2d 1255).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">We begin our analysis with the first factor, \u201cthe proximity between the actual illegality and the evidence sought to be suppressed.\u201d <em>Miles, </em>365 Md. at 522, 781 A.2d 787. There is no \u201c \u2018mathematically precise test for determining at what point the taint has been purged by the lapse of time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527, 781 A.2d 787 (quoting <em>Ferguson, </em>301 Md. at 550, 483 A.2d 1255). This factor suggests, however, \u201cthat the greater the time lapse between the illegality and discovery of evidence, the greater the chance that the taint has been purged.\u201d <em>Cox, </em>397 Md. at 218, 916 A.2d 311. In <em>Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 604-05, 95 S.Ct. 2254, a confession made less than two hours after the unlawful arrest was found not to be sufficiently attenuated, and in <em>Ferguson, </em>301 Md. at 550, 483 A.2d 1255, a twenty minute lapse between an illegal arrest and an extrajudicial identification was found to be an insufficient amount of time to purge the taint of the initial illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Here, appellant\u2019s statements to Mr. West did not occur within minutes or hours after the illegal arrest. Rather, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>occurred the next day, after appellant had been removed from the scene of the traffic stop and taken to central booking.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In <em>United States v. Lopez-Garcia, </em>565 F.3d 1306, 1315 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1012, 175 L.Ed.2d 620 (2009), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit addressed a statement made the day after an alleged illegal arrest.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">To be sure, there is no hard-and-fast rule for determining how much time must have passed before the link between an unlawful arrest and a confession can be considered sufficiently attenuated. Nevertheless, we have said that [i]f only a short period of time has passed, a court is more likely to consider the consent as a \u201cpoisonous fruit\u201d of the illegal act. Thus, we have observed that the amount of time found sufficient to meet the temporal proximity factor ranges from immediate or \u2018close in time,\u2019 to three minutes, to two hours.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgY\"><em>Id. </em>(citations and quotations omitted). Because Lopez-Garcia\u2019s statements \u201cwere not made until the day after the arrest,\u201d the court concluded that \u201chis statements were too attenuated from his arrest to be regarded as fruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">Other courts similarly have found that a lapse of time of one day, or even less, between the \u201cprimary illegality\u201d and a subsequent statement, is a sufficient lapse of time to dissipate the taint of the illegal conduct. <em>See State v. Blackman, </em>246 Conn. 547, 716 A.2d 101, 106 (1998) (incriminating statements made approximately 14 hours after the motor vehicle stop \u201clacked temporal proximity to the allegedly illegal police action\u201d); <em>State v. Serrato, </em>424 So.2d 214, 218 (La.1982) (temporal proximity of the illegal arrest and the confession made more than 21 hours later \u201cwas fairly distant\u201d); <em>State v. Belton, </em>150 N.H. 741, 846 A.2d 526, 533 (24 hours between illegal detention and incriminating statements was a \u201csignificant period of time which reduces the possibility that the defendant\u2019s state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ments were the product of the illegal detention as opposed to his own free will\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1028, 125 S.Ct. 674, 160 L.Ed.2d 509 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Appellant\u2019s statements here were made approximately twenty hours after the illegal arrest. This lapse of time was long enough to support a finding that the statements were \u201c \u2018sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 602, 95 S.Ct. 2254 (quoting <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 486, 83 S.Ct. 407). Accordingly, the temporal proximity factor weighs in favor of a finding that the statement was sufficiently attenuated from the initial illegality that it need not be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The second factor is the presence of intervening circumstances. The Court of Appeals has explained that \u201c \u2018[a]n intervening circumstance is an event that breaks the causal connection between the unlawful conduct and the derivative evidence.\u2019\u201d <em>Myers, </em>395 Md. at 288, 909 A.2d 1048 (quoting <em>Ferguson, </em>301 Md. at 551, 483 A.2d 1255).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The Court of Appeals stated that \u201cthe voluntariness of a person\u2019s actions in providing evidence or testimony should be considered as an intervening factor under the attenuation doctrine.\u201d <em>Miles, </em>365 Md. at 525, 781 A.2d 787. Here, appellant\u2019s statements were made voluntarily to another inmate in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Other courts have found that a statement made voluntarily to an inmate was a sufficient intervening factor to support a finding that the statement was not the fruit of an illegal arrest. <em>State v. Ostroski, </em>201 Conn. 534, 518 A.2d 915, 922-23 (1986), is instructive. In that case, the Supreme Court of Connecticut considered whether Ostroski\u2019s confession to his friend, and fellow inmate, was the fruit of an illegal arrest. <em>Id. </em>The court weighed the three attenuation factors and found that there were \u201csignificant intervening events which substantially broke the causal connection between the illegal arrest and the defendant\u2019s admission,\u201d the most important of which was Ostroski\u2019s decision to voluntarily confess to his friend. <em>Id. </em>at 922. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>[T]he defendant\u2019s voluntary conduct in admitting the killing to his friend was not the product of police exploitation of any prior illegality but was a totally unexpected voluntary admission by the defendant. Allen was not an agent of the police, nor is there any claim that he was. Allen had been the defendant\u2019s friend for a period of time prior to this episode. Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot say that the admission to Allen was \u201c \u2018come at by exploitation of [the] illegality.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 923 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Similarly, in <em>United States v. Houle, </em>620 F.2d 164, 165-66 (8th Cir.1980), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit addressed whether statements Houle made to his cellmates two hours after his arrest were \u201csufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint of the illegal arrest.\u201d In holding that the statements were admissible, the court noted that \u201cHoule\u2019s statements were not prompted by coercion or interrogation and were voluntarily made under circumstances within Houle\u2019s control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Appellant\u2019s voluntary conduct here, in making statements about the crime to another inmate, were not prompted by the police, but instead were made during a casual conversation with another inmate.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The voluntariness of appellant\u2019s action constitutes an intervening factor that weighs in favor of attenuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>The final factor is the purpose and flagrancy of the government misconduct. \u201cThis factor effectuates the deterrence policy of the exclusionary rule by providing an incentive for police to engage in lawful conduct.\u201d <em>Ferguson, </em>301 Md. at 552, 483 A.2d 1255. Here, the police conduct was not flagrant. Nor did the detention and arrest have \u201ca quality of purposefulness\u201d that weighed in favor of exclusion of the subsequent statement. <em>Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 605, 95 S.Ct. 2254. The purpose of the initial detention and arrest was not to obtain the statement that appellant subsequently made to Mr. West in central booking about a different crime. <em>See Ostroski, </em>518 A.2d at 923 (purpose of continued detention was not \u201cto acquire a totally unexpected, voluntary admission by the defendant to his friend Allen\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Weighing the three favors in the attenuation analysis leads to the conclusion that appellant\u2019s statements were sufficiently attenuated to dissipate the taint of the illegal detention and arrest. The statements, which were made the day after the arrest, were not the product of police exploitation of the illegal arrest. Rather, they were an unexpected voluntary admission during a conversation with another inmate in jail. The trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress his statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. Specifically, he argues that, because Mr. West\u2019s testimony involved his direct and tacit admissions, his conviction can be upheld only if there was corroborating evidence. Appellant asserts, however, that \u201cthere was no evidence, but for Michael West\u2019s testimony, that [he] committed the crimes charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">The State argues that the evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s convictions. It maintains that appellant\u2019s extrajudicial confession was adequately corroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we must determine, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, if \u201c\u2018any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burlas v. State, </em>185 Md.App. 559, 568, 971 A.2d 937 (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 Md. 166, 978 A.2d 245 (2009). If the evidence \u201c \u2018showed directly, or circumstantially, or supported a rational inference of facts which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt[,]\u2019 then we will affirm the conviction.\u201d <em>Bible v. State, </em>411 Md. 138, 156, 982 A.2d 348 (2009) (quoting <em>State v. Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 750, 720 A.2d 323 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The parties agree that \u201c \u2018an extrajudicial confession of guilt by a person accused of crime, unsupported by other evidence, is not sufficient to warrant a conviction.\u2019 \u201d Woods <em>v. State, </em>315 Md. 591, 615-16, 556 A.2d 236 (1989) (quoting <em>Bradbury v. State, </em>233 Md. 421, 424, 197 A.2d 126 (1964)). A defendant\u2019s confession must \u201c \u2018be supported by evidence, independent of the confession, which relates to and tends to establish the <em>corpus delicti, i.e., </em>the facts that are necessary to show that a crime has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bradbury, </em>233 Md. at 424, 197 A.2d 126).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The corroboration required, however, may be \u201csmall in amount,\u201d and it must show only the \u201cmajor or essential harm involved in the charged offense.\u201d <em>Riggins v. State, </em>155 Md.App. 181, 214, 215, 843 A.2d 115 (quotation and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>381 Md. 676, 851 A.2d 595 (2004). The corroborating evidence need not \u201c \u2018be full and complete\u2019 \u201d or \u201c\u2018establish the truth of the <em>corpus delicti </em>either beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance of proof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller v. State, </em>380 Md. 1, 46, 843 A.2d 803 (2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In <em>Woods, </em>the Court of Appeals noted that proof of the <em>corpus delecti </em>in a'murder case, \u201c \u2018is sufficient if it establishes the fact that the person for whose death the prosecution was instituted is dead, and that the death occurred under cireum-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>stances which indicate that it was caused criminally by someone.\u2019 \u201d 315 Md. at 617, 556 A.2d 236 (quoting <em>Jones v. </em>State, 188 Md. 263, 272, 52 A.2d 484 (1947)). <em>Accord Ballard v. State, </em>333 Md. 567, 578, 636 A.2d 474 (1994) (\u201c[I]n a homicide case, the <em>corpus delicti </em>consists of proof that the victim died and that the death was caused by a criminal act, but it need not tend to connect the defendant on trial with that act.\u201d); <em>Riggins, </em>155 Md.App. at 211-12, 843 A.2d 115 <em>(\u201cThe corpus delicti </em>of the crime of murder is ordinarily established through the presence of the victim\u2019s body and by direct evidence establishing that death resulted from criminal activity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">In <em>Woods, </em>315 Md. at 617, 556 A.2d 236, the Court affirmed Woods\u2019 conviction for murder stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">In his confession Woods admitted that he shot Michael Boyd \u201cthree or four times\u201d at point blank range in consummation of a plan to kill Boyd. This admission was corroborated as required with respect to the corpus delicti of murder in the first degree. Evidence apart from the confession established that Michael Boyd was indeed dead. His body was found. A doctor in the Department of Post Mortem Examiners testified that the cause of death was \u201cthe gunshot wounds.\u201d [ ] The gunshot wounds were enough to show that the manner of death was homicide \u2014 that Boyd\u2019s death was not by accident or suicide but was caused criminally by someone. With this corroboration the confession was enough to meet the test for the sufficiency of evidence to sustain the conviction of murder in the first degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Here, there similarly was sufficient evidence to corroborate appellant\u2019s extrajudicial confession to Mr. West. Appellant\u2019s admissions regarding the murder were corroborated by evidence that the victim was dead, as well as by Dr. Vincenti\u2019s testimony that the cause of death was homicide. Moreover, the admission that Mr. Johnson used a gun, which was described as a \u201cnine,\u201d was corroborated by the discovery of a 9-millimeter cartridge casing at the scene of the murder. The evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.

At the beginning of the motions hearing, appellant's counsel discussed the plea agreement that the State had offered appellant ten days earlier. In exchange for appellant pleading guilty to being an accessory after the fact, and on the condition that appellant testify against Mr. Johnson, the State would recommend a sentence of five years with parole. As an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>additional part of the agreement, appellant would receive five years for a pending violation of probation charge, which would run concurrent with the sentence of five years on the conviction as an accessory after the fact.

Mr. Smith subsequently testified that he heard the radio broadcast at 12:53 p.m.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\">. After appellant was taken to central booking, Detective Phyall issued citations for not wearing a seatbelt and for running a stop sign.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b660-8\">. Before argument began, the State entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>on the charged crime of conspiracy to commit murder. Mr. Johnson, appellant's former co-defendant, had been tried prior to appellant, and he had been found not guilty on all charges relating to the murder of the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b660-9\">. Counsel was referring to \u201cthe fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine,\u201d which is \"an aspect of the exclusionary rule, a judicially-imposed sanction for violations of the fourth amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures in state prosecutions.\u201d <em>Ferguson v. State, </em>301 Md. 542, 548 n. 2, 483 A.2d 1255 (1984). This doctrine provides for the exclusion of \"evidence that was the indirect product or \u2018fruit\u2019 of police conduct in violation of the fourth amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548, 483 A.2d 1255.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b662-7\">. As explained <em>infra, </em>the court precluded Mr. West from testifying to Mr. Johnson\u2019s statement that he shot the victim in the back of the head because appellant, who was sitting in his car when the alleged shooting took place, did not have first-hand knowledge of this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b663-9\">. Mr. West testified that \"TEE\u201d referred to the victim, Todd Dargan. In Mr. West's testimony, he referred to Mr. Johnson as \"Rod Dog,\u201d \u201cRow dog,\u201d and Roger.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b665-8\">. Counsel stated that it was his understanding that Mr. Johnson had a \"Fifth Amendment right at this point to remain silent because he has pending charges associated with the handgun that was retrieved in this case.\u201d As indicated, however, Mr. Johnson had been acquitted of all charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b665-9\">. The State also argued that Mr. Johnson's statements were admissible as a statement of a co-conspirator. The trial court rejected that argument, finding that the statements were not made in furtherance of a conspiracy, but \u201cwere, at best, statements in which the individuals were bragging about a completed crime.\u201d The State has not challenged this finding on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b667-9\">. The court ruled, however, that Mr. West could not testify to Mr. Johnson\u2019s statement that he shot the victim in the back of the head. The court explained that <em>\u201cHenry </em>also requires that the party must have had first-hand knowledge of the matter addressed,\u201d and \"Mr. Cox did not have first-hand knowledge of ... Mr. Johnson\u2019s conduct after he left Cox\u2019s car and went away from Cox where he walked up upon T and allegedly shot him in the back of the head and then returned to the car.\u201d Accordingly, the court excluded \u201cthat portion of Mr. Johnson's statements that he actually confessed to murdering T out of the presence of Mr. Cox.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b668-12\">.

The court ultimately concluded that the stop and arrest were constitutional. <em>United States v. Lopez-Garcia, </em>565 F.3d 1306, 1315 (2009).
