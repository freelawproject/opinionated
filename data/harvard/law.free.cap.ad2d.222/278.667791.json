Were we to review it, we would find that the court\u2019s instructions, considered as a whole, did not require proof of an extended taking, which is not a requisite element of the crime under Penal Law \u00a7 160.00.</p>\n<p id=\"Aasm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The proof at trial was sufficient to establish that the victim suffered \"physical injury\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 10.00 [93). The victim testified that the scuffle with defendant resulted in his sustaining a \"split lip\u201d and a \"swollen\u201d mouth, lasting almost a week, and causing him \"sharp\u201d pain which made it difficult for him to eat. He also received a cut over his left eye, which had moderate swelling, and caused him \"pain like a headache\u201d which was \"sharp.\u201d This evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant suffered \"substantial pain\u201d (see, <em>People v Valentine, </em>212 AD2d 399, <em>Iv denied </em>85 NY2d 944; <em>People v Mack, </em>210 AD2d 70, <em>Iv denied </em>85 NY2d 911), and \"impairment of physical condition\u201d (see, <em>People v Bogan, </em>70 NY2d 860).
