Material evidence is described in the opinion. The circumstances of the interruption of the argument of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, referred to in the opinion, were stated in the record as follows: \"During the argument for the plaintiff, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney said, \u2018The only witness to testify as to speed was the defendant.\u2019 Defendant\u2019s counsel said \u2018I object.\u2019 The court \u2018There is no occa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>sion for the interruption.\u2019 To which statement of the court the defendant reserved an exception. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel, continuing his argument then said, \u2019No witness testified as to speed except the defendant and a man standing two hundred feet away.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-4\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant moved that a verdict be ordered in his favor.

These facts could be found: The plaintiff, who was conveying a party of eight soldiers from Camp Devens to Boston, in his automobile, was proceeding easterly on Broadway, in Cambridge. He was on his right hand side of the street, near the curb as he approached Boardman Street, which enters Broadway from the south. His attention being attracted by a woman with a child he sounded his horn, and slowed down, so that he was moving only from five to eight miles an hour when he was passing the intersection of the two streets. The defendant\u2019s truck, which with its load weighed more than eight and a half tons, was coming along Broadway from the direction of Boston, westerly, and in the car tracks. The driver of the truck, without giving any signal, suddenly turned to his left, cut short and went just in front of the plaintiff\u2019s car, making the collision inevitable. The accident occurred at about four o\u2019clock in the afternoon of January 30, 1919; and there was no traffic on either street other than the two automobiles. The facts bring the case within the general rule, that when a collision occurs at intersecting streets between automobiles, the issues of the plaintiff\u2019s due care and the defendant\u2019s negligence ordinarily present questions of fact for the jury. <em>Salisbury </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, ante, </em>430, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">We are not prepared to say there was harmful error in the remark of the judge, made when the defendant\u2019s counsel interrupted the closing argument of counsel for the plaintiff. Apparently the latter had not then finished what he had to say as to the testimony about speed. In any event the trial judge in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>charge recalled to the attention of the jury all the evidence on that subject. <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Greeley, </em>162 Mass. 273. <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Dow, </em>182 Mass. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
