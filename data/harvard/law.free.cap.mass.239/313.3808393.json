The corporation then sublet the premises as permitted by its lease and thereafter, when there were still unexpired over seven years of the term of the lease, the corporation was dissolved by special act of the Legislature, all its debts having been paid and its only asset being the lease and there being but two nominal and one real stockholder. The owner did not learn of the dissolution until more than three years and nine months thereafter. In the meantime the rent reserved by the lease had been paid promptly each month by the sole stockholder in interest either by indorsement to the owner of a check of the subtenant or by a check bearing the signature of the lessee corporation signed by the sole stockholder in interest as treasurer, and the rent continued to be so paid and received for several months when the owner, learning of the dissolution of the corporation and discovering that a lease of the premises might be made at an advance in rent, contended that upon the expiration of three years from the dissolution of the corporation the lease was terminated and asserted a right to make a new lease independently of the rights of the sole stockholder in interest.

This court, having decided that the ruling that the lease was terminated was erroneous, <em>held, </em>that the only entry that could be ordered by this court on the record was, judgment for the sole stockholder in interest, the question, whether the matter should be recommitted and the arbitrator instructed to state definitely the amount due to the sole stockholder in interest so that a money judgment may be entered in his favor, not being before this court on the record.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-3\">Arbitrament under R.

The tenancy was to begin October 1, 1913, and to expire September 30, 1923. The stipulated annual rental was $12,400.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-3\">On May 23, 1913, Paine and the Chalmers Motor Company, a Michigan corporation, entered into an agreement providing that the Chalmers Motor Company should become the tenant of the premises under the lease above referred to in case the WhittenGilmore Company should for any reason cease before the expiration of the ten years to be the tenant. The original lease did not permit the tenant to assign but did permit the tenant to sublet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-4\">On May 5,1913, Charles Paine assigned his interest in the original lease and in the agreement of May 23, 1913, to Henry M. Williams, Ezra H. Baker and Philip R. Hovey, trustees of the Cummington Realty Associates.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-5\">For some time after the original lease was entered into the Whitten-Gilmore Company either paid the rent from its own funds or collected the rent from the Chalmers Motor Company of Massachusetts and sent its check to Williams, the managing trustee of the Cummington Realty Associates. On July 31, 1914, the Whitten-Gilmore Company notified Williams as follows: \u201c This letter will advise you that from this date the Chalmers Motor Company becomes the tenant for the remainder of the term of the lease according to memorandum of agreement attached to the lease.\u201d This reference was to the memorandum of May 23, 1913, referred to above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-6\">It was the intention at this time of the Whitten-Gilmore Company, of which the defendant Charles E. Whitten was the treasurer, to end its obligation under the lease and substitute the Chalmers Motor Company. On August 5, 1914, Williams, for the trustees, wrote to the Whitten-Gilmore Company declining to accept a cancellation of the lease or an assignment of it to the Chalmers Motor Company,of Massachusetts unless a bond of substantial amount was given to the trustees to secure the payment of the rent, or unless a payment of $2,000 in cash was made for the privilege of making the transfer. The letter contained the following paragraph: \u201cIf you do not care to make this arrange<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ment and make a sub-lease to the Chalmers Motor Company of Massachusetts we shall take such measures as are necessary to see that the Whitten-Gilmore Company continues in existence and that its assets are not dissipated until after the lease shall have terminated and its obligation to us at an end.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-4\">In August of 1914 Williams at the request of the Chalmers Motor Company prepared a sublease to the Chalmers Motor Company of Massachusetts from the Whitten-Gilmore Company, which was executed and delivered by the parties on or about August 1, 1914, was to run for nine years, one month and twenty-nine days from its date and was to expire September 29, 1923. The rental was $12,400 a year, the same amount provided in the original lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-5\">In the years 1916-1917, Williams, acting for the Associates, learned that there were some changes taking place in the organization of the Chalmers Motor Company (not the Chalmers Motor Company of Massachusetts), and had some correspondence with the officers of that company at Detroit with the intention of finding out whether the tenant then occupying the premises under the sublease was likely to continue as a tenant. \u201c The Whitten-Gilmore Company had then ceased to do anything with relation to the property but collect the rent from the sub-tenant and send it each month to Williams, sometimes sending the check of the \u25a0Whitten-Gilmore Company, sometimes the check of the subtenant.\u201d The subtenant changed from time to time and the premises were occupied in succession by the Chalmers Motor Company of Massachusetts, Chalmers Motor Company of New England, and the C. E. Fay-Alien Company. The rent was at all times paid promptly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-6\">On February 21, 1916, the Whitten-Gilmore Company with its own consent was dissolved by the Legislature, Spec. St. 1916, c. 112. The dissolution was in the usual form, and the provisions of the Massachusetts statute to keep a corporation alive for certain purposes for a term of three years are applicable. The dissolution was not known to any of the trustees of the Associates until about October 28,1919, or after the three years had expired.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-7\">Whitten and the estate of Ernest A. Gilmore, who had died, then and at all times owned all of the stock of the Whitten-Gilmore Company and own it at the present .time. The fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Whitten-Gilmore Company had been dissolved was known to Whitten but he did not communicate the information to any of the trustees but continued at all times to collect the rent of the subtenant, at that time the C. E. Fay-Alien Company, and to remit it promptly to the trustees. Checks payable to the WhittenGilmore Company he indorsed over as treasurer to the Cummington Associates just as he had done before the dissolution. In this respect and in all other respects, unless the corporation\u2019s dissolution is a cancellation of the lease, the Whitten-Gilmore Company complied with its terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-3\">On March 8, 1917, the Chalmers Motor Company of Massachusetts was also dissolved by the Legislature in the usual form. Spec. St. 1917, c. 157. The Michigan company known as the Chalmers Motor Company was also dissolved in Michigan under date of January 3, 1918.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-4\">\u201c It was admitted that during the period 1914-1919 the WhittenGilmore Company made several attempts to be relieved of further liability under the lease and that its officers and stockholders would have been glad to be relieved by having the lease cancelled, or by having a sub-tenant accepted as a new lessee. It is also agreed that the trustees of the Associates were aware of this desire on the part of the Whitten-Gilmore Company to cancel the lease and the trustees declined to permit it to be cancelled, and intended at all times to hold the Whitten-Gilmore Company. This intention they expressed to the Company on at least two occasions. In other words, the attitude of the trustees continued to be that expressed in Williams\u2019 letter of August 5,1914, above referred to in this report.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-5\">In the spring of 1920 the C. E. Fay-Alien Company, the occupant of the premises, moved. This removal had been previously planned by the latter company and one of its officers had notified Mr. Williams of the intended removal. Before it actually took place, however, Williams, for the trustees, wrote the C.E.Fay-Allen Company under date of December 27,1919, notifying it to quit the premises March 1,1920. This letter contained the statement that, the trustees would look solely to the C. E. Fay-Alien Company for the rent. The company is described in the letter as a\u201c tenant at will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-6\">The removal of the C. E. Fay-Alien Company left the premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>unoccupied. The rent at the rate required by the old lease was paid in the way above described to May 15, 1920. This left an unexpired balance of the term of the original lease of three years, four months and fifteen days with the Whitten-Gilmore Company dissolved and the building physically unoccupied;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEM\">\u201c At the time that the C. E. Fay-Alien Company moved from the building the trustees had known for some months that the WhittenGilmore Company had been dissolved. Just when they learned of the dissolution did not appear but it was prior to December 27,1919. At about the time of the removal a new party appeared and offered to take a lease of the premises at an increase in the rental over the $12,400 paid up to that time of $2,775 a year. This figure is the result of a computation made necessary by the fact that the new lease covers other space in addition to that covered by the original lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-4\"><em>\u201c </em>The parties to this action had now shifted their positions. The trustees claimed that the dissolution of the Whitten-Gilmore Company operated as a cancellation of the lease so that the trustees were entitled to make a new lease and take advantage for themselves of the additional rental. The stockholders of the Whitten-Gilmore Company claimed that it was too late for the trustees to take this position and that they were entitled to sub-let to the new tenant. The stockholders further claimed that by the operation of law the corporation\u2019s interest in the lease as an ass\u201eet of the company had become the property of the stockholders and that they were, therefore, entitled to continue as tenants, sub-let to the new tenant, pay the old rental and keep the annual difference of about $2,775.\u201d They further pointed out that under the agreement of May 23, 1913, between Paine and the Chalmers Motor, Company (of Detroit), if the lease became inoperative, the Chalmers Motor Company (of Detroit) became the tenant for the balance of the term. \u201c The parties thereupon agreed, without prejudice, to the making by the trustees of a lease to the new tenant at the increased rental and submitted the questions growing out of the facts above found to arbitration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\"><em>\u201c </em>It is agreed that the amount of money involved is the additional rental for'the period from May 15,1920, to September 30,1923, the expiration of the original lease, and that it may be taken for the ' purpose of the arbitration as $231.25 per month, or for the period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>$9,365. By the terms of the agreement for arbitration (see paragraph fourth) the plaintiffs may, however, in the event of a decision against them, discharge their obligations in full by paying \u2018such difference or increase in said rental value when and as received.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-3\">\u201c It is admitted that no formal instrument conveying the rights of the Whitten-Gilmore Company under the original lease to its .stockholders or any one else was ever executed or delivered, and there was no evidence that the corporation or its directors ever at .any meeting passed any vote or votes attempting to dispose to anybody of the corporation\u2019s interest in the lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-4\">\u201c I am unable to find that the conduct of the parties constituted a surrender of the lease. In other words, I find no agreement on the part of the tenant to abandon and on the part of the landlord to resume possession of the demised premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-5\">\u201c The agreement for arbitration contains, among others, three stipulations that should be noticed: (1) The rights of Whitten .shall be considered and adjudicated as of March 4, 1920, and (2) as if he had commenced such proceedings at law or in equity as were open to bim on that date, and (3) they shall include those rights which would have been possessed by or preserved by the appointment of a receiver of the Chalmers Motor Company of Massachusetts, and such rights and benefits as such receiver if appointed could have obtained. There is nothing in the agreement which specifically preserves such rights as might have been or might now be secured for him by the appointment of a receiver of the tenant corporation the Whitten-Gilmore Company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-6\">The arbitrator made rulings of law, subject to confirmation or reversal by the court, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-7\">\u201c I rule that the expiration of the three years after the dissolution of the corporation terminated the lease and that the trustees were therefore free to make a new one with a new tenant and retain the proceeds.\u201d Contingent upon the foregoing ruling being incorrect, he ruled that, if there were any rights remaining in the tenant, there being no evidence of any unpaid debts, Whitten succeeded to and became the owner of them; and that, except through a receiver of the Whitten-Gilmore Company, Whitten \u2022could not enforce the rights of stockholders in the lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-8\">By order of <em>Wait, </em>J., the \u201caward\u201d of the arbitrator was \u201cac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>cepted\u201d and, at the request of the parties, the case was reported to this court for determination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-3\">St. 1903, c. 437, \u00a7\u00a7 52, 53, 54 (see now G.

If he has, may he enforce them in these proceedings ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">The arbitrator under the first question ruled, \u201cthat the expiration of the three years after the dissolution of the corporation terminated the lease and that the trustees were therefore free to make a new one with a new tenant and retain the proceeds.\u201d We are of opinion that the ruling was wrong. The rent secured by the lease has been punctually paid, after as well as before dissolution, and accepted by the plaintiff who succeeded to the reversion. It is expressly found that before dissolution the lessee, hereafter called the corporation, sought to be relieved from further liability by cancellation of the lease, but the plaintiff declined to cancel, and \u201cintended at all times\u201d to hold the lessee. The plaintiff\u2019s ignorance of the dissolution until three years and nine months had elapsed, when it contended that the lease had been abrogated by operation of law and it was entitled to relet the premises, is of no consequence. If the lease had thus been terminated, the subsequent payment and acceptance of rent without knowledge of the dissolution could not deprive the plaintiff of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>its legal rights. The lessee was a domestic corporation and although dissolved by Spec. St.' 1916, c. 112, all debts had been paid and its only asset was the lease in question, the unexpired term of which of over three years was valuable, because the lessee-could sublet at a large advance over the rent reserved. The arbitrator having reported that he is \u201c unable to find that the conduct of the parties constituted a surrender of the lease,\u201d and \u201c I find no agreement on the part of the tenant to abandon and on the part of the landlord to resume possession of the demised premises,\u201d these findings of fact are conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\">The plaintiff\u2019s principal argument, however, is, that upon dissolution the leasehold estate at once reverted. The arbitrator rested his decision on <em>Hastings Corp. </em>v. <em>Letton, </em>[1908]] 1 K. B.. 378, which is strongly relied on by the plaintiff. It was there held that a lease to a corporation for a term of years terminated if the corporation was dissolved without having assigned the lease, and the reversion accordingly was accelerated and the premises reverted to the lessor. It does not appear that the question of the equitable rights of the stockholders was raised or considered. The question determined was, whether, under the circumstances, the corporation and lessee having ceased to exist, its rights went to the crown or to the lessor. We are unable to assume that the lease in the case at bar contained an implied condition, that it should determine if the corporation did not survive the term. It was said in <em>Folger </em>v. <em>Columbian Ins. Co. </em>99 Mass. 267, 276, 277, \u201cthe dissolution of a corporation cannot deprive its creditors or stockholders of their rights in its property; and if the common law affords them no adequate remedy, they may obtain relief in equity. <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>18 How. 480, 485-487, and cases cited. <em>Lum </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>6 Wall. 277.\u201d The governing principle is also well stated in <em>Mormon Church </em>v. <em>United States, </em>136 U. S. 1, 47, \u201cWhen a business corporation, instituted for the purposes of gain, or private interest, is dissolved, the modern doctrine is, that its property, after payment of its debts, equitably belongs to its stockholders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">If the charter had been repealed, the obligation of the corporation\u2019s contracts during its existence would not have been impaired, nor the stockholders estopped from asserting their rights against its property in accordance with the general principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>and practice in equity. <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>Marginal Freight </em>Railway, 123 Mass. 32, 34, and cases cited. The result is the same upon dissolution. <em>Allen-Foster-Willett Co. petitioner, </em>227 Mass. 551, 556. It is settled, that upon dissolution, all debts having been paid and discharged and no receiver having been appointed, the corporation\u2019s property of every description then belongs to the different stockholders as tenants or owners in common. It is a trust fund which equity will protect for their benefit. <em>Folger </em>v. <em>Columbian Ins. Co., supra. Thornton </em>v. <em>Marginal Freight Railway, supra. Allen-Foster-Willett Co. petitioner, supra. Bacon </em>v. <em>Robertson, supra. Detroit </em>v. <em>Detroit Citizens Street Railway, </em>184 U. S. 368, 394. <em>Minneapolis </em>v. <em>Minneapolis Street Railway, </em>215 U. S. 417, 430. 7 R. C. L. Corporations, \u00a7 750, and cases cited in note 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\">The plaintiff cites <em>Boston Tow Boat Co. </em>v. <em>Medford National Bank, 228 </em>Mass. 484. But, that action having been brought more than three years after dissolution of the plaintiff corporation, it was held that, having ceased to exist even for purposes of litigation, 'no decree could be entered for or against it. It is not an authority supporting the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the leasehold estate ceased to exist both at law and in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">It follows that by operation of law the stockholders as owners in common have succeeded to the title and interest of the corporation, subject however to all the obligations imposed on the lessee by the terms of the lease, and can enforce those rights by proceedings in equity where appropriate relief can be decreed. The provisions of R. L. c. 109, \u00a7\u00a7 53, 54, as codified in St. 1903, c. 437, \u00a7\u00a7 52, 53 (see now G. L.c. 155, \u00a7\u00a7 51, 52), are not applicable, as more than three years have expired since the date of dissolution. <em>Allen-Foster-Willett Co. petitioner, </em>227 Mass. 551, 556. See <em>Boston Tow Boat Co. </em>v. <em>Medford National Bank, 228 </em>Mass. 484; <em>S. C. </em>232 Mass. 38, 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The plaintiff not being entitled to prevail, the remaining question is, what measure of relief can be accorded the defendant. The premises under agreement of parties have been sublet, the rent being received and held by the plaintiff under a stipulation in the agreement incorporated in the reference to the arbitrator, which reads as follows: \u201c It is further agreed that if it shall appear that said Whitten in behalf of himself or of the interests he represents (and it is agreed that included among those interests are the estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>of . . . Ernest A. Gilmore and the joint interest of said Whitten and said Gilmore as partners or otherwise as their rights may appear) is entitled to hold said premises by virtue of the existing state of things . . . and so is entitled at law or in equity to a just proportion of the difference or increase in rental value . . . the said trustees,\u201d meaning the plaintiff, \u201c undertake to pay such difference or increase in said rental value to said Whitten when and as received. If said Whitten is not so entitled the said trustees may retain such increased rental received by them for their own use as such trustees.\u201d It is urged that under the immediately preceding stipulation, \u201c The said trustees agree that the rights of said Whitten and of the interests he represents shall be considered and adjudicated for all purposes as of March 4, 1920, with the same force and effect as if he had commenced such proceedings at law'or in equity as were open to him on said date and had by appropriate proceedings preserved such rights as he then had, including those which would have been possessed by or preserved by the appointment of a receiver of the Chalmers Motor Company of Massachusetts under and by virtue of St. 1903, c. 437, as amended, and that there shall inure to said Whitten such rights or benefits as such receiver, if he had been successfully applied for and had been appointed, could have obtained by appropriate proceedings including the extension in point of time of the existence of said Chalmers Motor Company of Massachusetts by appropriate order of court,\u201d the defendant can be given relief to the same extent as if he had brought a bill in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\">The submission is in the form prescribed by R. L. c. 194, \u00a7 2 (see now G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 2), which embraces by \u00a7 1 not only controversies which might be the subject of a personal action at law, but of a suit in equity, and, under \u00a7 10, when accepted and confirmed by the court, \u201c judgment shall be rendered thereon as upon a like award by referees.\u201d The award therefore must be such that a judgment can be rendered upon it which can be enforced by the trial court. <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>1 Cush. 389, 390. The award has been accepted, but not confirmed, and the only entry which can be made on the record is judgment for the defendant. The question, whether it should be recommitted and the arbitrator instructed to state definitely the amount due the defendant, so that a money judgment can be entered against the plaintiff, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>not before us. <em>Giles </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co. </em>179 Mass. 261, 268. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Brightman, </em>132 Mass. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
