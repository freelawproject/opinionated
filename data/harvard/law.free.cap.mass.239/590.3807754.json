The payee never made any demand for payment, and nothing has ever been paid upon the notes. The defendants also conceded that, if the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict, there was due $1,737.85.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">The defendants moved that a verdict be ordered in their favor, and excepted to the refusal of the trial judge so to do. The judge ordered a plaintiff\u2019s verdict for $1,737.85.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">The exception must be overruled. The consideration, execution and delivery of the notes were admitted; the promises to pay contained therein were unconditional; and demands were not necessary to charge the defendants, who were primarily liable on the instruments. R. L. c. 73, \u00a7\u00a7 18, 87. G. L. c. 107, \u00a7\u00a7 23, 93. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>1 Gray, 496. <em>Farmers National Bank of Annapolis </em>v. <em>Venner, </em>192 Mass. 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">The defendants\u2019 contention that their obligation to pay the notes has terminated, because no demands for payment were made in the lifetime of the payee and the notes were not transferred by her, cannot be sustained. It is based on the provisions of the notes relative to the disposition of principal and interest after Mrs. Sprague\u2019s death, and it is concluded by the former decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>which in effect held that the notes on their face contained promises to pay to the payee named therein, which the plaintiff as her administrator could enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">No question now arises as to the disposition of the proceeds of the notes when in the hands of the plaintiff. It cannot now properly be decided whether such proceeds will be a part of the-general estate of Mrs. Sprague, or will be impressed with a trust\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
