The deed conveying to him his second lot contained a clause of restriction \u201cthat only a single dwelling house adapted to the use of one private family only, with such out-buildings, including a private stable or garage, as are commonly used in connection with dwelling houses, shall be erected or placed on the lot.\u201d There were greenhouses on other lots in the entire tract of the syndicate. Conveyances were not made by the trustees by any one plan of all the lands, but the trustees intended to retain a power in themselves to change their system of development, and, while restricting the several lots as they were granted, they intended to avoid granting power to the purchasers to prevent the imposing of different restrictions or to compel the imposition of identical restrictions on all lots in the entire tract. The neighborhood was strictly residential with dwelling houses ranging in value from $20,000 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>over 850,000. The second purchaser built an expensive dwelling house on the first lot purchased by him and purposed to erect on the second lot, beside the lot of the first purchaser upon which was an expensive residence, a private greenhouse for the accommodation of his residence and according to a plan calling for an ornament to the locality. The first purchaser sought by a suit in equity to enjoin the erection of the greenhouse. <em>Held, </em>that</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b286-5\">(1) The second purchaser was bound by the restriction in the deed from the trustees to the first purchaser;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b286-6\">(2) The second purchaser\u2019s holdings, even if separately purchased, constituted an entire estate which he could occupy and develop to the same extent and in the same way as if the unity of title had existed when he built the dwelling house, or he had acquired the whole tract under one deed which recited all the restrictions;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AVe\">(3) The word <em>\u201c </em>appurtenances \u201d as used in the restriction placed upon the \" remaining land \u201d of the grantors by the first purchaser\u2019s deed, should be construed under such conditions to mean that which might become necessarily connected with the full and free use and enjoyment of the dwelling house whether it took the form of a private stable, or a private garage, or a private greenhouse;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b286-10\">(4) The private greenhouse proposed was not prohibited by the restriction placed upon the \u201cremaining land\u201d of the grantors by the first purchaser\u2019s deed, being among the buildings which were <em>\u201c </em>appurtenances \u201d to a dwelling house;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b286-11\">(5) The suit must be dismissed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-12\">Bill in equity, filed in the Superior Court on July 24, 1920, to enjoin the defendant from erecting a greenhouse on his land on Monadnock Road in that part of Newton called Newton Centre, adjoining land of the plaintiff, in alleged violation of restrictions in the deed of the plaintiff\u2019s land on Monadnock Road to him from the Trustees of the Newton Boulevard Syndicate, common source of the title of the parties to the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-13\">In the Superior Court, the suit was heard by <em>Wait, </em>J., a commissioner having been appointed under Equity Rule 35 to take the testimony. The judge filed a memorandum of findings' and an order for a decree as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-14\">\u201c The Trustees of the Newton Boulevard Syndicate had a large tract of land for development and sale. Many of the holders of certificates are lawyers. One was a justice of the Superior Court, and one a justice of the Supreme Judicial Court. The trustees were lawyers or real estate men. All had a wholesome fear of equitable restrictions, and a desire to profit by them. This, I think, may be reasonably inferred; and I assume this method of dealing was deliberate. Conveyances were not made by any one plan of all the lands. The language of the deeds given, while similar, was not identical. The restrictions did not terminate at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>one time for the whole tract. The trustees clearly intended to retain a power in themselves to change their system of development; and, while restricting the several lots as they were granted, they intended to avoid granting power to the purchasers to interfere to prevent the imposition of different restrictions or to compel the imposition of identical restrictions on all lots in the entire tract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-3\"><em>\u201c </em>In 1910, they owned the tract bounded by Hobart, Monadnock, and Wachusetts roads. They sold a parcel to Beekman on May 6, 1910, describing it by a plan of that parcel, and imposing certain restrictions on it. It was the first conveyance out of the tract bounded by the roads named. The deed provided: 'And for the consideration aforesaid, the said Trustees, for themselves, their heirs, successors and assigns, do hereby for the benefit of the land herein conveyed impose on the remaining land of said trustees, bounded southerly and easterly by Wachusett Road, westerly by Hobart Road, and northerly by Monadnock Road the following restrictions which shall remain in force for a period of twenty years from the date hereof, subject, however, to the rights of existing mortgagees, namely; no building shall be erected or placed thereon except private dwelling houses, adapted for the use of one private family only for each house, and the appurtenances thereto, including a private stable and garage for each of such houses; such dwelling houses shall cost above their foundations not less than five thousand dollars each.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-4\">\u201c Any one who acquired later any of the remaining land took subject to that restriction. As matter of fact, the Trustees, as they conveyed the remaining land to different grantees, imposed not only the above restriction in substance, but other restrictions as well.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff acquired, subsequently, other portions of the tract, but none of his deeds give him any greater rights in the defendant\u2019s lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-6\">\u201c It should be noted that the trustees created the restriction in question not for the benefit of the remaining lands, but expressly 'for the benefit of the land conveyed;\u2019 and that the power of enforcement is not described as secured to themselves, their heirs, successors and assigns ' owners of the granted premises and of the remaining tract \u2019 or in similar language.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u201c The defendant in 1916 purchased a part of the tract [bounded southerly on Wachusett Road] by a deed which, among other things, restricted the land as follows: \u2018 1st. That not more than one single dwelling house, adapted to the use of one private family only, with such outbuildings, including a private garage and private greenhouse, but excluding any stable, as are commonly used in connection with dwelling houses, shall be erected or placed on said' land.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">\u201c He later acquired the parcel [bounded by Monadnock Road on the north and by the first tract purchased by him on the south and] adjoining the plaintiff\u2019s parcel to the east, on which he has begun the erection of a greenhouse. This latter parcel comes from the trustees by mesne conveyances; and it is restricted so \u2018that only a single dwelling house adapted to the use of one private family only, with such out-b'uildings, including a private stable or garage, as are commonly used in connection with dwelling houses shall be erected or placed on the lot,\u2019 and in other ways not important to this matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">\u201cA breach \u2018shall in no case work a forfeiture of the grant, but shall only give to said Trustees or their successors or assigns the right to compel observance of said restrictions by a bill in equity or a right to enter upon the granted premises and abate and remove at the expense of the party at fault any erection that may be contrary to the true intent and meaning of said restrictions, without being deemed guilty of any manner of trespass for such entry, abatement or removal, or any of such acts.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-7\">\u201c The defendant has built a fine house on the parcel first acquired by him, and he now wishes to place his greenhouse on the second parcel instead of on the first. The structure he contemplates is not designed for business or' trade, but for the accommodation of a fine residence. It is forty-eight by forty-eight by eighteen feet in size, to be built of iron, glass and concrete; to cost as much as, or more than the single dwelling contemplated by the restrictions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-8\">\u201c There are greenhouses on other lots in the great tract developed by the Trustees; but none so readily to be observed from the roads. The plan calls for an ornament to the locality. No harm will be caused to the plaintiff by its erection other than the disappointment of not being able to prevent it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>\u201c The plaintiff has a fine residence on his land, and is naturally anxious to maintain the quality of the neighborhood, which is high. In this desire, the defendant and the neighbors share. The neighborhood is exclusively residential, with the dwelling houses ranging in value from $20,000 to over $50,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-5\"><em>\u201cA </em>greenhouse is, in my opinion, an \u2018outbuilding commonly used with a dwelling house \u2019 of the character of the dwellings in this vicinity. The deeds which the defendant received in his purchases of his lands all use the phrase \u2018 outbuildings . . . commonly used \u2019 with a dwelling house, and not the phrase \u2018 and the appurtenances thereto,\u2019 which was used in the first deed given to Beekman and imposing the general restriction on the \u2018remaining land \u2019 in the tract bounded by Hobart, Wachusett and Monadnock roads.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-6\">\u201c It is too narrow a construction of the language used to hold that unless a dwelling house were placed on the specific parcel originally conveyed to Frank A. Schirmer, [Being the parcel upon which the defendant proposes to erect a greenhouse] then no outbuildings can be put on that parcel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-7\">\u201c No one but the plaintiff appears to object to the action contemplated by the defendant. There has been no loches on the part of the plaintiff which should defeat him if otherwise entitled to prevail. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-8\">\u201cLet a decree be prepared dismissing the bill. No costs are allowed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-9\">A decree dismissing the bill was entered accordingly; and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-10\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-11\"><em>C.

The trial court dismissed the bill without costs, and the case is here on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The parties derive title from a common grantor described in the respective deeds as the \u201cTrustees of the Newton Boulevard Syndicate.\u201d The declaration of trust gave the trustees exclusive control and management with full power to improve, survey or plot a large tract of land to be developed and sold for residential purposes, and to locate, lay out and grade streets, sidewalks, ways, parks, squares, \u201cand to release lands therefor or for other purposes deemed by them expedient for the trust,\u201d and \u201c to grant and acquire easements.\u201d The record shows, and the presiding judge found, that conveyances were not made by any one plan of all the lands, but the trustees \u201c intended to retain a power in themselves to change their system of development; and, while restricting the several lots as they were granted, they intended to avoid granting power to the purchasers to prevent the imposition of different restrictions or to compel the imposition of identical restrictions on all lots in the entire tract.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s deed, which is prior in time to the defendant\u2019s title to both lots, and is the first sale of any of the lots shown on the plan bounded by Hobart, Monadnock and Wachusett roads, contains this provision in the granting clause: the trustees \u201c do hereby for the benefit of the land herein conveyed impose on the remaining land of said trustees, bounded southerly and easterly by Wachusett Road, westerly by Hobart Road, and northerly by Monadnock Road the following restrictions which shall remain in force for a period of twenty years from the date hereof, subject, however, to the rights of existing mortgagees, namely; no building shall be erected or placed thereon except private dwelling houses, adapted for the use of one private family only for each house, and the appurtenances thereto, including a private stable and garage for each of such houses; such dwelling houses shall cost above their foundations not less than five thousand dollars each.\u201d While in their subsequent conveyances they imposed other restrictions, those who bought within the period of limitation, acquired title subject to the restrictions in the plaintiff\u2019s deed. <em>Hano </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>155 Mass. 341, 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The deed to the defendant of the first lot where he built his house contained among other restrictions that \u201c not more than one single dwelling house, adapted to the use of one private family only, with such outbuildings, including a private garage and private greenhouse, but excluding any stable, as are commonly used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>connection with dwelling houses, shall be erected or placed on said land.\u201d By a later deed he acquired the second lot, and in this deed the material restriction reads, \u201c that only a single dwelling house adapted to the use of one private family only, with such out buildings, including a private stable or garage, as are commonly used in connection with dwelling houses shall be erected or placed on the lot.\u201d It is plain that if the mansion house were on this lot, a greenhouse to be used in connection with it would be an \u201c out building,\u201d the erection and maintenance of which would not be a violation of the restriction just quoted. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors</em>, 140 Mass. 287, 289. <em>Blakemore </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>159 Mass. 6. But the defendant\u2019s holdings, even if separately purchased, constitute an entire estate which he can occupy and develop to the same extent and in the same way as if the unity of title had existed when he built the dwelling house, or he had acquired the whole tract under one deed which recited all the restrictions. The land, however, was \u201cremaining land,\u201d and therefore is subject to the restriction in the plaintiff\u2019s deed previously stated, and the final question is, whether the greenhouse, even if used only in connection with the dwelling house, can be classed as among \u201c the appurtenances thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The judge has found in substance that the greenhouse is not to be used independently, but as an adjunct of the dwelling house. The word \u201c appurtenances \u201d is not used in a technical sense. It is to be read with the restrictions in subsequent deeds of the trustees permitting the erection of out buildings including a private garage and private greenhouse, and with the facts that there are greenhouses on other lots, one at least having been built in the immediate neighborhood of the land in controversy. <em>Clapp </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>176 Mass. 332, 338. The whole restriction also shows that \u201cappurtenances\u201d relate to minor structures or buildings needful to a dwelling house when constructed and maintained in a residential environment calling for large expenditure and much luxury. If appurtenances include a private stable and a private garage which are out buildings connected with and incidental to the use and enjoyment of the dwelling house, a private greenhouse for the same general purpose also may be classed as an out building coming within the intention of the grantors when framing the restriction. <em>Clapp </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>We are accordingly of opinion that \u201c appurtenances \u201d should be construed under such conditions to mean that which might become necessarily connected with the full and free use and enjoyment of the dwelling house whether it took the form of a private stable, or a private garage, or a private greenhouse. <em>Ammidown </em>v. <em>Granite Bank, </em>8 Allen, 285, 291. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>146 Mass. 70. <em>McShane </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>80 Cal. 310. <em>Woodhull </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>61 N.
