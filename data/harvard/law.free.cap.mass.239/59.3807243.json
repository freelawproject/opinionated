At the hearings before a second master, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel called as a witness the treasurer of the plaintiff, A. T. Stearns Lumber Company, who, on his examination in chief, testified that he was present at a meeting between the representatives of the various plaintiffs in the Irving-Casson case and a number of the defendants whom the plaintiffs contended were officers or agents of the unions in question and were entrusted with the calling of strikes, at which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>demands of the defendants as set forth in the bills of complaint were discussed. It appeared that this meeting was on March 30, 1916, before the filing of the bill in either of the suits. It also appeared that the witness had testified on November 6, 1916, in the suit by A. T. Stearns Lumber Company before the former master as to what took place at this conference, his testimony there covering between five and six typewritten pages. He was asked before the second master whether he could tell fully what was said at that meeting without refreshing his memory, and answered that he had not had an opportunity to look over the records of his testimony for several years and that he could not so testify. <em>\u201c </em>He was then asked to look over the pages of his testimony and to say whether they would so far refresh his recollection that he could testify to what took place at the meeting without looking at the book, and he answered that he could not. He then testified that the testimony he had given on November 6, 1916, was his best recollection of what took place. The question was then put to him: \u2018 Now, I will ask you, with this record before you and reading where it is necessary, will you tell us what took place at that meeting? \u2019 \u201d The defendants objecting, the master excluded the question on the ground that it would permit the witness to read from his former testimony, and in fact would permit the substitution of the former testimony for the present testimony, and ruled that he could not read to himself the statements appearing in the book and then by stating it in evidence substitute what he had just read for what he failed to remember about what took place at said meeting. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected to the ruling, and the master made a preliminary report of the foregoing facts and ruling by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-5\">The matter was heard by <em>Sisk, </em>J., who overruled the plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions and, being of the opinion that the foregoing ruling and order so far affected the merits and procedure of the controversy that the matter ought, before further proceedings, to be determined by the full court, he reported the cases to this court for determination.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-6\"><em>E.

The witness who testified at the former trial, after he had looked over the pages of the transcript of his testimony in substance testified that that testimony \u201c was his best recollection of what took place,\u201d and that he could not recall what took place at the meeting \u201c without looking at the book. . . . The question was then put to him: \u2018Now, I will ask you, with this record before you and reading where it is necessary, will you tell us what took place at that meeting? \u2019 \u201d It thus indisputably appears that the memory of the witness was not refreshed by reading his prior testimony and that he had no present recollection of the facts which at the former trial he recollected as the truth. It is not argued nor suggested that the failure of the witness to recall at the time of his testimony the facts which he recollected at the former trial is attributable to insanity or to any form of mental incapacity. The transcript of the evidence was properly usable to refresh the recollection of the witness, but it could not be used as evidence in confirmation or corroboration of such testimony. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>130 Mass. 64, 67. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>183 Mass. 461, 471. We think the effect of permitting the witness to supplement his recollection by reading from the transcript of his evidence at the former trial would be to adopt a further exception to the rule which excludes the testimony given at a former trial, and would not be conducive to the practical administration of justice. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Gilman, </em>43 N. H. 295. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>Stein </em>v. <em>Swensen, </em>46 Minn. 360. <em>Velott </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>102 Penn.

St. 294. <em>Rio Grande Southern Railroad </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>55 Col. 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">It follows that the order overruling the exceptions of the plaintiffs to the exclusion of the evidence by the master was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
