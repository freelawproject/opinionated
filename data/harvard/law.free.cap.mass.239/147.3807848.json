Subject to an exception by the defendant, the action was submitted to the jury who found for the plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that, upon the instructions given, which had become the law of the case, a finding for the plaintiff was not warranted, and that the defendant\u2019s exceptions must be sustained.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b167-12\">At the trial of an action of tort for deceit, brought by a poultry farmer against a manufacturer of feed for farm animals for a loss of poultry alleged to have been caused by giving to them for food an improperly mixed feed which the defendant had sold to a dealer, not his agent, from whom the plaintiff had purchased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>it relying on representations by the defendant that it was \u201c always uniform in quality,\u201d was \u201cabsolutely safe to feed,\u201d and the \u201cideal feed for all farm animals,\u201d there was neither allegation nor proof that the defendant sold the particular lot of feed in question to the dealer, knowing it to be unfit for poultry. The judge at the defendant\u2019s request instructed the jury in substance that statements upon which an action of deceit may be founded must be statements of fact, not of opinion; that, upon all the evidence, the only statements of the defendant in regard to the feed on which the plaintiff relied were \u201c sellers\u2019 talk; \u201d that honest statements of opinion will not found an action for deceit even though the opinion is not a correct one; and that there was no evidence that the defendant did not believe the statements made by it as to feed to be true. The defendant also asked for an instruction that, upon all the evidence, there was no evidence of any misrepresentation of fact by the defendant in any statement on which the plaintiff relied. The judge gave the last instruction, adding, subject to an exception by the defendant, \u201c but I refer you to exhibits three and four in reference to that.\u201d The exhibits referred to were a circular letter of the defendant giving a summary of a test made by the Massachusetts experiment station as to the digestibility of the feed, and an advertising booklet of the defendant which contained the representation above quoted. <em>Held, </em>that the reference to the exhibits nullified the ruling to which it was added and in the circumstances was prejudicial error.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-5\">Contract or tort, with a declaration in one count, described in the opinion.

The plaintiff bought the particular bags of feed alleged to have caused the loss from the Whitney Coal and Gram Company of Concord, which was a purchaser from and not a selling agent of the defendant. The declaration alleged that the death of the poultry \u201c was caused by the negligence and improper mixing and compounding of the said Schumacher Feed \u2019 by the said defendant,\u201d in consequence whereof the feed which he purchased \u201c contained dangerous and deleterious substances.\u201d With the exception of certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>phrases in his charge, which will be referred to later, the presiding judge submitted the case to the jury as one based on negligence. For instance he said: \u201cthe same rules of law apply to this as in all the cases that you have tried, negligence of the defendant and due care of the plaintiff.\u201d Again, \u201c unless and until you are satisfied that there was negligence on the part of the defendant you will go no further, you stop, and your verdict would be for the defendant; \u201d and \u201c The plaintiff asserts here that the negligence upon which he bases his case was caused by the defendant at its place of manufacture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">As was said by Bowen, L. J., in <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Quartermaine, </em>18 Q. B. D. 685, 694: \u201cthe ideas of negligence and duty are strictly correlative, and there is no such thing as negligence in the abstract, negligence is simply neglect of some care which we are bound by law to exercise towards somebody.\u201d It is a long established general rule that the manufacturer of an article is not liable to those who have no contractual relations with him for injuries resulting from negligence in its manufacture. This has been based on the various grounds of the absence of a legal duty to the plaintiff to use care in making the article; the break in the chain of legal causation; and the multiplicity of suits thought likely to result if the action were allowed. <em>Lebourdais </em>v. <em>Vitrified Wheel Co. </em>194 Mass. 341. <em>Windram Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Blacking Co. ante, </em>123, and cases cited. <em>Winterbottom </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>10 M. &amp; W. 109. <em>Huset </em>v. <em>J. I. Case Threshing Machine Co. </em>120 Fed. Rep. 865. This general rule is subject to certain well settled qualifications or exceptions. One, which recognizes the liability to third persons on grounds of negligence in the preparation of food for human consumption, is not applicable here, and need not be discussed. <em>Wilson v.J.G. &amp; B. S. Ferguson Co. </em>214 Mass. 265, 48 L.R.A. (N.S.) 219 note. Another established exception recognizes the existence of a duty of care in favor of strangers to the contract, where the product is inherently or commonly recognized as dangerous to human life or health; such as poisonous drugs and explosives. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>6 N. Y. 397. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Towne, </em>98 Mass. 567. <em>Wellington </em>v. <em>Downer Kerosene Oil Co. </em>104 Mass. 64. <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Carpenter-Morton Co. </em>220 Mass. 593. And there is a tendency in certain courts to extend this doctrine to cases, where an article not inherently dangerous becomes so by reason of neg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ligent preparation. <em>MacPherson </em>v. <em>Buick Motor Co. </em>217 N. Y. 382. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Cadillac Motor Car Co. </em>261 Fed. Rep. 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In the present case there was no evidence that Schumacher feed, in its ordinary state, was harmful to poultry. The testimony was all to the contrary; including that of the plaintiff, who had used it for two or three years before his loss, early in 1918. The complaint against the feed then bought by him is that salt, although commonly used as a desirable ingredient in commercial poultry feeds, was present in too large quantity; that this excess quantity was due to negligence in the process of mixing, and that it was responsible for the death of the poultry.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In instructing the jury as to the law applicable the presiding judge adopted the following requests submitted by the defendant: \u201cTwo: Upon all the evidence there is no evidence that the device used by the defendant in the preparation of the product used by the plaintiff was not reasonably adapted to the safe and proper and careful preparation of the same.\u201d \u201c Three: Upon all the evidence there is no evidence that the methods of manufacture used by the defendant in the preparation of the product used by the plaintiff were not reasonably adapted to the safe and proper and careful preparation of the same.\u201d \u201c Thirteen: A manufacturer of an article of food for poultry which is not inherently dangerous to poultry is not liable in an action of tort for negligence, for injuries due to negligence in manufacture.\u201d \u201c Sixteen: A manufacturer of feed for poultry is not bound at his peril to know that particular lots of his product are not dangerous to animals and poultry if fed to them.\u201d \u201cFifty-two: If you find there were lumps of salt in the Schumacher feed used by the plaintiff, that fact is not of itself evidence of negligence of the defendant in the mixing or sale of the feed.\u201d Regardless of whether these instructions were too favorable to the defendant, they became the law of the case. Applying the law as thus stated to the facts disclosed in the record, we find no warrant for a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on the basis of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The plaintiff also argues that he was entitled to recover on the ground of deceit. As already appears, the declaration sounded in negligence, and did not contain the requisite elements of an action of deceit, tersely stated by Church, C. J., in <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>Griswold, </em>55 N. Y. 400, 410, as \u201c representations, falsity, <em>scienter, </em>deception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>and injury.\u201d However, as no question of pleading was raised, and the issue of deceit was involved in the trial, we consider this aspect of the case. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Anheuser Busch Brewing Association, </em>211 Mass. 449. The charge does not seem to contain an instruction to the jury as to what the plaintiff should prove to establish liability based on deceit. And this issue was confused with that of negligence when the judge said: \u201cNow, if you are satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, he having shown negligence on the part of the defendant, that representations made by the defendant were not true, the representations caused him to buy this brand of feed, if you find negligence on the part of the defendant then you go to the question of the plaintiff\u2019s due care.\u201d At the end of the charge the judge gave these requests of the defendant, which thereupon became the law of the case: \u201c Nineteen \u00a1^Statements upon which an action of deceit may be founded must be statements of fact, not of opinion.\u201d \u201c Twenty-two: Upon all the evidence the only statements of the defendant in regard to Schumacher feed on which the plaintiff relied were only \u2018sellers\u2019 talk.\u2019\u201d \u201cTwenty-three: Honest statements of opinion will not found an action for deceit even though the opinion is not a correct one.\u201d \u201cTwenty-five: Upon all the evidence there is no evidence that the defendant did not believe the statements made by it as to Schumacher feed.\u201d The defendant also requested the following: \u201cTwenty: Upon all the evidence there is no evidence of any misrepresentation of fact by the defendant in any statement on which the plaintiff relied.\u201d This the judge gave; adding, however, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, \u201c but I refer you to exhibits three and four in reference to that.\u201d Exhibit 3 was a circular letter sent by the defendant to the plaintiff, dated June 30, 1916, giving a summary of a test made by the Massachusetts Experiment Station, as to the digestibility of Schumacher feed. Exhibit 4 was an extract from an advertising booklet of the defendant. From its context the following detached sentences are now selected by the plaintiff: \" Always uniform in quality . . . Absolutely safe to feed . . . The ideal feed for all farm animals.\u201d In view of the above quoted charge of the judge as to statements of opinion, and \u201c Sellers\u2019 talk,\u201d it is difficult to see how these exhibits could properly modify request twenty. The natural effect of referring the jury to them, without any ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>planation of their proper legal effect, was to practically nullify the request itself, and was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">It should be added that there is neither allegation nor proof that the defendant sold this particular shipment to its customer, the Whitney Coal and Grain Company, knowing that the feed was unfit for poultry.
