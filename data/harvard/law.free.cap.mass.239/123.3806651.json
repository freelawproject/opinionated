The long established general rule is that the manufacturer of an article is not liable for negligence in its manufacture to a third person with whom he has no contractual relations. <em>Winterbottom </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>10 M. &amp; W. 109. <em>Huset </em>v. <em>J. I. Case Threshing Machine Co. </em>120 Fed. Rep. 865. <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>11 Allen, 514. <em>Lebourdais </em>v. <em>Vitrified Wheel Co. </em>194 Mass. 341. <em>Tompkins </em>v. <em>Quaker Oats Co. post, </em>147. See cases collected in 1 Ann. Cas. 755 note; 24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>IL C, L. 512; 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 213 note. Whatever legal obligation the defendant may be under to its customer, Ellis, does not extend to sub-vendees. See <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Fiberloid Co. </em>196 Mass. 440, 444; <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Manhattan Market Co. </em>198 Mass. 271; <em>Gearing </em>v. Berkson, 223 Mass. 257, 260. The plaintiff has not stated a cause of action in the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\">The second count contains an allegation that \u201cthe defendant in such a way manufactured and mixed and put such materials into the cement . . . that said cement was, as the defendant was well aware, of a deleterious and dangerous character and certain to injure the fabrics and linings to which it should be applied by the plaintiff.\u201d Apparently it is sought thereby to bring the case within a recognized exception to the above general rule. As that exception ordinarily is stated, \u201c an act of negligence of a manufacturer or seller which is imminently dangerous to the life or health of mankind, and which is committed in the preparation or sale of an article intended to preserve, destroy, or affect human life', is actionable by third persons who suffer from the negligence regardless of privity of contract.\u201d 24 R. C. L. 512. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Towne, </em>98 Mass. 567. <em>Wellington </em>v. <em>Downer Kerosene Oil Co. </em>104 Mass. 64. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>J. G. &amp; B. S. Ferguson Co. </em>214 Mass. 265. <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Carpenter-Morton Co. </em>220 Mass. 593. 1 Ann. Cas. 755 note. A tendency appears in some recent cases to extend the class of \u201c inherently dangerous \u201d articles, so as to include not only those that in their ordinary state are dangerous to health and safety, such as poisons and explosives, but also those that are reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril because of negligent preparation. <em>MacPherson </em>v. <em>Buick Motor Co. </em>217 N. Y. 382. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Cadillac Motor Car Co. </em>261 Fed. Rep. 878. <em>Krahn </em>v. <em>J. L. Owens Co. </em>125 Minn. 33. Ann. Cas. 1917 E 584 note. No authority has been called to our attention which imposes a common law duty of care toward strangers to the contract, upon the maker of an article which is not inherently dangerous, but is likely to cause a loss to property because of careless preparation. See <em>Lukens </em>v. <em>Freiund, </em>27 Kans. 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The second count also includes an element distinct from negligence, and quite apart from the contract of sale, \u2014 namely, that of <em>scienter. </em>For the purposes of the demurrer we must assume that the defendant knew that this product was made for the sole use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the plaintiff, and was aware that by reason of its (the defendant\u2019s) carelessness in the process of manufacture the cement was certain to injure the fabrics of the plaintiff. This has some of the characteristics of an intentional tort, for which a wrongdoer is liable unless he has a legal justification; but the declaration falls short of that charge. There is present no allegation of a representation made by the defendant, either by word or conduct, which might mislead; no averment of any artifice employed, or of active concealment of defects; no alleged utterance of a half truth which is in effect a lie, or the use of other means to throw the plaintiff off its guard; any of which might be sufficient to prevent the application of the general rule as to non-disclosure, and render the defendant guilty of fraud. <em>Langridge </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>2 M. &amp; W. 519. <em>George </em>v. <em>Skivington, </em>L. R. 5 Ex. 1. <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Dockray, </em>156 Mass. 135. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Anheuser Busch Brewing Association, </em>211 Mass. 449. <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Carpenter-Morton Co. supra. Kuelling </em>v. <em>Roderick Lean Manuf. Co. </em>183 N. Y. 78, and cases cited. <em>Woodward </em>v. Miller, 119 Ga. 618. <em>Shinn </em>v. <em>Reutter, </em>135 Mich. 57. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>111 Cal. 39. <em>Huset </em>v. <em>J. I. Case Threshing Machine Co. </em>120 Fed. Rep. 865, 871. Mere silence on the part of the defendant is all that is charged. But failure to disclose known facts does not amount to fraud, and is not the basis of an action for deceit, unless the parties stand in such relation to one another that one is under legal or equitable obligation to communicate the facts to the other. \u201cIt may now be said to be firmly established that silence as to matters which there is no duty, original or supervening, to divulge, however actionable a positive misrepresentation of such matters may be, and however censurable <em>in foro conscientes </em>even the withholding of them may be, subjects the party observing silence to no legal liability whatever.\u201d Bower on Actionable Non-Disclosure, 135. <em>Potts </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>133 Mass. 276. <em>Van Houten </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>162 Mass. 414, 417. <em>Phinney </em>v. <em>Friedman, </em>224 Mass. 531, 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\">The demurrer was sustained rightly; and the judgment for the defendant must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
