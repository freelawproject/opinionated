Housed in pipes, they are used for warmth and for ventilation in airplanes. Plaintiff\u2019s blower is a single unit: motor, fan blades, vanes, and assembly, enclosed within a pipe, and designed to deliver a continuous stream of moving air in a defined channel.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">One thousand thirty-eight pages of testimony have been read. The evidence would support either the allegations of plaintiff or the allegations and denials of defendants. The trial court found for defendants, and there is substantial evidence to support that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">A finding of the trial court upon conflicting evidence will not be disturbed on appeal if there is evidence of a substantial character which reasonably supports the judgment. <em>(Fewel &amp; Dawes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>17 Cal.2d 85 [109 P.2d 650]; 2 Cal.Jur. 921; McK. Dig., Appeal and Error, \u00a7 1280.)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s claim of error in the exclusion of evidence on rebuttal is without merit. The following question was asked of a witness for plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-7\">\u201cCould the propeller shown on Defendants\u2019 Exhibit K have been designed by the use of the Dynamic Air designing methods?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Answer to this question was stricken out and objection sustained because of no foundation, in that there was no evidence of plaintiff\u2019s methods called for by the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">Later on the following colloquy occurred between the trial court and counsel for plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-10\">\u201cMr. Cusack: Do I understand I will not be permitted to lay any further foundation as to his qualifications or knowledge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-11\">\u201cThe Court: There is no question in my mind but what Mr. Sharpe is very ably qualified to testify in all the matters pertaining to the plaintiff\u2019s blowers as well as any other blower. However, that is not the necessary foundation, as I see it. The necessary foundation is the system used by the plaintiff to arrive at its deductions or results. Otherwise there would be no means of cross examining this witness on his calculations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">The court\u2019s ruling was based upon lack of essential foundational proof, and was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-14\">White, P. J., and Doran, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-15\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 5, 1951.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
