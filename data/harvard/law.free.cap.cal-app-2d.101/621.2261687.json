Suffice it to say that the record discloses ample evidence contrary to that relied upon by appellants which adequately supports the attacked finding and hence under the oft repeated rule such finding may not be disturbed upon appeal. <em>(Tupman </em>v. <em>Haberkern, </em>208 Cal. 256 [280 P. 970].)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Defendants\u2019 second contention is premised upon the assumption that under the agreement of the parties plaintiffs were acting as contractors within the meaning of section 7026 of the Business and Professions Code. Therefore, they argue, by reason of the failure of plaintiffs to secure a contractor\u2019s license they are now precluded from maintaining their action under the provisions of section 7031 of that code.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Section 7026 defines a contractor as \u201cany person, except an owner . . ., who in any capacity other than as the employee of another with wages as the sole compensation, undertakes to ... or does himself or by or through others, construct, alter, repair, add to, subtract from, improve, move, wreck or demolish any building, highway, road, railroad, excavation or other structure, project, development or improvement, or to do any part thereof, including the erection of scaffolding or other structures or works in connection therewith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Section 7031 provides: \u201cNo person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor, may bring or maintain any action in any court of this State for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act or contract for which a license is required by this chapter without alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>and proving that he was a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of such act or contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The record shows that defendants desired to clear, grade and level land, as well as construct a harbor and levees on Acker Island near Stockton, and that to accomplish their purpose they rented equipment and operators from plaintiffs over which defendants retained complete supervision, direction and control. Perhaps it is true, as defendants contend, that the operations here involved were such as normally come within th\u00b0 nurview of the provisions of section 7026 of the Business ana Professions Code. However, the trial court, as previously noted, upon conflicting evidence, found that plaintiffs did not agree to do the work for defendants on a contract basis but only agreed to rent to defendants certain equipment at a certain price.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">It is to be noted section 7026 does not apply to an owner of property who is improving the same for his own use and not for sale. Additionally said section defines a contractor as one who either by himself or through others undertakes to accomplish a particular project. Thus, defendants, to maintain their contention, would have to show conclusively that plaintiffs affirmatively undertook to perform or did perform some of the work contemplated. Here reliance upon particular testimony favorable to their case (which testimony was contradicted by plaintiffs), or the fact, if it be a fact, that it was such work as contractors usually perform, is not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">It necessarily follows that since there is ample evidence to sustain the finding of the court that plaintiffs\u2019 sole participation was their rental of equipment and operators and that defendants alone supervised, directed and controlled the doing of the work by and for themselves through the agency of the machines and operators rented by plaintiffs, defendants\u2019 second contention must fail for the same reason their first contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Adams, P. J., and Van Dyke, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
