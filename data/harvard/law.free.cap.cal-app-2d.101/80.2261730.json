J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdX\">Petitioner, seeking his release from imprisonment in the California State Prison at Represa, filed herein a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which writ was issued. A return thereto was filed, and questions of fact being raised thereby, the Honorable Raymond T. Coughlin, a judge of the Superior Court of Sacramento County, was appointed referee to take testimony regarding same. The report and findings of said referee have now been filed, and the cause submitted for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">The transcript of the hearings before the referee, and his findings, reveal the following: Petitioner was convicted in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, and was received at the prison on June 5, 1931, under sentence of one to fourteen years. On August 16,1935, he was granted a parole, and his parole and sentence were both fixed to expire on March 5, 1936. Under the terms of the parole he was permitted to leave California and take up his residence in the State of New York, it being provided that his monthly reports should be made to a parole officer of that state, in New York City. O\u2019Malley accepted employment with one McConnell in Brooklyn, New York, but on or about September 1, 1935, this employment was terminated with the consent of the parole officer of New York to whom petitioner made his report, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>said officer assisted him in securing employment as a ship\u2019s cabin boy with the Colonial Steamship Company, operating between New York and ports in New England. Since in the course of such employment petitioner would necessarily be absent from the city of New York for periods sometimes extending to two weeks, it was arranged with the New York parole officer, on the latter\u2019s suggestion, that O\u2019Malley should execute monthly report forms in advance covering the balance of his term, said forms to contain an estimate of his expected earnings and expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">On or about March 25, 1936, after the date upon which O\u2019Malley\u2019s parole and term were fixed to expire, he was arrested in Newton, Massachusetts. The Chief of Police of Newton advised the warden of the prison at Represa, and asked if 0 \u2019Malley was wanted by California authorities. Mr. Coxe, the California State Parole Officer, answered and advised the Newton chief of police that petitioner had violated his parole by leaving his place of employment in New York without the permission of the New York State Parole Department, but suggested that the prisoner be prosecuted in Massachusetts, and, if found guilty, be committed to the Massachusetts penitentiary with which the California authorities would then lodge a detainer and effect his return to California as a parole violator upon completion of his term in Massachusetts. On April 8, 1936, the Newton chief of police wrote to Mr. Coxe that O\u2019Malley had been convicted and sentenced to serve one year in the House of Correction, but that an appeal had been taken from such judgment; and that if a warrant of detainer were sent to the writer he would lodge it against petitioner. This was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">. On June 23,1936, the warden of the state prison at Charles-town, Massachusetts, wrote Mr. Coxe advising that O\u2019Malley had been committed to that institution on May 8, 1936, for a term of five to seven years. Mr. Coxe, in reply to that communication dated June 23, 1936, stated that O\u2019Malley was on the California records as a delinquent parole violator by reason of his \u201chaving failed to submit his monthly reports, and it is not our desire to return him to this state at the completion of his sentence, but should he be apprehended at any time within the confines of the State of California he shall be returned to Folsom Prison.\u201d The record also contains statements of O\u2019Malley, which were not refuted, that, while he was convicted on the charge in Massachusetts, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>judgment was reversed on appeal, and he was allowed compensation for the time served and the costs of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In the meantime, and on November 29, 1935, the California Board of Prison Terms and Paroles had made a minute order revoking the parole of petitioner, among others, for failure to submit his required monthly report \u201cin accordance with Rule VI of his ticket of leave,\u201d and it was ordered that he \u201cbe retaken and returned to actual custody to abide the further order of the Board.\u201d It does not appear that at that time any change was made in the previous order of the board fixing the date of the expiration of O\u2019Malley\u2019s sentence as March 5, <em>1936; </em>and there is no evidence, other than above stated, as to what were the conditions of O\u2019Malley\u2019s parole, or of what rule VI provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In December, 1948, petitioner was convicted of a misdemeanor in Santa Barbara County, California, and sentenced to the county jail; and in May, 1949, he was convicted of a misdemeanor in Pasadena Municipal Court and sentenced to serve 180 days in the Los Angeles County Jail. On completion of the latter sentence 0 \u2019Malley was returned to Folsom, charged with violation of his parole. Revocation of parole was then ordered, and his sentence was refixed at the maximum of 14 years, his credits earned being forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The referee\u2019s report states that O\u2019Malley\u2019s testimony regarding his dealings with the parole officer of New York as set forth hereinbefore, is without corroboration but is likewise without impeachment or denial; and he concluded that there was no substantial evidence that petitioner violated his parole. Petitioner introduced a letter written by him on March 11, 1949, to the parole officer of the city of New York, asking his version of what transpired, and a reply by the chief parole officer of the state of New York which merely referred the prisoner to the California parole officers for information. The referee at the close of the hearing asked petitioner\u2019s counsel to communicate with the New York parole authorities for their version, which was done; but he, also, was advised that any information thus obtained would have to be authorized by the California parole authorities. Later two letters from the Division of Parole of the State of New York were presented to the referee by respondent, but they stated only that \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>There is nothing to substantiate the parolee\u2019s claim that he had employment with the Colonial Steamship Lines with the approval of the parole officer,\u201d and that \u201cwe do not find any evidence that Mr. Dorsey (New York parole officer) granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the parolee permission to accept employment as cabin boy with the Colonial Steamship Lines.\u201d Neither an affirmance nor a denial of O\u2019Malley\u2019s testimony was made by Parole Officer Dorsey, nor does it appear that he was consulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Upon the filing with this court of the report and findings of Judge Coughlin the cause was set down for hearing before us. No objections to the report or findings were filed, and the cause was submitted without argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">We have read the record of the proceedings before the referee, and are in accord with his conclusion. Section 3063 of the Penal Code provides that no parole shall be suspended or revoked without cause; and respondent has presented no evidence showing cause for the revocation of petitioner\u2019s parole in November, 1939, and a search of the prison records was made. We conclude that there was no such cause, and that petitioner\u2019s parole and sentence expired on the date set, to wit, March 5, 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">It follows that the prisoner should be discharged and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Peek, J., and Van Dyke, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 23, 1950, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 5, 1951.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
