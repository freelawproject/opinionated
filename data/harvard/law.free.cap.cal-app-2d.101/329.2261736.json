Pierce for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b348-8\">DORAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuS\">The present appeal is from a special, order made' after a judgment. in favor of plaintiff, an injured employee, denying the employer\u2019s motion to satisfy the judgment. The basis of' such motion was that the uninsured employer (appellant) had fully paid to the employee the amount of . an award by the Industrial Accident Commission which was in excess of the judgment for damages rendered by the. superior court. Appellant contends that \u201cBy the use of the two concurrent remedies, the employee seeks to obtain for the one injury a double recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">The accident in question occurred November 10,1945 during plaintiff\u2019s employment. The present action was filed December 6, 1945, under provisions of sections 3706, 3707 of the Labor Code, permitting such an action against an uninsured employer. On July 22, 1946, judgment was entered for the respondent employee in the sum of $2,250 and $112.50 costs. On appeal, this judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 33 Cal.2d 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">After filing the action for damages in superior court, respondent employee on May 9, 1946 filed a claim before the Industrial Accident Commission, but requested that no hearing thereon be had until the superior court action was determined. On June' 5, 1947 the Industrial Accident Commission awarded the employee $2,890 and $350 attorney fee. The finding and award recite that \u201cThe applicant has received $2,250.00 plus costs of $112.20\"'in a parallel-negligence action against: the uninsured employer herein, which matter is pending on appeal.\u201d It was further found that \u201cThe defendant (appellant herein) was wilfully uninsured.\u201d This .award was paid by appellant and formed the basis for the motion to satisfy the judgment for damages which was denied'' by the trial court in the order now appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Appellant cites section 21 of article XX of the California Constitution authorizing enactment of a Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, which section, it is said, \u201cdenounces double recoveries for injuries suffered\u201d; this language, however, is that of appellant and is not used in said section. Also referred to is section 3709 of the Labor Code which provides that where a judgment is obtained against the employer in excess of the compensation award, payment of the award may be credited on the judgment. Such, however, is not the situation here for the award was in excess of the judgment obtained in superior court. The section makes no provision for credit in such a case. It is to be noted that appellant does not question \u201cthe right of the employee to take the concurrent remedies,\u201d and \u201cNo question is raised as to the validity of the award of the Commission or of the Court as separately considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that an equitable interpretation of section 3709 of the Labor Code should be adopted in order to prevent what appellant terms a \u201cdouble recovery.\u201d It is also asserted that relief should be granted \u201con the ground of extrinsic fraud\u201d in \u201cobtaining the judgment with resultant injury to defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Answering these contentions respondent\u2019s brief points out that section 21 of article XX of the Constitution, cited by appellant, \u201ccontains no express provision to the effect that an uninsured employer shall not be subjected to the payment of both an award of the Industrial Accident Commission and a judgment for damages . . . and no language from which any such limitation on the power of the Legislature can reasonably be inferred,\u201d Moreover, attention is called to the fact that section 3706 of the Labor Code provides that \u201cin addition\u201d to an award of compensation, an injured employee \u201cmay bring an action against such (uninsured) employer for damages as if this division did not apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">It is further^ pointed out that the only provision showing any relation between the decisions arrived at. in pursuing the two authorized remedies is that found in section 3709 hereinbefore referred to. This sole provision reads as follows : \u201cIf, as a result of such action for damages, a judgment is obtained against the employer in excess of the compensation awarded under this division, the compensation awarded by the Commission, if paid or security is given . . . shall be credited upon such judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>In the case of <em>Chakmakjian </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>33 Cal.2d 308 [201 P.2d 801], which affirmed the judgment against the appellant herein, the Supreme Court refused to consider \u201cthe merit of defendant\u2019s objection to the successive awards as embracing a \u2018double recovery\u2019 \u201d, since \u201csuch question manifestly was not before the trial court in its initial disposition of plaintiff\u2019s authorized damage action.\u201d On that appeal defendant was contesting \u201cthe validity of the judgment, not the premise of its enforcement in the admeasurement of plaintiff\u2019s total relief.\u201d However, in reference to the two remedies available against an uninsured employer, the reviewing court there said: \u201cUnder section 3706 of the Labor Code, the injured employee may bring an action for damages in any case where his employer failed to carry compensation insurance, and this right may be exercised independently of any proceedings before the Industrial Accident Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\"> The substance of appellant\u2019s claim is that by judicial interpretation or by reason of equitable considerations, a further provision should be read into section 3709 making it a duty of the trial court to satisfy an employee\u2019s judgment for damages against an uninsured employer, where the employee has received payment of a larger award by the Industrial Accident Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Unfortunately for appellant\u2019s contention, courts have neither express nor implied power to indulge in such judicial legislation. It must be assumed that the enacting body had fully considered the situation and that the resulting statute represents the law as the Legislature wished it to be. If changes are to be made in the statutory law as it stands, or additional provisions are deemed necessary, obviously such alterations fall within the jurisdiction of the legislative body. Any other disposition could but result in a complete destruction of the separate functions of the three divisions of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The essential differences between an action in the courts for damages resulting from negligence, and the statutory proceeding to secure an award of compensation by the Industrial Accident Commission, are too well known to require discussion. Actually, except as expressly provided by statute, there is no relation between the two remedies. And in the present action, by becoming an \u201cuninsured\u201d employer, appellant became subject to both remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">The fact that both proceedings arose out of the same accident affords no support to appellant\u2019s insistence that there has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>been an inequitable \u201cdouble recovery.\u201d The appellant was afforded the requisite day in court and due process at each hearing. The record here presented discloses no fraud, extrinsic or otherwise. As set forth in its findings, the Industrial Accident Commission at the time of making the award had before it the information that respondent had already obtained a, judgment for damages against appellant in the superior court. That judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">It is well known that the underlying theories of the two proceedings are entirely different. In no sense was the award of the Industrial Accident Commission a judgment for damages ; the proceeding itself cannot be considered a negligence action. And if any change in the statutory law is to be made for the relief of cases similar to that urged by appellant, such amendment must of necessity come from the law making body and cannot be effected by judicial construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
