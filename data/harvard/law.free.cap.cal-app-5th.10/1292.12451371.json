J.</author>\n<p id=\"AND\">A common butter knife is designed to cut and spread butter. In the hand of a person bent on assaulting another, it may be a useful tool to inflict great bodily injury. Consistent with an express direction from the California Supreme Court <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCoy </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 177, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>188-189 [153 P.2d 315]) and time-honored rules on appeal, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s factual finding that the instant butter knife was a deadly weapon must be affirmed on appeal. To the extent that <em>In re Brandon T </em>(2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 1491 [120 Cal.Rptr.3d 637] holds to the contrary, we respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">As we shall explain, an assault with a deadly weapon is complete when the defendant, with the requisite intent, uses an object in a manner which is capable of producing great bodily injury upon the victim. Such an assault is not negated by: (1) the victim\u2019s use of a shield or body armor to prevent injury; or (2) ineptness or poor aim in the use of the object; or (3) lack of success in inflicting great bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-6\">B.M. appeals from a juvenile court order declaring her a ward of the court and ordering her to serve 90 days in a juvenile justice facility. After a contested jurisdictional hearing, the court sustained a petition charging that appellant committed a felony assault with a deadly weapon (a knife) in violation of Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-7\">Relying on <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602] <em>(Miranda), </em>appellant contends the juvenile court erroneously admitted statements she made to the police. She also contends that the evidence is insufficient to support the finding that the knife she used was a deadly weapon. These contentions are without merit and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-8\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-9\">Appellant, 17 years old, was angry because she could not get inside the family home. Her mother had changed the locks to the house. She entered the house through a window and went into her sister\u2019s (S.M.) bedroom. She tried to pull S.M.\u2019s hair out, threw a telephone at her, and left the room.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She returned carrying \u201ca small . . . knife, like a butter knife.\u201d It was \u201c[t]he type of knife that you would use to butter a piece of toast.\u201d The knife was metal and about six inches long. The blade was about three inches long. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t . . . sharp\u201d and had \u201csmall ridges\u201d along one side.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-10\">S.M. was lying on her back on a bed when appellant attacked her with the knife. She covered herself with a blanket for protection. The knife struck the blanket near her legs a \u201cfew times.\u201d Through the blanket, S.M. felt pressure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>from the knife. On a scale of one to 10, with one being the least amount of pressure, the pressure was \u2018\u201c[m]aybe like a five or a six.\u201d Instead of \u2018\u201cpok[ing]\u201d S.M. with the knife, appellant made a \u2018\u201cslicing kind of\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">Appellant was \u2018\u201cyelling\u201d at S.M. who was terrified by the attack. When appellant left the bedroom, S.M. telephoned the police. The recording of her frantic call for help to the 911 operator was received by the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">In response to the telephone call, Officer Ryan Reynosa drove to S.M.\u2019s residence. On the way there, he was given a description and the name of the suspect. He saw appellant outside the residence \u2018\u201cand asked her if her name was [B.M.] \u201d Appellant replied, \u2018\u201cYes.\u201d Officer Reynosa testified, \u2018\u201cI then asked her to walk over towards me and sit against the bumper by my marked patrol vehicle so I could talk to her about what had happened.\u201d Appellant complied with his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-7\">Officer Reynosa told appellant that he \u2018\u201chad gotten a call of a fight inside the house and [he] asked her what . . . happened.\u201d Appellant explained as follows: she arrived at the residence and had been unable to open the front door with her key. She believed that S.M. had rekeyed the lock. Appellant entered the residence through an unlocked window. She was \u2018\u201cvery upset.\u201d Appellant \u2018\u201cgrabbed . . . what she described as a butter knife off of the kitchen counter and went upstairs to confront her sister [S.M.].\u201d Upon entering her sister\u2019s bedroom, appellant \u2018\u201cbegan yelling at [S.M.] . . . and . . . was holding the butter knife in her right hand and was pointing it at S.M.\u201d When S.M. told her to get out and threatened to call the police, appellant made \u2018\u201cdownward stabbing motion[s]\u201d toward \u2018\u201cthe bedding . . . that S.M. had pulled up over her.\u201d Appellant\u2019s intent was \u2018\u201cto scare S.M.\u201d Appellant \u2018\u201cthen ran back downstairs and put the knife in the kitchen sink.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-8\">Appellant testified as follows: She had been living at the residence for two weeks. After entering the residence through a window, she grabbed a butter knife in \u2018\u201cthe heat of the moment.\u201d She \u2018\u201cwanted to scare [S.M.].\u201d While holding the knife, she approached S.M., who was sitting on her bed. Appellant was \u2018\u201cyelling at her and cussing at her and telling her, . . . \u2018why did you . . . change the locks?\u2019 \u201d When appellant \u2018\u201cgot close . . . with the knife, [S.M.] covered herself with the blanket and started kicking her legs.\u201d Appellant was \u2018\u201cpretty sure [the knife] probably did touch the blanket[] because [S.M.] was kicking it, and [appellant] was right there, like, touching the bed.\u201d The part of the knife that touched the blanket was the blade\u2014\u2018\u201c[t]he part where you would . . . cut . . . toast and stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number><em>Alleged </em>Miranda <em>Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">Appellant claims that her \u201cconstitutional rights were violated\u201d because Officer Reynosa did not inform her of \u201cher <em>Miranda </em>rights before detaining and questioning her.\u201d Based on the alleged <em>Miranda </em>violation, appellant moved to exclude her statements to Officer Reynosa. The juvenile court denied the motion. It found that appellant was not subjected to custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">\u201cWe apply a de novo standard of review to a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress <em>[sic, </em>exclude] under <em>Miranda </em>insofar as the trial court\u2019s underlying decision entails a measurement of [as here] undisputed facts against the law.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Riva </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 981, 988 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 649].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-7\">\u201cIt is settled that <em>Miranda </em>advisements are required only when a person is subjected to \u2018custodial interrogation.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davidson </em>(2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 966, 970 [164 Cal.Rptr.3d 798].) \u201cAn interrogation is custodial when \u2018a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u2019 [Citation.] The test for <em>Miranda </em>custody is, \u2018 \u201cwould a reasonable person have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] The objective circumstances of the interrogation are examined, not the \u2018 \u201csubjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kopatz </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 62, 80 [186 Cal.Rptr.3d 797, 347 P.3d 952].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-8\">In determining whether a person was subjected to custodial interrogation, \u201c[t]he totality of the circumstances is considered and includes \u2018(1) whether the suspect has been formally arrested; (2) absent formal arrest, the length of the detention; (3) the location; (4) the ratio of officers to suspects; and (5) the demeanor of the officer, including the nature of the questioning.\u2019 [Citation.] Additional factors are whether the officer informed the person he or she was considered a witness or suspect, whether there were restrictions on the suspect\u2019s freedom of movement, whether the police were aggressive, confrontational, and/or accusatory, and whether the police used interrogation techniques to pressure the suspect. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davidson, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.4th at p. 972.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-9\">Based on the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d we conclude that appellant was not subjected to custodial interrogation. Officer Reynosa did not place her under arrest or handcuff her. He was the only officer present. The detention was not prolonged and occurred in a noncoercive atmosphere outside appellant\u2019s residence. Officer Reynosa\u2019s questioning was not aggressive, confrontational, or accusatory. He simply told her that he \u201chad gotten a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>call of a fight inside the house and [he] asked her what . . . happened.\u201d Reynosa did not use interrogation techniques to pressure appellant. He testified, \u2018\u201cShe was just telling me what happened.\u201d \u2018\u201c[A] reasonable person in [appellant\u2019s] situation would have believed [s]he was free to leave at any time and to terminate the interview. . . . The [juvenile] court correctly denied [appellant\u2019s] motion to suppress [sic, exclude] the interview.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kopatz, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">\u2018\u201cThe same standard governs review of the sufficiency of evidence in adult criminal cases and juvenile cases . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Matthew A. </em>(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 537, 540 [81 Cal.Rptr.3d 119].) \u2018\u201cIn reviewing a criminal conviction challenged as lacking evidentiary support, \u2018 \u201cthe court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Maury </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 342, 396 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 561, 68 P.3d 1].) \u201c \u2018[A] finding . . . based upon a reasonable inference . . . will not be set aside by an appellate court unless it appears that the inference was wholly irreconcilable with the evidence. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018[W]hen the evidence gives rise to conflicting reasonable inferences, one of which supports the finding of the trial court, the trial court\u2019s finding is conclusive on appeal. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Phillips </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>(2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 844, 851 [206 Cal.Rptr.3d 492]; see also <em>Denham v. Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564 [86 Cal.Rptr. 65, 468 P.2d 193].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-7\">\u201cAs used in [Penal Code] section 245, subdivision (a)(1), a \u2018deadly weapon\u2019 is \u2018any object, instrument, or weapon which is used in such a manner as to be capable of producing and likely to produce, death or great bodily injury.\u2019 [Citation.] Some few objects, such as dirks and blackjacks, have been held to be deadly weapons as a matter of law; the ordinary use for which they are designed establishes their character as such. [Citation.] Other objects, while not deadly per se, may be used, under certain circumstances, in a manner likely to produce death or great bodily injury. In determining whether an object not inherently deadly or dangerous is used as such, the trier of fact may consider the nature of the object, the manner in which it is used, and all other facts relevant to the issue. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aguilar </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1023, 1028-1029 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 655, 945 P.2d 1204].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-8\">The issue is whether a reasonable trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant used the butter knife \u201c \u2018in such a manner as to be capable of producing and likely to produce, death or great bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number><em>(People v. Aguilar, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 1028-1029.) We conclude that a reasonable trier of fact could and did make the requisite finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">Why does a person who assaults another person pick up an object to do so? The answer is apparent: to do greater harm than can be done with fists or feet. The victim of an assault with an object apprehends a greater degree of danger than a victim who is not assaulted with an object. The use of an object in an assault increases the likelihood of great bodily injury. In this instance, the Legislature has provided for greater punishment for the would-be assailant who utilizes an object in such a manner as to be \u201ccapable\u201d of producing great bodily injury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-6\">Here, sitting as trier of fact, and utilizing the power and ability to draw inferences from the evidence, the trial court concluded that the six-inch metal butter knife could be used to slice or stab, even though it was not designed for such. It was used in a manner \u201ccapable\u201d of producing great bodily injury. This factual finding is not \u201c \u2018wholly irreconcilable\u2019 \u201d with the evidence. <em>(Phillips </em>v. <em>Campbell, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.5th at p. 851.) This appeal \u201cturns\u201d on this factual finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-7\">It matters not that the victim was able to fend off great bodily injury with her blanket. This self-defense does not negate appellant\u2019s assault. Similarly, that appellant was not adept at using a knife does not inure to her benefit. She could have easily inflicted great bodily injury with this metal butter knife and just as easily have committed mayhem upon the victim\u2019s face. The trial court expressly found that it was only \u201clucky\u201d that there were no injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>McCoy, supra, </em>25 Cal.2d 177, our Supreme Court quoted with approval the Court of Appeal opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Raleigh </em>(1932) 128 Cal.App. 105 [16 P.2d 752], which said, \u201cWhen it appears . . . that [such] an instrumentality ... is capable of being used in a \u2018dangerous or deadly\u2019 manner, and it may be fairly inferred from the evidence that its possessor intended on a particular occasion to use it as a weapon should the circumstances require, we believe that its character as a \u2018dangerous or deadly weapon\u2019 may be thus established, at least for the purposes of that occasion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 108-109; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 303, 328 [78 Cal.Rptr. 217, 455 P.2d 153].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>As indicated, we part company with the opinion of <em>In re Brandon T, supra, </em>191 Cal.App.4th 1491. The Attorney General submits, and we agree, that this case was \u201cwrongly decided.\u201d This opinion has the earmarks of impermissible re weighing of the evidence. There, the appellate court drew inferences away from the factual finding under review. The defendant slashed at the victim\u2019s face and neck with a butter knife and used sufficient force to break the knife. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1497.) Even from the bare recital of facts, it is apparent that the butter knife was \u201cused in a manner so as to be capable\u201d of producing great bodily injury. That it broke during the assault preventing further stabbing should not inure to the defendant\u2019s benefit. The brutality of the attack in <em>In re Brandon T. </em>should not be minimized with hindsight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">The extent of the injuries, or lack of them, is relevant but not determinative. <em>(People v. Aguilar, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 1028.) The <em>In re Brandon T </em>opinion gives undue emphasis to the lack of injuries. The fallacy of this focus is easily shown by the typical assault with a deadly weapon with a firearm when the defendant has poor aim. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradford </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 8, 20 [130 Cal.Rptr. 129, 549 P.2d 1225].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-7\">The orders appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1175-8\">Perren, J., and Tangeman, J., concurred.</judges>\n<p id=\"b1175-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was granted July 26, 2017, S242153. Kruger, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1170-11\"> This uncharged assault shows that appellant intended to use any object available to harm her sister. In theory, throwing a telephone at another person with the requisite intent can be an assault with a deadly weapon. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cordero </em>(1949) 92 Cal.App.2d 196, 199 [206 P.2d 665] [beer bottle as a club or a missile].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-12\">Appellant also assaulted another sister giving her a bloody nose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1174-9\"> There is a historical exception to this observation. When Abraham Lincoln was accosted by a detractor, his bodyguard of tremendous physical strength. Ward Hill Lamon, knocked the assailant unconscious. He did this with a single blow to the head with his fist. Lincoln reportedly told Lamon that in the future, he should give the victim a chance: \u201cHereafter, when you have occasion to strike a man, don\u2019t hit him with your fist! Strike him with a club or crowbar or something that won\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
