J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArW\">In June 2012 the voters of City of San Diego (City) approved a citizen-sponsored initiative, the \u201cCitizens Pension Reform Initiative\u201d (hereafter, CPRI), which adopted a charter amendment mandating changes in the pension plan for certain employees of City. In the proceedings below, the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) determined City was obliged to \u201cmeet and confer\u201d pursuant to the provisions of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (MMBA) (Gov. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 3500 et seq.) over the CPRI before placing it on the ballot and further determined that, because City violated this purported obligation, PERB could order \u201cmake whole\u201d remedies that de facto compelled City to disregard the CPRI.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">We conclude, for the reasons stated below, that under relevant California law the meet-and-confer obligations under the MMBA have no application when a proposed charter amendment is placed on the ballot by citizen proponents through the initiative process, but instead apply only to proposed charter amendments placed on the ballot by the governing body of a charter city. We also conclude that, although it is undisputed that Jerry Sanders (City\u2019s mayor during the relevant period) and others in City\u2019s government provided support to the proponents to develop and campaign for the CPRI, PERB erred when it applied agency principles to transform the CPRI from a citizen-sponsored initiative, for which no meet-and-confer obligations exist, into a governing-body-sponsored ballot proposal within the ambit of <em>People ex rel. Seal Beach Police Officers Assn. v. City of Seal Beach </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 591 [205 Cal.Rptr. 794, 685 P.2d 1145] <em>(Seal Beach). </em>Accordingly, we hold PERB erred when it concluded City was required to satisfy the concomitant \u201cmeet-and-confer\u201d obligations imposed by <em>Seal Beach </em>for governing-body-sponsored charter amendment ballot proposals, and therefore PERB erred when it found Sanders and the San Diego City Council (City Council) committed an unfair labor practice by declining to meet and confer over the CPRI before placing it on the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">OVERVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The San Diego Municipal Employees Association and other unions representing the prospectively affected employees (Unions) made repeated demands on Sanders and the City Council for City to meet and confer pursuant to the MMBA over the CPRI before placing it on the ballot. <em>(San Diego Municipal Employees Assn. v. Superior Court </em>(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1447, 1451-1452 [143 Cal.Rptr.3d 49] <em>(San Diego Municipal </em>Employees).) However, there was no dispute the proponents of the CPRI had gathered sufficient signatures to qualify the CPRI for the ballot, and the City Council declined Unions\u2019 meet-and-confer demands and placed it on the ballot. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1452-1453.) The citizens of San Diego ultimately voted to approve the CPRI.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Unions filed unfair practice claims with PERB, asserting the rejection by Sanders and the City Council of their meet-and-confer demands constituted an unfair practice under the MMBA. PERB commenced proceedings against City and ultimately ruled City violated the MMBA by refusing to meet and confer over the CPRI before placing it on the June 2012 ballot. PERB ordered, among other remedies, that City in effect refuse to comply with the CPRI. City filed this petition for extraordinary review challenging PERB\u2019s conclusion that, because high level officials and other individuals within City\u2019s government publicly and privately supported the campaign to adopt the citizen-sponsored charter amendment embodied in the CPRI, City committed an unfair labor practice under the MMBA by placing the CPRI on the ballot without complying with the MMBA\u2019s meet-and-confer requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">In <em>Seal Beach, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 591, our high court was required to harmonize the provisions of the meet-and-confer requirements of the MMBA with the constitutional grant of power to a \u201cgoverning body\u201d to place a charter amendment on the ballot that would impact the terms and conditions of employment for employees of that city. The <em>Seal Beach </em>court concluded that, before a <em>governing body </em>may place such a charter amendment on the ballot, it must first comply with the meet-and-confer obligations under the MMBA. <em>(Seal Beach, </em>at pp. 597-601.) The <em>Seal Beach </em>court cautioned, however, that the case before it \u201c[did] not involve the question whether the meet-and-confer requirement was intended to apply to charter amendments proposed by initiative.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 599, fn. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">The present proceeding requires that we first determine the issue left open in <em>Seal Beach: </em>does the meet-and-confer requirement apply when the charter amendment is proposed by a citizen-sponsored initiative rather than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>governing-body-sponsored ballot proposal? We conclude the meet-and-confer obligations under the MMBA apply only to a proposed charter amendment placed on the ballot by the governing body of a charter city, but have no application when such proposed charter amendment is placed on the ballot by citizen proponents through the initiative process. With that predicate determination, we must then decide whether PERB properly concluded City nevertheless violated its meet-and-confer obligations because the CPRI was <em>not </em>a citizen-sponsored initiative outside of <em>Seal Beach\u2019s </em>holding, but was instead a \u201cCity\u201d-sponsored ballot proposal within the ambit of <em>Seal Beach. </em>Although several people occupying elected and nonelected positions in City\u2019s government did provide support for the CPRI, we conclude PERB erred when it applied agency principles to transform the CPRI into a governing-body-sponsored ballot proposal. Because we conclude that, notwithstanding the support given to the CPRI by Sanders and others, there is no evidence the CPRI was ever approved by City\u2019s governing body (the City Council), we hold PERB erred when it concluded City was required to satisfy the concomitant meet-and-confer obligations imposed by <em>Seal Beach </em>for governing-body-sponsored charter amendment ballot proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">A. <em>DeMaio\u2019s Pension Reform Proposal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">In early November 2010, City Councilmember Carl DeMaio announced his comprehensive plan to reform the City\u2019s finances. His wide-ranging plan to reform the City\u2019s finances included, among its many proposals, a proposal to replace defined benefit pensions with 401(k)-style plans for newly hired employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">B. <em>Sanders\u2019s Pension Reform Proposal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">In late November 2010, Sanders also announced that he would attempt to develop and place a citizens\u2019 initiative on the ballot to eliminate traditional pensions for new hires at City and to replace them with a 401(k)-style plan for nonsafety new hires. Sanders believed replacing the old system with the new 401(k)-style plan was necessary to solve what he viewed to be the unsustainable cost to City of the defined benefit pension for City employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">Sanders, after discussions with various members of his staff, decided to pursue his pension reform proposal as a citizens\u2019 initiative, rather than to pursue it by a City Council-sponsored ballot measure. Sanders chose to pursue his pension reform proposal as a citizen-sponsored initiative, rather than a City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>Council-sponsored ballot proposal, because he did not believe the City Council would put his proposal on the ballot \u201cunder any circumstances,\u201d and he also believed pursuing a City Council-sponsored ballot proposal (which would also require negotiating with the Unions) could require unacceptable compromises to his proposal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Sanders held a \u201ckick-off\u2019 press conference to announce his intent to pursue his pension reform plans through a private initiative. This event, which was held at City Hall and at which Sanders was joined by others,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was covered by the local media and included media statements informing the public that \u201cSan Diego voters will soon be seeing signature-gatherers for a ballot measure that would end guaranteed pensions for new [Cjity employees.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sanders\u2019s office also issued a news release\u2014styled as a \u201cMayor Jerry Sanders Fact Sheet\u201d\u2014to announce his decision. Faulconer disseminated Sanders\u2019s press release by an e-mail stating Sanders and Faulconer \u201cwould craft a groundbreaking [pension] reform ballot measure and lead the signature-gathering effort to place the measure before voters,\u201d and Sanders sent a similar e-mail announcing he was partnering with Faulconer to \u201ccraft language and gather signatures\u201d for a ballot initiative to reform public pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Over the ensuing months, Sanders continued developing and publicizing his pension reform proposal, and in early January 2011 a committee was formed (San Diegans for Pension Reform (SDPR)) to raise money to support his proposed initiative. At his January 2011 State of the City address,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sanders vowed to \u201ccomplete our financial reforms and eliminate our structural budget deficit.\u201d He stated he was \u201cproposing a bold step\u201d of \u201ccreating a 401(k)-style plan for future employees . . . [to] contain pension costs and restore sanity to a situation confronting every big city\u201d and that, \u201cacting in the public interest, but as private citizens,\u201d Sanders announced that he, Faulconer, and the San Diego City Attorney (City Attorney) \u201cwill soon bring to voters an initiative to enact a 401(k)-style plan.\u201d That same day, Sanders\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>office issued a press release publicizing his vow \u201cto push forward his ballot initiative\u201d for pension reform.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Sanders believed he had made it clear to the public that he undertook his efforts as a private citizen even though he was identified as \u201cmayor\u201d when speaking in public about his proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">C. <em>DeMaio\u2019s Competing Pension Reform Initiative</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The plan announced by DeMaio in early November 2010 for pension reform differed in some respects from Sanders\u2019s proposal. For example, DeMaio\u2019s proposed plan for a 401(k)-style plan for new hires did not exempt police, firefighters and lifeguards. DeMaio\u2019s proposed plan also included a \u201ccap\u201d on pensionable pay.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Two local organizations, the Lincoln Club and the San Diego County Taxpayers Association (SDCTA), supported DeMaio\u2019s competing plan as a plan that was \u201ctougher\u201d than Sanders\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">D. <em>The CPRI</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">In the aftermath of Sanders\u2019s January 2011 State of the City address, people in the business and development community informed Sanders they believed two competing initiative proposals\u2014the DeMaio proposal and the Sanders proposal\u2014would be confusing and there would be inadequate money to fund two competing citizens\u2019 initiatives. Shortly after a March 24, 2011, press conference at which Sanders presented his refined proposal, people within either the Lincoln Club or SDCTA told Sanders they were \u201cmoving forward\u201d with DeMaio\u2019s plan because it had sufficient money and was going to go onto the ballot, and that Sanders could either join them or go off on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>own. This apparently triggered a series of meetings between supporters of the competing proposals,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and they reached an accord on the parameters of a single initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The final initiative proposal, which ultimately became the CPRI, melded elements of both Sanders\u2019s and DeMaio\u2019s proposals: newly hired police would still continue with a defined benefit pension plan for newly hired police officers, but newly hired firefighters would be placed into the 401(k)-style plan. The pensionable pay freeze would be subject to the meet-and-confer process and could be overridden by a two-thirds majority of the City Council, but there would be no cap on total payroll. Sanders called the negotiations \u201cdifficult,\u201d and testified he did not like every part of the new proposal, but he nonetheless supported it because he believed it was \u201cimportant for the City in the long run.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">A law firm (Lounsbery, Ferguson, Altona &amp; Peak (hereafter Lounsbery)) was hired by SDCTA to draft the language of the CPRI. SDCTA gave Lounsbery the DeMaio draft of the initiative as the starting point for Lounsbery\u2019s drafting of the final language for the initiative.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Lounsbery made relatively few revisions to it to finalize the language that became the CPRI. Lounsbery was paid by SDCTA for its services.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">On April 4, 2011, the City Clerk received a notice of intent to circulate a petition seeking to place the CPRI on the ballot, seeking to amend City\u2019s charter pursuant to section 3 of article XI of the California Constitution. The ballot proponents were Catherine A. Boling (Boling), T.J. Zane (Zane), and Stephen Williams (Williams) (collectively, Proponents).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">To qualify the CPRI for the ballot, Proponents needed to obtain verified signatures from at least 15 percent (94,346) of City\u2019s registered voters. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>On September 30, 2011, Zane delivered to the City Clerk a petition containing over 145,000 signatures, and the City Clerk forwarded the petition to the San Diego County Registrar of Voters (SDROV) to officially verify the signatures. The SDROV determined the initiative petition contained sufficient valid signatures and, accordingly, on November 8, 2011, the SDROV issued a certification that the CPRI petition had received a \u201cSUFFICIENT\u201d number of valid signatures requiring it to be presented to the voters as a citizens\u2019 initiative. The City Clerk submitted the SDROV\u2019s certification to the City Council on December 5, 2011, and that same day the City Council passed resolution R-307155, a resolution of intention to place the CPRI on the lune 5, 2012, presidential primary election ballot, as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">E. <em>Sanders Campaigns for the CPRI</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The day after the proponents filed their notice of intent to circulate, Sanders, DeMaio, Goldsmith, Faulconer, Boling, and Zane held a press conference on the City Concourse at which they announced the filing of the CPRI petition.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A news media outlet reported that proponents of the dueling ballot measures to curtail San Diego City pensions had reached a compromise to combine forces behind a single initiative for the lune ballot. Sanders thereafter supported the campaign to gather signatures and promote the CPRI. He touted its importance by providing interviews and quotes to the media and by discussing it at his speaking appearances.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Additionally, campaign disclosure statements indicated SDPR (the committee formed to promote Sanders\u2019s original initiative proposal) contributed $89,000 in cash and nonmonetary support to the committee supporting the CPRI from lanuary 1, 2011, through lune 1, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">F. <em>The Meet-and-confer Demands</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">On luly 15, 2011, the San Diego Municipal Employees Association (MEA) wrote to Sanders asserting City had the obligation under the MMBA to meet and confer over the CPRI. When Sanders did not respond, MEA wrote a second letter demanding City satisfy its meet-and-confer obligations concerning the CPRI. City Attorney Goldsmith responded by stating, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>tilings, the City Council was required (under the California Constitution and state elections law) to place the CPRI without modification on the ballot as long as the proponents submitted the requisite signatures and otherwise met the procedural requirements for a citizens\u2019 initiative to amend the charter. Goldsmith explained that, \u201c[assuming the proponents of the [CPRI] obtain the requisite number of signatures on their petition and meet all other legal requirements, there will be no determination of policy or course of action by the City Council, within the meaning of the MMBA, triggering a duty to meet and confer in the act of placing the citizen initiative on the ballot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">MEA, in its September 9, 2011, response to Goldsmith\u2019s explanation, asserted City <em>was </em>obligated to meet and confer because Sanders was acting as the mayor to promote the CPRI and hence \u2018\u201chas clearly made a determination of policy <em>for this City </em>related to mandatory subjects of bargaining . . . .\u201d MEA asserted Sanders was \u2018\u201cusing the pretense that [the CPRI] is a \u2018citizens\u2019 initiative\u2019 when it is, in fact, this <em>City\u2019s </em>initiative\u201d as a deliberate tactic to \u2018\u201cdodge the City\u2019s obligations under the MMBA.\u201d The City Attorney\u2019s office reiterated City had no meet-and-confer obligations \u2018\u201cat this point in the process\u201d because \u201cthere is no legal basis upon which the City Council can modify the [CPRI], if it qualifies for the ballot,\u201d but instead the City Council \u201cmust comply with California Elections Code . . . section 9255\u201d and place the CPRI on the ballot if it meets the signature and other procedural requirements set forth in the Elections Code. Accordingly, City declined MEA\u2019s demand to meet and confer over the CPRI.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">G. <em>The Initial Proceedings and </em>San Diego Municipal Employees</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">MEA filed its unfair practice charge (UPC) on January 20, 2012, asserting City refused to meet and confer over the CPRI because \u201cCity claims that it is a \u2018citizen\u2019s initiative\u2019 <em>not </em>\u2018City\u2019s initiative,\u2019 \u201d and MEA alleged this refusal violated the MMBA because the CPRI \u201cis merely a sham device which City\u2019s \u2018Strong Mayor\u2019 has used for the express purpose of avoiding City\u2019s MMBA obligations to meet and confer.\u201d However, on January 30, 2012, the City Council, after recognizing the petitions for the CPRI contained the requisite number of signatures, enacted an ordinance placing the CPRI on the June 2012 ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">On February 10, 2012, PERB issued a complaint against City, alleging City\u2019s failure to meet and confer violated sections 3505 and 3506, and was an unfair practice within the meaning of section 3509, subdivision (b) and California Code of Regulations, title 8, section 32603, subdivisions (a) through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>(c).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> PERB also ordered an expedited administrative hearing and appointed an administrative law judge (ALJ) to hold an evidentiary hearing on the complaints. <em>(San Diego Municipal Employees, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.4th at p. 1453.)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">PERB also filed a superior court action seeking, among other relief, an order temporarily enjoining presentation of the CPRI to the voters on the June 2012 ballot, but the trial court rejected PERB\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. <em>(San Diego Municipal Employees, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1453-1454.) After the ALJ scheduled an administrative hearing for early April 2012 on the complaints, City moved in the superior court action for an order staying the administrative hearing and quashing the subpoenas issued by the ALJ. The trial court granted City\u2019s motion to stay the administrative proceedings, and MEA pursued writ relief. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1454-1455.) In <em>San Diego Municipal Employees, </em>this court concluded the stay was improper because \u2018\u201c[a]s the expert administrative agency established by the Legislature to administer collective bargaining for covered governmental employees, PERB has exclusive initial jurisdiction over conduct that arguably violates the MMBA\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1458), and PERB\u2019s \u201cinitial exclusive jurisdiction extends to activities \u2018 <em>\u201carguably . . </em>. prohibited\u201d by public employment labor law <em>(id. </em>at p. 1460, quoting <em>City of San Jose v. Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3 </em>(2010) 49 Cal.4th 597, 606 [110 Cal.Rptr.3d 718, 232 P.3d 701], italics added by <em>San Diego Municipal Employees.) </em>This court noted that, had City directly placed the CPRI on the ballot without satisfying the meet-and-confer procedures, it would have engaged in conduct prohibited by the MMBA, and we ultimately concluded that because \u201cMEA\u2019s UPC alleges (and provides some evidence to support the allegations) that the CPRI (while nominally a citizen initiative) was actually placed on the ballot by City using straw men to avoid its MMBA obligations, the UPC does allege City engaged in activity <em>arguably </em>prohibited by public employment labor law, giving rise to PERB\u2019s initial exclusive jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(San Diego Municipal Employees, </em>at p. 1460.) This court ultimately concluded it was error to stay PERB\u2019s exclusive initial jurisdiction over the UPC claims, and vacated the stay. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1465-1466.)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">H. <em>PERB Proceedings and Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"A1o\">\n<em>The ALJ Proposed Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The ALJ held an administrative hearing and, after taking evidence, issued a proposed decision. The proposed decision found Sanders chose to pursue a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>citizens\u2019 initiative measure, rather than invoke the City Council\u2019s authority to place his plan on the ballot as a City Council-sponsored ballot proposal, because he doubted the City Council\u2019s willingness to agree with him and because he sought to avoid concessions to the Unions. The ALJ found the CPRI, which embodied a compromise between Sanders\u2019s proposal and the proposal championed by DeMaio, was then carried forward as a citizens\u2019 initiative and was adopted by the electorate. The ALJ found that, because Sanders occupied the office of mayor in a city that uses the \u201cstrong mayor\u201d form of governance, and in that role has certain responsibilities when conducting collective bargaining with represented employee organizations on behalf of City (including the responsibility to develop City\u2019s initial bargaining proposals, to map out a strategy for negotiations, and to brief the City Council on the proposals and strategies and to obtain the City Council\u2019s agreement to proceed), Sanders \u201cwas not legally privileged to pursue implementation of [pension reform] as a private citizen.\u201d The ALJ concluded that because Sanders, acting \u201cunder the color of his elected office\u201d and with the support of two City Council Members and the City Attorney,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> launched and pursued the pension reform initiative campaign, Sanders made \u201ca policy determination that [City] propose [d] for adoption by the electorate\u201d on a negotiable matter but denied the Unions \u201can opportunity to meet and confer over his policy determination in the form of [the CPRI],\u201d in violation of the meet-and-confer obligations under <em>Seal Beach. </em>The ALJ further concluded that, because of Sanders\u2019s \u201cstatus as a statutorily defined agent of the public agency and common law principles of agency, the same obligation to meet and confer applie[d] to the City because it has ratified the policy decision resulting in the unilateral change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">\n<em>The PERB Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">After PERB considered supplemental briefing concerning the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision from City, Unions and the ballot Proponents, PERB issued the decision challenged in this writ proceeding that largely affirmed the ALJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>decision.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Specifically, PERB rejected City\u2019s exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s conclusions that City was charged with Sanders\u2019s conduct under principles of statutory agency, common law principles of agency based on actual and apparent authority, and common law ratification principles.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Instead, PERB adopted the ALJ\u2019s findings that (1) \u201cunder the City\u2019s Strong Mayor form of governance and common law principles of agency, Sanders was a statutory agent of the City with actual authority to speak for and bind the City with respect to initial proposals in collective bargaining with the Unions; (2) under common law principles of agency, [Sanders] acted with actual and apparent authority when publicly announcing and supporting a ballot measure to alter employee pension benefits; and (3) the City Council had knowledge of [Sanders\u2019s conduct], by its action and inaction, and, by accepting the benefits of Proposition B, thereby ratified his conduct.\u201d PERB\u2019s decision also concluded that, because City (through Sanders as its agent) decided to place the CPRI on the ballot while acquiescing in Sanders\u2019s rejection of the Unions\u2019 meet-and-confer demands, City violated the MMBA.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">PERB modified the remedy ordered in the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision insofar as the proposed decision ordered City to vacate the results of the election adopting the CPRI.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> However, PERB\u2019s remedy, invoking its \u201cmake-whole\u201d and \u201crestoration\u201d powers for remedying violations of the MMBA, ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>(among other things) that City \u201cpay employees for all lost compensation, including but not limited to the value of lost pension benefits, resulting from the enactment of [the CPRI], offset by the value of new benefits required from the City under [the CPRI].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">\n<em>Writ Proceedings Challenging PERB Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">City timely filed this writ petition challenging PERB\u2019s decision (\u00a7 3509.5), and this court issued its writ of review. In City\u2019s writ proceeding, City named Proponents as additional real parties in interest and Proponents have filed briefs in that proceeding. Proponents also filed a separate writ petition challenging PERB\u2019s decision, and this court issued a writ of review. We subsequently consolidated the two writ proceedings for consideration and disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">In City\u2019s writ proceeding, PERB (joined by Unions) has moved to dismiss Proponents as real parties in interest, arguing Proponents lack standing to participate as real parties because they were not (and were indeed barred by PERB regulations from being) parties to the underlying PERB proceeding. PERB has separately moved to dismiss Proponents\u2019 writ proceeding on the same ground. We conclude official proponents of a ballot initiative have a sufficiently direct interest in the result of the proceeding <em>(Connerly v. State Personnel Bd. </em>(2006) 37 Cal.4th 1169, 1178 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 788, 129 P.3d 1]) to join as real parties in interest in an action, either by intervention or because they are named by other parties as real parties in interest, which is directed at the evisceration of the ballot measure for which they were the official proponents. (See <em>Perry v. Brown </em>(2011) 52 Cal.4th 1116, 1125 [134 Cal.Rptr.3d 499, 265 P.3d 1002]; see also <em>Amwest Surety Ins. Co. v. Wilson </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1243, 1250 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 12, 906 P.2d 1112].) Accordingly, we deny PERB\u2019s motion to dismiss Proponents as real parties in interest from City\u2019s writ proceeding. Additionally, in light of our conclusion that PERB\u2019s decision must be annulled because City was not obligated to meet and confer prior to placing the CPRI on the ballot, PERB\u2019s motion to dismiss Proponents\u2019 writ proceeding (and the additional arguments raised in Proponents\u2019 writ proceeding) are moot and we need not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">The standards applicable to our review of a PERB decision are governed by differing degrees of deference. First, insofar as PERB\u2019s decision rests on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>its resolution of disputed factual questions, we apply the most deferential standard of review. Under this standard, PERB\u2019s factual findings are conclusive as long as there is any substantial evidence in the record to support its factual findings. <em>(Trustees of Cal. State University v. Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1107, 1123 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 60]; see, e.g., <em>Regents of University of California v.

Oregon </em>(2006) 546 U.S. 243, 255 [163 L.Ed.2d 748, 126 S.Ct. 904].) PERB asserts that we must follow its determinations of law unless clearly erroneous. Specifically, PERB argues that because it has been invested by the legislative scheme with the \u201cspecialized and focused task\u201d of protecting \u201c \u2018both employees and the state employer from violations of the organizational and collective bargaining rights guaranteed by [law]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Banning Teachers Assn. v. Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 799, 804 [244 Cal.Rptr. 671, 750 P.2d 313]), PERB is \u201c \u2018one of those agencies presumably equipped or informed by experience to deal with a specialized field of knowledge, whose findings within that field carry the authority of an expertness which courts do not possess and therefore must respect\u2019 \u201d <em>(ibid., </em>quoting <em>Universal Camera Corp. </em>v. <em>Labor Bd. </em>(1951) 340 U.S. 474, 488 [95 L.Ed. 456, 71 S.Ct. 456]). Accordingly, PERB argues, \u201c \u2018[T]he relationship of a reviewing court to an agency such as PERB, whose primary responsibility is to determine the scope of the statutory duty to bargain and resolve charges of unfair refusal to bargain, is generally one of deference\u2019 \u201d <em>(ibid., </em>quoting <em>Oakland Unified School Dist. v. Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 1007, 1012 [175 Cal.Rptr. 105]), and PERB\u2019s interpretation will generally be followed unless it is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">However, in <em>Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 1 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 960 P.2d 1031] <em>(Yamaha), </em>our Supreme Court explained, \u201c \u2018The standard for judicial review of agency interpretation of law is the <em>independent judgment </em>of the court, giving <em>deference </em>to the determination of the agency <em>appropriate </em>to the circumstances of the agency action.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 8.) <em>Yamaha\u2019s </em>conceptual framework noted that courts must distinguish between two classes of interpretive actions by the administrative body\u2014those that are \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d in nature and those that represent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>interpretations of the applicable law\u2014and cautions that \u201cbecause of their differing legal sources, [each] command significantly different degrees of deference by the courts.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 10.) When examining the former type of action, an agency interpretation \u201crepresents an authentic form of substantive lawmaking: Within its jurisdiction, the agency has been delegated the Legislature\u2019s lawmaking power. [Citations.] Because agencies granted such substantive rulemaking power are truly \u2018making law,\u2019 their quasi-legislative rules have the dignity of statutes. When a court assesses the validity of such rules, the scope of its review is narrow. If satisfied that the rule in question lay within the lawmaking authority delegated by the Legislature, and that it is reasonably necessary to implement the purpose of the statute, judicial review is at an end.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 10-11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">However, \u201c[t]he quasi-legislative standard of review \u2018is <em>inapplicable </em>when the agency is not exercising a discretionary rule-making power, but merely <em>construing </em>a controlling statute. The appropriate mode of review in such a case is one in which the judiciary, although taking ultimate responsibility for the construction of the statute, accords great weight and respect to the administrative construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Yamaha, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 12, italics added by <em>Yamaha, </em>quoting <em>International Business Machines v.

It is this \u2018expertise,\u2019 expressed as an interpretation . . . that is the source of the presumptive value of the agency\u2019s views. An important corollary of agency interpretations, however, is their diminished power to bind. Because an interpretation is an agency\u2019s <em>legal opinion, </em>however \u2018expert,\u2019 rather than the exercise of a delegated legislative power to make law, it commands a commensurably lesser degree of judicial deference.\u201d (Ib<em>id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">We construe <em>Yamaha </em>as recognizing that, in our tripartite system of government, it is the judiciary\u2014not the legislative or executive branches\u2014 that is charged with the final responsibility to determine questions of law <em>{Yamaha, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 11 &amp; fn. 4), and \u201c[w]hether judicial deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation is appropriate and, if so, its extent\u2014 the \u2018weight\u2019 it should be given\u2014is thus fundamentally <em>situational.\u201d {Id. </em>at p. 12.) Thus, while <em>some </em>deference to an agency\u2019s resolution of questions of law may be warranted when the agency possesses a special expertise with the legal and regulatory milieu surrounding the disputed question (see <em>New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number><em>Cingular Wireless PCS, LLC v. Public Utilities Com. </em>(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 784, 809-810 [201 Cal.Rptr.3d 652]), the judiciary accords no deference to agency determinations on legal questions falling outside the parameters of the agency\u2019s peculiar expertise.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>Overstreet ex rel.

In furtherance of that goal, section 3504.5, part of the MMBA, requires that reasonable written notice be given to organizations such as the MEA of any action \u201cproposed to be adopted by the governing body\u201d that directly relates to matters within the scope of representation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (\u00a7 3504.5, subd.

Thus, in <em>Friends of Sierra Madre, </em>the court held that the procedural mandates of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA; Pub.

While similar <em>citizen-sponsored </em>measures do not require compliance with analogous regulatory procedural prerequisites (see, e.g., <em>Stein v.

From those tenets, <em>Seal Beach </em>concluded a governing body constrained by the procedural requirements of the MMBA cannot circumvent the meet-and-confer requirement by using a charter amendment to unilaterally implement the same changes that would otherwise be subjected to the meet-and-confer requirement. <em>(Seal Beach, </em>at p. 602.)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>In contrast, the courts have refused to subject citizen-sponsored initiatives to the same procedural constraints that would apply if the same subject matter were embodied in a city council-sponsored ballot proposal (compare <em>Stein </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica, supra, </em>110 Cal.App.3d at pp. 460-461 with <em>Friends of Sierra Madre, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 186-191), which militates in favor of a conclusion that the procedural meet-and-confer obligation cannot be superimposed on a citizen-sponsored initiative addressing matters within the \u201cscope of representation\u201d as that term is used in the MMBA.

More importantly, the meet-and-confer requirements of the MMBA by its express terms constrain only <em>proposals </em>by the <em>\u201cgoverning </em>body\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 3504.5, subd.

Because a citizen-sponsored initiative does not involve a proposal <em>by </em>the \u201cgoverning body,\u201d we are convinced there are no analogous meet-and-confer requirements for citizen-sponsored initiatives.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">\n<em>PERB\u2019s Contrary Analysis Is Unpersuasive</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The PERB decision ostensibly \u201cdecline[d] to decide\u201d the \u201csignificant and difficult questions about the applicability of the MMBA\u2019s meet-and-confer requirement to a pure citizens\u2019 initiative,\u201d which it appeared to deem unnecessary because it concluded the CPRI was not a \u201cpure\u201d citizen-sponsored initiative because of Sanders\u2019s involvement in promoting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>CPRI. However, PERB nevertheless appeared to conclude the citizens\u2019 initiative rights enshrined in article II, section 11, and article XI, section 3, subdivision (b), of the California Constitution would <em>not </em>obviate the meet- and-confer obligations imposed on City by the MMBA.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In this writ proceeding, PERB and Unions appear to resurrect this argument, asserting the PERB decision does no violence to the citizens\u2019 initiative process. Specifically, they note the Legislature <em>can </em>limit (or entirely preempt) the local initiative power on matters of statewide (as opposed to purely local) concern, and contend that because the Supreme Court in <em>Voters </em>concluded a local referendum could not be used to reverse the adoption of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) following negotiations pursuant to the MMBA because allowing such use of the referendum would harm the statewide interest underlying the MMBA, the same conclusion applies equally to the initiative process. Accordingly, PERB and Unions argue that when the electorate seeks to exercise control over matters (such as pension benefits) that would be negotiable subjects under the MMBA, the constitutional right of initiative must yield to the statewide objectives of the MMBA, including the procedural requirements of the MMBA imposing a meet-and-confer process before proposals impacting negotiable subjects may be adopted.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>We believe PERB and Unions misconstrue, and hence overstate, the import of <em>Voters. </em>The <em>Voters </em>court addressed a distinct and limited issue: whether voters in a county were entitled to mount a <em>referendum </em>challenge to a county ordinance (which adopted an MOU impacting county employee pension benefits) under the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions. The court first concluded that article XI, section 1, subdivision (b), of the California Constitution neither authorized nor restricted voters from challenging the county ordinance by referendum. <em>(Voters, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 770-776.) The court, after recognizing courts should apply a liberal construction to the initiative power, with any reasonable doubt resolved in favor of preserving it, opined that \u201cwe will presume, <em>absent a clear showing of the Legislature\u2019s intent to the contrary, </em>that legislative decisions of a city council or board of supervisors\u2014including local employee compensation decisions [citation]\u2014 are subject to initiative and referendum. <em>In this case, the legislative intent to bar the referendum power over the ordinance in question is unmistakable.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. <em>777, </em>italics added.) Specifically, <em>Voters </em>determined the Legislature, by its enactment of section 25123, subdivision (e), evinced an unmistakable legislative intent to bar challenges <em>by referendum </em>to county ordinances specifically related to the adoption or implementation of MOU\u2019s. <em>(Voters, </em>at pp. 777-778.)<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The <em>Voters </em>court then rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim that section 25123, subdivision (e), was unconstitutional, reasoning the Legislature may properly restrict the right of referendum \u201cif this is done as part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>the exercise of its plenary power to legislate in matters of statewide concern,\u201d and concluded it was required to uphold section 25123, subdivision (e)\u2019s constitutionality if its referendum restriction, which was effectively an \u2018\u201cimplied delegation of exclusive decisionmaking authority to the boards of supervisors to adopt and implement memoranda of understanding between counties and their employee associations\u201d (Voters, at pp. 779-780), could be construed as fulfilling some legislative purpose of statewide import. The court inferred the legislative purpose of statewide import existed because of the MMBA, which was \u2018\u201ca statutory scheme in an area of statewide concern that justifies the referendum restriction inherent in section 25123, subdivision (e).\u201d <em>(Voters, </em>at pp. 780, 778-784.)</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">The distinct and limited issue examined in <em>Voters\u2014whether </em>the Legislature clearly and unmistakably intended to delimit the electorate\u2019s referendum rights and (if so) <em>whether </em>that constraint was constitutionally permissible\u2014 has no applicable counterpart here. Although <em>Voters </em>would support the constitutionality of an enactment by the California Legislature barring citizens\u2019 initiatives that seek to amend a city charter to limit employee compensation, we are unaware of any statute clearly and unmistakably barring such citizens\u2019 initiatives<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> (nor have PERB or Unions identified any such bar) and \u2018\u201cwe will presume, absent a clear showing of the Legislature\u2019s intent to the contrary, that . . . local employee compensation decisions [citation] ... are subject to initiative and referendum.\u201d <em>(Voters, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 777.) The courts have repeatedly upheld the ability of the electorate of a charter city to legislate on compensation issues by initiative (see, e.g., <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>City of Alhambra </em>(1941) 44 Cal.App.2d 75, 77-79 [111 P.2d 910]; <em>Kugler </em>v. <em>Yocum </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 371, 374-377 [71 Cal.Rptr. 687, 445 P.2d 303] <em>(Kugler)), </em>and the <em>Voters </em>court specifically declined to extend its holding to disapprove another decision, <em>United Public Employees v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 419 [235 Cal.Rptr. 477], which concluded a charter provision requiring that all increases in employee benefits be subject to voter approval by referendum was compatible with the MMBA. <em>(Voters, </em>at pp. 781-782 &amp; fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Thus, contrary to PERB and Union\u2019s arguments, <em>Voters </em>does not support the conclusion that the MMBA preempts, or superimposes procedural restrictions on, the right of citizens to invoke the initiative process to legislate on compensation issues for the employees of a charter city.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">We conclude, in light of the language of the MMBA and the \u201cclear distinction between voter-sponsored and city-council-generated initiatives\u201d <em>(Friends of Sierra Madre, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 189), a city has no obligation under the MMBA to meet and confer before placing a duly qualified citizen-sponsored initiative on the ballot because such an initiative does not involve a proposal by the \u201cgoverning body\u201d nor could produce an agreement regarding such an initiative that the public agency is authorized to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">C. <em>PERB\u2019s Determination That City Was Obligated by the MMBA to Meet and Confer Before Placing the CPRI on the Ballot Is Erroneous</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">PERB concluded City owed, but failed to discharge, the meet-and-confer obligations imposed by the MMBA on governing bodies by placing the CPRI on the ballot without hrst meeting and conferring with Unions. We have already concluded, contrary to PERB\u2019s apparent opposing conclusion, a governing body has no obligation to meet and confer before placing a duly qualified citizen-sponsored initiative on the ballot, but does have meet-and-confer obligations before placing on the ballot a proposal adopted by the governing body that falls within the parameters of sections 3504.5 and 3505.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We thus turn to the critical question: whether PERB correctly held the CPRI was not a duly qualified citizen-sponsored initiative exempted from the meet-and-confer requirements, but was instead a governing-body-sponsored ballot proposal within the ambit of <em>Seal Beach </em>and the meet-and-confer obligations the MMBA imposes on actions that conshtute a \u201cdetermination of policy\u201d (\u00a7 3505) that have been \u201cproposed [for] adoption] by the governing body\u201d (\u00a7 3504.5, subd. (a)) within the meaning of the MMBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">We begin by noting the evidence was undisputed (and PERB did not conclude to the contrary) the charter amendment embodied in the CPRI was placed on the ballot because it qualified for the ballot under the \u201ccitizens\u2019 initiative\u201d procedures for charter amendments as provided by the hrst clause of article XI, section 3, subdivision (b), of the California Conshtuhon (which provides that a charter amendment \u201cmay be proposed by initiahve or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>governing body\u201d) and the governing provisions of Elections Code 9200 et seq. We also note there was no evidence, and PERB did not find, that the charter amendment embodied in the CPRI was placed on the ballot because it qualified as a ballot measure sponsored or proposed <em>by the governing body </em>of City under the second clause of article XI, section 3, subdivision (b), of the California Constitution.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> (See generally <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 12, 21 [84 Cal.Rptr.3d 10] [stating \u2018\u201c[u]nder the California Conshtuhon there are only two methods for proposing an amendment to a city charter: (1) an <em>initiative </em>qualified for the ballot through signed voter petitions; or (2) a <em>ballot measure </em>sponsored by the governing body of the city,\u201d and noting differing standards applicable to each].) Accordingly, we evaluate whether PERB\u2019s decision, which appears to rest on the theory that the participation by a few government officials and employees in drafting and campaigning for a citizen-sponsored initiative somehow converted the CPRI from a citizen-sponsored initiative into a governing-body-sponsored ballot proposal, is erroneous under applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">We conclude PERB\u2019s determination was error. As a preliminary matter, we believe that, under <em>Yamaha, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1, we must apply de novo review of PERB\u2019s determination, rather than the more deferential standards of review advocated by PERB and Unions, because PERB\u2019s determination turned almost entirely upon its application of the interplay among City\u2019s charter provisions (and Sanders\u2019s powers and responsibilities thereunder), common law principles of agency, and California\u2019s constitutional and statutory provisions governing charter amendments, and did not turn upon resolution of material factual disputes (to which the deferential \u2018\u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard would apply) or upon PERB\u2019s application of legal principles of which PERB\u2019s special expertise with the legal and regulatory milieu <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>surrounding the disputed legal principles would warrant deference. Accordingly, we accord no deference to PERB\u2019s legal conclusions as to the constitutional or statutory scheme governing initiatives <em>(Overstreet ex rel. NLRB v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, Local Union No. 1506, supra, </em>409 F.3d 1199, 1208-1209; <em>Azusa Land Partners </em>v. <em>Department of Industrial Relations, supra, </em>191 Cal.App.4th at p. 14) or to PERB\u2019s application of common law principles of agency over which PERB has no specialized expertise warranting deference.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> (Cf. <em>Styrene Information &amp; Research Center v. Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment </em>(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1082, 1100 [148 Cal.Rptr.3d 776] [no deference where agency in question has no particular interpretive advantage over the courts based on some expertise]; <em>Sanchez v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 575, 584-585 [205 Cal.Rptr. 501, 685 P.2d 61] [agency denied applicant unemployment benefits based on finding employee lacked \u201cgood cause\u201d to leave employment; court reviewed lack of good cause finding de novo as issue of law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">It is clear that, apart from charter commission proposals (see generally \u00a7\u00a7 34451-34458), California recognizes only two avenues by which a proposed city charter amendment may be placed before the electorate: an initiative that qualifies for the ballot through signed voter petitions, or a ballot proposal that qualifies for the ballot because the governing body (here, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>City Council) adopts a resolution placing it on the ballot.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <em>(Hernandez </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>167 Cal.App.4th at p. 21.) Whether PERB correctly concluded meet-and-confer obligations were triggered here rests on whether it properly recast the CPRI from the former into the latter. Because PERB employed several variants of agency theory to reformulate the CPRI from a citizen-sponsored proposal to a City Council-sponsored proposal, we examine PERB\u2019s theories seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">\n<em>Statutory Agency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">PERB\u2019s first theory, which it denominated as a statutory agency theory, focused on the fact that Sanders, both in his capacity as a so-called \u201cstrong mayor\u201d and in his role as the lead negotiator for the City Council in labor-related matters,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> was empowered by the City Charter to recommend \u201cmeasures and ordinances\u201d that he believed to be \u201cnecessary or expedient\u201d (San Diego City Charter, art. XV, \u00a7 265(b)(3)), including recommendations encompassed in his \u201cState of the City\u201d address (see <em>id., </em>art. XV, \u00a7 265(c)). From these predicates, PERB deemed the activities of Sanders in aiding in the drafting of and campaign for the CPRI (both individually and insofar as additional actions were undertaken by the staff of his mayoral office at his direction) to have been the actions of the City Council because he was the \u201cstatutory agent\u201d for the City Council in labor-related matters. Under this theory, PERB appeared to rule that (1) the CPRI was sufficiently interwoven with Sanders\u2019s proposal such that the CPRI was as much Sanders\u2019s proposal as it was Proponents\u2019 proposal, and (2) Sanders was statutorily empowered to act on behalf of (and to make proposals on labor-related matters for) the City Council in labor-related matters, and therefore the CPRI became a City Council-sponsored (or at least cosponsored) proposal carrying meet-and-confer obligations within the meaning of <em>Seal Beach.</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>We conclude reliance on this theory was error because it ignores fundamental principles governing the charter amendment process and the conduct of municipal affairs. First, a charter amendment measure only becomes a \u201cproposal\u201d if it qualifies for the ballot under the citizen-sponsored-proposal provisions (for which no meet-and-confer obligation exists) or qualifies for the ballot as a governing-body-sponsored ballot measure (which would trigger meet-and-confer obligations) under section 34458 et seq. PERB\u2019s statutory agency theory essentially deemed Sanders\u2019s actions to have been those of the City Council, thereby treating the CPRI as a governing-body-sponsored ballot measure, even though the City Charter<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> specifically provides <em>all </em>legislative powers of City are vested in the City Council (San Diego City Charter, art. Ill, \u00a7 11) as City\u2019s legislative body <em>(id., </em>art. XV, \u00a7 270(a)), and provides such legislative power may not be delegated <em>(id., </em>art. III, \u00a7 11.1) but must be exercised by a majority vote of the elected council members. <em>(Id., </em>art III, \u00a7 15; see <em>id., </em>art. XV, \u00a7 270(c).) PERB cites no law suggesting Sanders was in fact (or even could have been) statutorily delegated the power to place a City Council-sponsored ballot proposal on the ballot without submitting it to (and obtaining approval from) the City Council <em>(Kugler, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 375 [legislative power may not be delegated]; <em>City of Redwood City </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 563, 575-576 [42 Cal.Rptr. 72], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>City of San Jose </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 56, 63, fn. 6 [81 Cal.Rptr. 465, 460 P.2d 137] [recognizing \u201cthe general principle that the public powers or trusts devolved by law or charter upon a governing body cannot be delegated to others\u201d]), and because there was no evidence suggesting Sanders sought or obtained such approval, PERB erred in concluding Sanders\u2019s actions in supporting the CPRI were in fact acts creating a City Council-sponsored ballot proposal. (Cf. <em>First Street </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number><em>Plaza Partners v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 650, 667 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 626] [where city charter prescribes procedures for taking binding action, those requirements may not be deemed satisfied by implication from use of procedures different from those specified in charter]; <em>Dynamic Ind. Co. </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach </em>(1958) 159 Cal.App.2d 294, 299 [323 P.2d 768] [\u201cWhen the charter provision has not been complied with, the city may not be held liable in quasi contract, and it will not be estopped to deny the validity of the contract\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">PERB nevertheless argues its agency theory was correct because employers (including governmental entities) can be held liable for unfair labor practices committed by their agent even when the agent\u2019s actions were not formally approved by the governing body. PERB also asserts its agency theory is supported by a 2008 opinion by a former City Attorney (the Aguirre Memo) that concluded, if the mayor \u201cinitiate[d] or sponsor[ed]\u201d a voter petition drive to place a measure on the ballot to amend the City Charter provisions related to retirement pensions, City \u201cwould have the same meet-and-confer obligations with its unions over a voter-initiative sponsored by the Mayor as with any City proposal implicating wages, hours, or other terms and conditions of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">We are unconvinced the Aguirre Memo undermines our analysis, for several reasons. First, a later opinion from the City Attorney rejected the conclusions of the Aguirre Memo, which it described as \u201coverly broad and incomplete in its analysis,\u201d and explained why the City Attorney believed the conclusions reached by the Aguirre Memo were unsound.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Second, PERB cites nothing to suggest the opinions expressed in the Aguirre Memo are somehow binding on City, much less that such opinions are entitled to any deference by this court. <em>(Yamaha, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1, 11 [\u201can agency\u2019s <em>legal-opinion, </em>however \u2018expert,\u2019 . . . commands a commensurably lesser degree of judicial deference\u201d].) Because the Aguirre Memo reached its conclusions without considering (or even mentioning) the limiting language of section 3504.5, which triggers meet-and-confer obligations only as to \u201cany ordinance, rule, resolution, or regulation . . . <em>proposed to be adopted by the governing body,\u201d </em>its conclusion that meet-and-confer obligations exist for a mayoral-initiated voter petition drive (which appears to have rested on the erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>assumption that a measure supported by the mayor is equivalent to a measure proposed to be adopted by the governing body) is unpersuasive. (\u00a7 3504.5, subd. (a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">We are equally unpersuaded that the cases cited by PERB that upheld unfair labor practices claims against governmental entities for conduct by their agents even when the agent\u2019s actions were undertaken without approval by the governing body have any relevance here. In the cases relied on by PERB, the agents\u2019 unapproved actions involved statements or actions by the agents that are declared to be unfair labor practices without the necessity of any predicate involvement by the governing body. Specifically, the unapproved actions interfered with, restrained, or coerced the employees in violation of section 3506, part of the MMBA (see <em>Public Employees Assn. v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 797, 806-807 [213 Cal.Rptr. 491] [\u201csection 3506 is patterned closely after section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA [citation] [,] which provides it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to \u2018interfere with, restrain, or coerce\u2019 employees in the exercise of rights to \u2018bargain collectively\u2019 \u201d]) or in violation of section 3543.5, subdivision (a). However, both of those sections are distinct from section 3504.5, because both of those sections condemn specified conduct as unlawful labor practices, regardless of whether that specified conduct was accompanied by actions of the governing body.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In contrast, the unlawful labor practice condemned by section 3504.5\u2014the failure to meet and confer\u2014is condemned <em>only </em>if preceded by specified conduct or actions of the governing body, i.e., when there is an \u201cordinance, rule, resolution, or regulation directly relating to matters within the scope of representation proposed to be adopted by the governing body.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (a).) Because section 3504.5 requires predicate action by \u201cthe governing body\u201d before the meet-and-confer obligations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>section 3505 can be triggered, cases addressing statutes that do not contemplate similar predicate action by a governing body have no persuasive value on the issues presented by the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">For all of these reasons, we agree with City that PERB erred in applying \u201cstatutory agency\u201d principles to find the CPRI was a de facto governing-body-sponsored ballot proposal that could have triggered meet-and-confer obligations within the contemplation of section 3504.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">\n<em>Common Law Agency: Actual Authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">PERB\u2019s second set of theories, which it denominated as a common law agency theory, focused on the common law doctrine of when a principal can be charged with the acts of its agent. PERB\u2019s articulated rationale for attributing Sanders\u2019s support of the CPRI (as putative agent) to the City Council (as putative principal) under \u201cactual authority\u201d principles was that actual authority is the authority a principal either intentionally confers on the agent or \u201cby want of ordinary care\u201d allows the agent to believe himself to possess (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2316), and a principal is responsible to third parties for the wrongful acts of an agent in transacting the principal\u2019s business regardless of whether the acts were authorized or ratified by the principal. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2330, 2338.) Under this theory, PERB noted (1) Sanders had broad authority as mayor to recommend legislation to the City Council, (2) he pursued pension reform as a goal for his remaining tenure as mayor and for the announced purpose of improving City\u2019s financial well-being, and (3) the City Council was aware of Sanders\u2019s desire for pension reform and of his efforts to implement it through a citizen-sponsored initiative. From these facts, PERB concluded Sanders\u2019s actions could be charged to the City Council because \u201cby want of ordinary care, the City Council allowed Sanders to believe that he could pursue a citizens\u2019 initiative to alter employee pension benefits, and that no conflict existed between his duties as the City\u2019s chief executive officer and spokesperson for collective bargaining and his rights as a private citizen. . . . Sanders acted with actual authority because proposing necessary legislation and negotiating pension benefits with the Unions were within the scope of the Mayor\u2019s authority and because the City acquiesced to his public promotion of the initiative, [and] by placing the measure on the ballot, . . . while accepting the considerable financial benefits resulting from the passage and implementation of [the CPRI].\u201d (Fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">We conclude PERB\u2019s use of a common law agency theory, which PERB appears to have used in order to find Sanders\u2019s actions are to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>charged to or deemed the acts of the City Council, is erroneous.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> \u201cActual\u201d authority is (1) the authority the principal intentionally gives the agent, or (2) the authority the principal intentionally or negligently allows the agent to believe he possesses. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2316.) There is no evidence the City Council <em>actually </em>authorized Sanders to act on its behalf to formulate and campaign for the CPRI, nor any evidence Sanders <em>believed </em>he was acting or had the authority to act <em>on behalf of the City Council </em>when he took those actions.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\"><em>PERB\u2019s \u201cApparent Agency\u201d </em>Theory<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">PERB\u2019s decision also relied on common law agency principles of \u201capparent authority\u201d to support charging the City Council (as putative principal) with the acts of Sanders (as putative agent) in promulgating and supporting the CPRI. PERB\u2019s articulated rationale for attributing Sanders\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>support of the CPRI to the City Council under \u201capparent\u201d authority principles was that the City Council intentionally or negligently caused or allowed the employees to reasonably believe Sanders was acting on behalf of the City Council in promulgating and supporting the CPRI within the meaning of the apparent authority principles codified in Civil Code section 2317. PERB, although acknowledging that <em>Inglewood, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d 767 required the party asserting an agency relationship by way of apparent authority to satisfy the burden of proving the elements of that theory <em>(id, </em>at p. 780) and that \u201c[m]ere surmise as to the authority of an agent is insufficient to impose liability on the principal\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 782), concluded <em>Inglewood's </em>test was satisfied. PERB reasoned that, because employees knew Sanders was an elected official and City\u2019s chief executive officer, and knew Sanders touted the CPRI as a measure that was in the best interests of City, employees \u201cwould reasonably conclude[] that the City Council had authorized or permitted [Sanders] to pursue his campaign for pension reform to avoid meeting and conferring with employee labor representatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">We conclude PERB\u2019s \u201capparent agency\u201d rationale is erroneous, for several reasons. First, apparent agency focuses on whether the principal (either intentionally or by want of ordinary care) caused or allowed a third person to believe the agent possessed authority to act on behalf of the principal (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2317), and therefore must be established through the conduct <em>of the principal </em>and cannot be created merely by a purported agent\u2019s conduct or representations.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> <em>(Mosesian </em>v. <em>Bagdasarian </em>(1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 361, 367 [67 Cal.Rptr. 369]; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Horizon West, Inc. </em>(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1122, 1132 [163 Cal.Rptr.3d 704].) Thus, even assuming apparent agency <em>could </em>be applied to permit Sanders\u2019s actions to somehow \u201cbind\u201d the City Council into being a cosponsor of the CPRI,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> PERB\u2019s decision (and PERB\u2019s and Unions\u2019 briefs on appeal) cite only the actions of Sanders and his staff as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>evidentiary foundation for application of \u201capparent\u201d agency theory. Neither PERB\u2019s decision nor PERB\u2019s and Unions\u2019 briefs on appeal cite any evidence that the putative principal (the City Council) affirmatively did or said anything that could have caused or allowed a reasonable employee to believe Sanders had been authorized to act on behalf of the City Council in promoting the CPRI, which undermines PERB\u2019s \u201capparent\u201d agency theory.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">PERB\u2019s \u201capparent\u201d agency theory in the present decision eschewed any reliance on affirmative manifestations by the City Council affirming Sanders\u2019s support for the CPRI was on its behalf.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Instead, PERB relied solely on the fact that Sanders supported the CPRI while occupying an office the responsibilities of which included acting for the City Council as the labor relations point man and recommending measures on labor issues to the City Council, and based thereon concluded Sanders had apparent or actual discretionary authority to promote the CPRI on behalf of the City Council, and therefore the City Council can be charged with liability for Sanders\u2019s failure to meet and confer over the CPRI. We recognize that \u201capparent\u201d agency, like a respondeat superior theory (see <em>Inglewood, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at p. 779 [noting courts do not always distinguish between ostensible agency theory and tort doctrine of respondeat superior]), permits a third party to hold a principal liable for the wrongful conduct of his agent within the scope of his authority even where the agent was not operating with the express authorization of his principal when engaging in that conduct. (See generally <em>Saks v. Charity Mission Baptist Church </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1137-1139 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 45]; <em>J.L. </em>v. <em>Children \u2019s Institute, Inc. </em>(2009) <em>111 </em>Cal.App.4th 388, 403 [99 Cal.Rptr.3d 5] [noting ostensible agency principles can be used to hold principal vicariously liable for agent\u2019s acts].)<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> In the field of labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>relations, some cases decided under the Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975 (ALRA; Lab. Code, \u00a7 1140) have upheld imposing liability on an employer for an act by an agent that constituted an unfair labor practice, even when such act was not expressly authorized by the employer, as long as such act was within the scope of the agent\u2019s duties.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> (See <em>Vista Verde Farms </em>v. <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 307 [172 Cal.Rptr. 720, 625 P.2d 263]; <em>Superior Farming Co. v. Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 100 [198 Cal.Rptr. 608].) However, decisions under the ALRA provide little guidance because \u201cunder the ALRA, application of the NLRA standard is statutorily mandated\u201d <em>(Inglewood, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at p. 778), and those standards are not premised on common law principles <em>(id. </em>at pp. 776-777; accord, <em>Superior Farming Co., </em>at p. 118 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>[\u201cemployer responsibility for acts of agents or quasi-agents ... is not governed by common law agency principles\u201d]; see also fn. 49, <em>ante), </em>nor have PERB or Unions demonstrated there are sufficient parallels between the relevant provisions of the MMBA and the ALRA to permit cases decided under the latter scheme to provide persuasive guidance under the distinct scheme of the MMBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">More importantly, affixing vicarious liability upon a principal under common law agency principles, regardless of whether the principal authorized the explicit conduct at issue, appears to presuppose the agent committed a wrongful act <em>ab initio. </em>(Cf. <em>Bayuk v. Edson </em>(1965) 236 Cal.App.2d 309, 320 [46 Cal.Rptr. 49].) This theory may well justify charging a principal with liability for an agent\u2019s acts that are inherently wrongful and injurious, such as the act committed by the agent in <em>Vista Verde Farms </em>v. <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd., supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at pp. 317-318 (in which the court noted the agent\u2019s acts violated Lab. Code, \u00a7 1153 and \u201cwould unquestionably constitute an unfair labor practice under [citation] if engaged in directly by the employer\u201d), regardless of whether the principal authorized those acts. However, the act alleged here\u2014an individual\u2019s advocacy for a citizen-sponsored initiative effecting employee benefits\u2014is not an inherently wrongful act,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> nor are we persuaded the MMBA explicitly proscribes such conduct merely because that individual occupies public office. Instead, the MMBA only requires compliance with the meet-and-confer mandate of section 3504.5 when there is some action \u201cproposed to be adopted by the governing body\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (a)), and has no apparent applicability when the \u201cgoverning body\u201d is not affirmatively involved with the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">We conclude PERB\u2019s reliance on common law principles of \u201capparent\u201d agency or respondeat superior, in order to charge the City Council (as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>putative principal) with the acts of Sanders (as putative agent) in promulgating and supporting the CPRI despite the absence of any evidence the City Council actually authorized these acts, is without legal support and was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">\n<em>PERB\u2019s \u201cRatification\u201d Theory</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">PERB\u2019s decision also relied on common law principles of \u201cratification\u201d to support charging the City Council (as putative principal) with the acts of Sanders (as putative agent) in promulgating and supporting the CPRI. As articulated by PERB, the City Council adopted Sanders\u2019s actions in promulgating and supporting the CPRI as their own measure because \u201cAn agency relationship may also be established by adoption or subsequent ratification of the acts of another. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2307, 2310.) It is well established as a principal of labor law that where a party ratifies the conduct of another, the party adopting such conduct also accepts responsibility for any unfair practices implicated by that conduct. [Citing <em>Compton Unified School Dish </em>(2003) PERB Decision No. 1518E at page 5 and <em>Dowd </em>v. <em>International Longshoremen \u2019s Assn., AFL-CIO </em>(11th Cir. 1992) 975 F.2d 779, 785-786.] Thus, ratification may impose liability for the acts of employees or representatives, even when the principal is not at fault and takes no active part in those acts. [Citation.] Ratification may be express or implied, and an implied ratification may be found if an employer fails to investigate or respond to allegations of wrongdoing by its employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">PERB\u2019s decision, noting it was adequately shown the City Council had actual or constructive knowledge of Sanders\u2019s actions in support of the CPRI, relied on two grounds for applying \u201cratification\u201d to convert Sanders\u2019s support for the citizen-sponsored CPRI initiative into City Council support for that initiative: the City Council\u2019s inaction (because it was aware of Sanders\u2019s support but did not disavow or repudiate his conduct), and the City Council\u2019s actions in placing the CPRI on the ballot while rejecting Unions\u2019 \u201cmeet-and-confer\u201d demands and accepting the financial benefits accruing from its passage. We conclude none of these grounds support PERB\u2019s determination that the City Council can be deemed to have promulgated or supported the CPRI under ratification principles.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>The first basis for PERB\u2019s ratification theory appears to be that the City Council did not disavow or repudiate Sanders\u2019s conduct. Although the failure to repudiate otherwise wrongful conduct can warrant charging a putative principal with responsibility for any unfair practices implicated by that conduct, as was the case in <em>Compton Unified School Dist., supra, </em>PERB Decision No. 1518E [27 PERC \u00b6 56] and <em>Dowd v. International Longshoremen \u2019s Assn., AFL-CIO, supra, </em>975 F.2d 779, this presupposes the issue to be determined: whether Sanders\u2019s conduct <em>was </em>an unfair labor practice. (See fn. 50, <em>ante.) </em>We are aware of no law holding that an elected official\u2019s support (however vigorous) for a citizen-sponsored ballot measure impacting a subject otherwise negotiable under the MMBA violates the meet-and-confer provisions (or any other provision) of the MMBA, and we are convinced Sanders was entitled to support the CPRI (either as an individual or through capitalizing on his office\u2019s bully pulpit) because he was not supporting the proposal as the \u201cgoverning body,\u201d which is the only entity constrained by the meet-and-confer obligations under the MMBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Moreover, reliance on the City Council\u2019s inaction is incompatible with other common law principles of ratification, which recognize that \u201c \u2018ratification can be made only in the manner that would have been necessary to confer an original authority for the act ratified . . . .\u2019 (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2310.) Thus, where the equal dignities rule applies, it requires formal, written ratification.\u201d <em>(van\u2019t Rood v. County of Santa Clara </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 549, 571 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 746]; accord, <em>John Paul Lumber Co. v. Agnew </em>(1954) 125 Cal.App.2d 613, 622 [270 P.2d 1044] [corporation\u2019s ratification of alleged agent\u2019s unauthorized sale of its property can only be effected through a resolution of its board of directors when duly assembled].) Accordingly, absent a majority vote of the elected council members (City Charter, art. III, \u00a7 15; see <em>id., </em>art. XV, \u00a7 270(c)), it is improper to find that Sanders\u2019s support for a citizen-sponsored initiative could convert the CPRI into a City Council-sponsored ballot proposal under ratification principles. <em>(Kugler, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 375; <em>First Street Plaza Partners v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at p. 667 [where city charter prescribes procedures for taking binding action, those requirements may not be satisfied by implication from use of procedures different from those specified in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>charter]; cf. <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Maxey </em>(1927) 84 Cal.App. 532, 547-549 [258 P. 717] [declining to apply ratification principles to validate act where act was one county board was incapable of delegating].)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">Finally, insofar as PERB premised ratification on the City Council\u2019s placing the CPRI on the ballot, and the City Council\u2019s acceptance of the financial benefits accruing from its passage by the voters, we conclude that theory also lacks legal foundation. This aspect of PERB\u2019s legal analysis rests on the unstated predicate that the City Council could have declined to place the CPRI on the ballot or to accept the financial benefits accruing from its passage, and that its decision to act to the contrary adopted Sanders\u2019s otherwise unauthorized conduct by ratification. However, ratification has no application when the principal is unable to decline the benefits of an agent\u2019s unauthorized actions. (See generally <em>Pacific Bone etc. v. Bleakmore </em>(1927) 81 Cal.App. 659, 664-665 [254 P. 618].) The City Council was required by the Elections Code to place the CPRI before the voters (without alteration) because it qualified for the ballot (cf. <em>Blotter </em>v. <em>Farrell </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 804, 812-813 [270 P.2d 481]), and PERB cites no authority suggesting the City Council could have elected to ignore the mandates of the CPRI (by refusing to accept the financial benefits accruing from its passage) once the CPRI was approved by the voters. Accordingly, the fact the City Council complied with its legal obligations cannot support PERB\u2019s ratification theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">D. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">We conclude, for the reasons previously explained, a city has no obligation under the MMBA to meet and confer before placing a duly qualified citizen-sponsored initiative on the ballot, and only owes such obligations before placing a governing-body-sponsored ballot proposal on the ballot. We further conclude PERB\u2019s fundamental premise\u2014that under agency principles Sanders\u2019s support for the CPRI converted it from a citizen-sponsored initiative on which no meet-and-confer obligations were imposed into a City Council-sponsored ballot proposal to which section 3504.5\u2019s meet-and-confer obligations became applicable\u2014is legally erroneous. Because PERB\u2019s remaining determinations\u2014that the City Council engaged in an unfair labor practice when it defaulted on its obligations under section 3504.5 and that PERB\u2019s \u201cmake whole\u201d remedies for that alleged unfair labor practice could order City to de facto refuse to comply with the CPRI\u2014proceeded from this fundamental but legally erroneous premise, PERB\u2019s decision must be annulled and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion. <em>(San Mateo City School Dist. v.

Apparently, during the transition period to a 401(k)-style plan for new employees, there would be an immediate shorter term cost to City (because the change in the actuarial method used in doing the calculation would increase City\u2019s payments into the pension plan in the first three or four years), and a proposal for a \u201chard cap\u201d on total payroll expenses could have mitigated the short-term impacts on City from the pension reform proposal.

Moreover, PERB acknowledges numerous other courts have reached the same conclusion as to other procedural prerequisites. (See, e.g.. <em>Associated Home Builders etc..

Those statutes provide that all county ordinances, with certain enumerated exceptions, \u201cshall become effective 30 days from and after the date of final passage\u201d by the board of supervisors (Elec. Code, \u00a7 9141, subd. (b)), and Elections Code section 9144 provides that between the date of the adoption of the ordinance and the date the ordinance becomes finally effective 30 days later, a petition signed by the requisite number of voters will suspend the ordinance and compel the board of supervisors to reconsider it. If the board of supervisors fails to \u201centirely repeal\u201d the ordinance, it must be submitted to a countywide referendum. <em>(Id.. </em>\u00a79145.) However, Elections Code section 9141 <em>excepts </em>certain types of county ordinances from the 30-day effective date rule, providing instead that these ordinances go into effect immediately, including ordinances \u201cspecifically required by law to take immediate effect.\u201d <em>(Id.. </em>subd. (a)(2).) These provisions, when read together, \u201cmake[] clear that when the Legislature desired to denominate certain types of ordinances that were not subject to county referendum procedures, it did so not by specifically declaring these ordinances ineligible for referendum, but rather by providing that they go into effect immediately.\u201d <em>(Voters, supra. </em>8 Cal.4th at p. <em>777.) </em>The court then noted section 25123 (which parallels Elec. Code, \u00a79141 et seq. in providing all county ordinances shall become effective 30 days from final passage except for certain classes of ordinances, which are to go into effect immediately), specifically provides at subdivision (e) that ordinances related to the adoption or implementation of MOU\u2019s with employee organizations are to take effect immediately. This statutory scheme convinced the court that, by designating MOU ordinances as a class of ordinances specifically required by law to take effect immediately, the Legislature evinced an unmistakable intent to exempt such ordinances from the referendum procedures. <em>(Voters, supra, </em>at p. 777.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b787-6\"> Indeed, the <em>Voters </em>court noted the statute it was considering \u201cis applicable to counties only and has no counterpart for cities,\u201d and hence cautioned that \u201c[w]e do not decide whether <em>city </em>ordinances that adopt or implement memorandums of understanding pursuant to the MMBA are subject to referendum.\u201d <em>(Voters, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 784, fn. 6.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b788-9\"> The parties have brought to our attention the recent decision in <em>City of Palo Alto </em>v. <em>Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 1271 [211 Cal.Rptr.3d 287], which evaluated whether the City of Palo Alto committed an unfair' labor practice when it failed to meet and consult with the unions before placing a ballot proposal on the ballot. We conclude that case provides no guidance here because it involved whether a governing body owed meet-and-consult obligations before it could place a <em>city </em>council-sponsored ballot proposal on the ballot <em>(id. </em>at p. 1284), and <em>not </em>whether a governing body owes meet-and-confer obligations for a citizen-sponsored initiative when some city officials and city staff members assisted in drafting and campaigning for the initiative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b789-5\"> Finally, we note the record is devoid of any evidence, and PERB did not find, that Proponents of the CPRI were merely straw men used by the City Council (as governing body for City) to achieve placement of a City Council-sponsored proposal onto the ballot as a ruse to circumvent the concomitant meet-and-confer obligations that would have been required for an <em>overt </em>City Council-sponsored ballot proposal. In <em>San Diego Municipal Employees, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.4th 1447, this court noted the unions\u2019 UPC\u2019s alleged a significant factual claim\u2014that the CPRI was not a true citizen-sponsored initiative but was instead a sham device employed to circumvent the meet-and-confer obligations owed by City under the MMBA <em>(San Diego Municipal Employees, </em>at p. 1463)\u2014which in turn raised the question of whether \u201cthe CPRI (while nominally a citizen initiative) was actually placed on the ballot by City using straw men to avoid its MMBA obligations\u201d <em>(id, </em>at p. 1460). It was because such activity was <em>arguably </em>prohibited by public employment labor law within PERB\u2019s initial exclusive jurisdiction <em>(ibid.) </em>that led us to conclude it was error to divest PERB of its ability to conduct proceedings on this issue <em>(ibid,). </em>However, PERB\u2019s decision did not sustain this allegation; to the contrary, PERB\u2019s decision appeared to reject Unions\u2019 claims that Proponents acted as agents for City in pursuing the CPRI. Accordingly, we have no occasion to address the distinct issue of whether an entity would violate its meet-and-confer obligations if its <em>governing body </em>sought to avoid its meet-and-confer obligations by enlisting private citizens to recast a governing-body-sponsored ballot proposal into a citizen-sponsored initiative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b790-6\"> PERB, citing <em>Garlock Sealing Technologies.

Certainly, the existence of an agency relationship can present a question of fact. However, when the material facts are undisputed, the question of the existence of a principal-agent relationship is a matter of law for the courts (see, e.g., <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Coldwell Banker Residential Affiliates. Inc. </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 741, 745 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 640]), of which PERB has no specialized expertise. Indeed, because we will conclude the relevant inquiry is <em>not </em>whether Sanders was an agent for City (at least in some capacities), but instead whether he was the actual or ostensible agent <em>for the governing body </em>when he helped draft and campaign for the CPRI, we will examine whether PERB correctly concluded Sanders\u2019s actions can be charged to a governing body under common law principles. For example, under common law principles, unless a party (the putative principal) has the legal right to control the action of the other person (the putative agent), the former ordinarily cannot be held vicariously liable for the other person\u2019s acts on an agency theory. (See generally <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Freeman </em>(1949) 34 Cal.2d 589, 592 [212 P.2d 883] [absent right of control, no true agency and therefore no imputation of wrongdoer\u2019s negligence]; Kap<em>lan, </em>at p. 746 [\u201cAbsent a showing that Coldwell Banker controlled or had the right to control the day-to-day operations of Marsh\u2019s office, it was not liable for Marsh\u2019s acts or omissions as a real estate broker on a true agency-respondeat superior theory.\u201d].) Thus, even if the appropriate inquiry was under a \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d rubric, there is no evidence the City Council had the <em>right </em>to control Sanders\u2019s actions here, and hence there would be no substantial evidence to support the conclusion Sanders was the agent of the City Council in promulgating and promoting the CPRI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b791-6\"> Section 34458 et seq. prescribing the methods for a governing body to place a proposed charter amendment before the voters, only appeal's to permit \u201cthe governing body\u201d to make the proposal and submit it to the voters for approval. <em>(Id., </em>subd.

If the negotiations between Sanders and a bargaining unit produced a tentative agreement, however.

We reject this reading of the statutory scheme. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>3504.5, subdivision (a) describes <em>when </em>meet-and-confer obligations are triggered (i.e., when there is an \u201cordinance, rule, resolution, or regulation directly relating to matters within the scope of representation proposed to be adopted by the governing body\u201d), and section 3505 describes <em>how </em>that process should be accomplished, including <em>who </em>(i.e., the \u201cgoverning body ... or other representatives as may be properly designated by law or by such governing body\u201d) shall participate on behalf of the governing body.

However, even assuming this theory can apply here (but see fn. 45, <em>ante). </em>PERB recognized that Sanders repeatedly stated his efforts in promoting the CPRI were in his capacity as a private citizen, and there is no evidence Sanders ever claimed his efforts were as the City Council\u2019s representative, which renders the City Council\u2019s inaction or silence incapable of supporting an \u201capparent\u201d authority finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b798-7\"> PERB\u2019s prior decisions have appeared to acknowledge that \u201c \u2018apparent authority to act on behalf of the employer may be found where <em>the manifestations of the employer </em>create a reasonable basis for employees to believe that the employer has authorized the alleged agent to perform the act in question\u2019 \u201d <em>(Trustees of the California State University </em>(2014) PERB Dec.

No. 2384-H.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b799-5\"> PERB\u2019s brief in this writ proceeding also asserts it was appropriate for the PERB decision to charge the City Council with Sanders\u2019s actions because he \u201cacted within the scope of his authority as lead labor negotiator\u201d in supporting the CPRI, which can be sufficient under NLRA precedent (see <em>H. J. Heinz Co. </em>v. <em>Labor Board </em>(1941) 311 U.S. 514, 520-521 [85 L.Ed. 309, 61 S.Ct. 320]; <em>I. </em>A. <em>of M. </em>v. <em>Labor Board </em>(1940) 311 U.S. 72, 80 [85 L.Ed. 50, 61 S.Ct. 83]) to charge an employer with the wrongful conduct of its supervisory personnel. However, the court in <em>Inglewood </em>recognized NLRA precedent is of limited value in the Education Employment Relations Act (EERA) arena because \u201cthere are significant differences between the two statutes\u201d and \u201cat times, PERB has even stated that not only is NLRA precedent not controlling, it may not even be instructive.\u201d <em>(Inglewood, supra. </em>227 Cal.App.3d at p. 777.) We note that, under the NLRA, an employer is specifically defined to include \u201cany person acting as an agent of an employer, directly or indirectly\u201d (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(2)), and explicitly states that \u201c[i]n determining whether any person is acting as an \u2018agent\u2019 of another person so as to make such other person responsible for his acts, the question of whether the specific acts performed were actually authorized or subsequently ratified shall not be controlling.\u201d (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(13).) In light of that statutory scheme, the <em>Heinz </em>court explained \u201c[t]he question is not one of legal liability of the employer in damages or for penalties on principles of agency or <em>respondeat superior, </em>but only whether the [NLRA] condemns such activities as unfair labor practices so far as the employer may gain from them any advantage in the bargaining process of a kind which the Act proscribes.\u201d <em>(Heinz, </em>at p. 521.) Although NLRA precedent can be relevant in some circumstances (see, e.g.. <em>International Assn, of Fire Fighters. Local 188. AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 259, 272 [120 Cal.Rptr.3d 117, 245 P.3d 845]), it is too distinct from the issue presented here: whether the MMBA was designed to permit the governing body to be charged with the unapproved conduct of its agents (cf. <em>Inglewood, </em>at p. 778 [rejecting union argument that agent should be included in definition of employer under EERA, because \u201c[s]ince the Legislature is deemed to be aware of the content of its own statutory enactments, it is a reasonable inference that the Legislature would have included the term agent in the definition of employer under the EERA if it wanted school districts perpetually exposed to liability for any unfair labor practice committed by an agent of a school district\u201d]), particularly when the specific conduct\u2014compliance with the meet-and-confer mandate of section 3504.5\u2014is triggered only when there is some action \u201cproposed to be adopted by the governing body\u201d (\u00a7 3504.5, subd. (a)) rather than some action proposed by a putative agent of the governing body.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b800-7\"> To the contrary, Sanders\u2019s advocacy for the CPRI is not inherently wrongful, but is instead protected under both statutory law (see \u00a7\u00a7 3203 [\u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this chapter, or as necessary to meet requirements of federal law as it pertains to a particular' employee or employees, no restriction shall be placed on the political activities of any officer or employee of a state or local agency\u201d], 3209 [\u201c[n]othing in this chapter prevents an officer ... of a state or local agency from soliciting or receiving political funds or contributions to promote the passage or defeat of a ballot measure which would affect the rate of pay, hours of work, retirement, civil service, or other working conditions of officers or employees of such state or local agency, except that a state or local agency may prohibit or limit such activities by its employees during their working hours\u201d]) and under the Constitution. (See generally <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1962) 370 U.S. 375, 394 [8 L.Ed.2d 569, 82 S.Ct. 1364] [\u201cpetitioner was an elected official and had the right to enter the field of political controversy\u201d]; <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Floyd </em>(1966) 385 U.S. 116, 136-137 [17 L.Ed.2d 235, 87 S.Ct. 339].) Accordingly, common law principles of \u201capparent\u201d agency or respondeat superior, which permit a third party to hold a principal liable for the <em>wrongful </em>acts of his agent, have no application here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\"> We note that, in this writ proceeding, PERB\u2019s brief appeal's to focus almost exclusively on the foundational issue\u2014whether there was substantial evidence the City Council was aware of Sanders\u2019s conduct and \u201cfailed to disavow it\u201d\u2014with almost no discussion of whether (in light of that knowledge) the City Council\u2019s inaction (failure to disavow), or action (placing the CPRI on the ballot and rejecting Unions\u2019 \u201cmeet-and-confer\u201d demands), or acceptance of the financial benefits supports the legal conclusion that the City Council adopted Sanders\u2019s support for the citizen-sponsored CPRI as its own under ratification principles. Similarly, Unions\u2019 brief is largely silent on this issue, arguing only that (by failing to meet and confer over the CPRI) \u201cthe City Council ratified [Sanders\u2019s] unlawful scheme . . . .\u201d This argument\u2014that the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>Council\u2019s <em>lawful </em>rejection of Unions\u2019 meet-and-confer demands (based on our conclusion there are no meet-and-confer obligations on citizen-sponsored initiatives, see pt. IVB., <em>ante) </em>converted such conduct into an <em>unlawful </em>rejection of those meet-and-confer demands under ratification principles\u2014amounts to a <em>petitio principii </em>argument <em>(Jasmine Networks, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 980, 1005 [103 Cal.Rptr.3d 426]) and sheds no light on the propriety of PERB\u2019s conclusion. While this lacuna would permit us to deem this claim abandoned <em>(Landry </em>v. <em>Berryessa Union School Dist. </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 691, 699-700 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 119] [\u201c[w]hen an issue is unsupported by pertinent or cognizable legal argument it may be deemed abandoned and discussion by the reviewing court is unnecessary\u201d]), we nevertheless examine PERB\u2019s stated basis for its \u201cratification\u201d theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
