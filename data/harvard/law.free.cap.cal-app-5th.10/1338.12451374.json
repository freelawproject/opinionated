Code, \u00a7 4502, subd. (a))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and assault by an inmate by means likely to cause great bodily injury (\u00a7 4501). The trial court found true three prior strike allegations. (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12.) The trial court sentenced defendant to consecutive terms of 25 years to life on each count. In an unpublished opinion, this court affirmed the judgment. <em>(People v. Valdez </em>(May 13, 2003, C038924) [nonpub. opn.] (Valdez).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-10\">Defendant appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition for recall of sentence under the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (enacted by Prop. 36, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012); \u00a7\u00a7 667, 1170.12, 1170.126) (Proposition 36 or the Act). As to each conviction, defendant asserts that: (1) the trial court was not authorized to make findings of fact and the People were required to plead and prove any disqualifying facts in the prosecution of his commitment offense; (2) substantial evidence did not support the trial court\u2019s determinations regarding his ineligibility; and (3) the trial court employed the wrong standard of proof, in that it should have applied the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard rather than the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard. Defendant also asserts that, if we conclude that he is eligible for resentencing on one conviction but ineligible on the other, he should be resentenced on the eligible offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-11\">In the published part of this opinion we conclude there was substantial evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s determination that defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>\u201carmed\u201d with the sharp instrument in prison. Defendant had the weapon available for use while he possessed it in his cell and the fact that the weapon was seized from his cell by correctional officers while defendant was away taking a shower does not make defendant eligible for resentencing under Proposition 36. Possession of a weapon can be a continuing offense. Consequently, a person is armed with a weapon for purposes of the Proposition 36 resentencing exception if the evidence from the record of conviction establishes that he or she was present with the weapon and had it available for use <em>at any time </em>he or she had actual or constructive possession of it within the time period for which the defendant was charged and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">In the unpublished parts of this opinion, we discuss and reject defendant\u2019s other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Aly\">Current Convictions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-8\">\n<em>Possession of a Sharp Instrument in Prison (\u00a7 4502)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-9\">\u201cIn December 1998, Correctional Officer Kevin Keene was working as a floor officer in the administrative segregation section of \u2018six block\u2019 of the California State Prison, Sacramento. While defendant and codefendant Jose Alberto Dubon were away taking showers, Keene conducted a routine search of their cell. The cell had two bunks and a toilet on the right-hand side and upper and lower cubicles on the left-hand side.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-10\">\u201cIn the upper cubicle, Keene found a long stiff straight object wrapped in plastic. When he unwrapped it, Keene saw that the object was an \u2018altered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>toothbrush with razor melted\u2019 into the handle, \u2018with cardboard cover piece, . . . two pieces of clear cellophane plastic.\u2019 Keene confiscated the object, put it into evidence, and notified the sergeant of his discovery. No inmates other than defendant and Dubon would have been allowed in their cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">\u201cKeene testified that inmates in administrative segregation are not allowed to have disposable razors or sharp metal objects. Inmates in the general population are allowed to have razors but are not allowed to alter them or remove them from their plastic casings. . . . Keene was not sure which inmate ordinarily used the upper cubicle.\u201d (Valdez, <em>supra, </em>C038924, fn. omitted.) We set forth additional facts regarding this offense in our discussion, <em>post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\"><em>Assault by Inmate by Means Likely to Cause Great Bodily Injury (\u00a7 4501) </em>'</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-8\">\u201cSeveral months after the incident in count three, defendant, Dubon, and two other inmates were seen assaulting a newer inmate. Defendant struck the victim from the back at about the same time that Dubon struck him in the front. Defendant and Dubon kicked the victim with \u2018full force kicks.\u2019 Both men ignored Correctional Officer Ernest Johnson\u2019s order to stop fighting and were undeterred when he fired a special gun that shot rubber grommets. When Johnson resorted to tear gas, the inmates dispersed. At that point, the victim was on the ground and was not moving. He later regained consciousness and tried to stand but fell down a couple of times. He suffered multiple injuries to his face and head, including a large hematoma to his right forehead, an open contusion on his right forehead, a bloody nose, multiple bruising to his upper face, blood in his mouth, a shoe imprint on the left side of his face, and abrasions on both knees and elbows.\u201d (Valdez, <em>supra, </em>C038924.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-9\">Petition for Resentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-10\">In 2014, defendant filed a petition for recall of his sentence pursuant to section 1170.126, which is part of the Act. Defendant asserted that, under section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(1), his convictions of possession of a sharp instrument while in prison (\u00a7 4502, subd. (a)) and assault by a prisoner by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury (\u00a7 4501) were neither serious felonies within the meaning of section 1192.7, nor violent felonies within the meaning of section 667.5, and therefore these convictions did not render him ineligible for resentencing under the Act. Defendant also asserted that, in violating sections 4501 and 4502, subdivision (a), he was not armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, did not use a firearm or deadly weapon, and he did not intend to cause great bodily injury to another person within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>meaning of section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iii), and therefore he was not ineligible for resentencing under the Act. (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) Defendant further asserted that these convictions did not otherwise render him ineligible for relief. Thus, according to defendant, he satisfied all of the criteria for resentencing under the Act, and he requested that the trial court resentence him as a second strike offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">Trial Court\u2019s Denial of Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">The trial court rejected each of defendant\u2019s contentions and denied the petition. We discuss <em>post </em>the court\u2019s factual findings concerning each conviction and its determination of resentencing ineligibility based on those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-7\">The trial court also rejected defendant\u2019s contention that, if it were to make findings of fact relevant to issues, it would violate the mandate of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348] that findings of fact that may result in an increase in punishment must be made by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The court ruled that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to section 1170.126 resentencing proceedings because resentencing pursuant to that section would constitute a downward departure from a previously imposed sentence, and there is no requirement that disqualifying factors must have previously been pleaded and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-8\">The trial court also ruled that its conclusion as to either conviction rendered defendant ineligible for resentencing under the Act. In this regard, the trial court followed those cases which had concluded that a defendant is ineligible for resentencing under the Act if <em>any </em>of the defendant\u2019s current convictions render him or her ineligible, although the court noted that the issue was pending before our high court at the time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-9\">Accordingly, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s petition for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A34\">I. The Act</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">\u201cPrior to its amendment by the Act, the Three Strikes law required that a defendant who had two or more prior convictions of violent or serious felonies receive a third strike sentence of a minimum of 25 years to life for any current felony conviction, even if the current offense was neither serious nor violent. [Citations.] The Act amended the Three Strikes law with respect to defendants whose current conviction is for a felony that is neither serious nor violent. In that circumstance, unless an exception applies, the defendant is to receive a second strike sentence of twice the term otherwise provided for the current felony, pursuant to the provisions that apply when a defendant has one prior conviction for a serious or violent felony.\u201d (Johnson, <em>supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at pp. 680-681, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">\u201cThe Act\u2019s exceptions to the new sentencing provisions relate to a defendant\u2019s current offense and prior offenses.\u201d (Johnson, <em>supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 681.) These exceptions are set forth in sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C), and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C). (Johnson, at p. 681.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-7\">The Act addressed both prospective sentencing and retrospective resentenc-ing. This case involves retrospective resentencing. \u201cIn addition to reducing the sentence to be imposed for some third strike felonies that are neither violent nor serious, the Act provides a procedure by which some prisoners already serving third strike sentences may seek resentencing in accordance with the new sentencing rules. [Citation.] \u2018An inmate is eligible for resen-tencing if . . . [\u00b6] . . . [t]he inmate is serving an indeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed pursuant to [the Three Strikes law] for a conviction of a felony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] Like a defendant who is being sentenced under the new provisions, an inmate is disqualified from resentencing if any of the exceptions set forth in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C) and section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C) are present.\u201d (Johnson, <em>supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 682.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-8\">The specific exceptions applicable in this case are: <em>\u201c[d]uring </em>the commission of the current offense, the defendant . . . was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another person.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd.

Sufficiency of the Evidence Supporting the Ineligibility Determinations</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">We review the factual basis for the trial court\u2019s finding of resentencing ineligibility under the substantial evidence test. We review the whole record in a light most favorable to the order to determine whether it contains substantial evidence, i.e., evidence that is credible and of solid value, from which a rational trier of fact could find ineligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. (See <em>Guilford, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.4th at p. 661 [applying the substantial evidence test to a determination of resentence ineligibility under the Act]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 812, 833 [208 Cal.Rptr.3d 138], review granted Jan. 11, 2017, S238354; <em>People v. Newman </em>(2016) 2 Cal.App.4th 718, 727 [206 Cal.Rptr.3d 427] <em>(Newman), </em>review granted Nov. 22, 2016, S237491.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-7\">B. Possession of a Sharp Instrument in Prison\u2014Armed with a Deadly Weapon</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-8\">Defendant asserts that the trial court\u2019s determination that he was armed with a deadly weapon when he violated section 4502, possession of a sharp instrument in prison,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was not supported by substantial evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-9\">1. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1207-10\">The trial court found that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iii). The court stated that, in this context, to be \u201c \u2018armed with a deadly weapon\u2019 \u201d means that a person has \u201cthe deadly weapon available for use, either offensively or defensively.\u201d In concluding that the circumstances here satisfied this requirement, the trial court stated: \u201cHere, defendant. . . and [his] cellmate . . . were only gone briefly from their cell, to take a shower; otherwise, the two and only those two spent most of their time in that cell. As the possession was ongoing, and defendant . . . most of the time was present in the cell and so near to the weapon as to have it available to him offensively or defensively during the times of his possession, he clearly was \u2018armed\u2019 with the deadly weapon when he was committing the offense.\u201d Accordingly, the court concluded that defendant was ineligible for resentencing on this conviction under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">\u201cA defendant is <em>armed </em>if the defendant has the specified weapon available for use, either offensively or defensively.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bland </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 991, 997 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 77, 898 P.2d 391] <em>{Bland)) </em>\u201c \u2018 \u201d[I]t is the availability\u2014the ready access\u2014of the weapon that constitutes arming.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>White </em>(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 512, 524 [167 Cal.Rptr.3d 328] (M. <em>White), </em>quoting <em>Bland, </em>at p. 997, quoting <em>People v. Mendival </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 562, 574 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 566].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">In <em>Bland, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 991, our high court described the issue presented in the case as follows: \u2018\u201cis a defendant convicted of a possessory drug offense subject to this \u2018arming\u2019 enhancement when the defendant possesses both drugs and a gun, and keeps them together, <em>but is not present when the police seize them from the defendant\u2019s house?\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 995, italics added.) Police investigating the defendant\u2019s possible involvement in the theft of auto parts searched his house and found rock cocaine in his bedroom closet. <em>{Ibid) </em>Under the bed, they found an assault rifle. <em>{Ibid) </em>At the time of the search, the defendant was in custody inside a police vehicle parked outside of his house. <em>{Ibid) </em>The opinion does not make note of specifically where the defendant was located prior to being placed in the patrol vehicle. The Court of Appeal affirmed the underlying convictions, but reversed the three-year arming enhancement, concluding that the defendant was not armed because he was outside of the house when the weapon was found. <em>{Id, </em>at p. 996.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-7\">In reversing the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision, the California Supreme Court observed that, by focusing on the defendant\u2019s proximity to the weapon at the time the police found it, the Court of Appeal erred because its temporal focus was too narrow. <em>(Bland, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 996.) Our high court explained: \u2018\u201c[W]hether defendant was \u2018armed in the commission\u2019 of the continuing offense of drug <em>possession\u2014it is immaterial whether defendant was present when police seized the assault rifle together with the cache of crack cocaine, </em>so long as he had the firearm <em>available for use </em>in furtherance of the drug offense <em>at any time during his possession </em>of the drugs. From evidence that the assault weapon was kept in [the] defendant\u2019s bedroom near the drugs, the jury could reasonably infer that, <em>at some point </em>during the felonious drug possession, defendant was physically present with both the drugs and the weapon, giving him ready access to the assault rifle to aid his commission of the drug offense.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1000, italics added.) In its reasoning, the court emphasized the continuing nature of drug possession. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 999-1000, 1002, 1004.) To summarize, the court wrote: \u2018\u201c[W]hen the prosecution has proved a charge of felony drug possession, and the evidence at trial shows that a firearm was found in close proximity to the illegal drugs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>in a place frequented by the defendant, a jury may reasonably infer (1) that the defendant knew of the firearm\u2019s presence, (2) that its presence together with the drugs was not accidental or coincidental, and (3) that, <em>at some point during the </em>period of illegal drug <em>possession, the defendant was present with both the drugs and the firearm and thus that the firearm was available for the defendant to put to immediate use </em>to aid in the drug possession. These reasonable inferences, if not refuted by defense evidence, are sufficient to warrant a determination that the defendant was \u2018armed with a firearm in the commission\u2019 of a felony within the meaning of section 12022.\u201d <em>(Bland, </em>at pp. 1002-1003, fn. omitted, italics added.) Thus, in the context of ongoing or continuous possession, our high court does not require the weapon be readily \u2018\u201cavailable\u201d or available for \u2018\u201cimmediate use\u201d at the very moment the weapon is found.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-5\">Here the possessory crime is the possession of a sharp instrument in prison. Possessory offenses, such as drug possession or possession of a deadly weapon, are \u201c \u2018continuing\u2019 offense[s], one[s] that extend[] through time\u201d and create criminal liability \u2018\u201cthroughout the entire time the defendant asserts dominion and control.\u201d <em>(Bland, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 999.) Thus, even if it is true that the weapon was not in defendant\u2019s actual physical possession at the precise time it was discovered, this does not necessarily undermine a finding that he was armed with the deadly weapon at other relevant times so as to support the trial court\u2019s determination. The instant case, where the weapon is stored in an inmate\u2019s cell, is an example of continuing or ongoing possession. Indeed, the discovery of the weapon in defendant\u2019s cell presents a stronger case for a finding that he was armed than the circumstances in <em>Bland </em>because defendant, an administrative segregation prisoner, spent the vast majority of his time in the cell where the weapon was discovered, whereas it is not clear how much time the defendant in <em>Bland </em>spent in his bedroom where police discovered the assault rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-6\">Moreover, similar to the situation in <em>Bland, </em>there is a safety risk here. The <em>Bland </em>court explained that \u2018\u201c[t]he crime scene in a drug possession case is the place where the defendant keeps his or her cache of illegal drugs. A firearm kept near the drugs creates an ongoing risk of serious injury or death from use of the weapon to protect the defendant during a drug sale, to guard against theft of the drugs, or to ward off police. Yet defendant would have us ignore the continuing nature of that risk.\u201d <em>(Bland, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 1001-1002.) Like in <em>Bland, </em>we should not ignore the continuing nature of the safety risk here. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1002.) Possession of a weapon by a state prisoner creates a continuing risk of serious injury or death to other inmates and staff and jeopardizes the security of the facility. Thus, incarcerated felons who possess such weapons are particularly dangerous. And as we shall discuss <em>post, </em>the electorate was particularly concerned with keeping dangerous felons incarcerated when it enacted Proposition 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number><em>People </em>v. <em>Delgadillo </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1570 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 507] (Delgadillo) is another example of the situation where, even though the defendant was not present when a weapon was found, the court held that he was armed because the weapon had earlier been available for use in furtherance of the drug offenses during the commission of those crimes. In <em>Delgadillo, </em>law enforcement followed the defendant from his house and stopped him some distance away on a freeway. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1572.) Law enforcement then executed a search warrant at his house. Two guns were found in the headboard of the defendant\u2019s bed and methamphetamine, cash, and indicia of methamphetamine sales and manufacturing were found elsewhere inside the home and in a car parked outside. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1573.) The <em>Delgadillo </em>court followed the <em>Bland </em>court\u2019s reasoning concerning the continuing nature of drug possession, noting \u201cthe crime of drug possession is \u2018a \u201ccontinuing\u201d offense, one that extends through time . . . [a]nd when, <em>at any time </em>during the commission of the felony drug possession, the defendant can resort to a firearm to further that offense, the defendant satisfies the statutory language of being \u201carmed with a firearm in the commission ... of a felony.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Delgadillo, at p. 1574, italics added.) Focusing the temporal analysis of arming on occasions prior to his arrest, the court held that the firearms were available for the defendant to use offensively or defensively <em>\u201cat any time </em>during the manufacturing process,\u201d even though that process took place over time and at different locations. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1574-1575, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-5\">It is true that <em>Bland </em>and <em>Delgadillo </em>are \u201c \u2018armed <em>in </em>the commission\u2019 \u201d (italics added) cases and that the <em>Bland </em>court noted \u201c <em>\u2018in </em>the commission\u2019 \u201d (italics added) means <em>\u201cany time during and in furtherance of the felony.\u201d (Bland, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 1000, 1001.) Because section 1170.126 requires only that the arming be \u201cduring\u201d the commission of the crime, there is no facilitative nexus requirement as when the arming must also be in furtherance of a felony. <em>(People v. Hicks </em>(2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 275, 283-284 [179 Cal.Rptr.3d 703] <em>(Hicks) </em>[crime of possession of firearm by a felon precludes \u00a7 1170.126 relief under the arming prohibition]; accord, <em>People v. White </em>(2016) 243 Cal.App.4th 1354, 1362-1363 [197 Cal.Rptr.3d 397] <em>(T. </em>White) [same]; <em>People v. Osuna </em>(2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1032 [171 Cal.Rptr.3d 55] <em>(Osuna) </em>[same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-6\">In <em>Hicks, </em>a published case of this court, parole agents and police officers approaching an apartment complex looking for a parolee at large encountered the defendant and two companions. <em>(Hicks, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.4th at p. 280.) After the defendant removed a clear plastic bag from his sweat pants and threw it away, officers frisked him and found five .380-caliber bullets. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Additionally, an officer retrieved the clear bag and discovered that it contained rock cocaine. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Officers proceeded to the apartment the defendant and his companions were there to visit, and, in that apartment, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>found a backpack containing a loaded .380-caliber handgun. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Two witnesses, who subsequently gave inconsistent testimony, told the police that the defendant had left the backpack in the apartment. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 280-281.) This court affirmed the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant was ineligible for resentencing because he was armed with a firearm when he committed the crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 279-280.) The <em>Hicks </em>court stated: \u201cunlike section 12022, which requires that a defendant be armed <em>\u2018in </em>the commission of\u2019 a felony for additional punishment to be imposed . . . , the Act disqualifies an inmate from eligibility for lesser punishment if he or she was armed with a firearm <em>\u2018[d]uring </em>the commission of\u2019 the current offense.\u201d <em>(Hicks, </em>at pp. 283-284.) \u201cThus, there must be a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, not a facilitative one. The two are not the same.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 284, citing <em>Bland, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 1002.) The <em>Hicks </em>court continued: \u201cFollowing this reasoning, <em>defendant was armed with a firearm during his possession of the gun, </em>but not \u2018in the commission\u2019 of his crime of possession. There was no facilitative nexus; his having the firearm available for use did not further his illegal possession of it. <em>There was, </em>however, <em>a temporal nexus. </em>Since the Act uses the phrase \u2018[djuring the commission of the current offense,\u2019 and not \u2018in the commission of\u2019 the current offense [citations], and since at issue is not the imposition of additional punishment but rather eligibility for reduced punishment, we conclude the plain language of the Act disqualifies an inmate from resentencing if he or she was armed with a firearm during the unlawful possession of that firearm. [\u00b6] Here, the trial court stated it found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was personally armed with the firearm he was convicted of possessing. There was sufficient evidence to support this finding based on the initial statements of the two recanting witnesses . . . that it was defendant who had the backpack with the gun inside and put it in the tenant\u2019s apartment.\u201d <em>(Hicks, </em>at p. 284, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-5\">Similarly, here, defendant was armed with the deadly weapon <em>during </em>his commission of possession of a sharp instrument in prison. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, the possession of the weapon need not facilitate another felony, e.g., drug possession or drug manufacturing. We need only look to whether the inmate was armed <em>during </em>the possession of the weapon. Further, we see no need to reconsider, as urged by defendant, this court\u2019s determination in <em>Hicks </em>that \u201cthere must be a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, not a facilitative one.\u201d <em>(Hicks, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.4th at p. 284.) As we have noted, other courts are in accord. <em>(T. White, supra, </em>243 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1362-1363; <em>Osuna, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1032.) Additionally, on its facts, <em>Hicks </em>provides another example of the fact that a defendant need not be present with the weapon when it is discovered to be deemed \u201carmed\u201d within the meaning of the exception rendering a defendant ineligible for resentencing under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>More recently, in <em>T White, supra, </em>243 Cal.App.4th 1354, a felon in possession of a firearm prosecution, the Fourth Appellate District, Division Three, observed that \u201ca defendant is armed with a weapon even though it is not carried on his person, when he is aware it is hidden in a place readily accessible to him.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1362.) This precisely describes the circumstance at issue here. Although the facts in <em>T White </em>are different, in the instant case the weapon was hidden in a place that was readily accessible to defendant when he was nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-5\">In <em>T. White, </em>a police officer spotted the defendant walking down the street carrying a fanny pack. <em>{T. White, supra, </em>243 Cal.App.4th at p. 1358.) Because the defendant matched the general description of a suspect in an armed robbery, the officer drove his patrol car next to the defendant. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The defendant turned away and walked into the parking lot of a motel, and the officer followed. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The officer lost sight of the defendant but moments later, he saw the defendant walking along the second story corridor of the motel. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The officer got out of his car and asked the defendant to come speak with him and defendant came down the stairs toward the officer. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The officer noted the fanny pack appeared to be less full than it had appeared before. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Retracing the defendant\u2019s path, the officer found a loaded nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistol in a trash can. <em>(Ibid.) </em>A search of the fanny pack revealed two bullets of the same make and caliber as those in the gun. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The defendant testified at trial, denying that he had a firearm when he arrived at the hotel and denying that he placed a firearm in the trash can. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The defendant did admit, however, that he walked by the garbage can. <em>(Ibid.) </em>He testified he had found the two bullets on the motel stairs and picked them up. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1212-6\">On appeal from the denial of his Proposition 36 petition, the defendant in <em>T White </em>contended that his case was different from the situation where the defendant is seen in actual possession and thus excluded under the arming exception.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(T. White, supra, </em>243 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1357, 1361.) Unlike that situation, according to the defendant, he could not be found to have been armed because the police never saw him discard the weapon in the trash can or otherwise observed him in physical possession of it. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1361.) Rejecting that contention, the Court of Appeal reasoned, \u2018\u201cit [was] clear [the] defendant\u2019s conviction was based on either the inference he discarded the gun into the trash can on that occasion or he had placed it there <em>earlier. </em>Either way, his possession amounts to being armed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1357, italics added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>The court explained that the jury necessarily concluded that the defendant possessed the gun found in the trash can, and, in turn, that finding necessarily implied that the defendant was \u201cat least aware it was hidden there.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1361.) The Court of Appeal reasoned: \u201cWhen [the] defendant was first approached by the police officer in the street, he turned directly into the motel, and assuming he did not have the gun in his fanny pack, he went straight for the trash can where he knew it was already hidden. And as he walked by that trash can\u2014as he conceded he did\u2014that gun was readily accessible to him. That qualifies [the] defendant as being \u2018armed.\u2019 As our Supreme Court has explained, \u2018 \u201c[i]t is the availability\u2014the ready access\u2014of the weapon that constitutes arming.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1361-1362, quoting <em>Bland, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 997.) The <em>T White </em>court concluded: \u201cSo even if the jury believed [the] defendant\u2019s testimony that he did not bring the gun into the motel on the occasion in question, its finding that he had possession of the gun located in the trash can, combined with his admission he walked right by it immediately after the police officer drove alongside him, demonstrates he qualified as armed during that possession.\u201d <em>(T. White, </em>at p. 1362.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-5\">Although the facts here are different, the circumstances are similar. The jury necessarily found that defendant possessed the altered toothbrush with the razor melted into the handle.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Prior to its discovery, this weapon was readily accessible to defendant when he was in his cell. As in <em>T. White, supra, </em>243 Cal.App.4th 1354, the weapon was not discovered on defendant\u2019s person or the immediately surrounding area where defendant was stopped. However, the evidence supports a finding that defendant was aware that the weapon was \u201chidden in a place readily accessible to him.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1362.) We also note that both here and in <em>T White, </em>the defendants were under control of law enforcement authorities in a different location when the weapons were discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">The case law thus teaches us not to limit the temporal focus for arming to the moment when the weapon was discovered; such a focus is too narrow. <em>(Bland, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 996 [Court of Appeal erred by focusing too narrowly on the defendant\u2019s proximity to the assault weapon at the time police found the cocaine and the assault weapon in the defendant\u2019s bedroom].) Possession of a weapon, like drug possession, can be a continuing crime. Thus, when a weapon is available to a defendant to use offensively or defensively <em>at any time </em>during the actual or constructive possession of that weapon within the time period for which a defendant was charged, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>defendant was armed. (See <em>Bland, </em>at p. 997.) The defendant need not be present at the moment when the weapon is discovered, nor must the weapon be immediately available for his or her use at that very moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">Defendant relies on a hypothetical situation considered in <em>Osuna, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.4th 1020, as supporting his position. In <em>Osuna, </em>an officer attempted to pull the defendant over after he sped through a school zone. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1027.) When the defendant finally stopped and exited the car he was driving, he was holding a handgun. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The defendant fled and, approximately 20 minutes later, police arrested him as he exited a house within the perimeter established by police. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Police searched the house and located a handgun in the air conditioning duct and its missing magazine outside the home. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Police discovered a second magazine and ammunition in the vehicle the defendant had been driving. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>Osuna </em>court, affirming the denial of the defendant\u2019s Proposition 36 petition, concluded that the defendant was disqualified from resentencing under the Act because he was armed with a firearm during the commission of the current firearm possession offense. <em>(Osuna, </em>at p. 1040.) The <em>Osuna </em>court stated: the \u201cdefendant was actually holding a handgun when he first got out of the car. Thus, factually he was \u2018armed with a firearm\u2019 within the meaning of the Act.\u201d <em>(Osuna, </em>at p. 1030.) In dicta, the <em>Osuna </em>court also wrote: \u201cA firearm can be under a person\u2019s dominion and control without it being available for use. For example, suppose a parolee\u2019s residence (in which only he fives) is searched and a firearm is found next to his bed. The parolee is in possession of the firearm, because it is under his dominion and control. If he is not home at the time, however, he is not armed with the firearm, because it is not readily available to him for offensive or defensive use. Accordingly, possessing a firearm does not necessarily constitute being armed with a firearm.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1214-6\">The <em>Osuna </em>court did not discuss the reasoning in <em>Bland </em>or <em>Delgadillo, </em>cases with facts that closely approximated the facts in the hypothetical. As a result, it does not appear that the <em>Osuna </em>court considered the <em>Bland </em>court\u2019s observation that it is \u201cimmaterial\u201d whether the defendant is present when the authorities find the weapon. <em>(Bland, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 1000.) Even so, the <em>Osuna </em>hypothetical is inapt.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Here, defendant left his cell briefly to take a shower. When he left the cell, his possession was continuing. Moments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>before he went to the shower, he was in his cell and in either constructive or actual possession of the weapon. At a minimum, the weapon was readily accessible to him at that time and thus it was readily accessible during his possession of the weapon. Additionally, the showers are located \u2018\u201c[r]ight in the middle of the . . . tier,\u201d with five cells to each side of each shower. Unlike the hypothetical parolee described in <em>Osuna </em>who was not home <em>(Osuna, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1030), defendant here was \u2018\u201chome.\u201d He was simply in another part of his home, mere cell widths away from his cell taking a shower. And defendant would undoubtedly be returning to his cell directly following his shower. Had the correctional officers not discovered the weapon, it would have been readily accessible to him immediately upon his return from the showers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">Defendant\u2019s circumstances here are more analogous to those of the defendant in <em>People </em>v. <em>Elder </em>(2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1308 [174 Cal.Rptr.3d 795] <em>(Elder). </em>In <em>Elder, </em>a law enforcement task force executing a search warrant found the defendant outside the front door of his apartment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1317.) Inside the apartment, law enforcement found a gun on an entertainment center and another gun in an unlocked safe in the bedroom. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>Elder </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>court concluded that the trial court properly determined that the defendant was ineligible for resentencing because he was armed with a firearm. <em>{Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">In addition to <em>Elder, </em>defendant\u2019s circumstances here are similar to each of the following: the defendant in <em>Bland </em>who was in the police vehicle while the weapon and drugs were discovered inside of his house; the defendant in <em>Delgadillo </em>who was detained on a freeway while drugs and a firearm were found during the execution of a search warrant at his home; the defendant in <em>Hicks </em>who was detained outside the apartment he was there to visit, inside of which his backpack containing a gun was found; and the defendant who was detained by the police officer at the motel in <em>T. White </em>while the gun was found in a garbage can in an upstairs corridor where the defendant had been. In each of these cases, the weapon was not discovered on the defendant\u2019s person or in his immediate presence and the authorities never saw the defendant in actual possession of the weapon. Yet, there was sufficient evidence to reasonably infer that, at some point during the defendant\u2019s possession of the weapon, he was present with it and that it was readily accessible to him for his immediate use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-6\">Defendant asserts he could not be armed because, in addition to being away from his cell, he was \u201cunder guard and possibly handcuffed\u201d when the weapon was found. Thus, according to defendant, the weapon was not readily available for offensive or defensive use. But this was the case in each of the cases we have just mentioned. Those defendants were also detained or in custody at the time the weapons were found. We conclude defendant\u2019s supervised visit to the shower did not make him eligible for sentence reduction under the Act. The arming exception still disqualifies him. Where, as here, the possessory offense is ongoing and defendant had the weapon available for use earlier, the arming exception makes him ineligible for resentencing under the Act. To conclude otherwise would mean that before he went to the shower, defendant was ineligible for sentence reduction; while he was in the shower, he was eligible for sentence reduction; and when he returned from the shower (had the weapon not been discovered), he was again ineligible for sentence reduction. It is difficult to accept the premise that it was the intent of the electorate to make defendant eligible or ineligible for sentence reduction depending on the fortuity of the weapon being found while he was taking a shower.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">Nor should his eligibility turn on the fact that inmates in administrative segregation were not allowed to roam the cell block freely. Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>eligibility for Proposition 36 relief cannot conceivably turn on the fact that he was housed in administrative segregation and, therefore, because he was escorted to the shower rather than being free to enter and exit his cell with greater autonomy, he was not deemed to have had the weapon available for use. This analysis would lead to an absurd result: an inmate housed elsewhere in the prison, with the ability to enter and exit his cell more freely and to take showers with lesser supervision would be ineligible for Proposition 36 relief if a weapon were found in his cell while he was nearby taking a shower or elsewhere in the cellblock, but defendant would be eligible for relief because, due to the greater danger he posed to other inmates and corrections officers, he had to be restrained whenever he left his cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">The dissent suggests the analysis in a <em>Bland </em>situation involving the possession of a weapon with drugs should be different than the analysis employed in a case involving a possession of a weapon charge. (Dis. opn. of Duarte, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 1359.) According to the dissent, \u2018\u201c[t]he key moment in time as well as in physical location for the \u2018armed\u2019 classification in the drug cases is the discovery of the drugs,\u201d and the result would be different if the weapon had been stored away from the drugs at the time when the drugs were discovered. <em>(Ibid.) </em>We do not disagree. As we have noted, armed <em>in the commission </em>of a drug offense requires both a facilitative nexus as well as a temporal nexus. <em>(Hicks, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.4th at pp. 283-284.) Consequently, if the firearm is stored away from the drugs, a facilitative nexus could not be established based solely on the concurrent possession of the weapon and drugs. But as <em>Bland </em>teaches, the defendant need not be present when the drugs and weapon are found to be deemed armed. <em>(Bland, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 1000.) Moreover, in a weapon possession case where arming requires that the weapon be available for a defendant\u2019s use <em>during </em>the commission of the weapon possession, only a temporal nexus is required and that nexus has nothing to do with where the defendant was located when the weapon was discovered. The temporal nexus is the concurrence of the point in time when the defendant has possession of the weapon and it is available for use. Thus, the key point in time for purposes of determining whether a defendant will be deemed to have been \u201carmed\u201d in a case involving constructive possession is whatever point in time the defendant had constructive possession of the weapon and it was simultaneously available for use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">The dissent suggests that under our analysis, a defendant is \u201cforever armed,\u201d but this temporal focus misses the mark. If a person commits a crime today and is not apprehended until some future point in time, that person is still subject to prosecution for the crime when he is apprehended (assuming charges are filed within the statute of limitations). That person is no less culpable for the offense just because he was not caught in the act and arrested at the time and place where the crime was committed. Similarly, where, as here, a defendant constructively possessed a weapon and simultaneously had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>it available for use offensively or defensively, he was armed at that point in time, and it does not matter that he was later detained in some place other than where the arming had previously taken place. He still had the weapon available for use at the earlier point in time. Thus, if he is charged with possession alleged to have taken place at that earlier time and convicted, he may also be deemed armed at that earlier time for purposes of the arming exception, rendering him ineligible for resentencing under the Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">In our view, the conclusion we reach here is consistent with the voters\u2019 intent in enacting Proposition 36. The arguments expressed in support of Proposition 36 \u201creflect[ed] an intent to \u2018make the punishment fit the crime\u2019 and \u2018make room in prison for <em>dangerous felons.\u2019 </em>\u201d (Johnson, <em>supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 686, quoting Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) argument in favor of Prop. 36, p. 52, italics added.) \u201cIn this same vein, the ballot materials related to Proposition 36 (and therefore the resentencing statute) reflect an intent to \u2018 \u201ckeep violent felons off the street\u201d \u2019 and \u2018 \u201cprevent[] <em>dangerous criminals </em>from being released early.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caraballo </em>(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 936, 940 [201 Cal.Rptr.3d 233], italics added, quoting <em>Johnson, </em>at p. 686.) These aims would not be served by an interpretation of the statute requiring the narrow temporal focus of arming advanced by defendant, a focus that would make him eligible for sentence reduction simply because he was not present with the weapon when it was found, even though he had been present with it and it had been available for his use earlier. \u201c[T]he plain purpose of these disqualifying factors is to serve as a prophylactic measure to further the goal of the Three Strikes law to protect society against recidivist criminals who commit violent and/or serious crimes. In enacting Proposition 36, the voters intended a third strike defendant who committed a current, nonviolent and nonserious crime would not be punished as severely as a third strike defendant whose current crime was violent and/or serious. Nonetheless, the voters also intended to exclude those defendants who committed the current nonviolent and nonserious crime <em>in a manner that potentially could result in violent and/or serious consequences, which intent is manifest in the triad of disqualifying factors. </em>As the court cogently reasoned in [Blakely; <em>supra, </em>225 Cal.App.4th 1042]: \u2018It is clear the electorate\u2019s intent was not to throw open the prison doors for <em>all </em>third strike offenders whose current convictions were not for serious or violent felonies, but only for those who were perceived as <em>nondangerous </em>or posing little or no risk to the public.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Newman, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.5th at pp. 724-725, first &amp; third italics added, review granted.) Felons in possession of weapons and who have them readily available for use <em>at any time </em>during the possession are obviously dangerous, particularly in a custodial setting. We see nothing in the statute, the ballot arguments, or any other source that suggests the voters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>intended dangerous felons to be eligible for sentence reduction if they were lucky enough to be arrested or detained at a location where they could not easily put their hands on the weapon, even though they had it available for use at some earlier point in time during their possession of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that substantial evidence supported the trial court\u2019s determination that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon within the meaning of sections 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iii), and 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iii), and that he was thus ineligible for resentencing on this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">C. <em>Assault by Inmate by Means Likely to Cause Great Bodily Injury (\u00a7 4501)</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1219-9\">Hull, Acting P.

Defendant moved to augment the record on appeal to include the entire record in his appeal from the underlying convictions and we treated that motion as a motion to incorporate by reference that record and granted the motion.

White, supra. </em>223 Cal.App.4th 512, the court stated, \u201cwhile the act of being armed with a firearm\u2014that is, having ready access to a firearm [citation]\u2014necessarily requires possession of the firearm, possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>of a firearm does not necessarily require that the possessor be armed with it.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 524.) The <em>M. White </em>court posed a hypothetical example in dicta similar to the one in <em>Osuna </em>to illustrate its perception of when a person in constructive possession of a weapon would not be aimed: \u201cFor example, a convicted felon may be found to be a felon in possession of a firearm if he or she knowingly kept a firearm in a locked offsite storage unit even though he or she had no ready access to the firearm and, thus, was not aimed with it.\u201d <em>(M. White, </em>at p. 524.) None of these cases actually involved the specific situation where the defendant was not seen with the weapon and was not present when the weapon was discovered. Indeed, in <em>Burnes. </em>the issue before the com! related to the improper use of a probation report to determine the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s possession, not the sufficiency of evidence establishing arming. <em>(Burnes. </em>at p. 1455.) No other source of facts establishing the underlying circumstances of the defendant\u2019s possession was considered by the trial court in <em>Burnes. </em>In <em>Blakely, supra. </em>225 Cal.App.4th 1042, the defendant actually fired the weapon and admitted actual possession of it for purposes of self-defense <em>(id. </em>at p. 1049), so not only was he excluded under the aiming exception but also the personal use exception. In <em>M. White, </em>the defendant was also in actual physical possession of the weapon. <em>(M. White, </em>at pp. 524-525; see fn. 10, <em>ante.) </em>Constructive possession was not a theory of possession in these cases. More importantly, like <em>Osuna, </em>these courts did not consider our high court\u2019s observation in <em>Bland </em>that the defendant need not be present when the weapon is found so long as the evidence demonstrates he or she had the weapon available for use \u201cat <em>any time </em>during [the] possession of the drugs.\u201d <em>(Bland, supra. </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 1000, italics added.) In light of our high court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Bland, </em>the fact that a defendant is only in constructive possession as opposed to actual possession at the time the weapon is discovered does not mean he or she did not have the weapon available for use at some earlier point dining the possession of that weapon. Having said that, we do not disagree that there could be scenarios where a person is in knowing constructive possession of a weapon, yet was never near it or even touched it so as to be deemed aimed, e.g., where a third person places a weapon in a place over which the defendant has dominion and control, tells the defendant it is at that location, but the weapon is discovered before the defendant could go to that location.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1216-8\"> However, in light of <em>Bland. Delgadillo. Hicks, </em>and <em>T. White, </em>we do not agree with the <em>Elder </em>court\u2019s seemingly inconsistent suggestion that a person could not be denied sentence reduction under the \u201carmed\u201d exception where the weapon \u201cis under a defendant\u2019s dominion and control in a location not readily accessible to him <em>at the time of its discovery.\u201d (Elder, supra. </em>227 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1313-1314, italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1218-6\"> Defendant was charged with possession of the weapon \u201c[o]n or about December 7, 1998,\u201d the same day when he left his cell to shower and the weapon was discovered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1219-13\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1338.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1219-10\">DUARTE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9f\">Concurring and Dissenting.\u2014I concur in all parts of the majority opinion except part IV.B., from which I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-11\">Absent some farfetched hypothetical, under the majority\u2019s broad holding <em>every </em>weapon possession is armed if charged broadly enough. The majority opinion erases the distinction between possession where the weapon is readily accessible to a defendant and possession where it is not. In my view, while both are valid theories of possession, only the first is armed possession. Thus I am compelled to dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-12\">The majority writes that because weapon possession \u201ccan be a continuing crime,\u201d \u201cwhen a weapon is available to a defendant to use offensively or defensively <em>at any time </em>during the actual or constructive possession of that weapon within the time period for which a defendant was charged, the defendant was armed.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1352-1353; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 1342 [a defendant is armed if \u201che or she was present with the weapon and had it available for use <em>at any time </em>he or she had actual or constructive possession of it within the time period for which the defendant was charged and convicted\u201d (original italics)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>Under the majority\u2019s holding, a hypothetical defendant who acquired a weapon and immediately secured it in a safe, then buried the safe and left the state, remaining away for multiple years, would be classified \u201carmed\u201d with that weapon were he eventually charged with its possession. Apparently, this classification would be valid provided the date range on the charging document encompassed the date of the weapon\u2019s <em>acquisition. </em>This would be true even if the date of the weapon\u2019s acquisition preceded the weapon\u2019s discovery (and the corresponding discovery of defendant\u2019s constructive possession of it) by years. This classification is merited merely because at some point <em>Cat any time\u201d) </em>the defendant placed the weapon in the safe. At the time of its placement, the weapon was readily accessible to him for use. Thus he is forever \u201carmed\u201d with it, despite being many years and miles removed from the weapon at the time of its discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">I understand that these are not the facts of Emigdio Valdez\u2019s case; I discuss his specific situation in detail below. But this is the broad effect of the holding\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">I disagree with the majority that <em>People </em>v. <em>Bland </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 991 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 77, 898 P.2d 391] compels this conclusion. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1352-1353.) In the drug cases of <em>Bland </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Delgadillo </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1570 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 507], both relied on by the majority, because of the proximity of the guns at issue to the drugs, it was clear that the defendants were armed with the guns at the time they were dealing drugs. But <em>Bland </em>and <em>Delgadillo </em>are not weapon possession cases; they are drug cases with weapon enhancements at issue. Those cases start with a completely separate offense from any arming analysis and build on that offense, requiring proof that during commission of the continuing drug offense a defendant had a weapon readily available for use to further that offense. This analysis stands in sharp contrast to the necessary analysis in a weapon possession case where the \u201carmed\u201d analysis is built on the <em>same conduct </em>as the charged possession. The key moment in time as well as in physical location for the \u201carmed\u201d classification in the drug cases is the discovery of the drugs, the charged crime being drug possession for sale. In those cases, at the time the defendants were discovered to be in (constructive) possession for sale of the drugs, the guns were <em>with </em>the drugs, and easily accessible to the defendants while they were selling drugs. If the guns in those cases had been stored <em>away </em>from the drugs at the time the drugs were discovered, the results of those cases would be different.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-7\">At the time Valdez was discovered to be in constructive possession of the weapon, it was stored and secured away from him. There is no evidence that Valdez was ever seen in actual possession of the weapon, as far as can be gleaned from this record. In my view, he cannot properly be classified as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>armed \u201cduring the commission of the current offense\u201d merely because at some unwitnessed point in time he was presumably in the cell with the weapon. As the majority acknowledges (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1353-1354, fns. 12, 13), published cases have agreed with my position in dicta, but those courts were not directly confronted with a case such as this one, where defendant\u2019s criminal conviction was based <em>solely </em>on evidence of constructive possession. Although I agree that those cases are not directly on point, I find them instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>White </em>(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 512, 523-524 [167 Cal.Rptr.3d 328], the Fourth Appellate District, Division One analyzed the application of the \u201carmed\u201d classification to the defendant\u2019s conduct as a felon in possession who was spotted by the police in actual possession of the gun\u2014carrying it\u2014and then, witnessed by police, threw the gun into the bed of his truck, from where it was later recovered. I agree that White was armed during the possession offense with which he was charged, as the trial and appellate courts found. But the <em>White </em>court went on to note that although White was observed in actual physical possession of the firearm, conviction under the relevant statute (Pen. Code, former \u00a7 12021, subd. (a))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> could also be under the theory of constructive possession. The court explained that: \u201cwhile the act of being armed with a firearm\u2014that is, having ready access to a firearm [citing Bland]\u2014necessarily requires possession of the firearm, possession of the firearm does not necessarily require that the possessor be armed with it. For example, a convicted felon may be found to be a felon in possession of a firearm if he or she knowingly kept a firearm in a locked offsite storage unit even though he or she had no ready access to the firearm and, thus, was not armed with it.\u201d <em>{White, </em>at p. 524.) The felon contemplated by the <em>White </em>court in this analysis surely had ready access to that gun at some point\u2014when he or she placed it in the storage unit, at a minimum. Yet the <em>White </em>court declined to classify that hypothetical felon as armed with the gun, even though he was clearly in constructive possession of it, presumably at the time of its detection. Summing up, the court stressed that White\u2019s offense was one of actual, not constructive, possession of the gun, given that White was carrying the gun at the time he was spotted by the police, and emphasized that for this reason the \u201carmed\u201d classification was appropriate. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 525-526.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">This court seemed to be in basic agreement that there is a separation between possession and armed possession in <em>People </em>v. <em>Elder </em>(2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1308 [174 Cal.Rptr.3d 795], citing <em>White </em>and noting that <em>White </em>\u201cmakes the point that if constructive possession was the basis for the prior conviction, not every conviction for possession will establish that a defendant was armed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1314, fn. 7.) <em>Elder </em>itself makes the point that \u201cnot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number><em>every </em>commitment offense for unlawful possession of a gun <em>necessarily </em>involves being armed with the gun, if the gun is not otherwise available for immediate use in connection with its possession, e.g., where it is under defendant\u2019s dominion and control in a location not readily accessible to him at the time of its discovery.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1313-1314.) Although Elder was outside the door of his apartment when the police caught him, there appear to have been two accessible guns inside, as well as a recent photograph of defendant in actual possession of one of the guns. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1317.) <em>Elders </em>conclusion that the defendant was \u2018\u201carmed\u201d with those guns which were immediately inside his apartment is much more defensible than a conclusion that defendant here was \u2018\u201carmed\u201d with the altered toothbrush containing the razor, found hidden in one of the cubicles in his shared cell while he was secured in the shower area and unable to get to his cell. The relationship between defendant and his altered toothbrush in this case in precisely that described by the <em>Elder </em>court, \u2018\u201ce.g., where [the altered toothbrush] is under a defendant\u2019s dominion and control in a location not readily accessible to him at the time of its discovery.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1314.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">The Fifth Appellate District\u2019s <em>People v. Osuna </em>(2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1030 [171 Cal.Rptr.3d 55], agrees with the idea that constructive possession does not equate to \u2018\u201carmed\u201d possession without at least some indication of ready access in close temporal proximity to the discovery of the offense. Being secured elsewhere and unable to access the cell containing the weapon, let alone the cubicle or the weapon itself, is akin to the hypothetical parolee in <em>Osuna </em>whose bedroom is searched while he is away from home. Although the majority classifies any comparison of <em>Osuna </em>with the instant case as inapt (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1353-1354), I do not agree that Valdez was \u2018\u201csimply in another part of his home\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1354) while he was held by force in another part of the facility and unable to return to his cell. The record does not indicate that Valdez had <em>any </em>access to his cell while he was detained away from it, much less ready access to the weapon secreted therein. The majority also discusses <em>People v. White </em>(2016) 243 Cal.App.4th 1354, 1361-1362 [197 Cal.Rptr.3d 397], where the Fourth Appellate District, Division Three upheld an ineligibility finding by the trial court based on the armed classification. There, the evidence produced at trial showed that not only was defendant likely carrying the gun in his fanny pack when first observed by law enforcement, but also that he was admittedly within arm\u2019s reach of the gun during the course of the pursuit which resulted in his being apprehended and charged with the gun\u2019s possession. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1358.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">These cases require at least <em>some </em>evidence of ready access to the weapon at the time its discovery was ongoing, although they are arguably trending toward broadening that requirement. I am not inclined to continue down this slippery slope and further blur the line between actual and constructive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>possession, and current and remote availability of the weapon for use.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Being armed with a weapon requires possessing that weapon in a manner which heightens the ease and probability of its use. The record shows only that Valdez constructively possessed a sharp object, which was first seen hidden in his cell while he was detained elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">In <em>People v. Burnes </em>(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1452 [195 Cal.Rptr.3d 903], although the defendant admitted possession of a firearm and possession of a deadly weapon with his no contest pleas to those counts, the Sixth Appellate District reversed the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant was armed for purposes of assessing eligibility for Proposition 47 relief. The reversal was due to the trial court\u2019s reliance on the probation report to find facts supporting its determination; however, had the mere fact of conviction on the firearm and weapon possession counts been enough to establish that the defendant was \u201carmed,\u201d reversal would not have been required. Any error in reliance on the probation report would have been harmless. Thus at least impliedly, the <em>Burnes </em>court agreed that the defendant\u2019s conviction of these possession offenses did not automatically equate to his being armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">To the extent that the majority relies on policy to justify its broad holding, I certainly agree that weapon possession by prisoners is dangerous. However, defendant\u2019s offense was not classified by the electorate as a disqualifying offense per se. (See \u00a7 1170.126, subd. (e)(1), cross-referencing \u00a7 667.5, subd. (c).) Only if he were actually \u201carmed\u201d with the weapon \u201c[dluring the commission of the current offense\u201d\u2014constructive possession of the weapon\u2014is he precluded from seeking recall of sentence. (\u00a7 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iii); see \u00a7 1170.126, subd. (e)(2), cross-referencing \u00a7 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iii).) If he is permitted to <em>seek </em>recall because he was in constructive possession of the weapon but not armed with it, he is still subject to the trial court\u2019s determination as to whether his resentencing poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (1).) The trial court may consider all of those concerns expressed by the majority opinion in its determination of risk, as well as any other relevant evidence. (See \u00a7 1170.126, subd. (g).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">The question before us is not whether defendant is dangerous, or the intent of the electorate in approving Proposition 36, but simply whether defendant was armed in the commission of the current offense. \u201c \u2018[I]t is the availability\u2014the ready access\u2014of the weapon that constitutes arming.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number><em>Bland, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 997.) On the record we were provided, it cannot be said that Valdez was armed in the commission of his constructive possession offense. Nor can it be said that my hypothetical defendant, long separated by time and distance from his gun, is forever armed with it and thereby ineligible to petition for recall of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis and conclusion in part IV. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was granted August 9, 2017, S242240.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1221-7\"> Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1223-8\"> To the extent an earlier case from this court does not appear to require witnessed or admitted availability of the weapon to the defendant during its discovery (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hicks </em>(2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 275 [179 Cal.Rptr.3d 703] [defendant aimed where witnesses saw backpack containing gun in defendant\u2019s possession at some point, but timing of backpack\u2019s possession by defendant unclear]), I disagree for the reasons I have discussed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
