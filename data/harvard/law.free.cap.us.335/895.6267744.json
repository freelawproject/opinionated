Inasmuch as the patent issued by the United States vests title to said land in the State of Wyoming during the entire period of possession by the defendant Ohio Oil Company, there is no need or requirement for further consideration by the Court of plaintiff\u2019s demand for a money judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">It is therefore ORDERED AND DECREED that the defendants shall pay the costs of this proceeding, including compensation for services rendered and actual expenses incurred by the Honorable Nat U.
