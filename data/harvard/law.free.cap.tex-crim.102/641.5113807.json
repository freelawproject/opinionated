The record fails to show a proper recognizance, and the only reference made to same is the following: \u201cRecognizance of defendant with Joe Miscovich and Alex Bonarden as sureties, taken.\u201d This is insufficient to sustain an appeal and without a proper recognizance this court is without jurisdiction. This doctrine is now so well established in this State, we think it is hardly necessary to cite authorities in support thereof. In Branch\u2019s P. C., Sec. 611, p 313, it is stated: \u201cAn appeal in case of misdemeanor, will be dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeals, if the record does not contain a proper recognizance or show the defendant has been continuously in jail since the conviction.\u201d Citing Young v. State, 8 Tex. Crim. App. 81; Sandifer v. State, 63 Tex. Crim. Rep. 361; Brinson v. State, 150 S. W. 776, and many other authorities. The record fails to show either. In passing we deem it prudent to call attention to the fact that there is no judgment shown in the record also. For the reasons stated the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">The appellant is granted fifteen days from this date within which to file a proper bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">ON MOTION TO REINSTATE APPEAL.</p>\n<author id=\"b660-13\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab8\">Appellant has filed a proper appeal bond, accompanied by a certified copy of the judgment rendered in the court below, and the appeal will therefore be reinstated and now considered upon its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\">It is alleged in the information and complaint that appellant slandered one Josephine Massai. The statement of facts presents the testimony of but one witness, who testified that ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>pellant came to his place of business on the morning of August 11, 1924, and said: \u201cThere is a bootlegging joint on one side of me and a whore house on the other.\u201d \u201cI asked him what about it, and he said, \u2018You know that old lady Massai\u2019. I said \u2018yes\u2019, and asked him if he wanted to file any complaint, and he said \u2018no\u2019. Then he said, T am not going to put up with it any more, she is even sleeping with other men.\u2019 \u201d There is nothing in the testimony to show that the \u201cold lady Massai\u201d referred to by the witness was Josephine Massai. No inferences will be indulged against one accused of crime. The State must make out its case by sufficient proof. Failure to prove the name of the alleged slandered female is fatal to a conviction.

We are not in accord with appellant\u2019s contention that the use of the language to the constable makes it a privileged matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">For the error mentioned the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
