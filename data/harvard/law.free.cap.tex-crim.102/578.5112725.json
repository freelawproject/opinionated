T. Lyttleton, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b596-17\"><em>Sam D. Stinson, </em>State\u2019s Attorney, and <em>Nat Gentry, Jr., </em>Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b596-18\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AFi4\">The offense is the manufacture of intoxicating liquor, punishment fixed at confinement in the penitentiary for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-19\">The charging part of the indictment contains these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-20\">\u201c * * * did then and there manufacture spirituous, vinous and malt <em>liquors, </em>capable of producing intoxication, against the peace and dignity of the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>The validity of the indictment is attacked by motion to quash upon the ground that it is vitiated by the omission of the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d. The point was decided against the appellant\u2019s contention in the case of Ross v. State, No. 9604, recently decided. That the appellant possessed a distilling apparatus and was engaged in the manufacture of whiskey was proved and is uncontroverted. He defended upon the ground that he was making whiskey for medicinal purposes for the use of his mother and father. From the paragraphs of the main charge submitting this issue to the jury, we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">\u201cIf the jury shall believe that the defendant was manufacturing the liquor in question solely for medicinal purposes to be used by his mother and father, or either of them, then find him not guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">\u201cOr if the jury shall have a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant was manufacturing the liquor in question solely for medicinal use by his mother or father, or either of them, then give him the benefit of the doubt and acquit him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">By a requested charge and exception to the main charge the sufficiency of the submission of the issue mentioned is challenged, but we think not justly so. The exception was general, and the special charge was not different in substance from the paragraphs of the main charge which have been quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The bill complaining of the fact that a witness for the appellant was asked if it was not a fact that he had been indicted for possessing intoxicating liquors shows no error. As affecting the credibility of the witness, proof that he had been indicted for a felony was competent. See Lights v. State, 21 Tex. Crim. App. 308, and numerous other cases collated in Branch\u2019s An. Tex. P. C., Sec. 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AdH\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
