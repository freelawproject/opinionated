The jugs were thrown from the car and broken while the sheriff was endeavoring to apprehend the appellant. Appellant, in his testimony, admitted that the jugs contained whiskey and that they had been brought by him from Victoria, in Victoria County, a distance of many miles. He interposed no defensive theory but sought a suspended sentence on account of his youth and previous good reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Attached to the motion for new trial is the affidavit of one of the jurors to the effect that he made a statement in the nature of new evidence to one of the jurors during the deliberation of the jury. The order overruling the motion for new trial contains a recital or statement by the court that he <em>had heard evidence </em>upon the motion. In the absence of a bill of exceptions or statement of facts showing what evidence was heard, the presumption that there was sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion of the trial court in overruling the motion must be indulged. See Crouchett v. State, 271 S. W. Rep. 91; see pages 103 and 104, with numerous citations of authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">No other questions are presented for review. The evidence is sufficient to support the verdict, and the lowest penalty was assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b515-10\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao_\">By supplemental transcript, appellant brings forward a bill of exceptions taken to the action of the court in overruling the motion for new trial. This bill, however, cannot be considered for the reason that it was not filed during the term of court at which the trial took place. Since the rendition of the Black case, 41 Tex. Crim. Rep. 185, the decisions of this court have been frequent and uniform to the effect that to warrant a review of the action of the court in overruling the motion for new trial in which it is averred that the jury has been guilty of misconduct, that the evidence supporting the motion must, by statement of facts or bill of exceptions, be put into the record during the term at which the trial takes place. See Reyes v. State, 81 Tex. Crim. Rep. 588; Ferguson v. State, 95 Tex. Crim. Rep. 213; also numerous cases following the Black case, supra, cited in Shepard\u2019s Texas Citations, 3rd Ed., p. 356.
