One of the State\u2019s witnesses testifies to facts which would tend to place said sale later in the morning, and all of the State\u2019s .witnesses place the transaction at the home of the appellant\u2019s father, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>where he, appellant, then resided. The defense of the appellant was an alibi. Some of the State\u2019s witnesses were not certain as to the identity of the party making the sale, whether it was the appellant or his brother. .The appellant made an application to the court for a continuance, for the want of the testimony of the witness Jack Moudy, who, the application shows had been duly subpoenaed, and had attended at a former setting of this case for trial, and had been duly notified of the setting of said case on the date of the trial, but failed to appear, in said application it is alleged that appellant would prove by said witness that at the date and time of the alleged sale that said witness was with the appellant at another and different place; to-wit, at Putnam, Texas, a distance of about seven miles, and had car trouble, and had taken his automobile to a shop at Putnam for repairs, and did not get said car repaired until 3:30 or 4 o\u2019clock a. m. The said motion was not contested by the State, and we are of the opinion that the learned trial judge erred in overruling same; especially in view of the fact that on the trial the said allegations in said motion were supported by the defendant\u2019s witness Julian, a mechanic at Putnam, who testified to seeing appellant on the said night about 11 o\u2019clock, when he came to his garage, and to going out and pulling his automobile into his garage, and working on same up until it was finished, and then he, the witness, left to go to his home, and when he reached his residence, a short distance from his shop, it was about 15 minutes until 4 o\u2019clock in the morning, and that there was another man, whom he learned later was named \u201cMondy\u201d with the appellant at said time. The appellant\u2019s witness Robertson, a constable, testified to seeing appellant at said garage about 1 o\u2019clock in the morning on said date, and to seeing said Julian working on said automobile, and that there was another man in appellant\u2019s car that \u201che took to be Jack Moudy\u201d. We are of the opinion that the trial judge erred in overruling said motion for continuance, and in view of the facts above stated being developed on the trial that at least he should have granted a new trial on the account of the testimony of the absent witness, Jack Moudy, because it can be readily seen that if said absent witness were to testify to the facts set out in said motion, that same would be very material to the defendant\u2019s defense.
