The second requested instruction was clearly upon the weight of the evidence and was correctly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">The first requested instruction was fully covered by paragraphs 4 and 5 of the court\u2019s main charge. In paragraph 5 of the charge he pertinently told the jury that if the liquor in question was placed in the car by someone else than the defendant and that the defendant transported the same, but that he did not know that the jars in question contained intoxicating liquor, or did not know that the said jars were in his car at the time he transported the same, or if they had a reasonable doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>as to whether or not the defendant knew that there was intoxicating liquor in the car while he was driving the same, to acquit him. This charge protected every right that the appellant had under any theory of his defense presented by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"Arz\">Appellant contends that the testimony in the case is insuffieient to support the verdict. With this contention, we cannot agree. It is undisputed that he was found traveling along the public road in an automobile containing four or five jars of whiskey. The record further shows that when the deputy sheriff started to search the car by virtue of a search warrant that he had, that the appellant grabbed a jar and turned it up and poured the most of its contents out on the ground. It is true the appellant presented the theory that some other person put this liquor in his car without his knowledge or consent, but as is usual with a defense of this character, the jury refused to believe or accept it. In so doing, they were well within the right and privilege given them by the law and we do not feel impressed with the duty of disturbing their verdict in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Finding no error in the record, it is our opinion that the judgment should be in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A2kQ\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"AD3\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b583-10\">BERRY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A_Om\">Appellant in his motion for rehearing makes the very unusual contention that we should grant his motion and reverse this case because as he says the transcript as filed in this court has omitted to include in it his recognizance, the judgment of the court pronouncing sentence and the motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">The transcript is before us and it contains the judgment of the court pronouncing sentence and appellant\u2019s notice of appeal to this court. There are no bills of exceptions contained in the record and if a motion of continuance was made and overruled it would not avail appellant without a bill of exception. Neither does the fact that the transcript fails to reveal a recognizance affect the appellant\u2019s rights before this court in any manner, as in the absence of same and any showing to the contrary he is presumed to be in custody. The contentions above stated might very properly be disposed of by saying that if the appellant de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>sired to have the transcript corrected, it was his duty to make a proper application before this court to have it done and to have supported it with a proper affidavit. A motion for rehearing on the merits is not the proper method of raising the questions above presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\">We have carefully considered appellant\u2019s other complaints in the motion for rehearing and find that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The motion is accordingly ovverruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
