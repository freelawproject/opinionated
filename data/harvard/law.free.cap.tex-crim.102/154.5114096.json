Appellant contends that there is no evidence connecting him with the original taking of the car. Without deeming it necessary to detail the facts, we think it sufficient to say that we have carefully reviewed same, arid the circumstances seem to us overwhelmingly to the effect that the jury was warranted in concluding that the appellant was guilty of the original taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In his brief, appellant complains at the court\u2019s action in permitting the State to prove that the witness Jones saw appellant\u2019s brother driving a new Dodge car on or about August 25, 1922, and that the appellant\u2019s brother did not own such car. As above stated, the record contains no bills of exception, and it is manifest under the practice in this State that we are without authority to review the question of the admissibility of this testimony in the absence of an objection to the same duly preserved by a bill of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Finding no error in the record, it is our opinion that the judgment should be in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
