George v. State, 90 Texas Crim. Rep. 179. The trial court submitted to the jury in general terms the question as to whether appellant was a traveler and instructed them if they so found to acquit him, and the jury\u2019s verdict was adverse to the proposition. This being a misdemeanor case, and no special charge being asked seeking to have appellant\u2019s view of the law presented to the jury, we have always held an exception to the charge as given in a misdemeanor case to be not sufficient. See authorities collated in Vernon\u2019s Annotated C; C. P., p. 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Appellant having the pistol in the car was sufficient to make same a violation of the law. Mayfield v. State, 75 Texas Crim. Rep. 103. We observe in addition to this that there was testimony before the jury -that appellant drew the pistol on a man named Dean.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
