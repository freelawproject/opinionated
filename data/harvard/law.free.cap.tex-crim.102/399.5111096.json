This application shows that the bill of indictment was returned on the third day of December and that he was forced to trial on the 15th day of December, all in 1924. The application is, in our opinion, entirely sufficient to show that appellant used due and sufficient diligence to procure the attendance of the absent witnesses, and it is sufficient to show that the witnesses were not absent on account of any fault or neglect on the part of this appellant. The application further shows that the testimony expected to be proved by the absent witnesses would be highly material to the appellant\u2019s defense. Briefly stated, it would, if true, be entirely sufficient to show that the appellant was not at the still from at least 8:30 o\u2019clock until 12 o\u2019clock on the night when the sheriff and the other State\u2019s witnesses testified that he remained there from shortly after 8:30 until 3 o\u2019clock. In other words, if the testimony of the absent witnesses is true, then it would have a strong tendency to destroy the State\u2019s case. So much has been written on the question of a first application for a continuance that we do not deem it necessary to write further on the subject. It is sufficient to say, as has often been said heretofore, that when the diligence is sufficient and the absent testimony is material and in consonance with defendant\u2019s testimony on the trial; or is contradictory of the State\u2019s case, a first application for continuance should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Cox v.
