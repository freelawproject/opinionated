That they stood on the outside and watched them and they were dancing and playing the piano and victrola and that he saw them in the kitchen-pantry drinking something out of bottles. Later when they went in the house they found one bottle that had some whiskey in it, a pint bottle about half full. That they arrested all the parties in the house that night. After the officers entered the house and before making the arrest they seemed to have stayed in there sometime and their testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>fails to disclose any fact which would indicate that the parties in the house were in any manner improperly conducting themselves. In fact, the state\u2019s testimony shows that at least one of the officers participated in the dancing. There was also proof that the general reputation of the' house was bad, so far as it being disorderly was concerned. In fact, this proof as to its general reputation is the only suggestion in the record tending to show the appellant\u2019s guilt. The State\u2019s testimony affirmatively shows that no witness was able to testify to any act of intercourse between any parties whatsoever in said house at any time. The proof of general reputation alone is not sufficient on which to base a verdict of guilty. O\u2019Brien v. State, 117 S. W. 133. Ramy v. State, 45 S. W. 459. Renfro v. State, 189 S. W. 137.
