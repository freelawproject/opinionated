The meagerness of the recital of the facts in the bill renders it impossible for us to determine whether the testimony was relevant or not. Even if irrelevant, however, the offense being definitely established and the minimum penalty assessed, the error, if any was committted in receiving the testimony, would not justify a reversal. It appears, moreover, that the jury was instructed to disregard the testimony mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Complaint is also made of the failure of the court to accord the appellant\u2019s counsel sufficient time to prepare a charge. The only charge given to the jury was that prepared by the appellant\u2019s counsel, instructing them to disregard the testimony above mentioned. The evidence is very short. No testimony was adduced by the appellant. Two witnesses testified that he was seen with a pistol under circumstances violative of the law. Nothing in the bill discloses the necessity of greater time than was allowed for the preparation of a written charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Appellant, by plea to the jurisdiction, attacks the indictment. There is a certificate of transfer, the caption of which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">\u201cNo. 49.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">\u201cThe State of Texas v. Francisco Cisneros.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-9\">\u201cExtract \u2014 Minutes of District Court, Willacy County, Texas. January 24, A. D. 1925.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">This is followed by the certificate, from which we quote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-11\">\u201cCourt met pursuant to recess of yesterday. Present as of yesterday, whereupon the following proceedings were had, to-wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-12\">\u201c \u2018On this day the grand jury came into open court, a quorum being present, and through its foreman presented into court the following true bills, to-wit: * * * One indictment, State of Texas vs. Francisco Cisneros, which was received by the court and ordered filed and docketed.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-13\">\u201cNo. 40.

Duffield, District Clerk, Willacy Co., Tex.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">Following the certificate is this endorsement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">\u201cEndorsed: No. 49. In County Court, Willacy Co., Texas. State of Texas vs. Francisco Cisneros. Transcript &amp; presentment of Indictment from Dist. Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Other proceedings show that the file number in the County Court was 49. The plea to the jurisdiction is based upon the proposition that there is a discrepancy in the file number. If, in fact, there was a discrepancy in the file mark, an amendment would have been in order. See Caldwell v. State, 5 Texas Reports, 18; DeOlles v. State, 20 Texas Crim. App. 145; Boren v. State, 32 Texas Crim. Rep. 637; Rippey v. State, 29 Texas Crim. App. 37; Skinner v. State, 64 Texas Crim. Rep. 84; Rhodes v. State, 29 Texas Reports, 188; and other cases collated in Vernon\u2019s Tex. Crim. Stat., Vol. 2, p. 190. Judging from the record before us, it is conceived that no such discrepancy appears. The number of the case in the District Court seems to have been 40; that in the County Court, 49. Exceptions were urged against the indictment upon the ground that it did not appear to have been filed in the Criminal District Court. The certificate which we have, quo ted is sufficient to show that it was filed in the District Court. In overruling the motion and exceptions, it is our opinion that no error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">We fail to perceive any harmful error in the record. The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
