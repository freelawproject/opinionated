We have had occasion, in the very recent case of Robbins v. State, 272 S. W. 176, to state our views with reference to what a bill of exceptions should contain in order to warrant this court in considering it. In that case, we attempted to clearly state the necessary requisites of a bill of exceptions and the bill in the instant case does not comply with any of the necessary requirements, even the mortgage itself is not set out in the bill of exceptions, and we find in the bill no facts stated which would warrant us in holding that error is shown in connection with the introduction of this mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-9\">By bill No. 3 complaint is made to the effect that \u201cthe State offered in evidence a letter alleged to have been signed by defendant which was immaterial and irrelevant, and which had no bearing on the case whatever, but it was used by the State entirely to prejudice the jury against defendant by unfair and disreputable means.\u201d What has just been said with reference to bill of exceptions No. 2 applies with equal force to this bill. The letter itself is not incorporated in the bill and no facts whatsoever are stated that would enable this court to determine whether or not error is shown by the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-10\">We have carefully examined bill No. 4, which complains at the argument of the district attorney and said bill is too meagre to enable us to intelligently pass upon it. The bill does nothing more than set out the argument made by the district attorney and follow it with the statement that the defendant objected to the argument and that the court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>There being no reversible error shown by this record, it is our opinion that the judgment should be in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AI\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b22-5\">ON MOTION for rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b22-6\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AxO\">The motion for rehearing raises the same legal questions that !were before the court upon the original hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">The motion is also critical of the court in holding the evidence sufficient, advancing the theory that in the absence of' a certified copy of the mortgage which was introduced in evidence, no verdict of conviction should stand. This may be conceded, but the certified copy of the mortgage found in the statement of facts must be considered in passing upon the sufficiency of the evidence. As stated in the original opinion, the bill of exceptions complaining of the introduction of the mortgage was not sufficiently specific to present any question for review. The bill is set out in the original opinion, and the mortgage is neither quoted nor described in the bill. However, if addressed to the mortgage which is found in the statement of facts, no reason is perceived for holding that the court was in error in receiving it in evidence. As found in the statement of facts, the mortgage comports with the descriptive averments contained in the indictment. The complaint that it was a certified copy is not tenable for the reason that, as we understand the Statute, the original chattel mortgage shall remain with the clerk'of the county in which it is filed, and proof of it is ordinarily made by a certified copy. See Vernon\u2019s Complete Statutes of 1920, Art. 5657. Manifestly the bill fails to show that upon the trial circumstances arose which required the production of the original instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-9\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
