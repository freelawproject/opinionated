From her testimony, it appears that she had some separate resources, and that' she and the children had earned money. The record is silent, however, touching the ages of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-15\">The statute upon which the prosecution is based denounces as an offense a wilful desertion by the parent or the refusal of maintenance of his children under the age of sixteen years who are in destitute circumstances. In the present case, it is essential, to the conviction that there be proof showing the ages of the children; at least that they were under sixteen years of age. Art. 602, P. C., 1925. The statement of facts, agreed to by the attorneys and certified by the trial judge, shows that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>evidence upon this subject was introduced. In this state of the record, we have no choice but to order a reversal of the judgment, which is accordingly done.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
