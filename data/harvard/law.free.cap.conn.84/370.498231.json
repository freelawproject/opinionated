Crofutt, Deputy Sheriff.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b382-6\">Third Judicial District, Bridgeport,</court>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AvRC\">April Term, 1911.</p>\n<judges data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b382-7\">Hall, C. J., Prentice, Thayer, Roraback and Wheeler, Js.</judges>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b382-8\">Every, possible crime, committed in any State of the United States, including misdemeanors as well as treason and felony, constitute extraditable offences under the provisions of Article 4, \u00a7 2, of the Federal Constitution requiring the surrender of fugitives from justice who are charged with treason, felony, or \u201cother crime.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b382-9\">No State can by legislation limit or abridge the meaning of the word <em>crime </em>as thus used in that instrument.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b382-10\">In this State the Act of 1852 (General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 1564-1567) provides for the surrender of persons charged with felony or other \u201chigh crime.\u201d <em>Held: </em>\u2014 \u25a0</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b382-11\">1. That by the words quoted the legislature obviously did not intend to restrict or lessen the crimes for which persons might be extradited, since the Act in express terms was made applicable to \u201cany case authorized by the Constitution and laws of the United States \u201d; and therefore must have used \u201chigh crime\u201d as synonymous with the word <em>crime </em>in the Federal Constitution.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b382-13\">2. That changes in the form of expression in the Act of 1852, made by the revisers of the statutes in 1875, were not intended to change the law, which supposedly covered all offenses extraditable within the Federal Constitution, but were designed merely to eliminate unnecessary words and self-evident propositions.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b382-15\">The Act of Congress (Revised Statutes of United States, \u00a7 5278) prescribes the procedure for carrying into effect this, constitutional mandate regarding extradition.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b382-16\">Upon a demand for the surrender of a person, two questions present themselves for the determination of the Governor: first, has the person demanded been substantially charged with a crime against the laws of the demanding State, by an indictment, information, or affidavit properly certified; and second, is he a fugitive from justice of that State.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b382-17\">Before issuing his warrant of arrest, the chief executive should have before him a copy of the indictment, information, or affidavits taken before a magistrate in the demanding State, charging the fugitive with the commission of a crime in that State; though these need not be incorporated in the warrant nor attached to it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b382-18\">Such warrant is of itself prima facie evidence of the regularity of its issue, and is sufficient to hold the accused until the presumption in its favor is overthrown by contrary proof.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b383-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>A high, crime is one nearly allied and equal in guilt to felony, but which technically does not fall within its definition.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b383-6\">A conspiracy in New York may be either a felony or a misdemeanor. Revisers are presumed not to change the law, and a mere change in words will not be deemed a change in the law unless it appears that such was the intention.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b383-7\">Submitted on briefs April 18th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AyD\">decided June 15th, 1911.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-8\">Petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>to determine the legality of the petitioner\u2019s detention pending his delivery to an agent of the State of New York in compliance with a requisition from the Governor of that State, brought to and heard by the <em>Hon. Howard B. Scott, </em>judge of the Court of Common Pleas in Fairfield County, upon a demurrer to the return of the respondent; said judge overruled the demurrer, dismissed the petition and remanded the petitioner to the custody of the respondent, from which the petitioner appealed.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AiU0\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-9\">The return of the respondent showed that the petitioner was held under a warrant from the Governor of Connecticut, directing his arrest as a fugitive from justice in response to a demand from the Governor of New York, in pursuance of the Constitution and laws of the United States, and his delivery to an agent of that State. Said demand was accompanied by properly attested copies of the proceedings in said State against the petitioner, and with proper affidavits of witnesses, whereby said petitioner is charged with the crime of conspiracy. Said Governor certifies in said warrant that \u201csaid demand is conformable to law and ought to be complied with.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-10\">The petitioner demurred to the return because in the warrant it does not appear that he is charged by the authorities of New York with having committed any high crime, and it does not appear but that the crime charged, conspiracy, is a mere misdemeanor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the Penal Code of New York. The demurrer was overruled, <em>Scott, J., </em>and the petitioner remanded, from which action this appeal was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b384-6\"><em>William H.

(U. S.) 66, 99, 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">The word \u201ccrime\u201d embraces not only treason and felony but misdemeanors as well, and the language was made \u201cbroad enough to include every possible crime committed within the borders of the United States, and that no State should be an asylum for fugitives committing crimes in other States.\u201d <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>Corkran, </em>188 U. S. 691, 697, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456; <em>Ex parte Reggel, </em>114 U. S. 642, 649, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1148; <em>Knox </em>v. State, 164 Ind. 226, 233, 73 N. E. 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>The meaning of the words \u201cother crime\u201d is settled <em>by </em>the highest judicial authority in repeated decisions, and that meaning fixed by the history surrounding the enactment of this constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The Act of Congress, now \u00a7 5278 of the Revised Statutes of United States (Comp. 1901, p. 3597), provides the procedure for carrying out this constitutional provision. In this constitutional provision is found the authority for the Governor to act, and in this statute the procedure to govern him.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The questions before the Governor on an application for the surrender of a person under this provision are twofold: Whether the person demanded has been substantially charged with a crime against the laws of the State from whose justice it is alleged that he has fled, by an indictment, information, or affidavit properly certified, and whether he is a fugitive from justice from that State. <em>Munsey </em>v. <em>Clough, </em>196 U. S. 364, 372, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 282; <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Rayner, </em>124 Fed. Rep. 481, 482; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>116 U. S. 80, 95, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Before issuing his warrant, the Governor should have before him a copy of the indictment or information, or affidavits before a magistrate in the demanding State, and charging the fugitive with crime committed by him in such State. <em>Compton </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>214 U. S. 1, 6, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">The warrant of the Governor is prima facie evidence of the regularity of its issue. <em>Davis\u2019 </em>Case, 122 Mass. 324, 328. And it is prima facie evidence sufficient to hold the accused, until the presumption in its favor is overthrown by contrary proof. <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>Corkran, </em>188 U. S. 691, 711, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456; <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Hawley, </em>78 Conn. 150, 155, 61 Atl. 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">It need not make such indictment, information, or affidavits a part of it either by incorporation or attach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>ment. <em>Whitten </em>v. <em>Tomlinson, </em>160 U. S. 231, 245, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 297; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Cornelius, 7 </em>Ind. 611, 612, 614; 2 Moore on Extradition (Ed. 1891) \u00a7 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Our own practice accords with this, as does the practice in all of the States with few exceptions. Forms of rendition warrants for most of the States are given in Moore on Extradition (Vol. 2, Ed. 1891) pp.' 1193 to 1514.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The return to the writ of habeas corpus sets out the Governor\u2019s warrant in due form, complying with the requirements of the law, and fully justifying the sheriff in detaining the petitioner, unless its recital that the petitioner \u201cstands charged with the crime of conspiracy\u201d fails, as the petitioner urges, to substantially charge a crime for which a fugitive from justice may be apprehended and surrendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The petitioner relies upon the provisions of our own statutes prescribing the procedure on requisitions upon the Governor and the prerequisites to his compliance with the demand. Under these the demand must be for the surrender of a person charged with a high crime. Conspiracy is not, he insists, a high crime in New York, but a misdemeanor. This is not entirely accurate. We understand conspiracy in New York may be either a felony or a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">A high crime is one nearly allied to and equal in guilt to felony, but technically does not fall within its definition. <em>State </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>6 Conn. 415, 417. Hence the petitioner claims that the charge in this warrant either, is or may be a misdemeanor, and the authority of the Governor cannot be invoked save in a case where the demanding warrant charges a \u201chigh crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">We have seen that the Federal Constitution used the word \u201ccrime\u201d in Article Fourth, \u00a7 2, to include every form of crime, whether felony or misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">Our own statute cannot restrict the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>word \u201ccrime\u201d as used in the Constitution. It must be interpreted either as within this term, or, so far as it may restrict its meaning, it must fall. It is possible, looking at the mere language used, to construe the legislative intent to have been to make the action of the Governor mandatory in cases of \u201chigh crime\u201d only, but the history of this statute negatives this construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Our statute, now General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 1564 to 1567 inclusive, first appears as chapter 51 of the Public Acts of 1852, p. 62, and \u00a7 1 of that Act reads: \u201cThe Governor of this State may, in cases authorized by the constitution and laws of the United States, appoint agents to demand and receive from the executive authority of any other State, any fugitive from justice, or any person charged with felony or other high crime in this State\u201d; and \u00a7 3 reads: \u201cWhen a demand shall be made upon the Governor of this State, by the- executive authority of any other State, in any case authorized by the constitution and laws of the United States, for the surrender of any person charged\u2019 in such State with felony or other high crime, the State Attorney,\u201d etc., when required by the Governor, shall forthwith investigate the ground of such demand, etc. \u201cAnd if it shall appear to the Governor, that such demand is conformable to law, and ought to be complied with, he shall issue his warrant,\u201d etc. \u201cOr other high crime\u201d means the crime which is distinguished from the felony, by technical circumstance rather than by immorality or unlawfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">At the time of its enactment there had been no authoritative construction of \u00a7 2, Article Fourth, of the Federal Constitution, by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Eight years later, in <em>Kentucky </em>v. <em>Dennison, </em>24 How. (U. S.) 66, 99, the Supreme Court, in an opinion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Chief Justice Taney, construed the word \u201ccrime\u201d in the phrase \u201ctreason, felony, or other crime\u201d of this clause to include every offense, misdemeanor as well as felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Before that decision there had been some doubt of the meaning of \u201ccrime,\u201d and it may well be that the General Assembly used \u201chigh crime\u201d as the equivalent of the \u201ccrime\u201d of the Federal Constitution. But it never intended to exclude any offenses within the Federal Constitution. It expressly gave the Governor power to act in cases authorized by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and it is quite clear from the language used that it was intended to cover all cases, for it provides the remedy \u201cin any case authorized by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">This was the main legislative intent, to furnish an extradition procedure for Connecticut covering every case within the Federal Constitution and laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The revisers (Rev. 1875, p. 544) changed the phraseology of the statute by omitting from said \u00a7 1, in lines 2 and 3, the words \u201cin cases authorized by the Constitution and laws of the United States,\u201d and in line 5 \u201cany\u201d before person, and \u201cfelony or other\u201d in line 6, and inserting \u201cany\u201d before high crime in line 6. And in \u00a7 3, by omitting the same words. The omission of the words \u201cfelony or other\u201d indicates the understanding of the revisers that high crime included felony. The omission of references to the Constitution and laws of the United States indicates the understanding of the revisers that these are unnecessary, since it is only in such cases the Governor can act and in such cases he must act. The revisers sought to change the language and shorten the expression, but not to change the law or its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Revisers are presumed not to change the law, and a mere change in the words will not be deemed a change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>in the law unless it appears that such was the intention. <em>State </em>v. <em>Geer, </em>61 Conn. 144, 150, 22 Atl. 1012; <em>Westfield Cemetery </em>Asso. v. <em>Danielson, </em>62 Conn. 319, 322, 323, 26 Atl. 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The intention of the revisers was to cut out unnecessary words and self-evident propositions, and leave the law as it was covering as they supposed every crime within Federal Constitution and laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The law has been preserved since 1875 in the form then adopted. We may then conclude that the legisative intent was not to restrict the meaning of the word \u201ccrime\u201d within the technical meaning of \u201chigh crime,\u201d but to include in the latter term every offense within Federal Constitution and laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
