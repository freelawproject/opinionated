Neither the context nor the surrounding circumstances furnish any ground for thinking that the testator used these terms in other than their primary significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">At the date of execution of the will and at his death the testator had a wife, two sons, and two daughters. None of his children had children except George W. Cornell, and at the date of execution of the will there ' were three of these.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The testator made a like bequest to two of his children, and to George W. $10, which sum, he says, \u201cwith that already advanced by me to him will make twelve hundred dollars.\u201d To his daughter Fannie he gave the income of $800 during her life, he having already advanced to her a sum sufficient, with this bequest, to equal $1,200. The remainder over of the bequest to the daughter Fannie in Article 8, if she die leaving no descendants then living, he gives to trustees for the use of his son George W. \u201c during his life, and upon his decease to his heirs forever in three equal portions share and share alike forever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u201c Heirs \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>children \u201d have different meanings in the law, \u201c yet in common speech they are often used as synonymous.\u201d <em>Lockwood's Appeal, 55 </em>Conn. 157, 165, 10 Atl. 519. The testator may have used the word \u2018 \u2018 heirs \u2019\u2019with its ordinary meaning. If we may construe the word \u201cheirs\u201d to mean the children of George W. Cornell living at the testator\u2019s death, this bequest will be valid, and the law prefers that to a construction which will convert this bequest into an illegal perpetuity. <em>Nicoll </em>v. <em>Irby, </em>83 Conn. 530, 77 Atl. 957; <em>Farnam </em>v. <em>Farnam, </em>83 Conn. 369, 381, 77 Atl. 70; <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Hatheway, </em>81 Conn. 181, 184, 70 Atl. 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Illustrations of the manner in which we have made use of the context and circumstances surrounding the testator in declaring his intent, are not infrequent in our reports. In <em>Nicoll </em>v. <em>Irby, </em>83 Conn. 530, 77 Atl. 957, we construed a devise, after a life use to a brother, of a remainder \u201cto my own heirs,\u201d to mean the next of kin exclusive of the brother who was the next of kin and only heir at law at the testator\u2019s death; because from the context and surrounding circumstances it appeared that the testator intended to exclude the stepchildren of his brother from a share in his estate, and if by \u201cmy heirs\u201d were designated the heirs of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>testator at the death of his brother, it would be possible for the brother to adopt the stepchildren after the testator\u2019s death and thus make them the heirs of the testator contrary to his intent. In <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Hatheway, </em>81 Conn. 181, 70 Atl. 645, the testatrix gave the income of one half of her residuary estate to two sons, \u201cand at the death of either or both, to their heirs at law respectively,\u201d and directed that at the death of their wives and all the children of the said two sons, the said property should go to the grandchildren. We held that by the term \u201cheirs at law\u201d the testatrix intended the class of persons defined by her immediately afterward as \u201cwives and children,\u201d and that \u201cto avoid the creation of an illegal perpetuity it ought to be so interpreted.\u201d In <em>Connecticut Trust &amp; Safe Deposit Co. </em>v. <em>Hollister, </em>74 Conn. 228, 231, 50 Atl. 750, we held from the context that the term \u201clegal heirs\u201d in a will was used as the equivalent of the words subsequently employed in the same sentence: \u201cthose who shall legally represent them,\u201d and of \u201ctheir legal heirs or representatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A9C\">What, then, did the testator intend by the term \u201cheirs\u201d in Article 8? Did he intend his three children other than George W., or did he intend his three grandchildren then living, or did he intend the heirs of his son George W. who might be living at his death? \u201cIn three equal portions\u201d may apply to either the three children or the three grandchildren. There can be no doubt of the testator\u2019s intention. He desired to give to his son George and his children a greater proportion of his property than to his other children and their issue. George was not provident, and so he placed his portion in trust, giving him its use. What more natural than that he should leave the remainder to the children of George? These were his only grandchildren. He was on terms of affection with their father. The strong relation of affection between a grandparent and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>grandchildren is a fact of nature of universal acceptance, and this provision should be construed keeping in view this fact. When this testator refers in different parts of this will to his own children he invariably names them. Had the testator intended that the remainder referred to in Article 8 should go to his three children, he would have pursued the method used by him in the other parts of his will. If George W. died leaving children, these would be his heirs. It is quite unlikely that the testator contemplated that the three children of George might die before his own children, and that in his use of the term \u201cheirs\u201d he intentionally used a term which might include the sisters and brother of George W., or the three grandchildren. The testator\u2019s purpose was to provide for his own children, and then for their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">A fourth child was born to George W. Cornell five days before the testator\u2019s decease, but as the testator never knew of the birth of this child, no duty rested upon him to make his will correspond with the fact and to change the language from three to four portions. His intention existent at the execution of his will to give these remainders to his grandchildren could not be varied by a fact subsequently occurring of which he had no notice. This language, read in the light of the circumstances surrounding this testator', may reasonably be construed to indicate the use by the testator of heirs instead of children. When he executed the will his purpose was to give to his son George in no event a greater interest than a life interest. George had then three children. When the testator gave this remainder \u201cto his heirs .... in three equal portions,\u201d he unquestionably referred to the portions which each grandchild would have; and he emphasized this by the addition \u201cshare and share alike forever.\u201d Equality in the distribution was his reiterat\u00e9d purpose. Among what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>heirs could he divide this in three equal portions? There were none to whom the three portions could apply except these living children of George, or the living children of the testator. Unless the three was intended to apply to either his three living grandchildren or his living children, it had no meaning, since the testator had no means of knowing how long he would live or how many heirs of George would be living at his decease. He could not then name the heirs nor the number of portions needed to give each heir an equal portion. He did know the number of his children and of his grandchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The words \u201cin three equal portions share and share alike forever\u201d are a part of the same phrase, and immediately follow the term \u201cheirs\u201d unseparated by punctuation. They qualify, explain, and limit the meaning of heirs. Nowhere in the will or in the surrounding circumstances is there any explanation or any fact suggestive of any to whom the three portions should apply except the three living grandchildren, or the three children of this testator, and we have already pointed out that the children of the testator were not intended. \u201cHeirs\u201d meant the children of George W. living at his death. If this be the true construction, the intention of the testator was to benefit immediate descendants, those living at his decease and not those born thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The devise in Article 9 of the residue to the trustees for the use of George W. Cornell for life \u201cand upon his decease to his heirs forever\u201d does not contravene the statute against perpetuities. \u201cHeirs\u201d is used in the sense of children. To hold otherwise would accord to the word \u201cheirs\u201d in Article 9 a different meaning from that attached to it in Article 8. This would violate a cardinal rule of construction \u2014 the 18th of Jarman\u2019s rules \u2014 that \u201cwords, occurring more than once in a will, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>shall be presumed to be used always in the same sense, unless a contrary intention appear by the context, or unless the words be applied to a different subject.\u201d 2 Jarman on Wills, pp. 840-843 (5th Amer. Ed., Vol. 3, pp. 702-709); <em>Allen\u2019s Appeal, </em>69 Conn. 702, 707, 38 Atl. 701; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>73 Conn. 106, 113, 46 Atl. 883; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>63 Conn. 324, 328, 28 Atl. 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The word \u201cheirs\u201d in Article 9 is applied to the same subject as'in Article 8, and there is nothing in the context or surrounding circumstances which suggests a contrary intent. In maintaining this construction we are upholding the validity of this provision of the will and carrying out the testator\u2019s intent, and this is the solicitous care of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The Superior Court is advised that questions (a) and (d), upon which its advice is asked by the trustee, should be answered in the affirmative, and questions (b) and (c) in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">No costs will be taxed in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
