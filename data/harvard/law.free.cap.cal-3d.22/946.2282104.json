(See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1111.) We disagree and affirm judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">Appellant and other juveniles entered a jewelry store at night through a broken window, removing jewelry valued at $13,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">In a petition filed pursuant to section 602, appellant was alleged to have committed acts constituting burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459), grand theft (Pen. Code, \u00a7 487) and receiving stolen property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496). At the jurisdictional hearing one of the juveniles entering the store with appellant was granted immunity from further proceedings against him and testified he had witnessed appellant participate in the affair. The juvenile court judge found the allegations relating to Penal Code section 496 to be true, those relating to Penal Code sections 459 and 487 to be untrue. Appellant was declared a ward of the court and returned to the custody of his parents. It is undisputed the only evidence of appellant\u2019s misconduct is the accomplice testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>Had appellant been criminally charged and convicted based solely on the accomplice\u2019s uncorroborated testimony, Penal Code section 1111 would require reversal of the conviction. That section provides: \u201cA conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless it be corroborated by other such evidence as shall tend to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense . . . .\u201d However, a finding of wardship pursuant to section 602 does not constitute a \u201cconviction\u201d within the meaning of Penal Code section 1111 (see \u00a7 203 [\u201cAn order adjudging a minor to be a ward of the juvenile court shall not be deemed a conviction of a crime for any purpose . . . .\u201d]), and our courts have uniformly held Penal Code section 1111 has no application in juvenile court proceedings. <em>(In re R. C. </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 887 [114 Cal.Rptr. 735]; <em>In re D. L. </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 65, 73 [120 Cal.Rptr. 276]; <em>In re Eugene M. </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 650, 657 [127 Cal.Rptr. 851].) Appellant contends the juvenile court\u2019s refusal to allow him to assert the accomplice testimony rule violates his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The accomplice testimony rule is not constitutionally based. Rather it was court created in the first instance. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Eckert </em>(1860) 16 Cal. 110, 112.) <em>Eckert </em>reached its holding not on constitutional grounds but on English common law (see 7 Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 2056, fn. 5) and today\u2019s legislative codification of the rule may be modified or repealed without infringing constitutional rights. The rule does not exist in many states and where it does exist it is normally of statutory origin. (7 Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 2056, p. 319.) Federal courts have rejected the rule, holding \u201ca conviction may be based on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice . . . .\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(9th Cir. 1975) 528 F.2d 143, 161; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Daniel </em>(9th Cir. 1972) 459 F.2d 1029.) Therefore, due process does not require the rule be adopted in either criminal or juvenile proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">A more difficult constitutional issue is presented by appellant\u2019s contention that, because the state deems uncorroborated accomplice testimony insufficient to support a criminal conviction, equal protection requires the same quality of proof in support of a juvenile jurisdictional finding. The Supreme Court in <em>In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 90 S.Ct. 1068] held that a minor cannot be subjected to \u201cinstitutional confinement on proof insufficient to convict him were he an adult.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 367 [25 L.Ed.2d at p. 377].)</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">At issue in <em>Winship </em>was the <em>degree </em>of factual proof of charged misconduct. <em>In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 87 S.Ct. 1428] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>established that, while due process does not require an adjudicatory hearing conform to all requirements of a criminal trial, it nevertheless requires \u201c \u2018the essentials of due process and fair treatment\u2019 \u201d at such a hearing <em>(id., </em>at p. 30 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 548]). One such essential in juvenile proceedings is that the minor be adjudicated by proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014a due process rather than an equal protection compulsion according to <em>Winship. Winship </em>thus holds that due process compels only the reasonable doubt degree of proof for adjudicatory findings in either criminal or juvenile proceedings. As we have seen, due process simply does not compel the accomplice corroboration rule in either criminal or juvenile proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Appellant\u2019s equal protection contention cannot be rejected, of course, merely because it is not supported by <em>Winship. </em>The state has created a classification\u2014placing those persons charged with crimes and subject to criminal penalties in a category different from those treated as juveniles and subject to restrictions the state deems to be for their best interests and necessary for their rehabilitation. The issue is whether the state can require a lesser <em>quality of evidence </em>in juvenile proceedings. This is not to say <em>degree of proof </em>may be different in the two <em>proceedings\u2014Winship </em>established proof beyond reasonable doubt shall apply to juvenile as well as criminal proceedings. The issue is whether evidence deemed insufficient in a criminal proceeding\u2014although standing alone it may constitute proof of criminal conduct beyond reasonable doubt\u2014is sufficient in a juvenile proceeding, so long as the charged misconduct is established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Appellant appears to argue on equal protection grounds that all rules of evidence in criminal proceedings must extend to juvenile court proceedings because in both criminal and juvenile proceedings the person charged faces the possibility of loss of freedom.  However, disparities among classes are constitutionally permissible when reasonably related to proper purpose.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>T.N.G. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 767 [94 Cal.Rptr. 813, 484 P.2d 981] we upheld procedures permitting the court to retain in an unsealed condition juvenile court records of charged misconduct even though no adjudication followed. While juveniles charged with\u2014but not convicted of\u2014criminal violations were entitled to immediate sealing of their records, no denial of equal protection resulted because retention was shown to relate to rehabilitation. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 782-783.) \u201cSuch rehabilitative need for retaining arrest records does not pertain to the case of a minor who has been dealt with as an adult in the criminal courts. The adult criminal courts neither perform the special rehabilitative functions of the juvenile court nor provide the particular procedures for protective confidentiality of the juvenile court. Thus, the Legislature has reasonably provided to minors who are treated as adults in criminal courts the immediate sealing of any arrest record . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 783-784.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">The critical question is whether the purpose served by the accomplice corroboration rule permits, as in the case of record sealing, disparate treatment between persons charged with crime and persons charged with juvenile misconduct. We examine the differing effects of the rule when applied in different procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Accomplice testimony is generally suspect because it may have been proffered in the hope of leniency or immunity, and thus greater weight may be accorded such testimony than is warranted. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wallin </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 803, 808 [197 P.2d 734].) However, when a judge rather than a jury is trier of fact it is not unreasonable to assume he is more critical of accomplice testimony and more likely to accord it appropriate weight. Although juries are generally required upon demand by defendant in a criminal proceeding, the state is not constitutionally compelled to provide a jury in juvenile proceedings (see <em>McKeiver </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 528 [29 L.Ed.2d 647, 91 S.Ct. 1976]), the juvenile court judge or referee being the trier of fact. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Carl W.) </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 271 [124 Cal.Rptr. 47, 539 P.2d 807].) It thus follows there is less reason for application of the arbitrary accomplice corrobora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>tion rule in juvenile court proceedings. (See, <em>In re R. C., supra, </em>39 Cal.App.3d 887, 895.)</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">While adjudication of a juvenile offender may well result in an incarceration which is not unlike that in the case of persons convicted of crimes, it must be acknowledged that a person convicted of a serious crime is generally exposed to a greater and more onerous term of confinement than a juvenile ward charged with the same misconduct. In providing for the kind of evidence which can constitute proof of charged misconduct, it is not unreasonable that our Legislature has placed more severe limitations on evidence which may be used to prove the criminal violation, bearing in mind of course that the degree of proof calls for the same reasonable doubt standard in each instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\"> Although the rehabilitative purpose of the juvenile court may not warrant a lesser degree of proof of the charged misconduct, the Legislature may well consider that judicial intervention in the interest of rehabilitating an impressionable minor outweighs policies against the use of particular kinds of testimony not otherwise constitutionally proscribed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is the Legislature\u2019s prerogative, acting within constitutional guidelines, to strike a proper balance between these competing interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">In the absence of direct constitutional prohibition or compulsion, equal protection has not been held in any instance to compel in juvenile proceedings evidentiary determinations identical to those in criminal courts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>McKeiver </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra, </em>403 U.S. 528, the Supreme Court stated the broad issue to be whether there was a \u201c \u2018constitutional right to a jury trial in juvenile court\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 535 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 655]), but purported to dispose of that issue on a due process analysis. However, it recognized the equal protection issue, summarily disposing of it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In holding that a juvenile is not entitled to a juiy determination of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>jurisdictional issue, the Supreme Court noted that the purpose served by juvenile court proceedings\u2014a purpose different from that served by criminal prosecutions\u2014could not be accomplished if those proceedings were burdened by the full panoply of rights accorded criminal defendants. \u201cIf the jury trial were to be injected into the juvenile court system as a matter of right, it would bring with it into that system the traditional delay, the formality, and the clamor of the adversary system and, possibly, the public trial.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 550 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 663].) Surely, if there are sufficient distinctions between criminal and juvenile proceedings to justify granting the constitutional right to a jury to the former and denying it to the latter, those same distinctions must also apply to the quality of evidence\u2014providing that in both proceedings charged misconduct is established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">We conclude that when due process and other constitutional demands have been satisfied, reasonable differences in criminal and juvenile evidentiary procedures are constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., Richardson, J., and Manuel, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b954-10\">Unless otherwise specified, all statutory references are to provisions of the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">Section 602 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who is under the age of 18 years when he violates any law of this state . . . defining crime ... is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge such person to be a ward of the court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b956-6\">This case does not present the issue of admissibility of accomplice testimony. Appellant is not aided by the provisions of section 701 requiring an adjudication to be \u201csupported by evidence, legally admissible in the trial of criminal cases.\u201d Penal Code section 1111 does not render uncorroborated accomplice testimony inadmissible. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bowley </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 855, 858 [31 Cal.Rptr. 471, 382 P.2d 591; 96 A.L.R.2d 1178]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Santos </em>(1933) 134 Cal.App. 736, 746 [26 P.2d 522].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b956-7\">There is no basis herein for application of the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d as opposed to the \u201crationality\u201d test in measuring permissible classifications. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Olivas </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 236 [131 Cal.Rptr. 55, 551 P.2d 375].) We do not here make' a-classification directly affecting a fundamental interest as in <em>Olivas. </em>There the deprivation of liberty for a misdemeanant committed to the Youth Authority for a term in excess of the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>confinement had he been committed to jail, was held to require the strict scrutiny analysis and to be unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. Here, there is no classification based on a deprivation of liberty or any other fundamental right. The classification affects only the kind\u2014but not the degree\u2014of otherwise proper evidence which may support a finding of misconduct. As the evidence must otherwise conform to constitutional demands, no fundamental right is affected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b957-10\">Another instance in which equal protection has been held not to foreclose disparate treatment between juveniles and criminal defendants is the unavailability in juvenile court of dismissal of a charge following successful completion of probation. <em>(In re S. A. </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 241 [85 Cal.Rptr. 775].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b958-7\">The purpose of the juvenile court system is \u201cguidance and treatment for the juvenile.\u201d <em>(T.N.G. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 767, 775.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b958-9\">As a matter of due process or the right against self-incrimination, juveniles are entitled to the exclusion of illegally seized evidence, unconstitutional pretrial identification, judicial admissions not preceded by an explicit waiver of rights, and statements obtained without constitutional admonishments.

They are also protected against multiple prosecutions <em>(In re Benny G. </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 371, 373 [101 Cal.Rptr. 28]) and from being twice placed in jeopardy in juvenile court proceedings <em>(Richard M. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 370 [93 Cal.Rptr. 752, 482 P.2d 664]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b958-10\">The Supreme Court stated: \u201cFinally, the arguments advanced by the juveniles here are, of course, the identical arguments that underlie the demand for the jury trial for criminal proceedings.

Whether they should be so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>equated is our issue. Concern about the inapplicability of exclusionary and other rules of evidence . . . chooses to ignore, it seems to us, every aspect of fairness, of concern, of sympathy, and of paternal attention that the juvenile court system contemplates. [\u00b6] If the formalities of the criminal adjudicate process are to be superimposed upon the juvenile court system, there is little need for its separate existence. Perhaps that ultimate disillusionment will come one day, but for the moment we are disinclined to give impetus to it.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 550-551 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 664].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b959-8\">BIRD, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad3\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">In reaching the conclusion that a minor may be adjudged to have committed a crime solely upon the uncorroborated testimony of a witness, who had been given immunity for his own admitted criminal acts, the majority err twice. They violate the Legislature\u2019s mandate that in the juvenile court system, \u201caccomplice testimony should be surrounded with the usual safeguards . . . -\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They also contradict the constitutional prohibition that judicial \u201cintervention [into the life of a minor] cannot take the form of subjecting the child to the stigma of a finding that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>violated a criminal law and to the possibility of institutional confinement <em>on proof insufficient to convict him were he an adult.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Today\u2019s decision by this court provides further support for the conclusion of one scholar that \u201cfew fields exist in which more serious coercive measures are applied, on such flimsy objective evidence, than in that of juvenile delinquency.\u201d (Bovet, Psychiatric Aspects of Juvenile Delinquency (World Health Organization, 1951) p. 79, quoted in <em>In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1, 19, fn. 25 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 541, 87 S.Ct. 1428].) It is, indeed, sad to see this distinguished court join such a questionable tradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">The rule that a conviction may not be had upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice has deep historical roots in this state\u2019s criminal law. The rule was adopted at the very first session of the California Legislature. (Stats. 1850, ch. 119, \u00a7 405, p. 304.) It was reenacted in the Criminal Practice Act of 1851 (Stats. 1851, ch. 29, \u00a7 375, p. 252), and, when the penal laws were codified in 1872, it became Penal Code section 1111.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The accomplice-corroboration rule has been retained with little change since its codification.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">This court has observed that \u201c[t]he requirement of section 1111 of the Penal Code that accomplice testimony must be corroborated is a convincing indication of the legislative intent and policy that such evidence is to be regarded as untrustworthy and not to be believed unless fortified by other evidence tending to connect a defendant with. the commission of the offense charged.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dail </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 642, 655 [140 P.2d 828].) The Legislature\u2019s reasons for this determination are numerous and have been often chronicled. It is useful to touch upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>them here because, as the Court of Appeal has noted, they are equally applicable to jurisdictional hearings in juvenile court. (See <em>In re R. C. </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 887, 894-895 [114 Cal.Rptr. 735].)</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">An accomplice is recognized to be a \u201ctainted\u201d source of evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 460, 471 [110 Cal.Rptr. 906, 516 P.2d 298].) He has a strong motive to fabricate testimony which incriminates innocent persons or which attributes the more active roles or the more serious offenses to others, in order that he might gain leniency or even immunity for his own criminal actions. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 468; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wallin </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 803, 808 [197 P.2d 734].) An accomplice has other reasons, as well, to \u201ctailor the truth to his or her own self-serving mold . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 471.) The accomplice may well be a friend of those who committed the crime with him, and he may attempt to keep them out of trouble by incriminating an innocent person instead of his actual associates. In addition, the accomplice may \u201cpurposely lie in .order to convict an innocent man, thereby cariying out a threat or obtaining revenge against him.\u201d (Comment, <em>Accomplice Corroboration\u2014Its Status in California </em>(1962) 9 UCLA L.Rev. 190, 192.) Finally, an accomplice\u2014especially one who, like the accomplice in the present case, is himself a minor\u2014may be under great parental or societal pressure to focus the blame for his own misconduct on someone else. (Heydon, <em>The Corroboration of Accomplices </em>(Eng. ed.) 1973 Crim. L.Rev. 264, 276; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra, 10 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 469-470.)</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">The danger in using the testimony of an accomplice is not limited to its lack of trustworthiness. The problem is compounded by the fact that an accomplice\u2019s fabrications \u201cwill usually have a seeming plausibility because the accomplice will have familiarity with at least some details of the crime: \u2018an accomplice is not merely a witness with a possible motive to tell lies about an innocent accused but is such a witness peculiarly equipped, by reason of his inside knowledge of the crime, to convince the unwary that his lies are the truth.\u2019 \u201d (Heydon, <em>supra, </em>at p. 266; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tewksbury </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 953, 967 [127 Cal.Rptr. 135, 544 P.2d 1335].) Thus, \u201cthe chance of successful perjury is increased by the fact that the accomplice, completely familiar with the events of the crime, can fabricate a believable story which can withstand cross-examination.\u201d (Note (1954) 54 Colum.L.Rev. 219, 234.)</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">For all of these reasons, section 1111 expresses a legislative determination that the testimony of an accomplice is \u201cinherently suspect.\u201d <em>(People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>v. <em>Bowley </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 855, 862 [31 Cal.Rptr. 471, 382 P.2d 591, 96 A.L.R.2d 1178].) But in enacting that section, the Legisl\u00e1ture went beyond mere suspicion of accomplice testimony. It expressed a more profound and sweeping judgment, \u201csuch testimony has been legislatively determined <em>never </em>to be sufficiently trustworthy to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt unless corroborated.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tewksbury, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 967, italics added; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Reingold </em>(1948) 87 Cal.App.2d 382, 409-410 [197 P.2d 175].)</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Since a minor\u2019s guilt of a criminal offense must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in juvenile court, the same legislative intent expressed in section 1111 applies equally to juvenile proceedings. (See <em>In re R.

Code, \u00a7\u00a7 200-945) can be directly traced to the Legislature\u2019s overhaul of the Juvenile Court Law in 1961. (Stats. 1961, ch. 1616, p. 3459 et seq.) In enacting the 1961 revisions, the Legislature substantially relied upon the recommendations, comments, and proposals of the Governor\u2019s Special Study Commission on Juvenile Justice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This court has repeatedly held that the commission\u2019s reports are \u201cpersuasive evidence of the intent of the Legislature\u201d <em>(Brian W. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 618, 623 [143 Cal.Rptr. 717, 574 P.2d 788]) and \u201cshould be given significant weight in determining the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Carl W.) </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 271, 277 [124 Cal.Rptr. 47, 539 P.2d 807]; see also <em>In re Robin M. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 337, 342 [146 Cal.Rptr. 352, 579 P.2d 1]; <em>T.N.G. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 767, 776, fn. 10 [94 Cal.Rptr. 813, 484 P.2d 981]; <em>In re William M. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 16, 21, fn. 5 [89 Cal.Rptr. 33, 473 P.2d 737]; <em>In re Gladys R. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 855, 867 [83 Cal.Rptr. 671, 464 P.2d 127].)</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>The commission found that one of the \u201cmajor problems\u201d of juvenile justice in California was that \u201c[bjasic legal rights are neither being uniformly nor adequately protected under present juvenile court provisions and procedures.\u201d (Com. Rep., pt. I, at p. 12.) \u201cThe paradox of juvenile courts ... is that while they are designed to insure a superior justice through protection of the child, they have, to an excessive extent, abandoned the fundamental judicial protections upon which the traditional methods of promoting justice are based.\u201d (Com. Rep., pt. II, at p. 4.) The commission conducted interviews with a sample of juvenile' court judges around the state and found, inter alia, that less than half of them applied the accomplice-corroboration rule in proceedings before them. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">In view of the \u201cpronounced absence of uniformity of court procedures,\u201d the commission proposed in its Recommendation No. 11 that the \u201cjuvenile court law should set forth minimum procedural rules as outlined in the comments accompanying this recommendation.\u201d (Com. Rep., pt. I, at p. 29.) Those comments specifically referred to the accomplice-corroboration rule and recommended that <em>\u201caccomplice testimony should be surrounded with the usual safeguards . . . </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Id., </em>at p. 30, italics added.) The commission explained that \u201c[a]ll of the reasons for employing rules of evidence in other judicial proceedings, e.g., to insure truthful, reliable, and fair testimony, <em>apply with equal force </em>to a hearing on a minor\u2019s delinquency . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">The conclusion that the accomplice-corroboration rule is applicable to juvenile court proceedings is strongly supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Carl W.), supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 271. There, this court held that the Legislature, in acting upon the commission\u2019s Recommendation No. 11, decided to provide <em>more </em>protection for the minor at contested jurisdictional hearings than did the commission. The court held that by adding certain language to Welfare and Institutions Code section 680,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cthe Legislature . . . clearly indicated that more formality should be observed when there was a contested factual or legal issue\u201d than the commission had proposed. (15 Cal.3d at p. 278.) Clearly, the Legislature had no intention to do away with the commission\u2019s recommendation on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>accomplice-corroboration in favor of less formality or fewer rights, as suggested by the majority opinion. <em>(Ante, </em>at pp. 952-953.)</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">The majority contend nevertheless that the accomplice-corroboration rule could not have been intended to apply in juvenile court because Penal Code section 1111 applies only to a \u201cconviction,\u201d whereas Welfare and Institutions Code section 203 (former \u00a7 503; adapted from former \u00a7 736) provides that \u201c[a]n order adjudging a minor to be a ward of the juvenile court shall not be deemed a conviction of a crime for any purpose . . . .\u201d Apparently, it is argued that by enacting the quoted language of section 203, the Legislature intended to remove the accomplice-corroboration rule from juvenile court. This argument cannot withstand analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">The earliest version of the language relied upon by the majority was enacted by the Legislature in 1937 as former Welfare and Institutions Code section 736.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Stats. 1937, ch. 369, \u00a7 736, p. 1037.) That language was <em>not </em>added as part of a legislative bill which was aimed at the accomplice-corroboration rule. Rather, it was enacted as a part of the initial codification of the entire Welfare and Institutions Code. (Stats. 1937, ch. 369, p. 1005 et seq.) The obvious purpose of this language was to protect juveniles as much as possible from the stigma and the adverse consequences which society attaches to criminal convictions in adult court. (See <em>T.N.G. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d at pp. 775-776; see also <em>id., </em>at p. 776, fn. 10.) Its enactment\u2014and the enactment of its successor statutes (\u00a7\u00a7 503 and 203)\u2014had nothing to do with the accomplice-corroboration rule. They were intended to give <em>added </em>protection to minors, not take protection away.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Whatever doubts there may have been concerning the purpose of the language upon which the majority rely, those doubts were resolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>against their interpretation during the 1961 overhaul of Juvenile Court Law. At that time, the Juvenile Justice Commission took former section 736, reworded and expanded it, and recommended its enactment as section 503 (now \u00a7 203).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 503 was enacted exactly as proposed. Thus, the precise language relied on by the majority opinion was recommended by the same commission which concurrently recommended that \u201caccomplice testimony should be surrounded by the usual safeguards . . . .\u201d (Compare Com. Rep., pt. I, at p. 29 with Com. Rep., pt. I, at p. 52.) It defies reason to conclude that the commission wished to undo in one section what it affirmatively proposed elsewhere. The majority simply ignore this paradox to which their interpretation leads.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Further, the majority\u2019s reasoning flies in the face of this court\u2019s admonition \u201cto look to the consequences of the proceedings rather than the formal labels to determine what rights are appropriately applied to juvenile proceedings.\u201d <em>(In re Gladys R., supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 866, fn. 21; see also Note (1974) 14 Santa Clara Law. 881, 883-884.) The \u201cwooden approach\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> adopted by the majority has been repeatedly rejected, regardless of whether the rights involved are of constitutional origin (see, e.g., <em>In re Gault, supra, </em>387 U.S. at pp. 49-50 [18 L.Ed.2d at pp. 558-559]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Olivas </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 236, 244 [131 Cal.Rptr. 55, 551 P.2d 375]) or are based on statute <em>(In re Gladys R., </em><footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 866, fn. 21). \u201c[I]n terms of potential consequences, there is little to distinguish an adjudicatory hearing [in California\u2019s juvenile court system] from a traditional criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>(Breed </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 519, 530 [44 L.Ed.2d 346, 356, 95 S.Ct. 1779].) Clearly, the majority\u2019s statutory argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">The majority opinion\u2019s analysis of the denial of equal protection of the law is also erroneous. \u201cThe concept of the equal protection of the laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>compels recognition of the proposition that persons similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law receive like treatment.\u201d <em>(Purdy &amp; Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 566, 578 [79 Cal.Rptr. 77, 456 P.2d 645, 38 A.L.R.3d 1194].) That heretofore settled proposition should dispose of the present appeal, since the purposes and policies underlying the accomplice-corroboration rule apply equally to adults and juveniles accused of criminal misbehavior. (Cf., dis. opn., <em>ante, </em>part I; <em>In re R. C, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.3d at pp. 894-895.)</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">In this case, equal protection does not involve differences in the formalities of <em>how </em>a court goes about determining whether an individual has committed criminal misconduct. (See, e.g., <em>McKeiver </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra, </em>403 U.S. at p. 551 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 664].) Rather, it concerns <em>whether </em>a minor may be convicted of an offense at all, when, as a matter of law, an adult\u2014on trial for the identical offense on the basis of identical <em>evidence\u2014cannot </em>be found guilty.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is established that \u201c[t]he same considerations that demand extreme caution in factfinding to protect the innocent adult apply as well to the innocent child.\u201d <em>(In re Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. at p. 365 [25 L.Ed.2d at p. 376].) Therefore, the Supreme Court has held that a minor may not constitutionally be subjected to \u201cthe stigma of a finding that he violated a criminal law and to the possibility of institutional confinement on proof insufficient to convict him were he an adult.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 367 [25 L.Ed.2d at p. 377], fn. omitted.) These principles control here.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">The majority offer several rationales in an attempt to justify a contrary result. None has merit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For example, the majority \u201cassume\u201d that a judge is a more competent trier of fact than a jury and thus will be \u201cmore critical of accomplice testimony\u201d than a jury. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 951.) Yet, just three years ago this court, \u201chastened] to express our doubts\u201d about the validity of such a startling assumption. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number><em>Court (Carl W.), supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 280.) In suddenly reversing itself, the majority has today attempted to deny a basic premise of our constitutional forefathers. (Cf., Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16; U.S. Const., 6th Amend.; <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 145 [20 L.Ed.2d 491, 88 S.Ct. 1444].) It has also flatly overruled the Legislature, which applied the accomplice-corroboration rule of section 1111 both to jury trials <em>and </em>to court trials\u2014a fact which shows a legislative determination that judges are <em>not </em>more capable of evaluating accomplice testimony than are jurors. Thus, the majority have relied upon a justification for a legislative distinction that is directly contradicted by the evidence of legislative intent. The rational basis test of equal protection analysis requires that disparate treatment be justified by \u201ca purpose [that] can <em>realistically </em>be ascribed to the Legislature.\u201d <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>Bray </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 841, 854 [148 Cal.Rptr. 148, 582 P.2d 604], italics added.) Today\u2019s decision fails to meet that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">It is further asserted that a minor may be found to have committed a crime on evidence statutorily inadequate to convict an adult due to the state\u2019s need to intervene \u201cin the interest of rehabilitating an impressionable minor . . . .\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 952.) The majority do not elaborate. Both this court and the United States Supreme Court have on numerous occasions expressed grave doubts whether minors actually receive the benefits of any special rehabilitation or treatment. For this reason, the courts have required that such a justification allowing differences between the juvenile and adult court must be more elaborate than \u201cmere verbiage\u201d and \u201cmore persuasive than clich\u00e9 can provide.\u201d <em>(In re Gault, supra, </em>387 U.S. at pp. 29-30 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 547].) Courts must \u201clook to the consequences of the proceedings rather than the formal labels to determine what rights are appropriately applied to juvenile proceedings.\u201d <em>(In re Gladys R., supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 866, fn. 21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Only three years ago the Supreme Court \u201ccandidly appraised\u201d California\u2019s juvenile system and found \u201cno persuasive distinction\u201d between a section 602 proceeding and a criminal prosecution. <em>(Breed </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>421 U.S. at pp. 529, 531 [44.L.Ed.2d at pp. 355-357].) \u201c[I]n terms of potential consequences, there is little to distinguish an adjudicatory hearing such as [is held in California juvenile courts] from a traditional criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 530 [44 L.Ed.2d at p. 356].) Nothing has occurred in the intervening months to alter the conclusion of the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>The majority also rely heavily upon <em>McKeiver </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra, </em>403 U.S. 528, in which the Supreme Court held that minors do not have a federal due process right to a jury trial at a jurisdictional-type hearing in juvenile court. There, the Supreme Court noted that its earlier <em>Gault </em>and <em>Winship </em>decisions had placed \u201can emphasis on factfinding procedures.\u201d (403 U.S. at p. 543 [29 L.Ed. at p. 659].) A jury trial was not a due process requirement in juvenile court, the court reasoned, because \u201cone cannot say that in our legal system the jury is a <em>necessary component of accurate factfinding.\u201d (Ibid., </em>italics added.) The court also stated a jury trial right \u201cwould bring with it into that system the traditional delay, the formality, and the clamor of the adversary system and, possibly, the public trial.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 550 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 663].)</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">From the holding in <em>McKeiver, </em>the majority conclude there can be no constitutional compulsion for an accomplice-corroboration rule in juvenile court. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 952-953.) However, the majority have significantly misinterpreted <em>McKeiver. </em>At the threshold, the majority appear to believe that <em>McKeiver </em>was partly decided as an \u201cequal protection issue.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 952.) In fact, <em>McKeiver </em>was based only on the \u201cnarrow but precise\u201d due process issue. (403 U.S. at p. 530 [25 L.Ed.2d at p. 652].) Thus, while <em>McKeiver </em>might at most have disposed of appellant\u2019s federal due process claim, the equal protection problem was never resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">In the context of an equal protection analysis premised on the rational basis test, the inquiry is twofold: (1) can the reason that is offered to support the disparate treatment (e.g., of juveniles with respect to the accomplice-corroboration rule) \u201crealistically be ascribed to the Legislature\u201d; and, if so, (2) is the disparate treatment \u201crationally related to [that] legislative purpose?\u201d <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>Bray, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at pp. 854, 855.) Viewed from this perspective, <em>McKeiver </em>offers the majority no comfort.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">Most of the reasons relied upon in McKeiver\u2014including the most critical one\u2014cannot realistically be ascribed to the Legislature when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>(allegedly) refused to apply the accomplice-corroboration rule to the juvenile court. The key factor in <em>McKeiver </em>was the accuracy of the factfinding process. The Legislature clearly believed that the accomplice-corroboration rule <em>was </em>a \u201cnecessary component of accurate factfinding.\u201d As has <em>been </em>previously noted, that rule involves a legislative determination that accomplice testimony is \u201cnever . . . sufficiently trustworthy to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt unless corroborated.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tewksbury, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 967.) Moreover, the Legislature was <em>not </em>concerned that the accomplice-corroboration rule would add undue \u201cformality\u201d and \u201cclamor\u201d to contested jurisdictional hearings, since it \u201cclearly indicated that more formality should be observed when there was a contested factual or legal issue\u201d at the hearing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Carl W.), supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 278.)</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">As to the remaining reasons offered in <em>McKeiver </em>for not having jury trials in juvenile court\u2014i.e., delay and a public trial\u2014neither are in any way involved by incorporation of the accomplice-corroboration rule. None of the concerns are rationally advanced by refusing to apply the accomplice-corroboration rule in juvenile court. Therefore, <em>McKeiver </em>fails to support the position of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">The legislative history of our Juvenile Court Law makes clear that the accomplice-corroboration rule was intended to apply to juvenile court. In view of what the majority concede is the \u201cdifficult constitutional issue\u201d presented by this case <em>(ante, </em>at p. 949), I find it extraordinary they choose to pay so little attention to that history.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">Further, it should violate our most fundamental notions of equality that one person may be found to have committed criminal misconduct and be subject to a potentially lengthy term at an undeniably penal institution operated by the California Youth Authority, while another person accused of the same crime on the same evidence <em>must </em>be acquitted. The former, a minor who is assertedly the recipient of specialized treatment, is in reality the recipient of specialized punishment. I cannot agree that our Constitutions require this court to stand idly by and ignore this basic inequity.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">Newman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b959-11\">Report of the Governor\u2019s Special Study Commission on Juvenile Justice, Part I\u2014Recommendations for Changes in California\u2019s Juvenile Court Law (1960) page 30.

Even though the evidence is identical as to each boy, John may not be convicted, but Jim, because he is a minor, may.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b966-8\">The majority apply the rational basis test, rather than a strict scrutiny analysis, to the minor\u2019s equal protection claim. Such a choice is dubious at best. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Olivas, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 251.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b967-7\">On the contrary, juvenile proceedings involving allegations of law violations have become more akin to traditional criminal proceedings since <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Jones </em>was decided in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>1975. Now, for example, \u201cthe prosecuting attorney shall appear on behalf of the people of the State of California\u201d in section 602 hearings. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 681, subd. (a).) Moreover, the purposes of the Juvenile Court Law have been expanded to include the protection of the public from \u201ccriminal conduct by minors\u201d and the imposition on the minor of \u201ca sense of responsibility for his own acts.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 202, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"AlI\">The time is drawing inevitably closer when this court must confront, in light of the developing changes in the functions of the juvenile court system, whether the immunity of that system from all of the protections of the criminal courts can withstand constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
