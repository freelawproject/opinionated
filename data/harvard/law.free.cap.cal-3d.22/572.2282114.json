Rates were proposed for one-way radio-paging service in the Redlands/San Bernardino area. General Telephone previously had not offered that service in the area.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Involved here is a one-way radio-paging technique that permits a customer in transit to be contacted by someone at a stationary telephone. The stationary individual dials into the paging terminal an assigned, four-digit code number. A signal is transmitted by radio to the transiting person, who receives it as a tone emitted from a portable receiver. Two-way mobile service, which General Telephone already was providing in the area, also uses radio transmissions. It permits two-way voice communication rather than the simpler, one-way tone paging involved in General Telephone\u2019s proposed tariff modifications here.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Protests against the proposed modifications were filed with the Commission by two radiotelephone utilities (RTUs).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>similar service in the area, and they requested that General Telephone\u2019s one-way service not be allowed to go into effect. The Commission suspended the new tariffs and instituted an investigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After several days of hearings, the Commission decided to end the investigation and to permit General Telephone to institute the proposed rates for its one-way paging (Dec. No. 86402, Case No. 975 (1976) 80 Cal.P.U.C. 503). It denied rehearing and reconsideration in Decision No. 86706 (1976) 80 Cal.P.U.C. 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Three RTUs requested review here. They allege (1) that the Commission\u2019s decision is unlawful because it permits General Telephone to extend its service without certification, and (2) that the Commission exceeded its authority when it investigated but did not adequately consider the anticompetitive aspects of the proposed service.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree with the complainants as to both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">I. <em>Certification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Public Utilities Code section 1001 provides that, before a telephone corporation \u201cbegin[s] the construction of... a line, plant, or system, or of any extension thereof,\u201d the Commission must certify that \u201cthe present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require such construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">General Telephone\u2019s proposed service requires (1) expansion of its terminal facilities in Pomona to accept up to 1,000 pager numbers (compared with the present 770 capacity), (2) installation of a new transmitter in Redlands, and (3) two foreign exchange lines for access to the Pomona terminal. The Commission found that \u201crelatively little additional plant is required in order to institute the new service.\u201d The minimal construction needed for expansion apparently is peculiar to radiotelephone service. (See <em>Loperena </em>v. <em>Fresno Mobile Radio, Inc. </em>(1970) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>71 Cal.P.U.C. 645, 649: \u201cIt is technically practicable for an RTU offering selective two-way mobile communication to add one-way paging service throughout its two-way service area without any necessary additions to its transmitting equipment. . . .\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\"> The RTUs contend that, even with minimal construction, General Telephone must obtain certification before offering the new service in Redlands/San Bernardino. Unless certificated, they say, the new service would be unlawful. General Telephone answers that the new service is exempted by these words of section 1001: \u201cThis article shall not be construed to require any such corporation to secure such certificate ... for an extension within or to territory already served by it, necessary in the ordinary course of its business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The Commission found that General Telephone now furnishes two-way mobile service throughout the Redlands/San Bernardino area where one-way service is proposed. It concluded that no certificate was needed because, under section 1001, the new service would constitute an \u201cextension within or to territory already served . . . , necessary in the ordinary course of . . . [General Telephone\u2019s] business.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The RTUs respond that certification nonetheless is necessary because the existing two-way service has never been certificated and thus itself is unlawful. Before the exception in section 1001 may be applied the lawfulness of the existing service should be shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">.At oral argument Commission counsel stated that General Telephone\u2019s two-way service in the area has been certificated. If so the company does lawfully provide that service and, under section 1001, may provide the new service without further certification. <em>(Loperena, supra.) </em>But nothing in the Commission opinion, record, or briefs indicates that the two-way service has been certificated; and, though we asked, the Commission has not provided us with a copy of any certification. We therefore examine the question of lawfulness assuming, as the Commission apparently did in its own opinion, that the two-way service never was certificated.</p>\n<p id=\"A_p\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>The Commission decided here that certification was not required for the two-way service because it covered territory already served by General Telephone\u2019s wirelines.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It found that \u201c[t]he word \u2018territory\u2019 as used in that part of section 1001 of the Public Utilities Code reading \u2018. . . extension within or to territory already served by it, necessary in the ordinary course of its business. . .\u2019 can and should denote, for mobile radiotelephone service by a land line telephone utility, that service area delineated by an appropriate signal strength contour which provides reasonable coverage of its pertinent exchanges <em>and such adjacent area as necessary to provide a rational </em>contour.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Using that definition the Commission concluded that General Telephone\u2019s uncertificated mobile s\u00e9rvice is lawful, even though the signal covers not only part of its own wireline area but also part of several Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company exchanges. The Commission explained that \u201cradio signals . . . cannot be arbitrarily confined to the fixed boundaries of telephone exchanges\u201d and that section 1001 was \u201cdesigned for classes of utilities with fundamentally different physical and operating characteristics than those of utilities in the radio communications field.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Because no special statutory scheme has been devised for radiotelephone communications, the Commission applies statutes not tailored to the new technology. <em>Loperena, supra, </em>71 Cal.P.U.C. 645, was a case in which the Commission struggled to find a way to accommodate the physical and economic characteristics of radiotelephone service to the words of section 1001. Because it found the statute inadequate to provide uniform regulation of two-way radiotelephone expansion into one-way service, it applied the words in such a way as to remove completely such expansion from any regulation. In this case the Commission again adopted an interpretation that removes radiotelephone expansion from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>regulation. But the reasons the Commission cited for its <em>Loperena </em>interpretation do not apply here. There, when mobile service expanded to include concentric paging service, additional construction would not always be necessary. Further, efficiency and economy would be furthered by having the same supplier offer both services, using the same equipment and personnel. l\u00eda contrast, when a wireline service expands to include mobile service, construction is typical rather than atypical; and the same equipment and personnel are not necessarily used. Also, <em>Loperena </em>concerned a new service concentric with and entirely within the existing service area, while the mobile service area here is quite different in size and shape from the original service. The Commission\u2019s interpretation here appears to exempt from certification an indefinite amount of radiotelephone expansion by wireline companies. It permits uncertificated expansion into \u201csuch adjacent area as necessary to provide a rational contour\u201d but does not indicate any limit to the size of a \u201crational contour.\u201d Complainants state that the radio contour area here is three times larger than General Telephone\u2019s wireline area.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The ratio of a radio contour area to a wireline area apparently could depend on the shape and size of the wireline exchange and the location of the transmitting tower within it, as well as the shape and size of the contour itself (see fn. 8, <em>ante). </em>Without limits on \u201ca rational contour\u201d the Commission\u2019s definition seems to be not an interpretation but rather a contradiction of the words of section 1001, resulting in partial deregulation (cf. <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>So. Pacific Communications Co. </em>(1974) 78 Cal.P.U.C. 123, 126-128).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The Commission emphasizes that wireline boundaries cannot accurately describe or confine a radiotelephone service area. We disagree with the Commission\u2019s conclusion that therefore all General Telephone\u2019s radiotelephone service area exceeding its wireline boundaries should be treated for certification purposes as if it were within those boundaries. On the contrary, new service to a large area that is more than incidentally outside the authorized service boundaries should be considered an extension by the wireline company into territory not already served by it. Otherwise, as this case illustrates, new service will be permitted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>previously unserved territory without certification, in contradiction of the clear mandate of section 1001.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">To require certification for wireline utilities\u2019 initial radiotelephone extension into new territory does not reject the Commission policy of fostering limited competition between wireline utilities and RTUs. <em>(Malis </em>v. <em>General Telephone Co., supra </em>(1961) 59 Cal.P.U.C. 110, 115-116; see also Dec. No. 85356 (1976) 79 Cal.P.U.C. 404, 457-458; the FCC\u2019s <em>Guardband Proceeding </em>(1968) 12 F.C.C.2d 841, recon. den. 14 F.C.C.2d 269, affirmed <em>sub. nom., Radio Relay Corporation </em>v. <em>F.C.C. </em>(2d Cir. 1969) 409 F.2d 322.) But the competition should be allowed only after a commission determination of public convenience and necessity. In making that determination the Commission would consider factors related to the beneficial effect of competition (e.g., adequacy of existing service). (Dec. No. 85356 (1976) 79 Cal.P.U.C. 404, 428; <em>Silver Beehive Telephone Co. </em>(1970) 71 Cal.P.U.C. 304, 307.) Indeed, as we discuss below, the Commission is required in certification proceedings to consider competition as an element of the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\"> In this case the Commission\u2019s approval of the tariffs did seem to resemble a certification decision. While it did not make a finding of or issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity, it did find the service to be in the public interest after discussion of several factors that also would be required in making a certification decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Complainants maintain, though, that by avoiding a certification proceeding General Telephone avoided \u201cthe procedural and substantive guidelines prescribed by the Commission.\u201d One significant difference between a certification proceeding and this one is that in the former determination of public convenience and necessity is required. Here, though, the Commission analyzed facts that happen to be relevant to certification only because a complaint by competitors led to an investigation. Further, in a certification proceeding the burden is on the applicant to show that the public convenience and necessity require the proposed service.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Here the burden was on complainants. In addition, the Commission\u2019s rules require that a certification application include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>information that was not included in the tariff letters here because certification was not requested (names of prospective competitors, maps, facts showing public convenience and necessity, etc.; see Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 20, \u00a7 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\"> We conclude that the Commission exceeded its authority by permitting General Telephone\u2019s tariff changes. Because the extensive two-way mobile service outside the wireline exchange boundaries is unlawful without certification, the proposed one-way service in the same area without a certification hearing also would be unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">II. <em>Issues as to Competition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Complainants contend that the Commission improperly excluded evidence of a regional plan, agreed to by General Telephone and Pacific Telephone, to provide paging service jointly and separately throughout southern California. They offered the evidence to show possible antitrust and anticompetitive effects of General Telephone\u2019s new service.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">\u201cIt is no longer open to serious question that in reaching a decision to grant or deny a certificate of public convenience and necessity, the Commission should consider the antitrust implications of the matter before it.\u201d <em>(Northern California Power Agency </em>v. <em>Public Util. Com. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 370, 377 [96 Cal.Rptr. 18, 486 P.2d 1218].) Even if the matter were not treated as a certification proceeding, the Commission agrees that it had a duty to consider anticompetitive factors as an element of the public interest affected by the new service. By excluding evidence of a plan the Commission here seems to have failed to fulfill that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Complainants sought to introduce evidence of the regional plan to show that Pacific Telephone and General Telephone had agreed to supply radiotelephone service jointly in some areas and to divide other areas between them. The Redlands/San Bernardino area at issue here allegedly was among the areas to be divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">The Commission offers several reasons for excluding the evidence. <em>First, </em>it relies on Commission and FCC policies to favor competition between wireline companies and RTUs. <em>(Malis </em>v. <em>General Telephone Co., supra, </em>59 Cal.P.U.C. 110.) <em>Malis, </em>however, did not imply that competition between wireline companies and RTUs should be promoted by eliminat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>ing competition between the wireline companies themselves. <em>Second, </em>the Commission explains that the plan here is too broad to be relevant because (1) this proceeding is limited to a small geographical area; (2) the paging service would not be provided jointly with Pacific Telephone but only by General Telephone; and (3) there is no evidence of an agreement that Pacific Telephone would refer its customers in the area to General Telephone. That reasoning ignores the possibility that General Telephone\u2019s exclusive presence in the Redlands/San Bernardino market is the result of an agreement to divide the market. <em>Finally, </em>the Commission contends that the evidence should have been introduced in another case pending at the time, involving the Los Angeles area, where anticompetitive factors were material issues. That those issues may have been material in another case does not justify excluding the evidence here. The agreement allegedly concerned the entire southern California paging market. That the other case involved a larger area and a joint service does not explain refusal to consider the plan in reference to a smaller area where allegedly the plan stated that only one wireline company would provide service.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">We note that <em>Northern California Power, supra, </em>requires consideration of antitrust issues where \u201ca close nexus exists\u201d between the construction to be approved by the Commission and an agreement presenting antitrust problems. (5 Cal.3d at p. 380.) In line with that decision the Commission in other cases has limited the scope of investigation (to avoid delays in needed facilities) by excluding \u201cantitrust implications [that] have only tangential impact on the primary matter before the Commission.\u201d (Dec. No. 81186 (1973) 75 Cal.P.U.C. 101, 114, mod. in Dec. No. 81422 (1973) 75 Cal.P.U.C. 227.) While some evidence offered here may have been tangential, the evidence of an agreement including the Redlands/San Bernardino area does seem closely related to General Telephone\u2019s expansion into that area.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">As for evidence on the joint plan that was admitted, the Commission\u2019s opinion does not analyze the issues raised.  This court stated in <em>Northern California Power, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at 379, \u201cThe task of the Commission extends far beyond the passive role of a sounding board. The Commission cannot discharge its duty by merely taking \u2018cognizance [of the evidence]\u2019 without evaluating [its] effect upon the interests of the public. It must weigh the opposing evidence and arguments in order \u2018to determine whether the rights and interests of the general public will be advanced by the prosecution of the enterprise which it is proposed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>carry on for the service of the public.\u2019 <em>(Oro Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>R. R. Commission </em>(1915) 169 Cal. 466, 475 [147 P. 118].)\u201d The Commission must also make findings of fact and conclusions of law relevant to all material issues. (5 Cal.3d at p. 380.)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Here the Commission looked only for evidence as to practices by General Telephone in the Pomona/Ontario /Redlands/ San Bernardino area, and it ignored the regional plan issue. While the plan itself was excluded, two internal General Telephone memos on the proposed service in the limited area were admitted (one stating, \u201cDeviation from the Personal Signaling Service Fundamental Plan for the Southern California Region has not been concurred in by PT&amp;T;\u201d the other noting that \u201cit will be necessaiy to negotiate a revision to the Personal Signaling Fundamental Plan which depicts frequency allocation and is presently concurred in by both PT&amp;T and General Companies\u201d). A material issue as to anticompetitive effect in the Pomona/Ontario/Redlands/San Bernardino area seems clearly raised by such evidence, but the Commission did not fulfill its duty to address that issue. Its discussion of the overall, beneficial effects of competition between RTUs and General Telephone did not take into account how that competition might be affected by the regional plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">We hold that the record <em>here does not </em>support the Commission\u2019s interpretation and application of the \u201cterritory already served\u201d exception in section 1001. Further, approval of General Telephone\u2019s paging service was unlawful because the Commission did not consider and make findings on the anticompetitive effect of any agreement not to compete in that area. However, we express no opinion as to whether such an agreement in fact would have an anticompetitive effect or whether notwithstanding that <em>effect the </em>proposed service would still be in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The decisions are annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Bird, C. J., Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., Clark, J., Richardson, J., and Manuel, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">The petition of the real party in interest for a rehearing was denied November 30, 1978.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Section 489 provides that \u201cevery public utility other than a common carrier shall file with the commission . . . schedules showing all rates ... to be collected or enforced. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Regarding changes, section 491 provides: \u201cUnless the commission otherwise orders, no change shall be made by any public utility in any rate . . . except after 30 days\u2019 notice to the commission and to the public.

General Telephone also provided two-way mobile service in the Redlands/San Bernardino area and wireline service in much of both areas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b581-12\">When first ruling, in 1961, that radiotelephone utilities are subject to its jurisdiction the Commission stated: \u201cFor administrative purposes, to differentiate between those telephone utilities conducting a general wireline business within the State of California and those utilities conducting such business principally or exclusively by radio, the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>group will be referred to hereinafter as radiotelephone utilities.\u201d (Dec.
