On Tuesday, November 2, 1976, an election was held to decide whether EPUD should be dissolved and annexed to the City of Redding. The ballot measure required a concurrent majority of those voting in both the city and EPUD in order to carry.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">The official canvass disclosed that Redding voters expressed overwhelming approval of the proposed annexation; EPUD electors voted 2,788 for consolidation and 2,231 against, however, a difference of 557 votes. The county clerk declared that a majority of the electors of EPUD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>favored dissolution and annexation, and a record of the result was certified to the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Plaintiffs do not contest the Redding vote, but dispute the EPUD tally. They filed a timely statement of contest pursuant to section 20050, naming county, municipal, and EPUD officials as defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statement alleged grounds for the contest as provided in section 20021.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, plaintiffs averred under subdivision (a) of section 20021 that the officials supervising the election were guilty of malconduct in that they caused \u201cover 2000 ballots to be misplaced on election night; . . . [were] under the influence of alcohol while counting votes; . . . [and permitted] unauthorized persons in the area where ballots were being counted,\u201d and that these irregularities were sufficient to change the election result. Additional allegations recited verbatim the terms of subdivisions (e) and (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">At pretrial conference the court ruled that plaintiffs were entitled to a recount only if they demonstrated on the basis of evidence other than the ballots themselves that there was a substantial possibility of a miscount which affected the outcome of the election.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs objected to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>ruling, arguing that section 20084 does not require them to make an evidentiary showing that a recount is necessary, and that since their statement of contest alleged facts which justified a recount the court was compelled to grant their request. They also offered to advance the costs of the recount, as required by section 20088.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Nevertheless, at trial the court proceeded to take evidence on the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. It was disclosed that on the night of the election the poll workers in each precinct of EPUD conducted an unofficial physical count of the vote. The ballots were then forwarded to the county clerk\u2019s office for the official computer tally. The district attorney was in the clerk\u2019s office with the election officials while ballots were being sorted for computer tabulation; there was conflicting evidence as to whether he was intoxicated and whether he touched boxes containing ballots. The ballots were tabulated by a computer in the adjoining board of supervisors\u2019 meeting room, and a screen in the clerk\u2019s office announced a running total of the results. The final canvass that evening was 2,000 votes short of the preceding physical count made by poll workers in EPUD.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Three days after the election, the ballots were again tallied by computer. The results of this count were exactly the same as the physical count on the night of the election, and these figures were announced as the official tally.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The court found that the 2,000-vote discrepancy in the first computer count, which plaintiffs alleged resulted from \u201cmisplaced\u201d ballots, was due to a programming error, and that this error was discovered and corrected and had no effect on the final official canvass; that none of the persons counting the ballots was under the influence of alcohol; and that while the district attorney was not authorized to be in the vote processing area, he did not interfere with the count and his presence had no effect on the results of the official canvass. The .court concluded that plaintiffs did not establish that a recount of ballots was necessary for the proper determination of the contest, and it confirmed the results of the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Plaintiffs contend that the plain language of section 20084 requires a recount when, as here, the grounds alleged in the statement of contest are such that a recount would be required if the allegations were true. We agree with this reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">In construing a statute it is the task of the court to determine the intent of the Legislature so as to fulfill the purpose for which the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>was enacted. <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 515 P.2d 1224], and cases cited.) We turn first to the words of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Section 20084 provides that at trial \u201cthe ballots shall be opened and a recount taken . . . where it appears <em>from the statements filed </em>that a recount is necessary for the proper determination of the contest.\u201d (Italics added.) The emphasized phrase distinctly directs the court to the statement of contest referred to in section 20050. (Fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em>Although the section does not explicitly preclude the court from going beyond the statement of contest in determining the necessity of a recount, if it were not for the inclusion of the quoted phrase the court could presumably consider both the statement and extrinsic evidence in determining whether a recount should be ordered. The limitation, \u201cfrom the statements filed,\u201d would be surplusage if the Legislature did not intend to confine the court to that material in making its determination of necessity. Thus the language of the section implies a legislative intent that the court look <em>only </em>to the statement of contest in determining whether a recount shall be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Considerations of public policy also favor this construction. To allow courts to reach beyond the statement of contest in deciding the necessity of a recount would postpone resolution of the challenge. As occurred here, the denial of a recount may trigger subsequent appeals and further delays. The cloud that lingers over the legitimacy of an election can cast its shadow for years. Here the resolution has been delayed for two years, during which time, according to defendants, services between the city and the former EPUD have been integrated, a bond issue of approximately $10 million for sewer and electrical services has been approved, and the former chairman of EPUD has been elected to the city council. A recount in the first instance would have immediately resolved the matter and avoided the uncertainties which the trial of a contest generates. In view of these considerations, the election contest provisions should be construed liberally in favor of the contestant. <em>(In re Cryer </em>(1926) 77 Cal.App. 605, 609 [247 P. 252].)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The Legislature itself has expressed concern over election contest delays, as shown by the following statutory requirements: in most cases such a contest must be filed, if at all, within 30 days after the declaration of the election result (\u00a7 20051, subd. (d)); the county clerk must notify the superior court of the filing within 5 days, and the court must thereafter set a hearing to be held within 20 days (\u00a7 <em>20080); </em>the commencement of the hearing or trial cannot be continued for more than 20 days (\u00a7 20083); and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>the court is required to file its findings of fact and conclusions of law within 10 days after the close of the proceedings (\u00a7 20086). Moreover, the Legislature has explicitly precluded the court from dismissing a contest for want of form (\u00a7 20053). Consistently, we held in <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Rourke </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 430, 438 [196 P.2d 884], overruled on other grounds, <em>Keane </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 932, 939 [95 Cal.Rptr. 197, 485 P.2d 261], that no \u201cnicety of pleading\u201d is required. It is clear the Legislature intended to ensure the speedy and practical resolution of electipn contests in order to promptly ascertain the will of the people. This legislative goal is promoted by interpreting section 20084 so as to confine the trial court to the statement of contest in determining whether a recount is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">It is important to note that in order to compel a recount a contestant must comply with section 20053, which entitles the court to dismiss the matter if the statement of contest fails to allege grounds with sufficient certainty to \u201cadvise the defendant of the particular proceeding or cause for which the election is contested.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The predecessor of section 20053 was applied in <em>In re Cryer </em>(1926) <em>supra, </em>77 Cal.App. 605. That case involved a contest statement which alleged that the board of elections had tallied ballots for the Mayor of Los Angeles which were not intended to be cast for him and had disqualified ballots lawfully cast for other candidates. The proceeding was dismissed because the contestant failed to set forth the \u201cparticular grounds\u201d of the contest, and the ruling was upheld on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In the present case the trial court apparently concluded that the charges set forth in plaintiffs\u2019 statement of contest were sufficiently specific to satisfy the requirements of section 20053, as it proceeded to take evidence on the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Clearly plaintiffs\u2019 charges, if true, would have required a recount, for they alleged that more than 2,000 ballots were misplaced in an election in which the announced margin of victory was less than 600. In these circumstances, the trial court erred in hearing evidence on the allegations contained in plaintiffs\u2019 statement and in determining on the basis of such evidence that plaintiffs were not entitled to a recount.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Defendants insist that our interpretation of section 20084 renders the trial and subpoena provisions of the Elections Code inoperative. However, section 20021 (fn. 3, ante) provides six grounds on which an election contest may be based; proof of certain of these grounds does not require a recount but may necessitate a trial or evidentiary hearing. For instance, a trial may be necessary to establish that the person declared elected was not eligible for the office. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).) Thus, the trial and subpoena provisions are not rendered inoperative by our interpretation of section 20084 as confining the trial court to the statement of contest in those situations in which the charges would require a recount.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Nor is there merit in defendants\u2019 assertion that the limitation we adopt will turn the contest provisions into a \u201cwide-open recount procedure.\u201d The Legislature has provided ample safeguards against such an occurrence. Frivolous election contests are deterred by requiring the contestant to advance the costs of a recount (\u00a7 20088), and in a populous district the costs are substantial. Moreover, the contestant must verify his statement of contest, which renders him liable for perjurious allegations. (\u00a7 20051.) Lastly, a contestant must allege grounds with supporting facts which are sufficiently specific to advise the defendant of the particular cause for the challenge. (\u00a7 20053.)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Finally, defendants assert that, to preserve the faith of the people in the electoral process, we must construe section 20084 to disallow easy access to a recount. Faith in the ballot box as an accurate index of public opinion is indeed essential; as Justice Douglas wrote, \u201cFree and honest elections are the very foundation of our republican form of government.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Classic </em>(1941) 313 U.S. 299, 329 [85 L.Ed. 1368, 1385, 61 S.Ct. 1031] (dis. opn.).) But public faith and confidence inexorably decline whenever final determination of a challenge for error or fraud is delayed for a substantial period or thwarted completely.  It is the primary purpose of the election contest provisions to ascertain the will of the people and to make certain that mistake or fraud has not frustrated the public volition. <em>(Minor </em>v. <em>Kidder </em>(1872) 43 Cal. 229, 237; <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Culbertson </em>(1881) 58 Cal. 198, 209.) When courts erect barriers to the recount procedure\u2014barriers not compelled by statute\u2014public doubt is prolonged and suspicion replaces confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that plaintiffs are entitled to a recount. The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">Bird, C.
