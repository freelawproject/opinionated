J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOt\">Appellant, plaintiff\u2019s attorney in a personal injury suit, was ordered by the trial court to pay respondents $700 in attorney\u2019s fees after a mistrial was declared in that action. This court must decide whether the trial court exceeded its authority in issuing that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">Appellant, Maxim N. Bach, represented the plaintiff in the personal injury suit of <em>Bauguess </em>v. <em>Paine. </em>The trial proceeded uneventfully until the second day, when appellant proposed reading a deposition to the jury. Appellant requested that a diagram, attached to the deposition, be admitted into evidence. Extra copies of the diagram had been made to pass among the jurors for their use in following the testimony. This procedure was approved by the court and the clerk was told to label the copies \u201c6A through M.\u201d When appellant requested that \u201c6 go into evidence,\u201d the court replied: \u201c6 is in evidence as are 6A through M.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Before the deposition was read, copies of the diagram were passed out to the jurors with the court\u2019s explanation: \u201cLadies and Gentlemen attached to the back of the deposition is a diagram. The diagram has been received in evidence. . . . These are Xerox copies for your use in following the deposition. They are numbered exhibits 6A through M. So you each have a copy. You are free to write on those documents, take notes. At the conclusion of the reading of this deposition those exhibits will be picked up by the bailiff, deposited with the clerk. At the time the case is submitted to you you will have those available in the jury room during your deliberations. So if you want to mark on them, fine, but take a look. You should have Exhibit 6A through M. A should be in the hands of Juror Number 1. And M should be in the hands of the alternate. Keep track of your own exhibit. You may proceed.\u201d These copies of the diagram were collected by the bailiff after the deposition had been read.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">This same procedure was followed regarding a sketch prepared by the next witness, a highway patrolman. The prepared copies of the sketch were passed among the jury and the court admitted \u201c7A through M <em>in evidence, </em>there being no objection.\u201d Again, the court instructed the jury, \u201cyou\u2019re free to mark on <em>these exhibits </em>if you want.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>These exhibits were not collected from the jury at the close of the patrolman\u2019s testimony. After another deposition was read, the court, observing that jurors had been taking notes on the diagrams, asked if any juror wanted note paper for the remainder of the trial. The court stated: \u201cBut let me advise you that it is all right for you to take.notes, but these are your personal notes and they\u2019re not to be shared with anyone until the case is finally submitted to you, and then you may refer to them in your deliberations, but until such time they\u2019re your own personal notes, not to be shown to anyone, not to be shown to any of your fellow jurors, your spouse or your neighbors, anybody. What we do in long trials is we often pass out spiral notebooks with the jurors\u2019 seat number on them and then collect them each night and give them back each morning. On short trials we don\u2019t go through that, but you\u2019re entitled to take your own notes and keep them. But keep in mind you are to keep your own counsel and you are not to share them with anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The court then collected the exhibits of the highway patrolman\u2019s sketch, on which the jurors had taken notes. Note paper was supplied to the jury. Although the jurors were allowed by the court to take their notes home, they were admonished to keep the notes confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">After the trial had recessed for the evening and while the judge was engaged with other matters, appellant asked permission of the clerk to examine exhibit 7. He took the exhibit, looked at it briefly, and returned it.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Before trial commenced the next day, the judge remarked that his clerk had informed him that appellant had looked at certain exhibits on which the jurors had taken notes. Appellant responded that he was entitled to do so since the exhibits had been admitted into evidence. The court disagreed, reprimanded appellant, and raised the possibility of a mistrial. Appellant steadfastly maintained he had done nothing improper, that there had been no prejudice to respondents\u2019 case and that the error, if any, could be cured if opposing counsel were to view the notes as well. Defense counsel refused and then moved for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">An acrimonious discussion ensued between the court and appellant. The court was particularly displeased with appellant\u2019s position that once an item had been admitted into evidence, counsel had not only a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>but a duty to examine it. Construing this position as an attack on its powers, the court informed appellant that his position constituted contempt of court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When appellant failed to change his position, the court granted respondents\u2019 motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">After the jury was discharged, defense counsel requested attorney\u2019s fees for the two days of the aborted trial. The court again expressed displeasure at appellant\u2019s position, indicated contempt or other disciplinary proceedings might be in order, and continued the matter for two days.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">At the hearing on respondents\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees, appellant requested that the contempt charges be heard first, since he feared anything said in opposition to the motion for attorney\u2019s fees might be used against him in the contempt proceedings. Appellant\u2019s counsel further requested that the hearing be postponed until the reporter\u2019s transcript of the trial was prepared. The court denied both requests. On the advice of counsel, appellant did not argue the motion for attorney\u2019s fees but renewed his standing request that the contempt proceedings be heard first.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The court declared the motion for attorney\u2019s fees submitted without opposition because appellant remained mute. Thereafter, the court ordered appellant to pay respondent $700 for attorney\u2019s fees as a sanction. The court then reiterated its displeasure, concluding: \u201c[What] would make me happier than anything in the world is to have you just maybe eat a little humble pie and admit that yo\u00fa made a mistake in judgment and it\u2019s not going to happen again. That\u2019s all I\u2019m after.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>When the hearing resumed the following week, the court again expressed its displeasure at appellant\u2019s conduct and formally found him in direct contempt for \u201cviolating] the court\u2019s order\u201d regarding the diagrams on which the jurors had taken notes. However, the court declined to impose a penalty for the contempt at that time, noting that appellant had already been assessed $700 in attorney\u2019s fees for the mistrial. This award was characterized by the court as analogous to probation and restitution in a criminal case and as an alternative to a penalty for contempt. \u201cNow if Mr. Bach is not willing to accept that as an alternative to the contempt then the court is certainly prepared to impose sanctions for contempt as well.\u201d This appeal was taken from the order directing appellant to pay attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $700.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\"> The sole issue before this court is whether the award of attorney\u2019s fees as a sanction for appellant\u2019s alleged misconduct was a proper exercise of the trial court\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">It has been the traditional practice in this country for each litigant to bear his or her own attorney\u2019s fees. <em>(Prentice </em>v. <em>North Amer. Title Guar. Corp. </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 618, 620 [30 Cal.Rptr. 821, 381 P.2d 645].) Awards of attorney\u2019s fees by courts are the exception rather than the rule. Generally, a court may properly award attorney\u2019s fees only pursuant to an agreement of the parties or statutory authority. This principle is codified in Code of Civil Procedure section 1021; \u201cExcept as attorney\u2019s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties . . . .\u201d In the present case, there was no agreement between the parties that would support the trial court\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>The Legislature has enacted several statutes authorizing the award of attorney\u2019s fees to advance certain public policies. (See generally 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 125-128, pp. 3275-3277.) However, there is no statute which authorizes the - award of attorney\u2019s fees in personal injury cases. <em>(LeFave </em>v. <em>Dimond </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 868, 870 [299 P.2d 858, 60 A.L.R.2d 939].)  Some statutes do authorize the use of fee awards as sanctions for conduct which produces unnecessary or unwarranted litigation. (See, e.g., Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2034 [authorizing the award of attorney\u2019s fees as a sanction for the improper refusal to permit discovery].) Usually these awards are assessed against the party or witness, but under certain circumstances both trial and appellate courts are authorized to order <em>counsel </em>to pay the opposing party\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees as a sanction for counsel\u2019s improper conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, no statute provides for fee awards as sanctions following a <em>mistrial </em>either against a counsel or a party. Respondent concedes this point, but contends that the court had the inherent power to make such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Courts have drawn on two distinct sources of power to justify the award of attorney\u2019s fees: equitable power derived from the historic power of equity courts (see, e.g., <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 35 [141 Cal.Rptr. 315, 569 P.2d 1303]), and supervisory or administrative powers which all courts possess to enable them to carry out their duties <em>(Fairfield </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 120 [54 Cal.Rptr. 721]; cf. <em>Bloniarz </em>v. <em>Roloson </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 143, 147-148 [74 Cal.Rptr. 285, 449 P.2d 221]). Although the latter power has been recognized by the Legislature in Code of Civil Procedure section 128,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it exists apart from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>express statutory authority. <em>(Bloniarz </em>v. <em>Roloson, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d at pp. 147-148; see generally 1 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1970) Courts, \u00a7\u00a7 116-118, pp. 385-388.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Courts have used their inherent equitable power in limited situations to award attorney\u2019s fees when it was warranted by the equities of the case. For example, one who preserves a common fund may recoup his or her attorney\u2019s fees from that fund, thus allocating the burden among all those who are to share in the fund. Also, one who acts as a \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d to further an important public policy, and one who confers a substantial benefit on a defendant or a large class, may be awarded attorney\u2019s fees. (See generally <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest, supra, 20 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 35-47.) In these cases, the fee award serves a dual purpose. It allocates the financial burden of litigation in an equitable manner and provides individuals with an incentive to bring litigation which benefits a larger group.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">This court has moved cautiously in expanding the nonstatutory bases on which awards of attorney\u2019s fees may be predicated. In <em>Serrano, </em>fees were awarded only after careful analysis and a finding that compelling reasons of public policy warranted such an award. Specific guidelines for the exercise of the trial court\u2019s power to make such awards were set down. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 43-47.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">In the present case, the fee award was not designed to foster a particular kind of socially beneficial litigation as approved in <em>Serrano. </em>Further, the equities of the case do not require shifting the burden to appellant of respondents\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees incurred for the two days of the aborted trial.  Appellant was not solely responsible for the events leading to the declaration of the mistrial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Clearly, this case does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>not fit within any of the recognized equitable exceptions to the general rule that each party shall pay for its own attorney.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The remaining question this court must decide is whether, absent statutory authority, a court may award attorney\u2019s fees as a sanction under its <em>supervisory </em>power.  Pursuant to this power, a court may take appropriate action to secure compliance with its orders, to punish contempt, and to control its proceedings. <em>(Bloniarz </em>v. <em>Roloson, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d at pp. 147-148.) Although a few statutes permit fee awards as sanctions, the appellate courts of this state have generally disallowed such awards based on a theory of inherent supervisory power. (See, e.g., <em>Wisniewski </em>v. <em>Clary, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.3d 499 [failure of party to attend mandatory settlement conference]; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Redman </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 827 [128 Cal.Rptr. 86] [bad faith defense, failure of party to appear at trial]; contra, <em>Santandrea </em>v. <em>Siltec Corp. </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 525 [128 Cal.Rptr. 629].) Even in the discovery context, where attorney\u2019s fees are permitted as sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2034, a purely punitive award of $1,000 in attorney\u2019s fees has not been allowed. <em>(Welgoss </em>v. <em>End </em>(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 982 [61 Cal.Rptr. 52] [sanction not permitted to punish plaintiff\u2019s dilatory conduct occurring prior to defendant\u2019s seeking a motion to compel].)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Respondents rely chiefly on <em>Fairfield </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>246 Cal.App.2d 113, 120. However, that slender reed scarcely provides support for the sweeping power respondents would have this court approve. <em>Fairfield </em>held that a trial court may award attorney\u2019s fees or impose appropriate sanctions if a party refuses to obey an order compelling further answers to interrogatories. That award was upheld as within the exercise of the trial court\u2019s inherent power. However, it was only because of the somewhat novel circumstances of that case that Code of Civil Procedure section 2034 did not authorize the award, and it was clearly consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the Civil Discovery Act. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2016 et seq.) The present case does not involve these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">It would be both unnecessary and unwise to permit trial courts to use fee awards as sanctions apart from those situations authorized by statute. If an attorney\u2019s conduct is disruptive of court processes or disrespectful of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>the court itself, there is ampi\u00e9 power to punish the misconduct as contempt.  Moreover, unlike the power advocated by respondent, a court\u2019s inherent power to punish contempt has been tempered by legislative enactment to provide procedural safeguards. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1209 et seq.; see <em>In re McKinney </em>(1968) 70 Cal.2d 8, 11-13 [73 Cal.Rptr. 580, 447 P.2d 972]; cf. <em>In re Oliver </em>(1948) 333 U.S. 257, 274-276 [92 L.Ed. 682, 694-696, 68 S.Ct. 499].) Among these safeguards is the opportunity, in cases where the contempt occurs out of the immediate view and presence of the court, to disqualify the judge pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 170, subdivision 5. (See 1 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1970) Courts, \u00a7 62, pp. 341-342.) Additionally, the Legislature has limited the penalty for civil contempt to five days in jail and a $500 fine. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1218; <em>In re McKinney, supra, 70 </em>Cal.2d at p. 10.) Absent such safeguards, serious due process problems would result were trial courts to use their inherent power, in lieu of the contempt power, to punish misconduct by awarding attorney\u2019s fees to an opposing party or counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The use of courts\u2019 inherent power to punish misconduct by awarding attorney\u2019s fees may imperil the independence of the bar and thereby undermine the adversary system. In cautioning trial courts to use their contempt powers with care, this court has repeatedly stressed the importance of permitting counsel to be a vigorous advocate:  \u201c \u2018He has a right to press a legitimate argument and to protest an erroneous ruling.\u2019 [Citation.] Indeed, so essential is this \u2018fundamental interest of the public in maintaining an independent bar\u2019... that \u2018a mere mistaken act by counsel cannot render him in contempt of court. Even if a legal proposition is untenable, counsel may properly urge it in good faith; he may do so even though he may not expect to be successful, provided of course, that he does not resort to deceit or to wilful obstruction of the orderly process.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 547, 560 [68 Cal.Rptr. 1, 440 P.2d 65], quoting <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 784, 788, 795, 796 [192 P.2d 905]; <em>In re Buckley, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 249.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The power advocated by respondents is potentially more sweeping in scope than even the power of contempt. If this court were to hold that trial courts have the inherent power to impose sanctions in the form of attorney\u2019s fees for alleged misconduct, trial courts would be given a power without procedural limits and potentially subject to abuse. In <em>Young </em>v. <em>Redman, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.3d 827, 838-839, under analogous facts, <em>the Court of </em>Appeal observed <em>that </em>\u201cabsent legislative action, for us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>to declare that the trial court has inherent power to impose such sanctions takes a giant step in expanding the power of the court with sweeping ramifications. Such power in the trial court, unfettered and unbridled, without appropriate safeguards and guidelines, could cancel out any benefits derived to the judicial process by generating a proliferation of appeals. . . . [A]ny power of the trial court to impose such sanctions should be created by the legislative branch of government with appropriate safeguards and guidelines developed following a thorough in-depth investigation. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The present case illustrates the dangers which the exercise of such power, \u201cwithout appropriate safeguards and guidelines,\u201d would pose. Although ostensibly awarded to compensate respondents, it appears from the record that the sanctions were prompted more by appellant\u2019s vigorous assertion that he had a right to examine the copies of the diagram once they had been admitted into evidence, and his refusal to apologize.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">In addition, the procedure which the court followed may not have afforded appellant due process of law. Although the trial judge had not personally observed appellant\u2019s alleged misconduct, he heard the sanctions motion. The hearing was based not on the actual record but on the participants\u2019 somewhat imperfect memories of the events. Further, appellant, following the advice of his counsel, did not contest the award of attorney\u2019s fees because the court would not hear the contempt allegation first. Finally, th\u00e9 court\u2019s remarks on the record indicate that it viewed the imposition of attorney\u2019s fees as an alternative to the penalty that could be imposed for contempt of court. However, the penalty assessed was in excess of that permitted for contempt. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1218.) Given these circumstances, this court cannot approve the order of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The Legislature has provided by statute that awards of attorney\u2019s fees may be granted by a court in specific situations. However, the situation presented by this case is not one of them. This case does not fall within the limited number of judicially recognized nonstatutory exceptions to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021. To carve out another judicial exception permitting such an award would pose serious due process problems. For all of these reasons, this court holds that the award of attorney\u2019s fees to respondents following a mistrial exceeded the proper limits of the trial court\u2019s inherent power.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>The order directing appellant to pay attorney\u2019s fees to respondents in the amount of $700 is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., Richardson, J., Manuel, J., and Newman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The sequence of events was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">\u201cMR.

BACH: I\u2019m not saying that.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The order imposing sanctions is appealable as a final order on a collateral matter directing the payment of money. (<em>Wisniewski </em>v. <em>Clary </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 499, 502 [120 Cal.Rptr. 176].) The order imposing sanctions directed appellant personally to pay defendants $700. The order also noted that appellant had made an appearance on his own behalf. Although he was not a party in the main action, he was made a party of record in the collateral matter by the court\u2019s order. The order imposing sanctions was a final determination of that matter. Thus, appellant was entitled to appeal that order. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 902.) Further, respondents have never contested appellant\u2019s standing to appeal the order. The order granting a mistrial is not appealable (e.g., <em>Estate of Bartholomae </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 839, 842 [68 Cal.Rptr. 332]) and is, therefore, not before this court. Appellant apparently did not seek review of the contempt order. (See <em>In re Buckley </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 237, 240, fn. 1 [110 Cal.Rptr. 121, 514 P.2d 1201, 68 A.L.R.3d 248].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Code of Civil Procedure section 2034, subdivision (d) authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees against an attorney who wilfully fails to answer interrogatories <em>(Weinkauf </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 662 [51 Cal.Rptr. 100, 414 P.2d 36]); Code of Civil Procedure section 396b permits attorney\u2019s fees to be assessed against an attorney who commences an action in the wrong court. <em>(Metzger </em>v. <em>Silverman </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d Supp. 30, 38 [133 Cal.Rptr. 355].) Appellate courts may order an attorney who brings a frivolous appeal to pay the opposing party\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 907; Cal. Rules of Court, rules 26(a) and 135(a); <em>In re Marriage of Milch </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 666, 671 [120 Cal.Rptr. 901].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Section 128 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">\u201cEvery court shall have power:</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">6\u00cd</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">\u201c3.

Apparently the court erroneously believed that only items actually admitted into evidence could be passed among the jury. However, if the original or a designated copy had been admitted into evidence, the copies could have been viewed by the jury without having first been admitted into evidence. The court was correct when it warned the jurors to keep their notes confidential. However, when the court admitted them into evidence, it breached this confidentiality. It is clear that any document admitted into evidence may be inspected at any time by counsel. <em>|(Pope </em>v. <em>Dalton </em>(1871) 40 Cal. 638; 31 Cal.Jur.3d, Evidence, \u00a7 311, p. 388.) As a part of the judicial record, exhibits may be inspected by the public as well, absent some specific lawful order to the contrary. <em>(Estate of Hearst </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 111, 782-783 [136 Cal.Rptr. 821].) In this case, there was no such order. The court\u2019s statements concerning the jurors\u2019 notes were simply an admonition to the <em>jurors </em>that the notes, which they were permitted to retain, were to be kept confidential. This warning was given when the copies of the diagram (exhibits 7A through M) were taken from the jurors by the bailiff. The warning related to the notes they were to retain not the copies of the diagram, and was not directed at counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b643-8\">In <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 27 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10], this court declined to consider a further equitable exception to the rule regarding attorney\u2019s fees. That case raised the issue whether one who has been required to litigate because of \u201cvexatious and oppressive conduct\u201d of another party may be awarded attorney\u2019s fees to penalize that party, absent statutory authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b645-8\">This court specifically disapproves <em>Santandrea </em>v. <em>Siltec Corp., supra, </em>56 Cal.App.3d 525 to the extent that it is inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b646-5\">CLARK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alm2\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The majority purport to hold\u2014without confronting the issue\u2014that an order imposing sanctions on an attorney for misconduct resulting in mistrial of an action in which he appears only in a representative capacity, is an appealable order <em>in that action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">In support of such proposition the majority state the rule that a final. order on a collateral matter directing payment of money is appealable, citing <em>Wisniewski </em>v. <em>Clary </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 499 [120 Cal.Rptr. 176], <em>(Ante, </em>p. 634, fn. 3.) However, <em>Wisniewski </em>stands only for the proposition that such an order is appealable by an aggrieved <em>party </em>to the action. The issue here is not whether the order is appealable but whether the attorney has standing to take the appeal in his individual capacity. An appeal may be taken only by a \u201cparty\u201d to an action. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 902.) Bach is not a party\u2014he is not a designated party and no proper order has been made bringing him into the action. Bach simply cannot assert an appeal in this case. (See <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Transamerica Corp. </em>(1935) 6 Cal.App.2d 340 [44 P.2d 635]; <em>Butchart </em>v. <em>Moorhead </em>(1929) 101 Cal.App. 659 [282 P. 23] [a party dismissed from an action cannot appeal]; <em>Shearer </em>v. <em>United California Theatres </em>(1955) 133 Cal.App.2d 720 [284 P.2d 934] [a party to an action not named in a cross-action cannot appeal from an order affecting only the cross-action].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bach\u2019s proper remedy is application for either writ of review (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1068) or writ of prohibition to circumvent the imposition of sanctions claimed to be applied in excess of jurisdiction <em>(Lund </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 698, 709-710 [39 Cal.Rptr. 891, 394 P.2d 707]). The appeal, accordingly, should be dismissed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Even if Bach may appeal from the order imposing sanctions, the majority further err in concluding the trial court lacks authority to impose such sanctions against Bach. Essential to such determination is a fuller exposure of material facts attending the circumstances preceding Bach\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Exhibit 7 consists of a highway patrolman\u2019s sketch offered into evidence by Bach in behalf of the plaintiff. Bach advised the court he had made copies of the exhibit for the individual jurors, and certainly we can assume his familiarity with the exhibit. Thereafter the court urged the jurors to make confidential notes on their copies of the sketch during testimony of the patrolman. The court observed that the jurors had done so not only during the patrolman\u2019s testimony but also during reading of the deposition of an unavailable witness. Thereupon the court admonished in clear and unambiguous language as to the confidentiality of the notes; \u201c. . . these are your personal notes and they are not to be shared with anyone until the case is finally submitted to you . . . but until such time they\u2019re your own personal notes, not to be shown to any of your fellow jurors, your spouse or your neighbors, anybody. . . . [K]eep in mind you are to keep your own counsel and you are not to share them with anyone.\u201d This admonition was made in open court in Bach\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">It is clear Bach did not casually examine exhibit 7 for the purpose of ascertaining information contained in a duly received exhibit. After proceedings had been recessed he obtained exhibits 7 and 7A through 7M from the clerk, sat in the courtroom examining all exhibits, observing the confidential notes of individual jurors for the purpose of obtaining information which might give him a competitive advantage. In fact he later argued to the court he had a right to examine the jurors\u2019 notes appearing on exhibits 7A through 7M notwithstanding direction to the contrary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In view of the court\u2019s admonition as to the confidentiality of the notes, delivered that same day in Bach\u2019s presence, Bach\u2019s misconduct cannot be disputed. His claim he merely exercised a right to examine an exhibit is refuted by his own admission that his purpose was to gain intelligence from the jurors\u2019 notes. I am distressed that the majority appear to condone both Bach\u2019s astonishing imposition upon the orderly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>procedures of the court and the disingenuous explanation to which he continues to adhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">I am unable to discern the precise ground upon which the majority conclude the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction in these circumstances. They suggest that Bach is innocent of any misconduct <em>(ante, </em>p. 636, fn. 6) and was in no way restrained from examining the jurors\u2019 notes because the admonitions of confidentiality had not been directed specifically to him <em>(id). </em>If that is the ground for the majority opinion, then the majority fail to recognize Bach\u2019s stated and obvious motivations.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Most of the majority\u2019s following discussion concerning the award of attorney fees is irrelevant to the issue presented\u2014clearly this is not a case involving an award of attorney fees in the traditional sense. What is at issue is the inherent authority of a trial court to supervise and control proceedings by exercising reasonable restraints on counsel practicing before it. The majority conclude that because a court can hold an attorney in contempt there is no need for further controls\u2014thus voiding the lesser power to impose sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">\u201c[Ejvery court of record has powers requisite to its proper functioning as an independent constitutional department of government . . . .\u201d <em>(Bloniarz </em>v. <em>Roloson </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 143, 147-148 [74 Cal.Rptr. 285, 449 P.2d 221]; see also <em>Mowrer </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 3 Cal.App.3d 223, 230 [83 Cal.Rptr. 125].) The exercise of this inherent power is limited only by sound discretion. (See <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Fosca Oil Co. </em>(1963) 216 Cal.App.2d 813, 818 [4 Cal.Rptr. 474].) Contempt is not the only tool at the court\u2019s disposal. A court may adopt \u201cany suitable process or mode of proceeding . . . which may appear most conformable to the spirit of\u201d the Code of Civil Procedure. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 187; <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1951) 106 Cal.App.2d 593, 595 [235 P.2d 420].) While there is no legislative authorization for the sanctions imposed in the instant case, the Legislature has enacted provisions. requiring a defaulting attorney to pay attorney fees of an opposing party when such attorney disrupts the judicial process by failing or refusing to comply with discovery orders. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2016 et seq.) In view of such legislation it cannot be said the imposition of almost identical sanctions under the court\u2019s inherent powers contravenes any legislative policy or that a court is restricted to its contempt powers in supervising proceedings before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">In an analogous situation, wherein the court noted there was no legislative authorization for imposition of a sanction\u2014including an order requiring an attorney for one party to pay attorney fees for an opposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>party\u2014when the first party refused to comply with particular discovery orders, the court held: \u201cEvery court has power \u2018to compel obedience to its judgments, orders and process\u2019 in an action or proceeding pending before it, and to use all necessary means to carry its jurisdiction into effect, even if those means are not specifically pointed out in the code.\u201d <em>(Fairfield </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 120 [54 Cal.Rptr. 721].)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">In another case in which sanctions requiring payment of money to an opposing party were upheld, the court stated: \u201cEvery court has the inherent power to regulate the proceedings of matters before it and to effect an orderly disposition of the issues presented. [Citations.] Sanctions are expressly provided for in some situations [citations] but sanctions have also been approved in situations which are not expressly covered by statute or court rules. . . . [\u00b6] . . . Although no direct order of the trial court was disobeyed, the facts support the view that the time of both the court and of opposing counsel was wasted. [\u00b6] The exercise of the court\u2019s inherent power to provide for the orderly conduct of the court\u2019s business is a matter vested in the sound legal discretion of the trial court. Such a decision is subject to reversal only where there has been an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>(Santandrea </em>v. <em>Siltec Corp. </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 525, 529-530 [128 Cal.Rptr. 629].)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Certainly it cannot be argued the court in the instant case abused its discretion by imposing a sanction in the amount of modest attorney fees for the two days of trial. The court could well consider that a penalty imposed for contempt would not compensate the damaged party for the expense of two wasted days. For that reason there is no abuse when the court elects to exercise its inherent power to impose sanctions rather than fix a penalty for Bach\u2019s contempt. The only reported cases support the trial court\u2019s action\u2014the majority referring to no case in point supporting their judgment to ignore or disapprove existing authorities.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The order imposing sanctions not being appealable, the appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Although the circumstances of this case are novel, they are not unlike those in a discovery situation when sanctions, are imposed against an attorney who refuses or otherwise fails to comply with a discovery order. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2034.) An appeal does not lie from an order made for the purpose of furthering discovery or granting sanctions for refusal to make discovery. (See <em>Lund </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>61 Cal.2d 698, 709; <em>Friedberg v. Friedberg </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 754, 764 [88 Cal.Rptr. 451].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b646-9\">It may be noted dismissal of the appeal herein is not required merely because Bach seeks to appeal from an order the majority hold to be void. It can no longer be argued that because a trial court lacks jurisdiction to make a particular order a reviewing court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>lacks appellate jurisdiction to judge the validity of the order. (See <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 363 [217 P.2d 951].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b647-9\">In stating his position to the court, Bach said: \u201cI do not think the court could have precluded me from looking at these notes in view of the state of this record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\">The majority rely on <em>Young </em>v. <em>Redman </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 827 [128 Cal.Rptr. 86], for the proposition that a trial court should impose only those sanctions authorized by the Legislature. However, the holding in that case is that the court abused its discretion in imposing the particular sanctions. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 839.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
