Miller, custody of their two minor children pursuant to an Australian custody decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">Patricia and Harry were married in California in 1962. After living in New Zealand, they moved to Australia in 1964 where their two children were born. On 9 February 1967 the marriage was dissolved in Australia, the court awarding custody to Patricia with visitation rights to Harry. Denying application for change of custody in 1967, the court restrained both parents from removing the children from Australia without leave of court, required the parents\u2019 passports to be delivered to their attorneys, and provided that should Patricia leave Australia Harry would be entitled \u201cforthwith\u201d to custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">With Harry\u2019s agreement and subject to visitation, Patricia moved <em>to </em>Los Angeles with the children in 1968. In 1972 Patricia remarried and moved to Australia with her present husband, an Australian citizen, and the two children. About the same time she and Harry entered another agreement providing for Harry\u2019s visitation rights and for his arranging all schooling. Harry also remarried in 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">Pursuant to the 1972 agreement, Harry enrolled one of the children, Miles, as a.weekly boarder in a private school in Sydney. From 1972 to March 1976, the parties shared custody during holiday periods, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>Harry had custody of the children for three six-week periods while Patricia was on foreign trips.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">In 1976 Patricia, without consulting Harry, changed Miles\u2019 enrollment to that of a day student. Harry filed an application for custody of both children, or in the alternative, for joint custody with Miles attending school as a weekly boarder, Harry continuing to be responsible for , schooling arrangements, each parent having specified access rights. Finally, Harry sought sole custody should Patricia leave the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">On 19 March 1976, following extended hearings, the court ordered, over Patricia\u2019s objection, that Harry have custody of the children for three weeks while Patricia went abroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">When Patricia returned the parties entered an agreement. In accordance with the first five paragraphs of the agreement, the court on 3 May ordered that Patricia have custody of the children, that Harry have access alternate weekends from Friday night to Monday morning and certain specified holidays and school vacations, that Harry pay child support, and that the parties have general liberty to apply to the court on all matters on seven days\u2019 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Although the court order did not set forth the next four paragraphs of the agreement, the court \u201cnoted\u201d the further provisions in the agreement. Those paragraphs provided in part that Harry would have custody during any period Patricia was out of Australia without the children, Harry would be responsible for school arrangements, and the parties would give one month\u2019s notice through counsel of any overseas trips involving the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Patricia\u2019s solicitors remained her solicitors of record. Between 25 May and 16 July the solicitors for the parties exchanged a dozen letters relating to child support, visitation, and trips.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">In July 1976, Patricia decided to permanently leave Australia with the children. Deliberately failing to inform either Harry or the court of her intention, she departed on 23 July while the children were in the middle of a school term.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">On 27 July Harry was informed by school officials that the children had not been in school since 22 July. His efforts that day and the next to learn of the whereabouts of Patricia and the children were fruitless.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>Harry\u2019s solicitor telephoned the office of Patricia\u2019s solicitors on 27 July. The solicitor who had represented Patricia, Mr. Twigg, was out of Sydney and communications on the 27th and 28th were with his partner, Mr. Doolan. Mr. Doolan was unable to locate Patricia and so advised Harry\u2019s solicitor the following morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">On 28 July Harry\u2019s solicitor filed an application in the Australian court seeking custody and an order restraining Patricia from leaving Australia and compelling her to surrender the children\u2019s passports. In support of the application, Harry filed an affidavit stating that the children had been taken out of school; that his efforts to locate Patricia and the children had been unsuccessful; that she could be a \u201cvery emotional person\u201d and capable of conduct detrimental to the children; that if there was discord in her existing marriage, she might leave for America; and that in view of her behavior in early 1976, she was not a fit and proper person to have custody of the children without the stabilizing influence of her present husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Copies of the application and affidavit were served on Patricia\u2019s solicitors at 12:40 p.m., 28 July. Mr. Doolan stated that he had been unable to locate Patricia and had no specific instructions, requesting Harry\u2019s solicitor to so advise the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">At 2:45 p.m., 28 July the court, after hearing the matter ex parte, signed an order awarding temporary custody of the children to Harry. The order was made returnable on 3 August 1976. The order was served on Patricia\u2019s solicitors. Mr. Twigg advised Harry\u2019s solicitor on 29 July that he had no knowledge of Patricia\u2019s whereabouts, that she and her second husband had separated, and that the latter was also unaware of where she might be.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">On 3 August Patricia failed to appear and there was no request for continuance. The court issued warrants for the custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">On 22 October 1976 Harry initiated contempt proceedings in the Los Angeles Superior Court. Evidence was presented that under Australian law notice could be served on the solicitor of record and that in cases of urgency the court could issue ex parte custody orders. The superior court determined that the orders of 3 May and 28 July were valid and that Patricia had deliberately violated them. The court ordered Patricia to deliver custody of the children to Harry and to pay his attorney fees, travel, and other expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>While aware of the Australia court orders by 9 August, Patricia has made no effort to reopen the Australian proceedings, to appeal, or to seek modification of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Civil Code section 5172, part of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, provides: \u201cThe general policies of this title extend to the international area. The provisions of this title relating to the recognition and enforcement of custody decrees of other states apply to custody decrees and decrees involving legal institutions similar in nature to custody rendered by appropriate authorities of other nations if reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard were given to all affected persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Patricia contends that she was not given reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard in the Australian proceedings and that the Australian custody order should be denied enforcement because its purpose assertedly was to punish her for removing the children from Australia.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">Prior to the 1963 enactment of the provision now found in Civil Code section 4809, California law provided that, when there was aff attorney of record, motions to modify custody were to be served on the attorney (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1015). The provision was held constitutional because it is \u201cestablished that the Legislature may provide that once the court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of a proceeding and over the person of the party affected, it may bind such person by orders made after he has left the state.\u201d <em>(Reynolds </em>v. <em>Reynolds </em>(1943) 21 Cal.2d 580, 583 [134 P.2d 251]; see 38 State Bar J. 639 (1963).) Although the Legislature has changed the rule, the former practice did not constitute unreasonable notice. In addition, it must be pointed out that Patricia\u2019s solicitors were still acting on her behalf respecting the 3 May order as late as 16 July, 12 days before the service of the 28 July application.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">More importantly, Patricia\u2019s contentions are based on a mischaracterization of the Australian orders of 28 July and warrants of 3 August. It is obvious that the order was not intended to effect a permanent change in custody. Rather, it provided a change of custody with a return date. The order contemplated that Hariy would have custody pending a hearing and determination whether he or Patricia should have custody. The period contemplated for Harry\u2019s custody was short, at most six days if Hariy was successful in immediately locating the children. The interim order far from denying Patricia a right to be heard, is designed to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>Patricia full right to be heard on the custody issue\u2014a right still available to her before the Australian court.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Code of Civil Procedure section 527 provides for temporary restraining orders to be granted ex parte returnable in a short period. In <em>United Farm Workers of America </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 902, 913 [122 Cal.Rptr. 877, 537 P.2d 1237] this court held that in First Amendment cases, the party seeking the restraining order must make a reasonable, effort in good faith to give notice, in either formal or informal fashion, to either the defendant or his counsel. The court recognized that the hearing will often be held promptly\u2014perhaps immediately. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 913-914.) A concurring and dissenting opinion suggests that the requirement of reasonable efforts to give notice should apply in all cases, including custody cases. In any event, it is clear that counsel was served with the application and reasonable attempts were made to locate Patricia.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Section 527 requires that \u201cgreat or irreparable injury\u201d must appear before a temporary restraining order will issue without notice. Earlier in 1976, litigation had been triggered before the Australian court by Patricia\u2019s changing school attendance, assertedly in violation of her agreement with Harry that he would \u00a1 be responsible for all school arrangements for the children. In settlement of that litigation Patricia had again agreed that Harry would have responsibility for all school arrangements. Withdrawing the children from school without Harry\u2019s consent as shown by his affidavit was an apparent violation of her agreement. In addition, in the absence of some explanation or excuse, withdrawal of young children from school and their continued absence must be viewed as presumptively detrimental to the children. Harry\u2019s affidavit also provided reasonable cause to believe that Patricia had left Australia in violation of the 30-day notice provision of the agreement and her disappearance with the children would frustrate performance of the visitation rights ordered by the court. Irreparable harm was shown by the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">One main factor to be considered by a judge in determining whether to issue an interim restraining order without full contested hearing is the severity of the injunctive restrictions sought. <em>(United Farm Workers of America </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 902, 914.)  Harry had previously been given substantial custodial rights. Under the 3 May order he was entitled to custody on alternate weekends from Friday night to Monday morning, on certain holidays, and for extensive periods during vacations and Patricia\u2019s trips abroad. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>the light of Harry\u2019s extensive custodial rights the order granting him custody pending further hearing of the custody issue may not be considered a severe restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">We are satisfied that the Australian court order granting Harry custody pending further hearing of the custody issue did not involve a deprivation of reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard. Because of the temporary nature of the order, there is no basis to the claim that the Australian court intended to punish Patricia.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Our conclusion that the Australian court order granting Harry custody pending further proceedings should be enforced in California has the effect of determining that further hearings may be held in Australia to modify the Australian custody orders. Such result is in full accord with the purposes of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 5150 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">The alternative writ is discharged and the peremptory writ denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Mosk, J., Richardson, J., and Manuel, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-10\">Civil Code section 5150 provides: \u201c(I) The general purposes of this title are to: [\u00b6] (a) Avoid jurisdiction competition and conflict with courts of other states in matters of child custody which have in the past resulted in the shifting of children from state to state with harmful effects on their well-being.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgA\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">Petitioner, Patricia Ann McGuinness (formerly Miller), seeks a writ of mandate to compel the Superior Court of Los Angeles County to vacate its order of December 10, 1976, directing her to deliver to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>former husband, Harry Maurice Miller, custody of their two minor children pursuant to a custody decree of the Family Law Court of Australia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She contends that the Australian decree awarding custody of the children to the father is not entitled to recognition and enforcement by California because (1) the decree was issued without compliance with the due process requirements of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 5150 et seq., hereafter the Act) and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and (2) the decree was punitive in that it was issued to punish her rather than to serve the best interest of the children. Since the first contention disposes of the issue, it is not necessary to consider the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Patricia, a native-born United States citizen, and Harry, an Australian citizen, were married in California on October 23, 1962. Following the marriage, they lived in New Zealand until 1964, when they moved to Australia. The two children of the marriage, Miles, now age 14, and Justine, now age 12, were born in Sydney, Australia. The children are citizens of both Australia and the United States because of the status of their parents\u2019 citizenship at the time of their birth. (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a)(7).)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">The marriage was dissolved in Australia on February 9, 1967. At that time, the Australian court granted custody of the children to Patricia with visitation rights to Harry. In May 1967 Harry applied to the Australian court for custody of the children. The court denied his application and again awarded custody of the children to Patricia and visitation rights to Harry. The decree explicitly restrained both Harry and Patricia from taking the children out of Australia without leave of the court and required the passports of the parents to be delivered to their respective attorneys. The court further ordered that in the event Patricia left Australia, Harry would \u201cbecome entitled forthwith\u201d to custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">In May 1968, with Harry\u2019s approval, Patricia moved with the children to Los Angeles. They agreed that Hariy could visit the children in Los Angeles at any time upon reasonable notice, and later when the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>were older, they could visit Harry in Australia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 14, 1972, Patricia married her present husband, also an Australian citizen. Following the marriage, Patricia, her husband and her two children moved to Australia.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">On April 26, 1972, in Australia, Harry and Patricia executed a written agreement. The agreement provided that Patricia would retain custody of the children but if Patricia were out of Australia \u201cwithout the children,\u201d the children would stay with Harry. The agreement also provided that Harry would have visitation rights on alternate weekends and certain holidays and that he would be responsible for the schooling arrangements of the children. The agreement was not made part of any court order and referred neither to the 1967 custody decree nor to the informal agreement between Harry and Patricia in effect while Patricia lived in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Hariy and Patricia abided by the April 1972 agreement until February 1976, when they were unable to resolve a dispute over the schooling arrangements for Miles. In January 1974 Harry had enrolled Miles as a weekly boarder in a private school in Sydney, pursuant to the 1972 agreement. However, in February 1976 Patricia, without consulting Harry, terminated Miles as a weekly boarder and enrolled him as a day student.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">Upon learning of Patricia\u2019s actions, Harry filed an application on February 24, 1976, in the Australian Family Law Court for custody of both the children, or in the alternative, for joint custody with Patricia pursuant to the following conditions: (1) that Miles attend school as a weekly boarder, Justine as a day student; (2) that Harry continue to be responsible for all schooling arrangements for the children; (3) that certain access rights be granted both parents; and (4) that Harry have sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>custody of the children should Patricia leave the state of New South Wales or, at most, the countiy of Australia.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">The hearing on Hariy\u2019s application was set for March 18, 1976, but later continued until May 3, 1976. On March 12, 1976, Patricia advised Harry that she and her husband planned to be out of Australia for three weeks beginning March 19, 1976. Patricia proposed to leave the children with her housekeeper and Patricia\u2019s 24-year-old brother. Hariy objected, and this dispute was presented to the Family Law Court on March 18 and 19, 1976. Patricia argued that Justine refused to go to Harry\u2019s house and that Miles would not go without his sister.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court ordered that Justine be examined by a social worker to determine if she in fact did not want to go to Harry\u2019s home. The social worker reported that Justine was willing to go \u201cfor a day or so and then review the situation.\u201d The court then ordered Patricia to deliver the children to Hariy for the three weeks she was to be out of Australia.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">After Patricia returned to Australia, another agreement (referred to as the \u201cShort Minutes\u201d) was negotiated in response to Hariy\u2019s February 24, 1976, application for sole custody or conditional joint custody. On May 3, 1976, that agreement was presented to the court, which issued the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-7\">\u201cUpon Application made to the court this day It Is Ordered:\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-8\">\u201c1. That orders be made in terms of paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the document titled \u2018Short Minutes\u2019 dated 3rd day of May 1976 and filed herein as set out hereunder:\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-9\">\u201c1.

She did not notify Hariy. On July 27, 1976, Harry learned from school administrators that the children had not been in school since July 23d. He was unable to locate Patricia on that day or the following day.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>On July 28, 1976, Harry filed with the court an application and affidavit<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> requesting that custody of the children be granted to him, that Patricia be restrained from removing the children from the jurisdiction of the court, and that the children\u2019s passports be surrendered to Patricia\u2019s attorneys. Copies of the application and affidavit were delivered at 12:40 p.m. on July 28th to the law firm of the attorney who had represented Patricia at the May 3d hearing. He was not in Sydney at the time of service and did not learn of the hearing on that date. At 2:35 p.m. on July 28th, the matter was heard ex parte, and an order was signed at 2:45 p.m. awarding custody of the children to Harry. The order was made returnable on August 3, 1976, at which time, in another ex parte proceeding, warrants were issued for the custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">On August 9, 1976, in a telephone conversation between Harry and Patricia, Patricia first learned of the July 28th proceeding. On October 22, 1976, Harry initiated the present proceeding in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County in the form of an order to show cause re contempt pursuant to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act. The order to show cause sought recognition and enforcement of the May 3, 1976, and July 28, 1976, decrees of the Family Law Court of Australia.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">On December 10, 1976, the superior court found that Patricia had wilfully disobeyed both decrees of the Australian court and ordered that both be enforced. The court further directed her to deliver custody of the children to Harry and to pay his attorneys\u2019 fees, travel and other expenses. This writ petition ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">In 1973, the Legislature adopted the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Civ. Code, \u00a7 5150 et seq.), which sets forth the provisions by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>which the courts of this state are to be governed when asked to enforce or modify a custody decree of a sister state. However, the provisions of the Act are extended to decrees of foreign nations by Civil Code section 5172 only <em>if </em>due process has been accorded to all affected persons: \u201cThe general policies of this title extend to the international area. The provisions of this title relating to the recognition and enforcement of custody decrees of other states apply to custody decrees and decrees involving legal institutions similar in nature to custody rendered by appropriate authorities of other nations if reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard were given to all affected persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">In <em>Mullane </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Tr. Co. </em>(1950) 339 U.S. 306, 314 [94 L.Ed. 865, 873, 70 S.Ct. 652], the United States Supreme Court set forth the guidelines for compliance with due process: \u201cAn elementaiy and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections. [Citations.] The notice must be of such nature as reasonably to convey the required information [citation], and it must afford a reasonable time for those interested to make their appearance [citations].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">As to how much time should be afforded interested parties to make their appearance, the Supreme Court has held that they must be given time to retain counsel, prepare a defense and journey to the site of the proceeding. \u201cIn the cas'e of a witness subpoena the command of the writ is that the party served shall lay aside all his business and excuses, and make his way to the court with the utmost dispatch, or at least present himself upon the return day of the writ. An ordinary summons, however, . . . contemplates that the party served may have other business of equal or greater importance engaging his attention, or may require time for the retainer of counsel and the preparation of his defense. [\u00b6] . . . \u2018The time appointed must always allow sufficient opportunity, between the service of the summons and the time of appearance, to enable the party to prepare his defense and for his journey; and the justice should in this respect take care to avoid any supposition of improper hurry ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Roller </em>v. <em>Holly </em>(1900) 176 U.S. 398, 409 [44 L.Ed. 520, 525, 20 S.Ct. 410] [held five days\u2019 notice was constitutionally insufficient where it required four days of travel to reach site of proceeding]; see also <em>United States </em>ex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>rel. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Fisher </em>(1911) 222 U.S. 204 [56 L.Ed. 165, 32 S.Ct. 37] [held notice on the attorney of record a few hours before a proceeding did not satisfy due process requirements].)</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">In the present case, Patricia was neither personally served with, nor did she have actual notice of the July 28, 1976, proceeding changing custody of the children to Harry. The only attempt to notify her of the July 28th hearing was made by delivering Hariy\u2019s affidavit and application for change of custody to Mr. Twigg\u2019s office, the attorney who had represented Patricia at the May 3d proceeding, only one hour and fifty-five minutes before the hearing. However, prior to the hearing, Harry\u2019s counsel was informed that Mr. Twigg was not in Sydney,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that Patricia had discharged Mr. Twigg after the May 3d hearing and that Mr. Twigg\u2019s office had no instructions to represent Patricia in any new litigation. Even if it were assumed that Mr. Twigg was still Patricia\u2019s attorney of record and, therefore, authorized to accept service on her behalf,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the notice attempted in this case was clearly insufficient to satisfy the constitutional notice requirements of due process. Notice of less than two hours can hardly be deemed to \u201cafford a reasonable time for those interested to make their appearance . . . .\u201d <em>(Mullane </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Tr. Co., supra, </em>339 U.S. at p. 314 [94 L.Ed. at p. 873].) On the contrary, the notice attempted was no more than \u201ca mere gesture,\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 315) calculated to deprive Patricia of reasonable time in which to prepare a defense and appear to present her objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Moreover, the procedure followed in this case was contrary to the express provisions of the Family Law Act of Australia. That act provides that a hearing may not be set until at least 14 days after the filing of an application for a. change of custody if the party sought to be served is in Australia, or at least 42 days after filing if the adverse party is out of Australia.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>To explain his failure to comply with this notice requirement, Harry attempts to rely on the urgency provisions of the Family Law Act of Australia. He contends that these emergency provisions and the fact that the July 28th order was made returnable five days later render it valid even though granted ex parte.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although Harry cites no authority for what constitutes an emergency under Australian law, he urges that under section 527 of the Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the July 28th order was valid even without notice to Patricia. He states that sufficient facts were presented to show that great or irreparable injury would have resulted before the matter could have been fully noticed and heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Under section 527, notice may be dispensed with where \u201cfrom <em>facts shown . . . </em>great or irreparable injury would result to the applicant before the matter can be heard on notice.\u201d (Italics added.) In <em>McKay </em>v. <em>Retail Auto. S. L. Union 1067 </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 311, 320 [106 P.2d 373], this court stated that \u201c[i]t is a fundamental principle that the drastic sanctions of equity may not be invoked without a detailed showing of <em>specific facts </em>justifying such relief.\u201d (Italics added.) The only \u201cfacts\u201d before the Australian court on July 28th were the allegations contained in Harry\u2019s affidavit (fn. 7, <em>ante). </em>The affidavit alleged that Patricia \u201ccan be a very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>emotional person and in an excited or upset state is capable of conduct that would be extremely detrimental to the best interests of the children and their future emotional stability.\u201d However, it contains no specific instances of misconduct to support these allegations. Nor does the transcript of the July 28th hearing show that Harry presented any additional facts to the court<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to support his allegation of Patricia\u2019s emotional instability or to show that Patricia had ever done anything that was detrimental to the children, even if she were \u201ccapable\u201d of such conduct. Harry had made similar allegations against Patricia in a 1967 modification hearing, which he had initiated. However, the court rejected those allegations and reaffirmed custody of the children in Patricia. Moreover, less than a year after the 1967 hearing, Harry approved Patricia\u2019s move to California with the children, an action which calls into question the factual basis for his allegations of her instability. On May 3, 1976, less than three months before the July 28th hearing, the Australian court again granted custody of the children to Patricia, as it had consistently done since the dissolution of the marriage nine years earlier. In so doing, the court rejected Hariy\u2019s explicit request that the prior order be modified to grant him sole or joint custody in the best interest of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Harry\u2019s affidavit further alleges a \u201cconcern\u201d that there might be \u201cdiscord\u201d in Patricia\u2019s existing marriage<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and that she is not to be considered a \u201cfit and proper person to have the care and control of the children\u201d without the \u201cstabilizing influence of her present husband.\u201d Again, no facts were presented to support these allegations either in the affidavit or at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">The majority opinion would nevertheless condone the manifest lack of compliance with due process on the ground that the threat of great or irreparable injury was shown by Harry\u2019s affidavit. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 929.) It finds such irreparable injury on the bases that (1) Patricia had violated her agreement with Harry by withdrawing the children from school, (2) the children\u2019s continued absence from school is \u201cpresumptively\u201d detrimental, (3) there was reasonable cause to believe Patricia had left Australia and (4) Harry\u2019s visitation rights were frustrated by Patricia\u2019s departure. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 929.) However, none of these asserted bases can justify the drastic sanctions of section 527, for the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>opinion points only to acts which either had already occurred, do not amount to irreparable injury within the meaning of that section, or were not alleged in Harry\u2019s affidavit, nor considered by the Australian court in issuing the July 28th order.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">In <em>Blake </em>v. <em>City of Eureka </em>(1927) 201 Cal. 643, 661-662 [258 P. 945], this court stated: \u201c \u2018An injunction lies only to prevent threatened injury and has no application to wrongs which have been completed\u2019 [citation]. \u2018The office of a writ of injunction, as its name imports, is peculiarly a preventative and not a remedial one; it is to restrain the wrongdoer, not to punish him after the wrong has been done or to compel him to undo it\u2019 [citations].\u201d (Accord <em>Blackmore Investment Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1931) 213 Cal. 148, 150-151 [1 P.2d 978].) Thus, Patricia\u2019s withdrawal of the children from school cannot serve to justify the lack of compliance with due process pursuant to the provisions of section 527, for the record is clear that this act had already occurred at the time the July 28th order was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">As to the continued absence of the children from school, Harry\u2019s affidavit did not allege that he feared Patricia intended to keep the children out of school. There is also nothing in the transcript of the proceedings in the Australian court to indicate that the court even considered this possibility in issuing the July 28th order. Additionally, it is noteworthy that Hariy did not assert, either in the trial court, the Court of Appeal or in this court, the continued absence of the children from school as a basis for the ex parte order. Section 527 specifically states that no temporary restraining order shall be granted \u201cwithout notice to the opposite party, unless it shall appear from <em>facts shown . . . </em>that great or irreparable injury would result . . . before the matter can be heard on notice. . . .\u201d Since the record is completely devoid of any evidence that Patricia intended to keep the children out of school, the majority\u2019s assertion that the threat of great or irreparable injury was shown by Hariy\u2019s affidavit is unjustifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">As to Harry\u2019s visitation rights, the majority opinion does not indicate how the temporaiy impairment of the exercise of those rights, pending a full hearing after reasonable notice, would have resulted in irreparable harm in order to justify the ex parte order under section 527. If Harry\u2019s visitation rights were frustrated by Patricia\u2019s departure, his remedy was obvious under the provisions of the Family Law Act of Australia: a full hearing on the issue of custody following 14 days\u2019 notice if Patricia were in Australia or 42 days\u2019 notice if she were not. Instead, Harry, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>circumventing these notice requirements, attempted and succeeded in obtaining custody of the children\u2014something he had not been able to do in a nine-year history of contested hearings following notice.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">The only matter of \u201curgency\u201d raised at the July 28th hearing was the possibility that Patricia might leave Australia with the children. However, that urgency was met by the provisions of the ex parte order mandating delivery of the passports of the children to Patricia\u2019s attorney and prohibiting Patricia from removing the children from Australia. The record is devoid of any facts to show that the children or Harry were in danger of suffering irreparable harm if Harry were not immediately awarded custody. There is a similar lack of evidence that Patricia had ever done anything remotely detrimental to the best interest of the children. Resolution of the issue of custody could well have waited until reasonable notice had been afforded Patricia.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">The fact that the order was made returnable five days later was not calculated to give Patricia adequate notice to appear. The transcript of the July 28th hearing shows that Harry\u2019s attorney had no reasonable expectation of serving Patricia during that time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-7\">\u201cHis Honour: When can I make it returnable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-8\">\u201cMr. Delaney: It is almost impossible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-9\">\u201cHis Honour: I can make it returnable for the 3rd August but you won\u2019t have served her by then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-10\">\u201cMr. Delaney: Perhaps if we make it Tuesday and the message gets through to her\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-11\">\u201cHis Honour: ... I mark the application returnable for the 3rd August at 11 a.m.\u201d This exchange indicates that the August 3d date was chosen as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>a matter of expediency rather than as a genuine attempt to afford Patricia adequate notice with an opportunity to appear. If Hariy had been seriously motivated by a desire to provide Patricia with proper notice, he would have urged the court to continue the matter at least 14 days, as required by Australian law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Moreover, the fact that the order was made returnable five days later cannot be used to bootstrap the validity of the ex parte order. Section 527 provides a limited exception to the constitutional right to reasonable notice in cases of emergencies to prevent great or irreparable injury. It is the only exception. However,, when the facts alleged are insufficient to show that such an emergency existed, characterizing the order as temporary in nature, subject to challenge on the return date, does not cure the due process defect of the ex parte order. As the United States Supreme Court has stated: \u201c[N]o later hearing and no damage award can undo the fact that the arbitrary taking that was subject to the right of procedural due process has already occurred. \u2018This Court has not . . . embraced the general proposition that a wrong may be done if it can be undone.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Fuentes </em>v. <em>Shevin </em>(1972) 407 U.S. 67, 82 [32 L.Ed.2d 556, 570-571, 92 S.Ct. 1983], citing <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 645, 647 [31 L.Ed.2d 551, 556, 92 S.Ct. 1208]; <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Manzo </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 545, 551 [14 L.Ed.2d 62, 66, 85 S.Ct. 1187]; <em>Randone </em>v. <em>Appellate Department </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 536 [96 Cal.Rptr. 709, 488 P.2d 13].) Since no exigency existed, the July 28th order is void, for it deprived Patricia of the custody of her children, a right \u201cranked among the most basic of civil rights . . .\u201d <em>(In re B.G. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 679, 688 [114 Cal.Rptr. 444, 523 P.2d 244]), without affording her reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Harry further contends that if Patricia was not afforded adequate notice, it was due to her \u201cillegal\u201d conduct in removing the children from Australia in violation of the May 3d order and the July 28th order. However, when Patricia left Australia on July 23d, the only order in effect was the May 3d order. Under that order, Patricia <em>was </em>the custodial parent, and the order did not specifically prohibit Patricia from leaving Australia with or without the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">The lack of such an express prohibition in the May 3d order is significant when compared to the 1967 order which was in effect up to the time the May 3d order was issued. The 1967 order specifically restrained Patricia from leaving Australia with the children without leave of the court. In addition, Harry\u2019s application initiating the May 3d hearing had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>explicitly requested that Patricia be prohibited from removing the children from Australia or the state of New South Wales. Yet, neither the five directives of the May 3d order nor the balance of the agreement which the court noted contains an explicit prohibition on Patricia\u2019s movements.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">The visitation provisions of the May 3d order cannot be interpreted to impliedly prohibit Patricia from leaving Australia with the children. The provisions of items 6 and 8 of the \u201cShort Minutes\u201d indicate that (fn. 5, <em>ante) </em>no such implication was intended. Item 6 states that the \u201cmother agrees that children stay with father during any periods when she is out'of Australia <em>without </em>them.\u201d (Italics added.) Item 8 notes that the parents agree to give \u201ceach other at least one month\u2019s notice ... of any proposed overseas trips involving the children. . . .\u201d Both items would be superfluous if the visitation provisions were meant to prohibit Patricia from leaving Australia.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">As to the July 28th order, Patricia left Australia on July 23d. Therefore, she could not have violated that order by taking the children from Australia, since that order had not yet been issued at the time she left.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">Thus, the only \u201cillegal\u201d conduct which can be attributed to Patricia is that she may have violated the visitation provisions of the May 3d order and her agreement to give Harry one month\u2019s notice of any overseas trips with the children. However, this conduct cannot be used to legitimize the due process defects of the July 28th order.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">It has, nevertheless, been suggested that because Patricia violated the visitation provisions of the May 3d order, the July 28th order should be enforced despite the lack of compliance with due process. This argument is based on a variant of the equitable doctrine of \u201cclean hands\u201d which has been developed in a series of child custody cases. However, in this area the clean hands doctrine has only been invoked to bar reexamination of a sister state custody decree when a parent who is <em>not </em>entitled to custody seeks modification of a decree. (See <em>Ferreira </em>v. <em>Ferreira </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 824, 834-835 [109 Cal.Rptr. 80, 512 P.2d 304].) Courts have declined reexamination in order to discourage noncustodial parents, who were unhappy with an existing decree, from abducting their children in an effort to obtain a more favorable decision in another jurisdiction. In the past, such forum shopping had been encouraged by the fact that many states have exercised jurisdiction to modify out-of-state custody decrees based on the mere presence of the child in the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>The Act itself was designed to prevent this type of forum shopping. (See Commissioners\u2019 Prefatory Note, 9 Uniform Laws Ann. (Master ed. 1973) pp. 99-102.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Civil Code section 5152, subdivision (2),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> states that the mere presence of the child in the state is insufficient to confer jurisdiction. In section 5157,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the clean hands doctrine is codified.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">However, neither the clean hands doctrine as it existed prior to the enactment of the Act, nor section 5157, may be used to validate the July 28th order, which was issued without compliance with due process. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>Patricia left Australia, she was the custodial parent. She did not abduct her children in order to seek a more favorable forum in which to relitigate the custody issue. Patricia did not initiate the present proceeding in order to modify the decree granting custody to Harry. Rather, Harry initiated the proceeding to enforce that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The July 28th order was not entitled to be enforced because it was issued without giving Patricia reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard. The only order which was entitled to enforcement under the due process requirements of the Act was the May 3d order. In that order, Patricia retained the custody of the children as she had since the dissolution of the marriage.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The fact that Patricia may have violated the visitation provisions of the May 3d order may not be used to circumvent the express provisions of the Act which mandate recognition and enforcement of custody decrees of foreign nations only if reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard have been given to all affected persons. The notice attempted in relation to the July 28th order does not meet the due process standards of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution. \u201c[W]hen notice is a person\u2019s due, process which is a mere gesture is not due process. The means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.\u201d <em>(Mullane </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Tr. Co., supra, </em>339 U.S. at p. 315 [94 L.Ed. at p. 874].) In a matter of such compelling importance as the custody of children, it is imperative that all parties be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard. The record in this case discloses no justification to excuse the manifest lack of compliance with procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">The Australian court\u2019s July 28th decree was not entitled to recognition and enforcement pursuant to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Tobriner, J., and Newman, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">Petitioner\u2019s application for a rehearing was denied January 17, 1979.

When the matter first comes up for hearing the party who obtained the temporary restraining order must be ready to proceed and must have served upon the opposite party at least two days prior to such hearing, a copy of the complaint and of all affidavits to be used in such application and a copy of his points and authorities in support of such application . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b945-7\">In fact, Harry did not personally appear at the July 28, 1976, hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Patricia is still married to her present husband, and they are residing together with the children in California.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b947-12\">It should be noted that refusal to enforce the July 28th ex parte order does not preclude further hearings in Australia on the issue of custody. Under the Act, this state could not assume jurisdiction to modify the May 3d Australian order, since at the time the present proceeding was initiated in this state California was not the children\u2019s home state. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 5152, subd. (1)(a)(ii); see also Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5155, 5156 and 5169.) Refusal to recognize and enforce the July 28th order would have the effect of placing the parties where they were at the beginning of the present proceeding. It would, however, prevent the children from being wrenched from the custody of their mother, with whom they have lived since the dissolution of the marriage, until, after a full contested hearing, the Australian court determines that it is in their best interest that they live with their father in Australia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b950-5\">\u201c \u2018Reports of commissions which have proposed statutes that are subsequently adopted are entitled to substantial weight in construing the statutes. . . .
