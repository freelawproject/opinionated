Upon an indictment for an assault and battery, against George, Archibald, Henry and Mahlon Sprinkle, and three other persons, the defendants pleaded, severally, not guilty. The jury found the four Sprinkles guilty, and assessed a fine, severally, on each of them; and they found the other three defendants not guilty. The court gave judgment against each of the defendants found guilty, for the fine assessed on him by the verdict, and judgment against all four of them, for the costs of the prosecution. They then moved the court to direct the clerk to tax but one fee for the attorney for the commonwealth. The court certified, that the evidence in the case, was the same against each defendant, shewing the different agency and guilt of each, in the same offence; and, with the consent of the defendants, adjourned the question of practice to this court, Whether a fee of ten dollars for the attorney for the corn-monwealth, ought to be *taxed against each of the four defendants found guilty, or only one fee of ten dollars against all four of them?</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b232-23\">See monographic <em>note </em>on \u2018Pines and Costs in Criminal Cases\u201d appended to Pifer v.
