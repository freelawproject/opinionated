At October term 1833, Watts, a free negro, was indicted (upon the statute of 1822-3, ch. 34, <em>\\ </em>3), and tried, for violently and feloniously making an assault upon, and attempting to ravish, one J. B. described in one count of the indictment, \u201ca white woman unmarried,\u201d and in another, \u201ca white maid.\u201d The jury found him guilty. Whereupon, he made a motion in arrest of judgment, because J. B. the female upon whom the attempt to commit the rape was charged in the indictment, was, at the time of the offence, under the age of twelve and above the age. of ten years, and so was not a white woman, within the meaning of the statute on which the prosecution was founded. The court certified that it was proved at the trial, that J, B. was, at the time of the offence committed by the prisoner, and *yet was, a white girl, of the age of eleyen going on to twelve years, and had not attained to puberty; and then, with the prisoner\u2019s consent, adjourned to this court, the question presented by the prisoner\u2019s motion \u2022 in arrest of judgment, and all other questions arising on the record of the proceedings, and, generally, what judgment ought fo be given?</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-30\">Arresto!

But the court does not think there is any distinction between a violence of this kind, practised upon a female between the age of ten and twelve years, and a similar violence practised upon one above the age of twelve. Both are equally rapes. If this was not so, the chastity of women between the age of ten and twelve years would be very inadequately protected. It is most manifest, that the statute\u2019l Rev. Code, ch. 158, \u00a7 3, p. 585, punishing the deflowering of children under the age of ten years, does not apply to the case of an attempt to ravish a female of the age of J. B., that is, between eleven and twelve, at the time the offence was committed of which the prisoner has been convicted. And the statute of 1822-3, ch. 34, \u00a7 3, enacls, that\u2018\u2018if any slave, free negro or mulatto, shall attempt to ravish a white woman, married, maid, or other,\u201d such offender shall be adjudged guilty of felony, and suffer death &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-28\">This court is of opinion, that sentence of death ought to be passed upon the prisoner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
