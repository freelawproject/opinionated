At October term 1831, a rule was made upon Sherrard, to shew a cause why an information in the nature of \u25a0 quo warranto, should not be filed against him for exercising \u00abthe office of justice of the peace of the county of Hampshire, without any legal warrant or authority. The rule was enlarged till October term 1832, when Sherrard appearing to shew cause, the following facts were agreed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-15\">That Sherrard was duly appointed and commissioned a justice of the peace for the county of Hampshire, in October 1818, and was duly qualified, by taking the oaths required by law, in March 1819; that he had, thenceforth, continued to act as justice of the peace, till the present time: that, in October 1828, he was duly appointed by-the government of the U. States, assistant post master at Sherrard\u2019s store in Hampshire, and took the oaths prescribed by the laws of the U. States for assistant post masters; and his appointment of assistant post master was placed on file at the general post office at Washington : and that he resigned his office of assistant post master, before the rule upon him to shew cause why the information should not be filed, was made:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AP7\">Whereupon, the circuit superiour court, with the defendant\u2019s consent, adjourned the following questions to this court: Whether, upon the facts agreed, leave ought to be granted to file the information? and whether the defendant\u2019s acceptance of the office of assistant post master had, under the circumstances of the case, incapacitated him from holding the office of justice'of the peace?</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b230-16\">Justices of Peace. \u2014 See generally, monographic <em>note </em>on Justices of the Peace\" appended to Wallace v.

That statute provides, \u201cthat the acceptance of any office under the government of the U. States, or of deput3r sheriff in any county within the commonwealth, or of any other office incompatible with that of justice of the peace, agreeably to the existing laws, except the office of high sheriff of any county, shall in like manner vacate the commission of the justice so accepting such office, and he \u00abshall thereafter be disqualified to-act as a justice of the peace, unless under the authority of a new commission.\u201d There can be no question, that an assistant post master holds an office under the government of the U. States; and it is of no consequence, that the defendant had resigned that office, before this prosecution was commenced ; for by the acceptance of it, his commission as a justice was absolutely vacated, and he became forever disqualified to act as such, unless under the authority of a new commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-20\">Therefore, this court is unanimously of opinion, that upon the facts agreed and stated in the record, leave should be granted to file an information in the nature of a quo warranto against the defendant, to remove him from his office of justice of the peace: and that the acceptance of the office of assistant post master by him, under the circumstances, did incapacitate him from holding the office of justice of the peace, unless under the authority of a new commission.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b230-24\">Sess.
