California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir. 2011). Delgadillo-Nunez has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-20\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. Although counsel states that Delgadillo-Nunez\u2019s appeal waiver is valid, counsel does not discuss the validity of the appeal waiver or district court\u2019s compliance with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. An appeal waiver in the plea agreement does not waive the district court\u2019s compliance with Rule 11 or the need to brief this issue adequately in an <em>Anders </em>brief. <em>See United States v. Carreon-Ibarra, </em>673 F.3d 358, 362 n.3 (5th Cir. 2012); <em>see also United States v. Brown, </em>328 F.3d 787, 789-90 (5th Cir. 2003). Nevertheless, our independent review confirms that the guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. We therefore concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-31\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
