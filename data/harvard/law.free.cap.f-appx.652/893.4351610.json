The sentence was slightly above the middle of his guideline range of 188 to 235 months of imprisonment. In 2014, Lara, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 782, which reduced the offense levels for certain drug-trafficking offenses. The district court granted the motion and reduced Lara\u2019s sentence to 188 months of imprisonment, the high end of his amended guideline range of 151 to 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Lara appealed the district court\u2019s order, arguing that the order was insufficient to allow for meaningful review because the court gave no explanation of its reasons for the partially reduced sentence. We agreed, finding that \u201cthe court\u2019s order gives no indication of the court\u2019s reasoning for its chosen sentence or its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Lara, </em>626 Fed.Appx. 799, 801 (11th Cir. 2015). We noted a discrepancy between where Lara was sentenced within his original guideline range (near the middle) and where he was sentenced within his amended guideline range (at the top). Because we \u201clack[ed] any detail, however minute, as to what was considered by the district court when it reduced Lara\u2019s sentence of imprisonment to 188 months,\u201d we vacated the district court\u2019s order and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 801-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">On remand, Lara filed a brief in support of his request for a sentence of 151 months of imprisonment, the low end of his amended guideline range. In his brief, Lara detailed his post-sentence rehabilitation while in prison, asserted that reducing his sentence would pose no threat to the community because he was 49 years old and he faced an undischarged state prison sentence and deportation upon his release from federal custody. Lara also argued that society\u2019s evolving understanding of drug crimes indicated that his sentence was longer than necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">The district court issued a seven-page order granting Lara\u2019s motion and again reducing his sentence to 188 months of imprisonment. In contrast to the court\u2019s original order, which was silent about the court\u2019s reasons and its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court\u2019s order on remand contains an explicit discussion of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the court\u2019s reasons for resentencing Lara to the high end of the amended guideline range. Lara again appeals the partial reduction of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">Lara challenges the district court\u2019s order on two main grounds. First, Lara asserts, the district court on remand violated the spirit of this Court\u2019s mandate by simply justifying its original decision rather than reconsidering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in an objective and unbiased way. Second, Lara contends, the court abused its discretion by refusing to properly weigh and consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including his extensive post-sentencing rehabilitation, the fact that he would pose no danger to the community if released earlier, and a societal recognition that drug sentences are excessive as a general matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce an eligible defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009). A district court abuses its discretion by failing to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures when making a determination under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1241-42 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">In evaluating whether and to what extent a sentence reduction is warranted, the district court \u201cmust consider the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as well as public safety considerations, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>may consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.1(B). The district court is not required to discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor as long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256; <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 927-29 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion by resentencing Lara to 188 months of imprisonment following our remand. As an initial matter, the court did not violate the spirit of our mandate. <em>See Piambino v. Bailey, </em>757 F.2d 1112, 1119 (11th Cir. 1985) (\u201cThe trial court must implement both the letter and the spirit of the mandate, taking into account the appellate court\u2019s opinion, and the circumstances it embraces.\u201d (citations omitted)). We remanded Lara\u2019s case because the court\u2019s original \u00a7 3582(c)(2) order and the record as a whole were insufficient to show what the court considered when it reduced Lara\u2019s sentence of imprisonment to 188 months, not because we disagreed with the substance of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Lara, </em>626 Fed.Appx. at 801. Without any explanation from the district court, we could not meaningfully review the sentence imposed. <em>Id. </em>at 801-02; <em>see Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1257. In keeping with both the letter and spirit of our mandate, the district court has now provided an explanation and an explicit discussion of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. The court was not required to reconsider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or impose a different sentence on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">Turning to the merits of the district court\u2019s decision, Lara has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and refusing to grant the extent of reduction sought by Lara. <em>See Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1257 (\u201c[The court\u2019s] decision whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence, and to what extent, remains discretionary.\u201d). \u201c[T]he abuse of discretion standard allows a range of choice for the district court, so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Drury, </em>396 F.3d 1303, 1315 (11th Cir. 2005) (quotation marks omitted). Absent a clear error of judgment or mistake of law, we must defer to the district court\u2019s determination. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">Here, the district court\u2019s order is sufficient to show that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and had a reasoned basis for sentencing Lara to the high end of the amended guideline range. The court\u2019s order references numerous \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the nature and characteristics of the underlying offense, Lara\u2019s criminal history, and the amended guideline range. The court also stated that it had considered Lara\u2019s post-remand brief, which addressed his post-sentence rehabilitation, public safety considerations, and other pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256. Thus, the record as a whole shows that the court adequately considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See id. </em>at 1256-57; <em>Smith, </em>568 F.3d at 928-29. While the court was permitted to take into account Lara\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, it was not required to do so. <em>See Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256. Finally, though Lara may disagree with how the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, he has not shown that the court committed a clear error in judgment by resentencing him to the high end of the amended guideline range. <em>See Drury, </em>396 F.3d at 1315. Because the district court did not abuse its discretion, we affirm, and reassignment to a different judge on remand is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-6\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the applicable guideline range, and the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and to protect the public. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) \u2014 (2), (4).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
