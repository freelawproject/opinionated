After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">Hamze was arrested on June 4, 2007 for the death of a black woman who was dragged underneath his vehicle for two miles after a hit and run.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Immediately after Hamze\u2019s arrest in June 2007, defendant Kenne Jenne, who was then the head of the Broward Sheriffs Office, spoke to the media. His statements included the following: \u201cThis was a brutal, senseless, roadrage killing. Hamze\u2019s complete disregard for human life should outrage everyone in this community. His capture will ensure he will pay for his brutality.\u201d Compl., Doc. 1 at 4-5 (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jenne also indicated that he intended to charge Hamze with first degree murder. Jenne attempted to charge him with first degree murder, but the grand jury downgraded the charge to second degree murder. Hamze was also charged with vehicular homicide and two counts of leaving the scene of an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">During his pretrial detention at Broward Main Jail (\u201cMain Jail\u201d), from June 7, 2007 through September 17, 2008; Hamze suffered injuries on several occasions. On August 17, 2007, deputies placed him in a holding cell with general population inmates, despite knowing that Hamze belonged in protective custody. As a result, Hamze was beaten by a fellow inmate who accused Hamze of committing a \u201cheinous [crime] against black people.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. Then on January 9 and 10, 2008, Main Jail deputies themselves seriously injured Hamze\u2019s head, neck, face, elbow, and wrist when they slammed him against the wall of his cell. And finally, on September 17, 2008, Hamze was again placed in a holding cell with another inmate who beat him and accused him of committing a \u201cheinous crime against black people.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. In addition, moments before this beating, the inmate indicated that he recognized Hamze from \u201cmedia exposure,\u201d mentioned the \u201cSheriff,\u201d and then referenced Jenne\u2019s 2007 statement. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, the inmate said Hamze was \u201cguilty of ... a \u2018brutal, senseless killing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-15\">On June 12, 2009, Hamze filed in the district court his first <em>pro se </em>complaint against several Main Jail staff members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>arising out of the incidents on January 9 and 10 and September 17, 2008. <em>Hamze v. Steele, et al., </em>No. 0:09-cv-60882-AJ (S.D. Fla. June 12, 2009) <em>(Hamze </em>I). The magistrate judge construed his complaint as alleging violations of Hamze\u2019s constitutional due process rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Report of Magistrate Judge, <em>Hamze I, </em>No. 0:09-cv-60882-AJ, slip op. at 2-9 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 10, 2009). The defendants moved for summary judgment, asserting a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See </em>Order, <em>Hamze I, </em>No. 0:09-cv-60882-AJ (S.D. Fla. Jan. 5, 2012). Upon the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge, the district court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>Id. </em>We affirmed. <em>Hamze v. Steele, et al., </em>509 Fed.Appx. 897 (11th Cir. 2013) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">After <em>Hamze I </em>was dismissed, Hamze requested from Main Jail staff leave to file an out of time grievance, explaining that his first attempts to grieve these incidents were thwarted when Main Jail deputies intercepted his grievance forms and threatened to retaliate if he continued to file grievances. Hamze did not allege whether his request was granted or denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">On July 4, 2012, Hamze filed this <em>pro se </em>action in district court, again alleging that his constitutional rights were violated based on the incidents on January 9 and 10 and September 17,2008. Hamze added two additional claims, one based on the August 17, 2007 beating and another against former Sheriff Jenne sounding in defamation based on the statement Jenne made to the media when Hamze was arrested. The magistrate judge construed this complaint as raising claims under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that Hamze\u2019s claims were barred either by the statute of limitations or because he failed to exhaust administrative remedies, the latter issue having been decided adverse to him in <em>Hamze I. </em>The magistrate judge recommended granting the motion, and the district court adopted the recommendation over Hamze\u2019s objections. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">A. Collateral Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Hamze first challenges the district court\u2019s determination that collateral estoppel bars his claims arising out of the incidents on January 9 and 10 and September 17, 2008.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that collateral estoppel bars a claim. <em>E.E.O.C. v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., </em>383 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir. 2004). We review for clear error the court\u2019s factual finding that an issue was actually litigated. <em>Precision Air Parts, Inc. v. Avco Corp., </em>736 F.2d 1499, 1502 (11th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>Collateral estoppel, also known as issue preclusion, \u201crefers to the effect of a judgment in foreclosing relitigation of a matter that has been litigated and decided.\u201d <em>Migra v. Warren-City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., </em>465 U.S. 75, 77 n.1, 104 S.Ct. 892, 79 L.Ed.2d 56 (1984); <em>accord Matter of McWhorter, </em>887 F.2d 1564, 1567 (11th Cir. 1989) (\u201cCollateral estoppel is appropriate only when the identical issue has been fully litigated in a prior case.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). The party seeking to bar an issue on collateral estoppel grounds must show that: (1) the issue in the current and prior actions is identical; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior suit; (3) the determination of the issue was critical and necessary to the judgment in the prior action; and (4) the party against whom the doctrine is invoked had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior proceeding. <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v. Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, </em>327 F.3d 1309, 1317 (11th Cir. 2003). \u201cCollateral estoppel ... is not limited to parties and their privies. A defendant who was not a party to the original action may invoke collateral estoppel against the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Hart v. Yamaha-Parts Distribs., Inc., </em>787 F.2d 1468, 1473 (11th Cir. 1986). An issue has been \u201cactually litigated\u201d when it was properly raised by the pleadings or otherwise, submitted to the court for determination, and actually determined. <em>See Christo v. Padgett, </em>223 F.3d 1324, 1339 (11th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The district court did not err in applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel and dismissing Hamze\u2019s claims arising out of the incidents on January 9 and 10 and September 17, 2008. The district court found that the issue of exhaustion regarding these incidents was raised in <em>Hamze I, </em>actually litigated, and identical to the exhaustion issue raised here. The district court\u2019s finding of fact that the same issue was actually litigated was not clearly erroneous. In both cases, Hamze complained of the same incidents and responded to dispositive motions on the same exhaustion grounds. Hamze also had a full and fair chance to litigate the issue in <em>Hamze I. </em>The defendants raised exhaustion as an affirmative defense in the answer to the initial complaint and again in their motion for summary judgment. Hamze had ample opportunity to amass evidence and argue on summary judgment why his claims should survive the defendants\u2019 exhaustion defense. Finally, because the district court dismissed <em>Hamze I </em>solely for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, the exhaustion issue was necessary to the court\u2019s judgment. Therefore, the district court did not err in applying collateral estoppel to conclude that Hamze failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Hamze\u2019s arguments on appeal explaining why he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies do not alter our conclusion. Hamze asserts that (1) he was not told of the grievance procedure and was unaware of the requirements; (2) he was incapable of filing a timely grievance when he was in the hospital; (3) Main Jail staff intercepted his grievances and destroyed them; and (4) Main Jail staff threatened to retaliate if he filed a grievance. According to Hamze, he was unable to raise these arguments sufficiently in <em>Hamze I </em>because he lacked counsel and access to the prison law library. Although his assertions about Main Jail\u2019s grievance procedures are troubling, he needed to raise them before the district court; thus we will not consider them on appeal. Further, he does not meaningfully contest that the <em>issue </em>of exhaustion was previously litigated and actually decided. A collateral estoppel determination focuses on identity of issues, not arguments. <em>See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. FAG Bearings Corp., </em>335 F.3d 752, 762-63 (8th Cir. 2003) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>(collecting cases). \u201c[O]nce an <em>issue </em>is raised and determined, it is the entire <em>issue </em>that is precluded, not just the particular arguments raised in support of it in the first case.\u201d <em>Yamaha Corp. of Am. v. United States, </em>961 F.2d 245, 254 (D.C. Cir. 1992). Thus, Hamze\u2019s additional arguments about the grievance process do not factor into our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Hamze also contends that his request to file a belated grievance form after <em>Hamze I </em>was dismissed constitutes a new fact rendering collateral estoppel inapplicable here. It is generally true that \u201cchanges in facts essential to a judgment will render collateral estoppel inapplicable in a subsequent action raising the same issues.\u201d <em>Montana v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 159, 162, 99 S.Ct. 970, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979). But Hamze does not explain how his request to file a belated grievance amounts to an exhaustion of his administrative remedies. We have held that a prisoner who failed to file a timely grievance does not exhaust administrative remedies when his request to file an untimely grievance is denied. <em>Johnson v. Meadows, </em>418 F.Sd 1152, 1156-59 (11th Cir. 2005). Here, Hamze failed to. allege whether his request was granted or denied; he now asserts in his appellate brief that the defendants never responded to his request. Regardless of whether the defendants expressly denied his request or simply failed to grant it, the result is the same: Hamze has failed to show that he exhausted his administrative remedies. <em>See id. </em>at 1159. For these reasons, the district court did not err in its dismissal of these claims as unexhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">B. Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Hamze also challenges the dismissal on statute of limitations grounds of his two remaining claims, one based on the deputies\u2019 failure to protect him from another inmate on August 17, 2007 and the other based on Jenne\u2019s statements to the media in June 2007. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the applicable statute of limitations. <em>Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Hamilton, </em>453 F.3d 1331, 1334 (11th Cir. 2006). We apply the forum state\u2019s statute of limitations for personal injury actions to \u00a7 1983 claims. <em>See Chappell v. Rich, </em>340 F.3d 1279, 1282-83 (11th Cir. 2003). For \u00a7 1983 claims such as Hamze\u2019s brought in the forum state of Florida, the statute of limitations is four years. <em>See id.; </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(3)(o).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The limitations period begins to run when the facts which would support a cause of action are apparent or should be apparent to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights. <em>Rozar v. Mullis, </em>85 F.3d 556, 561-62 (11th Cir. 1996). Thus, a plaintiff must know or have reason to know that he was injured and who inflicted the injury. <em>Id. </em>at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">As regards his failure-to-protect claim, Hamze asserts that the statute of limitations began to run not when he was injured on August 17, 2007, but instead when he was beaten again on September 17, 2008, which was less than four years before he filed this lawsuit in July of 2012. He would not have suffered this later injury, he argues, had deputies \u201cproperly reported the altercations ... in 2007.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 20. Hamze essentially attempts to bootstrap his way out of the statute of limitations bar by tying the alleged misconduct in 2007 to injury sustained a year later. We see insufficient factual support in his complaint to render this theory of liability plausible. And in any event, we have already held that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>claim arising out of his mistreatment on September 17, 2008 was barred as unex-hausted. Hamze therefore identifies no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">In contrast, we disagree with the district court\u2019s ruling that Hamze\u2019s defamation claim against Jenne under \u00a7 1983 is time-barred. The court concluded that Hamze\u2019s defamation allegations arose out of incidents occurring on August 17, 2007, but, as alleged in the complaint, Jenne\u2019s comments led to Hamze\u2019s injury on September 17, 2008. Assuming the truth of allegations in the complaint that the beating in September 2008 was causally related to Jenne\u2019s June 2007 statements, Hamze\u2019s injuries fell inside the four year statute of limitations. Nonetheless, as we explain next, we affirm the dismissal of this claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>See Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007) (\u201cWe may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any ground that appears in the record, whether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered by the court below.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">C. The \u00a7 1983 Defamation Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">To state a claim under \u00a7 1983 based on statements by government officials, a plaintiff must first allege a common-law defamation claim and then allege a constitutional injury flowing, from the defamatory statement. <em>Rehberg v. Paulk, </em>611 F.3d 828, 851-52 (11th Cir. 2010). A statement of opinion bearing no provably false connotation cannot support a common-law defamation claim. <em>See Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., </em>497 U.S. 1, 20, 110 S.Ct. 2695, 111 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990); <em>Keller v. Miami Herald Publ\u2019g Co., </em>778 F.2d 711, 714-15 (11th Cir. 1985) (applying Florida law). Likewise, \u201c[a] statement that is substantially true is not defamatory.\u201d <em>Brueggemeyer v. Associated Press, </em>609 F.2d 825, 826 (5th Cir. 1980);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>accord Jews for Jesus, Inc. v. Rapp, </em>997 So.2d 1098, 1107-1108 (Fla. 2008) (recognizing that although a literally true statement could create a false impression and thus be actionable, as a long as the statement is \u201csubstantially true,\u201d it cannot support a claim for defamation).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">Jenne\u2019s June 2007 statements to the media are not actionable because they were either statements of opinion or true statements. Jenne\u2019s expression of his opinion that Hamze\u2019s crime was \u201ca brutal, senseless, roadrage killing\u201d that showed a \u201cdisregard for human life,\u201d Compl. at 4, cannot support a claim for defamation. And, as alleged in the complaint, Jenne\u2019s statement that he intended to charge Hamze with first degree murder was substantially true. According to the complaint, Jenne endeavored to charge Hamze with first degree murder, but the grand jury downgraded the charge. Thus, even assuming Hamze has adequately alleged a causal connection between Jenne\u2019s 2007 statements and Hamze\u2019s September 2008 beating, the remarks at issue were not defamatory as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-12\">. Unless otherwise indicated, we derive this factual background from the allegations in Hamze\u2019s complaint, which we accept as true for purposes of the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b899-18\">. Citations to \"Doc.\" refer to docket entries in the district court record in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b900-6\">, Upon a frivolity review pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, the magistrate judge recommended that the defamation claim against Jenne proceed. Although the district court adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation, it apparently did not allow the defamation claim to proceed, and thus Jenne was never served. We therefore review the dismissal of the claim against Jenne as one under \u00a7 1915, but we apply the same standard that applies to our review of the dismissal of Hamze's claims under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See Farese v. Scherer, </em>342 F.3d 1223, 1230 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b900-12\">. Hamze also argues that the district court erred in determining that he was a \"three-struck\u201d filer, for purposes of the Prison Litigation Reform Act and thus ineligible to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\"IFP\u201d) on appeal. Because he has since paid his appellate filing fees, the issue of his eligibility to proceed IFP is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b902-7\">. We assume without deciding that Hamze's \u00a7 1983 claim premised on Jenne\u2019s allegedly defamatory statement is subject to a four-year statute of limitations rather than the two-year limitations period for slander under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.1 l(4)(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b903-9\">.
