On appeal, Scott argues that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) erred by (i) affording limited weight to the May 2012 mental health assessment of Scott by her treating doctor, Dr. Zhang, that concluded Scott had marked impairments, and (ii) concluding that Scott is capable of maintaining full-time employment despite her combined impairments and therefore not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-21\">Upon review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-23\">\u201cIn Social Security appeals, we must determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir. 1997). We do not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>weigh the evidence or substitute our own judgment of the evidence, even if the preponderance of the evidence weighs against the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1213 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">A claimant of Social Security disability benefits must prove that she is disabled. <em>See id. </em>at 1211. The social security regulations outline a five-step, sequential evaluation process to determine whether a claimant is disabled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">(1) whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-6\">(2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment or combination of impairments; (3) whether \u2022 the impairment meets or equals the severity of the specified impairments in the [list of impairments under 20 C.F.R. Part' 404, Sub-part P, Appendix 1]; (4) based on a residual functional capacity (RFC) assessment, whether the claimant can perform any of his or her past relevant work despite the impairment; and (5) whether there are significant numbers of jobs in the national economy that the claimant can perform given the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-7\"><em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1178; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i)-(iv), 416.920(a)(4)(i)-(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">In reviewing different medical opinions relevant to the determination, \u201cthe ALJ must state with particularity the weight given\u201d to each and the grounds for his decision. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179. The ALJ must give the opinion of a treating physician \u201csubstantial or considerable weight unless good cause is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>See Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Such \u201cgood cause exists when the: (1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1240-41. If the ALJ articulates legitimate reasons for assigning limited weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion that demonstrate good cause, then we must conclude such determination is supported by substantial evidence and therefore is not reversible error. <em>See Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1212; <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">The ALJ did not err in giving limited weight to the opinion of Dr., Zhang, Scott\u2019s treating doctor at Meridian Behavioral Healthcare (Meridian). The ALJ\u2019s decision specifically articulates legitimate reasons for assigning Dr. Zhang\u2019s May 2012 RFC evaluation little weight. <em>See id.; Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179. The ALJ determined that Dr. Zhang\u2019s conclusions were \u201cinconsistent with [his] own medical records\u201d assessing Scott\u2019s mental health just a month prior to his completion of the RFC. <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240-41. The ALJ further noted that Dr. Zhang\u2019s findings differed from other evidence on the record including Meridian\u2019s own treatment records and test results, as well as the opinion of the state agency psychological consultant. Therefore, the ALJ articulated sufficient reasons to demonstrate good cause for affording Dr. Zhang\u2019s opinion limited weight, leading us to conclude such a determination is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-13\">Mental and psychological defects can combine with physical impairments to create total disability. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.923. As such, \u201can ALJ must make specific and well-articulated findings as to the effect of the combination of impairments when determining whether an individual is disabled.\u201d <em>Davis v. Shalala, </em>985 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>F.2d 528, 534 (11th Cir. 1993). In determining whether the claimant is capable of work despite her impairments, the ALJ may rely on the testimony of a vocational expert. <em>See Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228-29 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In determining that Scott was not disabled, the ALJ explicitly stated that Scott\u2019s combined impairments (i.e. post-tibial fracture injury, affective disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder) did not amount to a listed impairment and made specific, articulated findings as to the effect of the combination of Scott\u2019s impairments. Such a statement constitutes evidence that the ALJ considered the' combined effects of Scott\u2019s impairments and discussed their cumulative effect. <em>See Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1224-25 (11th Cir. 2002) (per curiam) (holding that the following statement by an ALJ constituted sufficient consideration of combined impairments: \u201c[Tjhe medical evidence establishes that Wilson had several injuries which constitute a \u2018severe impairment\u2019, but that he did not have an impairment or combination of impairments listed in, or medically equal to one listed in [20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1].\u201d (alterations adopted)); <em>see also Jones v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>941 F.2d 1529, 1533 (11th Cir. 1991) (per curiam). Moreover, the ALJ discussed in detail both the physical and mental impairments she deemed legitimate and severe, and evaluated them both \u201csingly and in combination\u201d in finding Scott not disabled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She also properly relied on the vocational expert\u2019s testimony in determining that despite not being able to perform her past work, jobs involving sedentary work existed in the national economy that Scott could perform with her combined impairments. <em>See Apfel, </em>190 F.3d at 1228-29. Thus, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s determination that Scott was not disabled and therefore capable of maintaining full-time employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order affirming the SSA\u2019s denial of supplemental security income is</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-20\">. Additionally, because the ALJ had good cause to discredit the May 2012 opinion of Dr. Zhang, the ALJ did not need to consider the marked impairments Dr. Zhang identified in determining whether Scott was capable of full time employment. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1160-61 (11th Cir. 2004) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
