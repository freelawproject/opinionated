We granted Ramirez a certificate of appealability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">We review the denial of \u00a7 2255 relief de novo. <em>United States v. Flores-Ochoa, </em>139 F.3d 1022, 1023 (5th Cir. 1998). Ramirez argues that his sentence, based on the application of \u00a7 924(e)(1) for having three prior convictions of violent felonies, is unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), which the Supreme Court held to be retroactive to cases on collateral review in <em>Welch v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1257, 1268, 194 L.Ed.2d 387 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">The record indicates that Ramirez\u2019s pri- or conviction for possessing a deadly weapon in a penal institution was treated as a violent felony under the residual clause of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). On the present record and in light of <em>Johnson, </em>Ramirez\u2019s sentence is unconstitutional and he is entitled to \u00a7 2255 relief. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255; <em>Welch, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1268; <em>Johnson, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2557-58, 2563. Accordingly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s order and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We express no opinion regarding the district court\u2019s ultimate sentencing decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">The Government\u2019s motions for summary affirmance and for an extension of time in which to file a brief are DENIED, but further briefing is unnecessary. <em>See Welch, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1265, 1268. This resolution renders all outstanding motions moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R, 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-12\">. We have jurisdiction to address only the issue specified in the grant of the certificate of appealability. <em>See United States v. Daniels, </em>588 F.3d 8.35, 836 n.1 (5th Cir. 2009). To the extent that Ramirez raises other issues, we do not address them. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
