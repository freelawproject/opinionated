Bonilla asserted claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d) and Bivens<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against the United States and Assistant United States Attorney Andrea Hoffman (\u201cthe Defendants\u201d) arising out of the arrest, detention, and prosecution of Bonilla for his alleged involvement in an international drug smuggling operation. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">We recount below the relevant facts by accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to Bonilla. Fin. Sec. Assurance, Inc. v. Stephens, Inc., 500 F.3d 1276, 1282 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">A. Bonilla\u2019s Background and Social Status</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">Bonilla, a 64-year-old Colombian citizen, was a well-respected member of the Colombian community. Bonilla served as a pilot for Colombia\u2019s national airline for over 25 years. Thereafter, Bonilla assumed high-ranking positions for the Colombian government, including serving as the Director of Air Safety for the Civil Aviation Authority of Colombia. In 2004, Bonilla retired from his position as Director, began working as an aviation consultant, and also started a part-time business brokering the sale and lease of airplanes.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-17\">B. Investigation, Arrest, Detention, and Prosecution of Bonilla</p>\n<p id=\"b909-18\">At some point prior to June 2012, the United States initiated an investigation into an international drug smuggling operation occurring in Colombia. While the investigation was a \u201chighly coordinated\u201d effort between the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) and Colombian law enforcement, the United States was \u201cin charge.\u201d As part of the investigation, DEA agents made monthly payments to Colombian narcotics officers and paid them \u201cbonuses\u201d for their investigative efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-19\">On June 28, 2012, Bonilla was extradited to a prison in Florida where a DEA agent arrested Bonilla on suspicion of drug-smuggling activity. The United States accused Bonilla of selling airplanes to drug traffickers and claimed that phone wiretaps proved as much. However, the apparently incriminating wiretaps actually demonstrated that Bonilla refused to sell airplanes to people that he suspected were drug traffickers and, according to Bonilla, affirmatively established his innocence. Bonilla alleged that \u201cthe Defendants mali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>ciously and recklessly arrested, prosecuted and detained [him] due to his alleged involvement in a complex drug smuggling operation ... in spite of [their] knowledge that he was innocent of any wrongdoing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">The United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida delegated responsibility for prosecuting Bonilla to Defendant Andrea Hoffman, an Assistant United States Attorney. Bonilla alleged that prosecutor Hoffman unlawfully withheld exculpatory phone wiretaps despite his repeated requests for the disclosure of such evidence. Bonilla also alleged that Hoffman unlawfully withheld evidence proving that the DEA paid \u201cbonuses\u201d to individual Colombian narcotics police officers for their investigative efforts. According to Bonilla, Hoffman tried to \u201ccreate a case against [him] that simply did not exist,\u201d going so far as to represent that a secret witness existed who would testify against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">In August 2012, the United States dismissed all charges against Bonilla. Bonil-la\u2019s arrest and detention negatively impacted his family life, mental health, credibility, reputation, and ability to secure employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"A7u\">A. The Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">On July 28, 2014, Bonilla filed a counseled, nine-count complaint in federal district court against the United States of America and Hoffman. Bonilla brought the following claims against only the Defendant United States pursuant to the FTCA: (1) false arrest (Count I); (2) false imprisonment (Count II); (3) malicious prosecution (Count III); (4) abuse of process (Count IV); (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count V); and (6) negligence (Count VI).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">Bonilla brought the following claims against' only Defendant Hoffman pursuant to Bivens: (1) Constitutional claim under the Fifth Amendment (Count VII); (2) Constitutional claim under the Fourth Amendment (Count VIII); and (3) Constitutional claim for Brady<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rule violation (Count IX).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">B. Dismissal of the Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">In a September 20, 2015 order, the district court granted the Defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. The district court concluded that Bonilla\u2019s FTCA claims against the Defendant United States were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity because they were based on the actions of Hoffman, a federal prosecutor, who does not qualify as an \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). The district court also concluded that Defendant Hoffman was entitled to absolute immunity from Bonil-la\u2019s Bivens claims because those claims arose from Hoffman\u2019s performance of her prosecutorial duties. Bonilla appeals the district court\u2019s September 20, 2015 dismissal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b910-16\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b910-17\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Cinotto v. Delta Air Lines Inc., 674 F.3d 1285, 1291 (11th Cir. 2012). When evaluating a motion to dismiss, a court looks to see whether the complaint contains sufficient factual mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>ter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. Surtain v. Hamlin Terrace Found., 789 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir. 2015). This plausibility-standard is met when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">\u201cA pleading that offers labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quotation marks omitted). Indeed, a complaint\u2019s factual allegations must be enough \u201cto raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \u201c[C]onclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions of facts or legal conclusions masquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal.\u201d Oxford Asset Mgmt., Ltd. v. Jaharis, 297 F.3d 1182, 1188 (11th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">B. FTCA Claims against the United States</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">On appeal, Bonilla argues that the district court erred by dismissing his FTCA claims on sovereign immunity grounds. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">\u201cAbsent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the Federal Government and its agencies from suit.\u201d FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475, 114 S.Ct. 996, 1000, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994). The FTCA was designed primarily to remove the sovereign immunity of the United States from suits in tort. Millbrook v. United States, 569 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1441, 1443, 185 L.Ed.2d 531 (2013). The United States waives sovereign immunity in \u00a7 1346(b) of the FTCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-11\">[T]he district courts ... shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United States, for money damages, ... for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). However, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h) creates an exception to the waiver of sovereign immunity, as well as an exception to that exception, by providing that the waiver in \u00a7 1346(b) \u201cshall not apply to\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-14\">[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the United States Government, the provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall apply to- any claim arising ... out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). Thus, while \u00a7 2680(h) carves out an exception to the waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to the commission of certain enumerated intentional torts, the United States may still be liable for those torts when federal \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officers\u201d commit them. See id.; see also Nguyen v. United States, 556 F.3d 1244, 1260 (11th Cir. 2009). Section 2680(h) defines an \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d as \u201cany officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>evidence, or to make arrests for violations of Federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Here, the district court properly dismissed Bonilla\u2019s FTCA claims under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. All of Bonilla\u2019s FTCA claims maintain causes of action for intentional torts from which the United States is immune. Bonilla\u2019s false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and abuse of process claims are barred under the plain language of \u00a7 2680(h). See id. Additionally, Bonilla\u2019s negligence and emotional distress claims, though not enumerated in \u00a7 2680(h), are still barred because they are derived from the same conduct that forms the basis of the enumerated causes of action. See Metz v. United States, 788 F.2d 1528, 1534 (11th Cir. 1986) (\u201c[A] cause of action which is distinct from one of those excepted under \u00a7 2680(h) will nevertheless be deemed to \u2018alise out of an excepted cause of action when the underlying governmental conduct which constitutes an excepted cause of action is \u2018essential\u2019 to plaintiffs claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Bonilla nevertheless argues that the waiver of sovereign immunity for intentional torts committed by \u201cinvestigators or law enforcement officers\u201d applies to this case in two ways. First, Bonilla contends that Hoffman\u2019s conduct \u201cwent far beyond her prosecutorial duties such that she was acting in the role of an investigative or law enforcement officer for purposes of the FTCA.\u201d According to Bonilla, the. United States does not enjoy sovereign immunity where a federal prosecutor commits certain tortious acts in an investigative or law enforcement capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">With respect to Hoffman\u2019s conduct, prosecutors do not qualify as \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer[s]\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h) as they are not, empowered to execute searches, seize evidence, or make arrests. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 547-(setting out the duties of U.S. Attorneys). Nor does the complaint allege that Hoffman performed any of these functions. Accordingly, based on the allegations in this case, Hoffman does not qualify as an \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d under the plain meaning of \u00a7 2680(h), and sovereign immunity precludes FTCA liability arising from her allegedly tortious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Second, Bonilla argues that, regardless of Hoffman\u2019s conduct, the complaint sets forth detailed allegations of tortious misconduct by DEA agents and other federal law enforcement officers. According to Bonilla, the United States does not enjoy sovereign immunity where DEA agents, who are clearly law enforcement officers, commit certain tortious acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">With respect to the DEA\u2019s conduct, we have no doubt that DEA agents qualify as \u201cfederal investigative or law enforcement officer[s]\u201d under \u00a7 2680(h), which means that the United States does not enjoy sovereign immunity from claims based on the DEA\u2019s commission of certain intentional torts. See Nguyen, 556 F.3d at 1260. However, the complaint does not contain sufficiently specific allegations relating to the DEA\u2019s actual conduct to state an FTCA claim against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">The complaint alleges numerous instances of misconduct by Hoffman and the United States in general, but contains very few allegations concerning the actual conduct of the DEA or other federal law enforcement officers. Indeed, Hoffman is the only agent of the United States who the complaint ever identifies by name. All we can glean from the complaint is that unidentified DEA agents (1) coordinated a drug-smuggling investigation with Colombian law enforcement, (2) arrested Bonilla on June 28, 2012, upon suspicion of drug-smuggling, (3) paid \u201cbonuses\u201d to Colombian narcotics officers for their investigative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>efforts, and (4) received from Bonilla's attorney and Colombian agents some evidence tending to exculpate Bonilla. These allegations, accepted as true, do not establish the unlawfulness of Bonilla\u2019s arrest and detention and, therefore, do not state a claim for false arrest, false imprisonment, or any of the other related causes of action that form the basis of Bonilla\u2019s FTCA claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, none of Bonil-la\u2019s FTCA counts contain any allegations even mentioning the conduct of the DEA or other federal law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">At most, one could speculate that Bonil-la\u2019s allegations concerning the \u201cUnited States\u201d and \u201cU.S. authorities\u201d refer to the actions of the DEA or other federal law enforcement officials. However, complaints that do riot \u201craise a right to relief above the speculative level\u201d will not survive dismissal. See Bell Atl. Corp., 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Ultimately, we are left with nothing more than Bonilla\u2019s vague, threadbare, and conclusory allegations concerning the conduct of the DEA, which do not state an FTCA claim against the United States that is plausible on its face. See Surtain, 789 F.3d at 1245; Oxford Asset Mgmt., 297 F.3d at 1188.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">In sum, under \u00a7 2680(h), sovereign immunity precludes FTCA liability arising from the tortious conduct alleged in the complaint. Hoffman is not an \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer,\u201d and while a DEA agent is, the allegations regarding the DEA\u2019s conduct is not sufficiently specific to state a claim. Because the complaint does not state a claim against the United States based on the conduct of an \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer,\u201d the \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d exception in \u00a7 2680(h) does not apply and the United States enjoys sovereign immunity from Bonilla\u2019s FTCA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">C. Bivens Claims against Hoffman</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">On appeal, Bonilla also argues that the district court erred by dismissing his Bivens claims against Hoffman under the doctrine of absolute immunity. Bonilla argues that absolute immunity does not protect Hoffman because her misconduct exceeded the scope of her duties as an Assistant United States Attorney. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">\u201cProsecutors are ... entitled to absolute immunity from damages for acts or omissions associated with the judicial process, in particular, those taken in initiating a prosecution and in presenting the government\u2019s case.\u201d Bolin v. Story, 225 F.3d 1234, 1242 (11th Cir. 2000). \u201cSuch absolute immunity extends to a prosecutor\u2019s acts undertaken ... in preparing for the initiation of judicial proceedings or for trial, and which occur in the course of his role as an advocate for the State.\u201d Jones v. Cannon, 174 F.3d 1271, 1281 (11th Cir. 1999) (quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">\u201c[A]bsolute immunity does not necessarily shield a prosecutor from liability when he is. performing a function that is not associated with his role as an advocate for the state.\u201d Mastroianni v. Bowers, 173 F.3d 1363, 1366 (11th Cir. 1999). For example, absolute immunity is.not available where a prosecutor performs an investigative function, See Rivera v. Leal, 359 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir. 2004). \u201cA prosecutor functions as an investigator when he searches for the clues, and corroboration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>that might give him probable cause to recommend that a suspect be arrested.\u201d Id. (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">Acts protected by absolute immunity include a prosecutor\u2019s \u201cprofessional evaluation of the evidence assembled by the police.\u201d Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 259, 273, 113 S.Ct. 2606, 2615, 125 L.Ed.2d 209 (1993). Absolute immunity also extends to the \u201ctask of evaluating the credibility of the alleged exculpatory information,\u201d which \u201cno doubt requires the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.\u201d Long v. Satz, 181 F.3d 1275, 1279 (11th Cir. 1999) (quotation marks omitted). Additionally, \u201c[ijnjury flowing from a procedural due process violation ... that results from a prosecutor\u2019s failure to comply with the Brady rule cannot be redressed by a civil damages action against the prosecutor ... because the prosecutor is absolutely immune from such liability.\u201d Porter v. White, 483 F.3d 1294, 1305 n.8 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">Here, the district court properly dismissed Bonilla\u2019s Bivens claims under the doctrine of absolute immunity. The substance of Bonilla\u2019s Bivens claims, as alleged in the complaint, are essentially twofold: (1) Hoffman allegedly violated Bonilla\u2019s Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights by ignoring exculpatory evidence and detaining him despite knowledge of his actual innocence, and (2) Hoffman allegedly violated Bonilla\u2019s Constitutional rights under Brady by failing to disclose exculpatory evidence during the investigative phase. Hoffman enjoys absolute immunity from both types of Bivens claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">Bonilla\u2019s first species of Bivens claim concerns the very type of prosecutorial functions traditionally protected by absolute immunity. Bonilla seeks recovery from Hoffman based on her alleged failure to weigh properly the value of exculpatory evidence collected by the DEA. But absolute immunity protects prosecutors from liability when evaluating exculpatory evidence and performing a \u201cprofessional evaluation of the evidence assembled by the police,\u201d as Hoffman did here. See Buckley, 509 U.S. at 273, 113 S.Ct. at 2615; Long, 181 F.3d at 1279. Additionally, Hoffman\u2019s alleged knowledge of Bonilla\u2019s actual innocence is both a legal conclusion and an \u201cunwarranted deduction[] of fact[]\u201d that will not prevent dismissal. Oxford Asset Mgmt., 297 F.3d at 1188.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Hoffman also enjoys absolute immunity from Bonilla\u2019s Bivens claims based on her alleged Brady violations. Hoffman\u2019s alleged failure to comply with Brady constitutes an exercise of her prosecutorial function and entitles her to absolute immunity. See Porter, 483 F.3d at 1305 n.8. Indeed, when Hoffman told the DEA to \u201cstand down\u201d and not disclose exculpatory wiretap evidence, allegedly in violation of Brady, she was not performing an investigative function. See Rivera, 359 F.3d at 1353. Rather, Hoffman was performing a prose-cutorial function, for which she is absolutely immune. See Porter, 483 F.3d at 1305 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Bonilla\u2019s remaining allegations concerning Hoffman\u2019s general prosecutorial misconduct amount to nothing more than a claim for malicious prosecution, for which absolute immunity attaches. Jones, 174 F.3d at 1281. Accordingly, Hoffman enjoys absolute immunity from Bonilla\u2019s Bivens claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">In light of the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Bonilla\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-13\">.
