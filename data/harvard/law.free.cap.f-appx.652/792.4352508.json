For five years Hamler employed Quarles as a personal security guard. In 2010 Quarles sued Hamler for overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). A jury awarded Quarles $65,497.50, and the district court also awarded the same amount in liquated damages, along with attorney\u2019s fees. Hamler raises three claims on appeal. First, he says Quarles was not his employee for FLSA purposes. Second, he says he shouldn\u2019t owe liquidated damages. Third, he says the district court awarded excessive attorney\u2019s fees. Hamler did not properly designate his first and third claims for appeal, so we lack jurisdiction over them. His second claim is without merit, so we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">Each of Hamler\u2019s three claims relates to a separate order issued by the district court. The first claim arises from the district court\u2019s May 12, 2015, order, which found that Quarles was Hamler\u2019s employee for FLSA purposes. This order followed a one-day bench trial on this question and stated that \u201c[t]he case will now proceed to a jury trial for determination of the remaining issues.\u201d After a jury trial took place, the court awarded Hamler liquidated damages in an order dated July 23, 2015. These damages are the subject of Hamler\u2019s second claim. At the time the court issued its July order, Quarles still had a motion for attorney\u2019s fees pending. The July order closed the case, while noting that \u201c[t]he case does not have to be formally open for the Court to rule on the remaining issues as to costs and attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Within a month of the July order, Hamler filed a notice of appeal which said he was \u201cappealing to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals from this Court\u2019s July 24, 2015 Order awarding Plaintiff liquidated damages in the amount of $65,497.50.\u201d Then, on September 25, 2015, a month after that notice of appeal, the district court granted Quarles\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Hamler filed no notice of appeal regarding the September attorney\u2019s fees order. This September order is the subject of Hamler\u2019s third claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">Quarles says we lack subject matter jurisdiction over Hamler\u2019s first and third claims (about his FLSA status and the attorney\u2019s fees) because they were not referenced in the single notice of appeal that Hamler filed. Quarles is right. The Supreme Court has \u201cma[d]e clear that the timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2366, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). And though \u201cwe generally construe a notice of appeal liberally, we will not expand it to include judgments and orders not specified unless the overriding intent to appeal these orders is readily apparent on the face of the notic\u00e9.\u201d Osterneck v. E.T. Barwick Indus., Inc., 825 F.2d 1521, 1528 (11th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">Here, no such \u201coverriding intent\u201d was apparent in Hamler\u2019s notice of appeal. To the contrary, the notice of appeal referenced the ruling on liquidated damages by date and described what the ruling did. The notice of appeal did not mention or even allude to any other order, judgment, or issue. \u201c[Wjhere some portions of a judgment and some orders are expressly made a part of the appeal, we must infer that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>appellant did not intend to appeal other unmentioned orders or judgments.\u201d Id. at 1529. Hamler expressly made the district court\u2019s order awarding liquidated damages \u201ca part of the appeal\u201d and never referenced the court\u2019s prior order regarding Hamler\u2019s FLSA status. And the district court had not even ruled on attorney\u2019s fees at the time Hamler filed his one notice of appeal. See United States v. Garrison, 963 F.2d 1462, 1463 (11th Cir. 1992) (\u201c[T]he filing of a premature notice of appeal is as \u2018if no notice of appeal is filed at all.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S. 56, 61, 103 S.Ct. 400, 403, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Even assuming though that the notice of appeal was sufficient and that we have jurisdiction over these two claims, the district court is due to be affirmed. For the claim about FLSA status, the district court was presented with facts sufficient to find that Quarles was Hamler\u2019s employee. \u201c[T]he overarching focus of the inquiry\u201d into whether a plaintiff was the defendant\u2019s employee rather than an independent contractor \u201cis economic dependence.\u201d Scantland v. Jeffry Knight, Inc., 721 F.3d 1308, 1312 (11th Cir. 2013). \u201c[I]n considering economic dependence, the court focuses on whether an individual is in business for himself or is dependent upon finding employment in the business of others.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted).' Quarles presented plenty of evidence on this score. Quarles showed that he did not work for anyone else during the entire five years that he worked for Hamler. Indeed Hamler expected Quarles .to guard him at all times that Hamler was working or traveling, and the district court found that Hamler told Quarles he could not work for anyone else. These findings amply support the district court\u2019s finding that Quarles was Hamler\u2019s employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">As for the attorney\u2019s fees, \u201c[prevailing plaintiffs are automatically entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under the FLSA.\u201d Dale v. Comcast Corp., 498 F.3d 1216, 1223 n. 12 (11th Cir. 2007). Hamler claims the district court awarded excessive attorney\u2019s fees, but provides no legal or eviden-tiary support for why this is so. The district court\u2019s 17-page order on attorney\u2019s fees thoroughly analyzed Quarles\u2019s motion and reasonably reduced Quarles\u2019s request by 30 percent. Even assuming our jurisdiction over this claim, we see no basis for holding that the district court abused its discretion. See Kreager v. Solomon &amp; Flanagan, P.A., 775 F.2d 1541, 1543 (11th Cir. 1985) (\u201cThe determination of a reasonable fee pursuant to section 216(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be set aside absent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">This leaves the one claim designated by Hamler in his notice of appeal: whether he should owe liquidated damages. For a claim like this, we review findings of fact for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. Dybach v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 942 F.2d 1562, 1566 (11th Cir. 1991). \u201cUnder the FLSA a district court generally must award a plaintiff liquidated damages that are equal in amount to actual damages.\u201d Rodriguez v. Farm Stores Grocery, Inc., 518 F.3d 1259, 1272 (11th Cir. 2008). However, a district court \u201cmay, in its sound discretion, award no liquidated damages\u201d \u201cif the employer shows to the satisfaction of the court that the act or omission giving rise to [the FLSA] action was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a violation of [FLSA].\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260. The employer bears the burden of proof on this issue. Joiner v. City of Macon, 814 F.2d 1537, 1539 (11th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>The district court had an ample basis to find that Hamler did not act in good faith. The court\u2019s decision about good faith was largely based on its finding that the \u201ctestimony regarding [Hamler\u2019s] reliance on his accountants\u2019 advice\u201d was not credible. And Hamler\u2019s argument on appeal also turns primarily on the court\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to consider\u201d the testimony on this issue as well. But \u201c[i]t is the exclusive province of the judge in non-jury trials to assess the credibility of witnesses and to assign weight to their testimony.\u201d Hearn v. McKay, 603 F.3d 897, 904 (11th Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (quotation omitted). For this reason \u201c[w]e accord great deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations.\u201d United States v. Clay, 376 F.3d 1296, 1302 (11th Cir. 2004) (quotation omitted). The court heard testimony from Hamler and his accountant and decided that Hamler did \u201cnot demonstrate[ ] that he objectively acted in good faith.\u201d We see no basis to override the court\u2019s credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Also, though the jury found that Hamler did not willfully or recklessly violate FLSA, we have held that this finding doesn\u2019t preclude liquidated damages. This is because the burden for proving willfulness is with the employee, but the burden for proving good faith is with the employer. See Rodriguez, 518 F.3d at 1274. The district court had an ample basis to find that Hamler did not meet his burden as the employer. In any event, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260 merely provides that a district court \u201cmay, in its sound discretion, award no liquidated damages\u201d \u201cif the employer shows to the satisfaction of the court\u201d that he acted in good faith. So, even if Hamler had proved he acted in good faith, the court still would have been within its discretion to award liquidated damages, Ham-ler has not proven that the district court abused its discretion when\u2019 it chose to award liquidated damages here.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
