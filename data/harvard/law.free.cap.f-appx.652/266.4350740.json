Colvin, </em>803 F.3d 773, 776 (5th Cir.2015). To be eligible for social security disability benefits, one must not be able \u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). This determination is made through review of a sequential, five-step inquiry. Those five steps are: 1) Is the claimant currently working? 2) If no, does she have a severe impairment? 3) If yes, does the impairment meet or equal an impairment listed in the regulations? 4) If no, does the impairment prevent her from performing her past relevant work? and 5) If yes, does the impairment prevent her from doing any other work? 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i)-(v). A claimant\u2019s failure to meet even a single step terminates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>inquiry and results in a finding of no disability. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">The Commissioner concluded that Holland\u2019s application failed at the fourth step of the inquiry because Holland had the functional capacity to perform her past relevant work as defined by the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. Our thorough review of the briefs, record, and applicable law confirms that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Commissioner\u2019s rejection of Holland\u2019s application on those grounds. <em>See Leggett v. Chater, 67 </em>F.3d 558 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">The order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
