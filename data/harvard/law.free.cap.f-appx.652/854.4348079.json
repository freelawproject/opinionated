On appeal, Lucas\u2019s petition for review argues that: (1) he should be allowed to apply for asylum as relief from his reinstated removal order; and (2) the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) erred by concurring with the asylum officer\u2019s adverse reasonable fear determination. After review, we dismiss in part and deny in part Lucas\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">A.Prior Illegal Entries and Removals</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">On May 10, 2012, Lucas, a citizen of Guatemala, illegally entered the United States by crossing the Rio Grande River in Texas. On May 19, 2012, a DHS border patrol agent issued an order of expedited removal pursuant to Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 235(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225(b)(1)(A). The expedited removal order found that Lucas was inadmissible under INA \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), as an' immigrant not in possession of a valid entry document. Pursuant to the expedited removal order, Lucas was removed from the United States on June 19, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Over the next year, border patrol agents encountered Lucas at the U.S. border attempting to enter the United States three more times (in September 2012, December 2012, and March 2013). Each time, DHS reinstated Lucas\u2019s expedited removal order, and Lucas was again removed to Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">B. Illegal Reentry Conviction and Reinstatement of Removal Order</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">In 2014, law enforcement intercepted mail with a Florida address that contained Lucas\u2019s Guatemalan identification. Investigation confirmed that Lucas had unlawfully reentered the United States and was living at the Florida address. Lucas was arrested. In 2015, Lucas pled guilty to reentry after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), and was sentenced to time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">Lucas was remanded to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement pending reinstatement of his previous removal order and a fifth removal. On January 21, 2015, pursuant to INA \u00a7 241(a)(5), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(5), DHS issued a combined notice of intent/decision to reinstate the 2012 expedited removal order because Lucas was an alien who illegally reentered the United States after being previously deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-13\">C. Reasonable Fear Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b878-14\">At some point during his detention, Lucas expressed a fear of returning to Guatemala, and, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 241.8(e) and 208.31, was referred to an asylum officer for a reasonable fear determination. At his February 20, 2015 reasonable fear interview, Lucas said he was afraid of the Maras, a gang in Guatemala. According to Lucas, members of the Mar-as grabbed him off the street in 2011, took him into the mountains, and threatened him so that he would join the gang. Lucas said that the gang members wanted him to give them information about business people in his village so the gang could kidnap and extort money from them. Lucas convinced the gang members to release him while he considered their offer. The gang members told Lucas they would give him a phone that the gang would call to get his answer. Lucas reported the incident to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>police in a neighboring village, who did nothing. Lucas moved to another area to work and then travelled to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The asylum officer determined that Lucas was credible, but that he did not have a reasonable fear of persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala. Specifically, the asylum officer found that Lucas failed to establish that the harm he experienced or feared was on account of a protected ground or that the harm would be inflicted with the consent or acquiescence of a Guatemalan public official. Lucas requested review of the reasonable fear determination by an IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">On February 23, 2015, before the reasonable fear proceeding had concluded, Lucas filed this petition for review of the DHS\u2019s decision to reinstate his 2012 expedited removal order. On March 11, 2015, while this appeal was pending, the IJ issued an order concurring with the asylum officer\u2019s reasonable fear determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The IJ agreed that Lucas had failed to demonstrate a nexus to a protected ground and government acquiescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">A. Timeliness of Lucas\u2019s Petition for Review</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">The government moved this Court to dismiss Lucas\u2019s petition as untimely because it was filed 33 days after the January 21, 2015 reinstatement of his expedited removal order. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that jurisdiction to review Lucas\u2019s petition vested on March 11, 2015, when the reasonable fear proceeding con-eluded, and we deny the government\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">A petitioner seeking to challenge a final order of removal must file a petition for review within 30 days of the order\u2019s issuance. INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); Fed. R. App. P. 15(a)(1); Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n.3 (11th Cir. 2005). The statutory deadline for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is mandatory and jurisdictional and not subject to equitable tolling. Chao Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 677 F.3d 1043, 1045 (11th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">In addition, this Court generally has jurisdiction to review only final orders of removal. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a), (b)(9), (d); Jaggernauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 432 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir. 2005). An order of reinstatement of a removal order is reviewable as a final order. Avila v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 560 F.3d 1281, 1284 (11th Cir. 2009). However, \u201cwhere an alien pursues a reasonable fear proceeding following DHS\u2019 initial reinstatement of a prior order of removal, the reinstated removal order does not become final until the reasonable fear proceeding is completed.\u201d Jimenez-Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 821 F.3d 1307, 1308 (11th Cir.2016). Furthermore, if the alien files a premature notice of appeal \u2014 that is, before the reasonable fear proceeding has concluded \u2014 the petition becomes ripe and jurisdiction vests \u201conce the immigration judge rule[s] adversely to\u201d the alien, \u201cand the petition can be adjudicated if no action has been taken on the merits and there is no prejudice to the government.\u201d Id. at 1309.</p>\n<p id=\"AvP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>Here, Lucas filed his petition for review prematurely because his reasonable fear proceeding was not yet complete. However, his petition became ripe on March 11, 2015, when the IJ concurred in the asylum officer\u2019s reasonable fear determination. Furthermore, this Court has not taken action on the merits, and the government has not argued in either its motion to dismiss the appeal or its merits brief that any prejudice would result from judicial review. Accordingly, we conclude that we have jurisdiction to review Lucas\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar_\">B. Merits of Lucas\u2019s Petition for Review</p>\n<p id=\"AoG\">As an initial matter, Lucas argues that he asked to file an asylum application in May 2012, when he was originally detained, but he was not allowed to do so. He also contends that he should \u201cbe able to examine\u201d the records of his prior removals pursuant to his expedited removal order to see if he \u201chad expressed a fear to return to Guatemala as he claims, and whether he was afforded the opportunity to pursue a claim for political asylum on each of those occasions.\u201d But expedited removal orders issued pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225(b)(1) are not subject to judicial review except in very limited circumstances not applicable here. See INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(A), (e), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(A), (e) (limiting review to certain discrete claims raised only in habeas corpus proceedings); see also Shunaula v. Holder, 732 F.3d 143, 145-47 (2d Cir. 2013) (concluding that \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(A) and (e) barred review of petition for review of an expedited removal order); Khan v. Holder, 608 F.3d 325, 329-31 (7th Cir. 2010) (same); Garcia de Rincon v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., 539 F.3d 1133, 1138-39 (9th Cir. 2008) (concluding that \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(A) and (e) barred review of petition for review of a reinstated expedited removal order); Lorenzo v. Mukasey, 508 F.3d 1278, 1281 (10th Cir. 2007) (same).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, to the extent Lucas attacks his underlying expedited removal order entered on May 18, 2012 or any of his prior removals pursuant to that order, we dismiss his petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"AsS\">Although we have jurisdiction to review a reinstatement order, see Avila, 560 F.3d at 1284, Lucas does not challenge the immigration officer\u2019s 2015 decision to reinstate his 2012 expedited removal order. Specifically, Lucas does not challenge the immigration officer\u2019s findings that Lucas \u201chas been subject to a prior order of removal,\u201d that Lucas is in fact the alien previously removed, and that Lucas unlawfully'reentered the United States. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.8(a)(l)-(3). Thus, Lucas has abandoned any claim as to the decision to reinstate his expedited removal order. See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n.2 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"AOH\">Rather, Lucas argues that despite reinstatement of his removal order, he was statutorily entitled to apply for asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158. Pursuant to \u00a7 1231(a)(5), however, illegal reentrants who, like Lucas, are subject to reinstated removal orders are \u201cnot eligible and may not apply for\u201d asylum under \u00a7 1158. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(5) (precluding aliens who have illegally reentered the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>from applying \u201cfor any relief under this chapter,\u201d which includes asylum under \u00a7 1158); Jimenez-Morales, 821 F.3d at 1309-10 (concluding that \u00a7 1231(a)(5) renders an illegal reentrant subject to a reinstatement order ineligible for asylum).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Instead, the only relief Lucas could pursue at the reinstatement stage is withholding of removal under either \u00a7 1231(b)(3) or the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) via a reasonable fear proceeding. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.8(e); Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, 548 U.S. 30, 34-35 &amp; n.4, 126 S.Ct. 2422, 2426 <em>&amp; </em>n.4, 165 L.Ed.2d 323 (2006).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, we consider only whether substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adoption of the asylum officer\u2019s adverse reasonable fear determination, which in effect, denied Lucas\u2019s request for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AjTa\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adoption of the asylum officer\u2019s adverse reasonable fear determination. Lucas\u2019s statements in his reasonable fear interview failed to demonstrate that his life or freedom \u201cmore likely than not\u201d would be threatened in Guatemala on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. See Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 492 F.3d 1223, 1238 (11th Cir. 2007) (quotation marks omitted); INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). People who are targeted by a criminal gang because they oppose or refuse to join the gang are not members of \u201ca particular social group,\u201d and are not being persecuted on account of their \u201cpolitical opinion\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). See Rodriguez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 735 F.3d 1302, 1310-11 (11th Cir. 2013) (concluding family targeted by drug trafficking organization for refusing to cooperate did not establish a nexus to membership in a particular social group); Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 446 F.3d 1190, 1196-98 (11th Cir. 2006) (concluding that noncriminal informants working against a drug cartel were not members of a particular social group); Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir. 2006) (\u201c[E]vidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas, or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d); cf. Gonzalez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 820 F.3d 399, 403, 404-06 (11th Cir. 2016) (concluding that former members of the Honduran Mara-18 gang who would be targeted for leaving the gang were not members of a particular social group). Furthermore, Lucas has not shown that he is likely to suffer harm by, or with the acquiescence of, the Guatemalan government.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">In sum, the government\u2019s motion to dismiss Lucas\u2019s petition for review as untimely is DENIED. To the extent Lucas challenges his 2012 expedited, removal order and his prior removals, we dismiss his petition for review for lack of jurisdiction. To the extent Lucas challenges the 2015 reinstatement of removal order and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>adverse reasonable fear determination, Lucas\u2019s petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-10\">. Under the regulation governing reasonable fear proceedings, there is no further administrative review by the Board of Immigration Appeals. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.31(f), (g)(1). The government agrees that \"an appeal may be taken directly to\u201d this Court from the IJ's order concurring in the asylum officer's reasonable fear determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b879-16\">. \"We review de novo our own subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Avila v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 560 F.3d 1281, 1283 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A5T\">. We note, in any event, that Lucas\u2019s counseled petition for review does not raise any of the permitted claims that would be reviewable in a habeas proceeding pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(e)(2). That is, Lucas does not dispute that he is an alien who has been ordered removed pursuant to an expedited removal order, and he does not contend that he has already been admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident, a refugee, or an asylee. Instead, Lucas argues that he is entitled to relief from removal, a claim that 8 U.S.C, \u00a7 1252(e)(5) explicitly precludes from habeas review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b881-7\">. Because Lucas\u2019s petition for review does not address relief from removal under CAT or argue that he fears torture, he has abandoned any CAT claim. See Sepulveda, 401 F.3d at 1228 n.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b881-8\">. The government argues that this Court should apply a \"facially legitimate and bona fide reason standard\u201d rather than the substantial-evidence test. Because Lucas\u2019s claim fails even under the less deferential substantial evidence test, we need not address the government\u2019s argument regarding the appropriate standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
