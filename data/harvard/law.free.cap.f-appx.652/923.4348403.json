On appeal, Miles argues that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred by discrediting Miles\u2019s testimony regarding pain and by substituting his own medical diagnosis for the opinions of medical providers. After careful consideration, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of the Commissioner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">Miles, who previously worked as a mail carrier and postal clerk, applied for disability benefits, claiming that he was disabled due to headaches, mental disorder, back pain, neck pain, diabetes, high blood pressure, and shoulder pain. After a hearing, the ALJ denied his application, finding that because Miles could perform light work subject to certain limitations, there were a significant number of jobs in the national economy that he could perform. The Appeals Council denied Miles\u2019s request for review. Miles then filed an action in federal district court, asking the district court to reverse the Commissioner\u2019s decision. After briefing, the district court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision. This is Miles\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-15\">We review the decision of the ALJ as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision when, as here, .the ALJ denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir. 2001). \u201c[W]e review <em>de novo </em>the legal principles upon which the Commissioner\u2019s decision is based.\u201d <em>Moore v. </em>Barnhart, 405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir. 2005). The Commissioner\u2019s factual findings are reviewed with deference, and the \u201cfactual findings are conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence, consisting of such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Doughty, </em>245 F.3d at 1278 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cEven if we find that the evidence preponderates against the [Commissioner\u2019s] decision, we must affirm if the .decision is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Barnes v. Sullivan, </em>932 F.2d 1356, 1358 (11th Cir. 1991). \u201cThis limited review precludes deciding the facts anew, making credibility determinations, or reweighing the evidence.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-17\">An individual claiming disability benefits must prove that she is disabled. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a)(1)(E). In determining whether a claimant is \u201cdisabled,\u201d the ALJ in a sequential process examines whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>claimant: (1) is engaging in substantial gainful activity; (2) has a severe and medically determinable impairment; (3) has an impairment or combination of impairments that satisfies the criteria of a \u201clisting\u201d; (4) can perform her past relevant work in light of her present abilities, which comprise her residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d); and (5) can adjust to other work in light of her RFC, age, education, and work experience. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">On appeal, Miles asserts that the ALJ erred in the analysis of whether he was disabled by (1) improperly discounting his subjective complaints of pain and (2) substituting his own medical diagnoses for the diagnoses of two physicians. We consider these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Miles testified before the ALJ that he experienced neck pain, shoulder pain, back pain, and chronic headaches. He described how his neck pain- radiated into his upper extremities and how he experienced weakness and numbness in his upper extremities. He also testified that he had lower back pain from a herniated disk and experienced constant headaches. The ALJ found that Miles\u2019s statements about the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of these symptoms were not entirely credible. Although Miles asserts that the ALJ erred by rejecting his subjective complaints of pain, we discern no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">When a claimant attempts to establish a disability through his own testimony concerning pain or other subjective symptoms, we require \u201c(1) evidence of an underlying medical condition; and (2) either (a) objective medical evidence confirming the severity of the alleged pain; or (b) that the objectively determined medical condition can reasonably be expected to give rise to the claimed pain.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir. 2002). If the record shows that the claimant has a medically determinable impairment that could reasonably be expected to produce her symptoms, the ALJ must evaluate the intensity and persistence of the symptoms in determining how they limit the claimant\u2019s capacity for work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(1). In assessing the claimant\u2019s credibility about her symptoms and their effects, the ALJ must consider in addition to the objective medical evidence: the individual\u2019s daily activities; the location, duration, frequency, and intensity of the individual\u2019s pain; precipitating and aggravating factors; the type, dosage, effectiveness, and side effects of medication taken to relieve the symptoms; treatment, other than medication, for pain; any other measure used to relieve the symptoms; and any other factors concerning functional limitations and restrictions due to the symptoms. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1529(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">The ALJ is not required to discuss every piece of evidence so long as the decision does not broadly reject the claimant\u2019s case and the decision is sufficient for a reviewing court to conclude that the ALJ considered the claimant\u2019s medical condition as a whole. <em>See Mitchell v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>771 F.3d 780, 782 (11th Cir. 2014). \u201cIf proof of disability is based upon subjective evidence and a credibility, determination is, therefore, critical to the decision, the ALJ must either explicitly discredit such testimony or the implication must be so clear as to amount to a specific credibility finding.\u201d <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1562 (11th Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">We conclude that the ALJ properly applied our Court\u2019s pain standard and that substantial evid\u00e9nce supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Miles\u2019s testimony was not credible. The ALJ correctly recited our standard in his decision and indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>that he considered all Miles\u2019s symptoms based on the- requirements set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529. Then, the ALJ articulated specific reasons for his credibility determination. The ALJ explained that approximately a year after a 2006 neck surgery, Dr. David Gower, the surgeon who operated on Miles, stated he could not find an objective reason why Miles could not return to work and opined that Miles was malingering. And the ALJ explained that medical records from other physicians contradicted Miles\u2019s subjective complaints of pain. These records indicated that Miles had a normal gait, normal muscle strength, normal range of motion in his back and shoulders, normal fine and gross coordination, and normal x-rays of the lumbar and cervical spine. The ALJ also noted Miles was only taking over-the-counter medication for his pain. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3)(iv) (permitting an ALJ to consider the type of medication used to alleviate a claimant\u2019s pain). We conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision not to credit Miles\u2019s subjective complaints of pain. <em>See </em>Wilson, 284 F.3d at 1226 (\u201cIn citing to \u00a7 404.1529 and based on the findings and discussion, it is clear that the ALJ applied this Circuit\u2019s pain standard.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Miles also argues that the ALJ unfairly characterized his daily activities based on his testimony. There is no question that the ALJ was required to consider Miles\u2019s daily activities in considering the severity of his pain. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3). The ALJ relied on portions of a function report Miles completed showing that he could prepare simple meals, do laundry, drive, shop in stores, pay bills, use a checkbook, and handle a savings account. Miles contends that the ALJ erred by considering only his statements that supported the conclusion that he was not disabled while ignoring his other statements that supported a disability finding. We reject Miles\u2019s assertion that the ALJ erred by not discussing all portions of the function report because the ALJ\u2019s opinion make clear that the ALJ considered Miles\u2019s condition on the whole. <em>See Mitchell, </em>771 F.3d at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">Miles also argues that the ALJ erred by substituting his own medical diagnoses for the opinions of examining physician Dr. James and treating physician Dr. Kingloff. We conclude there is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">\u201c[T]he ALJ must state with particularity the weight given to different medical opinions and the reasons therefor.\u201d <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir. 2011). In weighing a medical opinion, the ALJ must consider, among other things, the medical source\u2019s treatment and examining relationship with the claimant, the evidence supporting the opinion, and the opinion\u2019s consistency with the record as a whole. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c). Generally, the opinions of treating physicians are given more weight than examining physicians. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">Dr. James, who examined but did not treat Miles, opined that CT, scans showed Miles had spinal stenosis and com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>pression of the nerve root.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The ALJ gave little weight to Dr. James\u2019s opinion on the basis that it was inconsistent with other evidence in the record. Although Dr. James reported that CT scans showed compression of the nerve root in Miles\u2019s cervical and lumbar spine, the ALJ found that the CT scans showed only \u201cminimal proximal left SI nerve root effacement.\u201d ALJ Decision at 9 (Doc. 7-2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Miles argues that the ALJ substituted his own medical diagnoses for the opinion of Dr. James when he characterized the root effacement as \u201cminimal.\u201d We disagree. The ALJ\u2019s description of the CT scans is consistent with the opinion of Dr. Gower who treated Miles and also reviewed the CT scans. Dr. Gower opined that while the scans showed some \u201cminor frontal steno-sis,\u201d he was \u201cnot at all convinced that this is the source of any component of [Miles\u2019s] pain.\u201d Progress Note (Doc. 7-7). Given these conflicting medical opinions about the CT scans, we cannot say that the ALJ erred in giving greater weight to the opinion of Dr. Gower, who treated Miles, over the opinion of Dr. James, who 'merely examined him.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Miles also argues that the ALJ \u201cput words into the mouth\u201d of Dr. Kingloff, a physician who treated Miles, Appellant\u2019s Br. at 25, by stating that Dr. Kingloff \u201cbelieve[d] the claimant\u2019s physical problems have been largely resolved.\u201d ALJ Decision at 8 (Doc. 7-2). We disagree. Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s characterization of Dr. Kingloffs opinion. In treatment notes, Dr. Kingloff repeatedly stated that Miles needed and would be helped by psychiatric counseling. When Miles reported neck and back pain, Dr. Kingloff noted that he was not prescribing any medication because psychiatric treatment was \u201cgoing to be the only therapy that is really going to help [Miles].\u201d These records constitute substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Kingloff believed Miles\u2019s physical problems had been larg\u00e9ly resolved. Accordingly, the ALJ did not insert his own diagnosis in the place of Dr. Kingloffs medical professional opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">For the reasons set forth above, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-11\">. Because we write only for the parties, we set out only those facts necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b949-6\">. Miles further argues that the ALJ improperly based the credibility determination on the fact that Miles was able to return to work for a period of time after he was in a motor vehicle accident and had neck surgery. But we have recognized that the fact that the claimant was able to work for several years in spite of his injuries constitutes substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision that the claimant was not disabled when medical opinions also support the conclusion that the claimant was not disabled. <em>See Ellison v. Barnhart, </em>355 F.3d 1272, 1275-76 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b950-5\">. Dr. James also opined that Miles was totally and completely disabled. Of course, this opinion cannot be controlling because that decision is reserved to the Commissioner. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(1) (\u201cA statement by a medical source that you are \u2018disabled\u2019 or \u2018unable to work\u2019 does not mean that [the Commissioner] will determine that you are disabled.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b950-12\">.
