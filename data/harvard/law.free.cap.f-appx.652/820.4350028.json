On appeal, he contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because his coworkers\u2019 use of the term \u201chomeboy\u201d was sufficient to create a hostile work environment. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">On or about September 26, 2011, CSXT employee Christopher Ellis called the company\u2019s ethics hotline to register a complaint against Mahone.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ellis complained that Mahone threatened him and his family after he called Mahone \u201csleepyhead\u201d over CSXT\u2019s internal radio. Decl. of Linda Mundy \u00b6 16, Doc. 31-17 at 6.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ellis stated that Mahone responded on a mobile phone, warning Ellis that \u201cyou don\u2019t know who you\u2019re f[*]cking with\u201d and \u201cyou don\u2019t know what can happen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 17 (alteration'in original). A coworker who overheard the interaction said that Mahone told Ellis that Mahone was \u201cgoing to do something to [Ellis] in Mobile,\u201d that he knew where Ellis lived, and that for $500 he could get one of his buddies to \u201ctake care\u201d of Ellis. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 18 (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-15\">Ellis also complained to Melvin Murray, Mahone\u2019s supervisor. Murray then notified his supervisor, who instructed him to assess a disciplinary infraction against Ma-hone for threatening workplace violence and against Ellis for using the company\u2019s internal radio improperly. CSXT removed Mahone from service pending an investigative hearing. Mark Mayo, the manager responsible for disciplinary issues in Ma-hone\u2019s division, cancelled the hearing in an effort to resolve the complaint informally without risking Mahone\u2019s employment. Instead, Mayo scheduled a staff meeting for November 2011 with Mahone, Ellis, Murray, two union representatives, and two witnesses to the interaction. Mahone recorded this meeting without the knowledge of anyone else present.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>During the staff meeting, Mayo and the union representatives highlighted the importance of communication and observing regulations. A witness to the incident stated that Mahone told Ellis to \u201cwatch [his] back ... [because Mahone was going to] pay [his] homeboy $500 to ride by over at [Ellis\u2019s] house\u201d.Meeting Audio at 1:25:25, Doc. 35-1. At that point, Mahone and his coworkers began shouting at each other while Mayo, Murray, and the union representatives attempted to calm them down. A union representative asked Mahone to assure Ellis that he would not come by Ellis\u2019s house. After another heated discussion, Mahone claimed that his coworkers were racially harassing him by making false statements. Mahone characterized these false accusations as a hate crime. The union representative replied that \u201cthis [was] not about a black and white issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1:33:20. Mayo told Ellis that he should not have called Mahone a sleepyhead and that Mahone should not have picked up the phone to respond to Ellis. Mayo declined to discipline Mahone for the alleged threat, but he explained to all of the parties that if they could not work together they should find employment elsewhere. Mahone did not make any further allegations of racial harassment after the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">In April 2013, Mahone filed a claim for racial discrimination, retaliation, and harassment against CSXT with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The EEOC was unable to conclude that CSXT violated Title VII and issued Mahone a notice of his right to sue in federal or state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">In February 2014, Mahone sued CSXT in state court bringing causes of action under Title VII and \u00a7 1981 alleging racial discrimination, retaliation, and racial harassment. CSXT removed the action to federal court based on federal question jurisdiction. CSXT filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted, dismissing all of Mahone\u2019s claims. Mahone now appeals the dismissal of his racial harassment claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.C.C., </em>492 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir. 2007). Summary judgment is appropriate if, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">Mahone argues that CSXT exposed him to a racially hostile working environment in violation of Title VII and \u00a7 1981. Specifically, Mahone contends that his white coworkers\u2019 use of the word \u201chomeboy\u201d created a hostile work environment by characterizing Mahone as a \u201cblack thug or black gangster.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">To establish a hostile work environment claim under Title VII or \u00a7 1981, a plaintiff must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>(1) that he belongs to a protected group; (2) that he has been subject to unwelcome harassment; (3) that the harassment must have been based on a protected characteristic of the employee, such as national origin; (4) that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and create a discriminatorily abusive working environment; and (5) that the employer is responsible for such environment under either a theory of vicarious or of direct liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-5\"><em>Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., 277 </em>F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir. 2002). To sustain a hostile work environment claim, the plaintiff must prove that \u201cthe workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and create an abusive working environment.\u201d <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The district court properly granted summary judgment because, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Mahone, he failed to come forward with evidence that the harassment was severe or pervasive enough to amount to a racially hostile work environment. This fourth element of the hostile work environment test \u201cincludes a subjective and objective component.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 1238, 1246. (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc). In the objective inquiry, we consider \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d including the following factors: the frequency of the conduct, the severity of the conduct, whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating or a mere offensive utterance, and whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with the employee\u2019s job performance. <em>Id. </em>We must keep in mind that neither Title VII nor \u00a7 1981 is a \u201cgeneral civility code\u201d that makes actionable ordinary workplace \u201ctribulations.\u201d <em>Cotton v. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc., </em>434 F.3d 1227, 1234 (11th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[SJimple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Although Mahone may have subjectively perceived that the harassment was severe enough to change the terns or conditions of his employment, we cannot say that under the totality of the circumstances this perception was objectively reasonable. The evidence here reflects only a single incident in which a coworker used a racially-charged word during a staff-meeting, but this conduct was not physically threatening or humiliating, and the plaintiff suffered no adverse employment actions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Mendoza, </em>195 F.3d at 1246. Additionally, this solitary event<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> during Mahone\u2019s multiyear employment at CSXT is too \u201cisolated to establish that [Mahone\u2019s] employers\u2019 conduct was so objectively severe or pervasive as to alter the terms and conditions of [his] employment.\u201d <em>McCann v. Tillman, </em>526 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>F.3d 1370, 1379 (11th Cir. 2008) (concluding that over more than two years of employment the use of one racially derogatory term in front of the plaintiff and two racial epithets outside of the plaintiffs presence was insufficient to support a hostile work environment claim). Although an isolated incident \u2014 if grave enough \u2014 may render a work environment hostile, that is not the case here. <em>See Faragher, </em>524 U.S. at 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining that Mahone failed to show that he was subjected to a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-11\">. In reviewing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we recount the facts in the light most favorable to Mahone. See <em>infra </em>section II.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b843-16\">. \u201cDoc.\u201d refers to the docket entry in the district court record in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b844-5\">. CSXT ultimately discharged Mahone in 2013 after he violated company policy with three serious operating-rule violations in two years. Mahone concedes that the incident at issue in this case did not result in his termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b844-6\">. Mahone does not appeal the dismissal of his racial discrimination and retaliation claims. We thus need not consider these claims. <em>See Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 680 (11th Cir. 2014) (\u201cWhen an appellant fails to challenge properly on appeal one of the grounds on which the district court based its judgment, he is deemed to have abandoned any challenge of that ground, and it follows that the judgment is due to be affirmed.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\">.Although <em>Harris </em>is a Title VII case, Title VII and \u00a7 1981 hostile work environment claims have the same elements and are subject to the same analytical framework. <em>See Shields v. Port James Corp., </em>305 F.3d 1280, 1282 (11th Cir. 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b845-10\">. We assume for purposes of this appeal that the term \u201chomeboy\u201d was a racially-charged reference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b845-11\">. There is some evidence in the record suggesting that Mahone encountered other instances of racial harassment at least two years before this incident, such as when he saw a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>racial slur painted on a bathroom and a train engine. But Mahone raises no argument on appeal that these earlier incidents should be considered as part of the severe and pervasive harassment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
