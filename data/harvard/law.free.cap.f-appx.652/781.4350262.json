After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-14\">In 2010, Mitchell filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion, arguing, inter aha, that his counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge his career offender classification under the Sentencing Guidelines. In denying Mitchell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court acknowledged Mitchell\u2019s valid collateral appeal waiver in his plea agreement, but did not rely on that appeal waiver. Instead, the district court ruled on the merits of Mitchell\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-15\">In 2015, Mitchell filed the instant \u00a7 2255 motion, again arguing ineffective .assistance of counsel for failing to challenge his career offender classification. The district court dismissed this \u00a7 2255 motion as an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-16\">On appeal, Mitchell asserts that the district court dismissed his first \u00a7 2255 motion in 2010 due to his appeal waiver in his plea agreement and that afterward his appeal waiver was \u201cremoved upon instructions of the [United States] Attorney General.\u201d Mitchell argues that his current \u00a7 2255 motion was not second or successive because, pursuant to \u00a7 2255(f)(2), his claim did not become ripe until after the removal of the appeal waiver as an impediment.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-17\">Pursuant to \u00a7 2255, a federal prisoner claiming the right to be released on the grounds that his sentence was imposed in violation of federal law or the Constitution, the court lacked jurisdiction to impose sen- \u2022 tence, his sentence is beyond the maximum authorized by law, or his sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack, \u201cmay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). If the district court determines that relief is warranted, it must vacate and set aside the judgment and discharge or resentence the prisoner, or grant a new trial or correct the sentence, if appropriate. Id. \u00a7 2255(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) provides for a one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion, which begins to run following the latest of four possible events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-6\">(1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-7\">(2) the date on which the impediment to making a [\u00a7 2255] motion created by governmental action in violation' of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from making a motion by such governmental action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-8\">(3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-9\">(4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">Id. \u00a7 2255(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">Before a prisoner may file a second or' successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the prisoner must first obtain an order from this Court authorizing the district court to consider the motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h). Without this Court\u2019s authorization, the district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. United States v. Holt, 417 F.3d 1172, 1175 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">A numerically second \u00a7 2255 motion may or may not be \u201csecond or successive\u201d under the AEDPA. See Stewart v. United States, 646 F.3d 856, 859-60 (11th Cir. 2011); see also Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 486, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 1605, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (explaining that the phrase \u201csecond or successive,\u201d as used in the AEDPA, is a term of art). In Stewart, after a prisoner filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion, he successfully challenged in state court the state convictions that were predicate convictions for his career offender sentence. See Stewart, 646 F.3d at 857-58. One month after his state convictions were vacated, the prisoner filed a second-in-time \u00a7 2255 motion, and requested vacatur of the career offender enhancement. Id. at 858. The district court dismissed the second-in-time \u00a7 2255 motion as successive. Id. In reversing, we explained that the basis for the second-in-time \u00a7 2255 motion \u2014 vacatur of the predicate state convictions \u2014 did not exist at the time of the prisoner\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 motion, and thus the numerically second motion was not \u201csecond or successive\u201d within the meaning of AEDPA. Id. at 863-65. In Boyd v. United States, we applied Stewart and determined that a prisoner\u2019s previously dismissed \u00a7 2255 motions did not render a later \u00a7 2256 motion \u201csuccessive\u201d because the prisoner\u2019s claim did not exist before his initial \u00a7 2255 proceeding concluded and the rulings on subsequent motions were not on the merits. 754 F.3d 1298, 1301-02 (11th Cir. 2014) (stating that \u201csecond or successive status only attaches to a judgment on the merits\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-14\">Here, whether Mitchell\u2019s current \u00a7 2255 motion would have been timely filed under \u00a7 2255(f)(2) if it were his first \u00a7 2255 motion has no bearing on whether the present motion is successive within the meaning of the AEDPA. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f). The district court did not err in dismissing Mitchell\u2019s motion to vacate as an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion because, unlike in Stewart and Boyd, not only did Mitchell\u2019s ineffective assistance claim exist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>when he filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion in 2010, but he asserted essentially the same ineffective assistance argument in his first \u00a7 2255 motion that he asserts in his current \u00a7 2255 motion. In his initial \u00a7 2255 proceeding, the district court clearly addressed the merits of Mitchell\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. Contrary to Mitchell\u2019s claim, the district court did not rely on the collateral appeal waiver in Mitchell\u2019s plea agreement to deny his first \u00a7 2255 motion. Therefore, the district court correctly determined that Mitchell\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 motion was adjudicated on the merits, and as such, the current \u00a7 2255 motion is a \u201csecond or successive\u201d motion within the meaning of the ADEPA. See Boyd, 754 F.3d at 1302. Accordingly, because Mitchell did not obtain our authorization before filing his successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the motion and dismissed it. See Holt, 417 F.3d at 1175.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-11\">. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2255 motion as second or successive. McIver v. United States, 307 F.3d 1327, 1329 (11th Cir. 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-11\">. On appeal, Mitchell does not argue that the district court should have construed his \u00a7 2255 motion as a \u00a7 2241 petition brought pursuant to \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause. In any event, the Southern District of Florida would have lacked jurisdiction to consider a \u00a7 2241 petition from Mitchell, as he is incarcerated in the Middle District of Florida. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a); Fernandez v. United States, 941 F.2d 1488, 1495 (11th Cir. 1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
