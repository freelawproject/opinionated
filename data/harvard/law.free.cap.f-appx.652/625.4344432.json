Phillips, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b1133-14\">Creditor Rich Dad Operating Company,' LLC (RDOC) appeals from the district court\u2019s affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order approving a settlement agreement between the trustee for the debtor\u2019s estate and another creditor. RDOC obtained a stay of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order pending its appeal to the district court, but it did not seek a stay of the district court\u2019s order pending this appeal. After the automatic stay of the district court\u2019s order expired, the trustee and the creditor performed their obligations under the settlement agreement. Accordingly, they now move this court to dismiss this appeal as moot. Because we are not persuaded that the appeal is moot, we proceed to the merits and review the bankruptcy court\u2019s approval of the settlement agreement. But because we also are not persuaded by RDOC\u2019s challenges to the decision, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">RDOC is the sole member and manager of the debtor, Rich Global, LLC (Rich Global). Rich Global lost a lawsuit brought by appellees Learning Annex Holdings, LLC, Learning Annex, LLC, and Learning Annex L.P. (collectively, Learning Annex) in the Southern District of New York. In July 2012, that court entered judgment against Rich Global and in favor of Learning Annex for nearly $23.7 million. Rich Global appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Learning Annex cross-appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal of one of its claims, as well as its grant of judgment as a matter of law to another defendant in the action..</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">The Southern District of New York ordered Rich Global to post a reduced appeal bond, but instead Rich Global filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the District of Wyoming. The filing of that petition automatically stayed the Second Circuit appeal and cross-appeal. The bankruptcy court appointed appellee Tracy L. Zubrod as trustee (the Trustee). Two creditors filed proofs of claim: (1) RDOC for approximately $2.2 million, and (2) Learning Annex for the amount of the judgment with interest, almost $23.7 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-6\">Initially the Trustee intended to abandon Rich Global\u2019s interest in the Second Circuit appeal. She rejected RDOC\u2019s offer to indemnify the estate for the costs of pursuing the appeal. Ultimately, however, the Trustee and Learning Annex entered into the settlement agreement (the Agreement). The principal terms of the Agreement are: (1) Learning Annex would pay the bankruptcy estate $100,000; (2) the Trustee would dismiss the Second Circuit appeal, with prejudice; (3) Learning Annex would dismiss Rich Global as an appel-lee in its cross-appeal; and (4) \u201c[a] single claim shall be allowed as a general unsecured claim in favor of ... Learning Annex ... in the amount of $23,690,999.41,\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. 2 at 467. Over RDOC\u2019s objection, the bankruptcy court approved the Agreement. RDOC moved for and was granted a stay pending its appeal to the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-8\">On August 18, 2015, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order. By operation of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8025(a), the district court\u2019s judgment was automatically stayed for fourteen days. RDOC did not move for a further stay of the district court\u2019s order. After the end of the automatic stay period, the Trustee and Learning Annex performed their obligations under the Agreement. Learning Annex had already paid the Trustee $100,000, so on September 4, the Trustee and Learning Annex filed their agreed-upon stipulation to dismiss Rich Global\u2019s Second Circuit appeal and Learning Annex\u2019s cross-appeal against Rich Global. On September 8, the Second Circuit dismissed the appeal and the cross-appeal against Rich Global, and it issued its mandate. The next week, it lifted the stay of the cross-appeal and set a briefing schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-9\">On September 16, RDOC appealed to this court from the district court\u2019s order. In light of their performance of the Agreement, the Trustee and Learning Annex moved to dismiss the appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ap5\">A. Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-11\">1. Constitutional Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-12\">Under Article III of the Constitution, the judiciary has authority to adjudicate \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies.\u201d U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. \u201cA case becomes moot \u2014 and therefore no longer a \u2018Case\u2019 or \u2018Controversy\u2019 <em>for </em>purposes of Article III\u2014 when the issues presented are no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>live or the parties lack a legally cognizable, interest in the outcome.\u201d <em>Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 721, 726, 184 L.Ed.2d 553 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cAn appeal is constitutionally moot if the court can fashion no meaningful relief.... [I]f a court can fashion some form of meaningful relief, even if it only partially redresses the grievances of the prevailing party, the appeal is not moot.\u201d <em>Search Market Direct, Inc. v. Jubber (In re Paige), </em>584 F.3d 1327, 1336 (10th Cir. 2009) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). The burden of establishing there is no longer a live case or controversy is on the party claiming mootness, <em>see id. </em>here the Trustee and Learning Annex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-6\">The Trustee and Learning Annex argue that given the performance of their obligations under the Agreement, particularly the dismissal of the Second Circuit matters, this court cannot afford RDOC any meaningful relief. RDOC asserts, to the contrary, that \u201cthe Settlement Agreement and its effects upon the bankruptcy estate can be. unwound and modified without substantial difficulty.\u201d Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 3. It suggests that the $100,000 payment can be returned to Learning Annex; that \u201cnothing would prevent the parties from requesting that the Second Circuit vacate its recent orders dismissing the Second Circuit Appeal or the cross-appeal against Rich Global and an affiliate,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 8-9; and that \u201cLearning Annex\u2019s allowed general unsecured claim against the bankruptcy estate of Rich Global can be adjusted, discounted, subordinated or disallowed should this Court decide to reverse the decisions made by the district court and the bankruptcy court,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-9\">It appears that the Trustee could return the $100,000. But of course this court has no ability to compel the Second Circuit to recall its mandate. Moreover, a court of appeals may exercise its power to recall the mandate \u201conly in extraordinary circumstances\u201d; \u201cit is [a power] of last resort, to be held in reserve against grave, unforeseen contingencies.\u201d <em>Calderon v. Thompson, </em>523 U.S. 538, 550, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998). And the cross-appeal has moved forward with briefing. In these circumstances, there is virtually no chance that the appeal and cross-appeal can be resurrected. RDOC\u2019s suggestion that the settlement can be unwound because nothing prohibits the parties from seeking such resurrection borders on the frivolous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1135-10\">This appeal is not moot, however, if we may offer even partial relief. And the burden of showing the absence of any meaningful relief rests on the Trustee and Learning Annex. Those parties have failed to overcome RDOC\u2019s assertion that, if we were to reverse the decision to approve the Agreement, RDOC would be able to challenge Learning Annex\u2019s claim in ways that it could hot do if the Agreement stands. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>light of this possibility of relief, the appeal is not constitutionally moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">2. Equitable Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">In the bankruptcy context, equitable mootness may also be a consideration. Under this doctrine, \u201cequitable, prudential, or pragmatic considerations can render an appeal of a bankruptcy court decision moot even when the appeal is not constitutionally moot.\u201d <em>Paige, </em>584 F.3d at 1337 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cAs with constitutional mootness, we hold that the party seeking to prevent this court from reaching the merits of the appeal bears the burden of proving that, for pragmatic reasons, the court should abstain from reaching the merits of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-7\">We apply equitable mootness at our discretion. <em>See C.O.P. Coal Dev. Co. v. C.W. Mining Co. (In re C.W. Mining Co.), </em>641 F.3d 1235, 1240 (10th Cir. 2011). Upon careful consideration, we decline to decide whether this appeal is equitably moot. The parties have not explicitly argued for equitable mootness, and this court has not yet decided whether equitable mootness should apply in a Chapter 7 case, <em>see id. </em>Accordingly, we will not \u201cdecide whether the doctrine can be applied, and if so, weigh the doctrine\u2019s six factors in this case in the face of an underdeveloped record on this issue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1136-8\">3. Statutory Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-9\">RDOC\u2019s first merits argument also triggers a mootness inquiry \u2014 this time statutory mootness. RDOC asserts that the bankruptcy court erred in declining to apply the sale-of-property provisions in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(b), instead approving the Agreement solely under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9019. The Trustee and Learning Annex counter that, if \u00a7 363 applies, this appeal is moot under \u00a7 363(m), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-10\">The reversal or modification on appeal of an authorization under subsection (b) or (c) of this section of a sale or lease of property does not affect the validity of a sale or lease under such authorization to an entity that purchased or leased such property in good faith, whether or not such entity knew of the pendency of the appeal, unless such authorization and such sale or lease were stayed pending appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1136-11\">\u201c[Section] 363(m) forecloses any remedy ... that would affect the validity of the trustee\u2019s sale.\u201d <em>C.W. Mining Co., </em>641 F.3d at 1239. As with the other mootness doctrines, it is the Trustee\u2019s and Learning Annex\u2019s burden to prove that the appeal is moot under \u00a7 363(m). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1136-12\">RDOC asserts that \u00a7 363(m) does not apply because the bankruptcy court did not apply \u00a7 363. It further asserts -that \u00a7 363(m) only applies to a \u201cgood faith\u201d purchaser, and in this case there has been no determination that Learning Annex acted in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-13\">It seems disingenuous for RDOC to complain about the bankruptcy court\u2019s failure to apply \u00a7 363(b) while simultaneously disclaiming the applicability of \u00a7 363(m). Nevertheless, we do not consider RDOC\u2019s \u00a7 363 argument statutorily moot. By the statute\u2019s plain terms, there must be a determination of \u201cgood faith,\u201d and the Trustee and Learning Annex have not shown any such determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-14\">For these reasons, we do not consider any portion of this appeal to be moot, and we move to the parties\u2019 merits arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-15\">B. Merits Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-16\">\u201cEven though this appeal comes to us from the district court, we review a bankruptcy court\u2019s decisions independently, examining legal determinations de novo and factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>FB Acquisition Prop. I, LLC v. Gentry (In re Gen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number><em>try), </em>807 F.3d 1222, 1225 (10th Cir.2015). \u201cA bankruptcy court\u2019s approval of a compromise may be disturbed only when it achieves an unjust result amounting to a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Reiss v. Hagmann, </em>881 F.2d 890, 891-92 (10th Cir. 1989) (citation omitted). \u201cA bankruptcy court is inherently a court of equity,\u201d and \u201c[tjhere is an overriding consideration that equitable principles govern the exercise of bankruptcy jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Sec. Nat\u2019l Bank v. Turner (In re Ocobock), </em>608 F.2d 1358, 1360 (10th Cir. 1979) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-4\">1. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">Section 363(b) allows the trustee to sell estate property outside the ordinary course of business. As stated, RDOC argues that the bankruptcy court erred in not applying \u00a7 363(b) standards, instead approving the Agreement solely under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9019. It asserts that a remand is necessary for the bankruptcy court to consider the Agreement under \u00a7 363(b) standards, including whether the Agreement is within the Trustee\u2019s sound business judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">Although the federal courts are split, the majority have held that a settlement of claims can also qualify as a sale of property under \u00a7 363. <em>See </em>3 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 363.02 (Alan N. Resnick <em>&amp; </em>Henry J. Sommer eds., 16th ed.). For purposes of this appeal, we assume without deciding that this court would adopt the majority position. But courts have also held that \u201c[wjhether to impose formal sale procedures is ultimately a matter of discretion that depends upon the dynamics of the particular situation.\u201d <em>Goodwin v. Mickey Thompson Enter. Grp., Inc. (In re Mickey Thompson Enter. Grp., Inc.), </em>292 B,R. 415, 422 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2003); <em>see also Cadle Co. v. Mims (In re Moore), </em>608 F.3d 253, 265 (5th Cir. 2010) (same). \u201cIn most compromises, the procedures of [Fed. R. Bankr. P.j 6004 [implementing \u00a7 363] and the substance of Code section 363 <em>will not </em>be implicated.\u201d 10 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 6004.01[6] (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-8\">In both <em>Moore </em>and <em>Mickey Thompson, </em>the courts were persuaded that \u00a7 363 auctions were required because the tendering of higher offers indicated that an auction could yield a better result for the estate. <em>See Moore, </em>608 F.3d at 265; <em>Mickey Thompson, </em>292 B.R. at 421, 422; <em>see also </em>10 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 6004.01[6] (indicating that \u00a7 363 procedures are necessary \u201cif other parties indicate that they are willing to pay more for the claim, or if it is otherwise shown that a bidding procedure would be appropriate\u201d). Those decisions, however, were context-dependent. <em>See Mickey Thompson, </em>292 B.R. at 422 n.7 (\u201cWe are not suggesting that every compromise of a bona fide controversy presented to a bankruptcy court under Rule 9019 must pass muster as a sale under section 363, We are sensitive to the different considerations that come into play.\u201d). As the district court recognized, in this case the circumstances are significantly different. The \u201cclaims\u201d at issue are defensive appellate arguments. No other person or entity offered more to settle the appeal; RDOC itself went only so far as to offer to indemnify the estate for the costs of pursuing the appeal. Moreover, the parties already had demonstrated the futility of trying to resort to an auction, given that an earlier proposed auction never went forward because they failed to agree on procedures. In these circumstances, we reject RDOC\u2019s assertion that the bankruptcy court\u2019s failure to employ \u00a7 363(b) protections requires reversal of the order approving the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-9\">2. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-10\">RDOC argues that the bankruptcy court\u2019s order fails to satisfy Fed. Bankr. R. 7052, which incorporates Fed. R. Civ. P. 52 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>into certain bankruptcy proceedings. Under Rule 52(a)(1), \u201cthe court must find the facts specially and state its conclusions of law separately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">\u201cThe Rule is designed to provide the appellate court with a clear understanding of the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision and to aid the trial court in considering and adjudicating the facts.\u201d <em>Colo. Flying Acad., Inc. v. United States, </em>724 F.2d 871, 877 (10th Cir. 1984). \u201cFindings of fact satisfy Rule 52(a) ... if they afford the reviewing court a clear understanding of the factual basis for the trial court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Bell v. AT &amp; T, </em>946 F.2d 1507, 1510 (10th Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted). Findings need not be in a specific form and need not be detailed. <em>See Colo. Flying Acad., Inc., </em>724 F.2d at 878; <em>Featherstone v. Barash, </em>345 F.2d 246, 250 (10th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">RDOC complains that the bankruptcy court\u2019s order is insufficient for appellate review. We disagree. The order is adequate to show this court the basis for the decision. To the extent that RDOC believes the bankruptcy court, should have been more specific regarding certain points, \u201c[gjeneral findings which realistically meet and resolve the issues in dispute may be sufficient in the absence of occasion or request for more specific ones.\u201d <em>Featherstone, </em>345 F.2d at 250. The bankruptcy court adequately gave \u201cthe reviewing court some basis for distinguishing between well-reasoned conclusions arrived at after comprehensive consideration of relevant factors and mere boilerplate approval.\u201d <em>Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of W. Pac. Airlines, Inc. v. W. Pac. Airlines, Inc. (In re W. Pac. Airlines, Inc.), </em>219 B.R. 575, 580 (D. Colo. 1998). (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-7\">3. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9019</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-8\">Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9019(a) allows the bankruptcy court to approve a compromise or settlement upon notice and a hearing. RDOC asserts that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in approving the Agreement under Rule 9019.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-10\">In undertaking its analysis, the bankruptcy court applied the following four factors: (1) the chance of success of the litigation on the merits; (2) possible problems in collecting a judgment; (3) the expense and complexity of the litigation; and (4) the interest of creditors. <em>See W. Pac. Airlines, </em>219 B.R. at 579; <em>Kopp v. All Am. Life Ins. Co. (In re Kopexa Realty Venture Co.), </em>213 B.R. 1020, 1022 (B.A.P. 10th Cir. 1997); William L. Norton, Jr. and William L. Norton III, 8 <em>Norton Bankruptcy Law &amp; Practice </em>\u00a7 167:2 (3d ed. 2011). The parties do not argue that the bankruptcy court erred in identifying these as the appropriate factors, and so we assume without deciding that they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-11\">\u201c[A] court\u2019s general charge is to determine whether the settlement is fair and equitable and in the best interests of the estate.\u201d <em>W. Pac. Airlines, </em>219 B.R. at 579 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[Tjhe court should, without conducting a trial or deciding the _ numerous questions of law and fact, review the issues and determine whether the settlement falls below the lowest point in the range of reasonableness.\u201d 8 <em>Norton Bankruptcy Law &amp; Practice </em>\u00a7 167.2 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-12\">Contrary to RDOC\u2019s assertions, we are not convinced that the bankruptcy court failed to adequately apprise itself of the facts and the law pertaining to the Second Circuit appeal. The court reviewed \u201cthe history of the litigation, the counts alleged, ... the District Court opinions and the supporting' documents found on the record.\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. 4 at 860. It was not required to \u201cdecid[ej the numerous question of law and fact.\u201d 8 <em>Norton Bankruptcy </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number><em>Law &amp; Practice </em>\u00a7 167.2. Nor was it required to conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying law or a risk-adjusted value of continuing litigation, as RDOC urges. And the bankruptcy court did not ignore either the Southern District of New York\u2019s assessment or RDOC\u2019s indemnity offer, as RDOC also asserts. It is apparent that the court was aware of these issues, as it addressed them in the order. We see no abuse of discretion with regard to any of these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-8\">RDOC states that the bankruptcy court\u2019s failure to reject the Agreement, in light of its indemnity offer, is per se reversible error. We disagree. In <em>Reiss, </em>this court reversed the rejection of a settlement where the only creditor had offered to pay the costs of a lawsuit upon which rested the only hope of any recovery for disbursement to that creditor. 881 F.2d at 893. We did not create a per se rule, however, and in fact we qualified our holding by stating \u201c[a]t least in a case like that at bar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The circumstances here are unlike those in <em>Reiss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-9\">RDOC also asserts that the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that if the Second Circuit appeal were reversed, a third trial would be required. Even if error, however, we do not consider it reversible error. The bankruptcy court\u2019s concern about the potential of an appeal or further litigation dragging on for an extended time was not an invalid one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-10\">Regarding the interests of the creditors, RDOC argues that the bankruptcy court erred in weighing the relative effects of the Agreement on Learning Annex and RDOC \u2014 if the Second Circuit were to reverse the judgment, RDOC would be the sole remaining creditor and would be paid a significant portion of its claim. The bankruptcy court, however, was well aware of RDOC\u2019s creditor status (as well as its status as Rich Global\u2019s only member). RDOC also asserts that the bankruptcy court, while expressing concern about RDOC\u2019s proposed indemnity arrangement aligning RDOC and the Trustee against Learning Annex, instead impermissibly allowed the Trustee and Learning Annex to align together against RDOC when it approved the Agreement. But the bankruptcy court was concerned that the indemnity agreement would \u201cput[ ] the Trustee in the position of working for a creditor and equity shareholder of the estate, against the only other creditor.\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. 4 at 861. The Agreement, in contrast, did not put the Trustee in the position of \u201cworking for\u201d Learning Annex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-4\">Having thoroughly reviewed the arguments, the record, and the applicable law, we cannot conclude that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion. The approval of the Agreement does not \u201cachieve[ ] an unjust result amounting to a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Reiss, </em>881 F.2d at 891-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">The motion to dismiss the appeal as moot is denied. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1133-8\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It \u2022may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1135-7\">. In addition, these arguments contradict RDOC\u2019s prior statements to the bankruptcy court in its motion for stay.
