Lindley\u2019s claims arise out of his nine-day detention at the Birmingham City Jail, where he alleges he was deprived of medical care for an infection in his leg. In denying Taylor\u2019s motion, the district court ruled that: (1) the claims in Lindley\u2019s amended complaint related back to his original complaint; (2) Taylor was not entitled to qualified immunity on Lindley\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim; and (3) Taylor was not entitled to state-law immunity on Lindley\u2019s negligence claim. We have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal because it concerns whether Taylor is entitled to immunity as a matter of law. Moniz v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 145 F.3d 1278, 1281 (11th Cir. 1998). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-19\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) governs when an amended complaint \u201crelates back\u201d to original filings for statute of limitations purposes. We review a district court\u2019s application of Rule 15(c) for abuse of discretion. Powers v. Graff, 148 F.3d 1223, 1226 (11th Cir. 1998). An amended complaint that adds a party or changes the name of a party \u201crelates back\u201d when: (1) the amendment \u201carose out of the conduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>transaction, or occurrence set out \u2014 or attempted to be set out \u2014 in the original pleading\u201d; and (2) within the 120-day period for service provided by Rule 4(m), the new party \u201creceived such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits\u201d and \u201cknew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B), (C)(i)(ii); see also Krupski v. Costa Crociere S.P.A., 560 U.S. 538, 548, 130 S.Ct. 2485, 2493, 177 L.Ed.2d 48 (2010). Constructive notice satisfies Rule 15(c)\u2019s requirements and can be imputed to a new defendant through her attorney if that attorney also represents the parties originally sued. Kirk v. Cronvich, 629 F.2d 404, 407-408 (5th Cir. 1980),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> abrogated on other grounds by Schiavone v. Fortune, AKA Time, Inc., 477 U.S. 21, 106 S.Ct. 2379, 91 L.Ed.2d 18 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">There is no question that Lindley\u2019s amended claims arose out of the same conduct set out in the original complaint. Taylor asserts, however, that she did not have adequate notice \u201cthat [she] would have been named a defendant but for an error.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at 548, 130 S.Ct. at 2493. But Lindley\u2019s original complaint named \u201cNurse Frida\u201d as a defendant in addition to the Birmingham City Jail and a number of Taylor\u2019s coworkers there. The city attorney investigated the incident and filed pleadings on behalf of other defendants named in the original complaint. Once Lindley corrected Taylor\u2019s name to \u201cNurse Fredia L. Taylor\u201d in his amended complaint, the city attorney undertook her representation as well. On this record, the district court did not abuse its discretion by imputing notice of the action to Taylor. See Kirk, 629 F.2d at 408. Because Taylor should have known that she was not named in the original complaint due to an error, Lindley\u2019s amended complaint \u201crelates back\u201d and his claims against Taylor are not time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity, applying the same legal standards that governed the district court.\u201d Feliciano v. City of Miami Beach, 707 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir. 2013). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In reviewing a denial of summary judgment, we are required to \u201cview the evidence and all factual inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-movant.\u201d Skop v. City of Atlanta, 485 F.3d 1130, 1143 (11th Cir. 2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">Qualified immunity \u201cprotects public officials to some extent from lawsuits against them in their individual capacities.\u201d Goebert v. Lee Cty., 510 F.3d 1312, 1329 (11th Cir. 2007). To claim qualified immunity, a defendant must first demonstrate that she was engaged in a discretionary duty. Mercado v. City of Orlando, 407 F.3d 1152, 1156 (11th Cir. 2005). After that, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that the defendant is not entitled to qualified immunity because she violated a clearly established constitutional right. Holloman ex rel. Holloman v. Harland, 370 F.3d 1252, 1264 (11th Cir. 2004). Because it is undis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>puted that Taylor was engaged in a discretionary duty as a nurse at the jail, we consider whether Lindley has overcome Taylor\u2019s claim of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">We first consider whether the facts, taken in the light most favorable to Lindley, establish that Taylor violated a constitutional right. Deliberate indifference to a pre-trial detainee\u2019s serious medical needs is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Lancaster v. Monroe Cty., 116 F.3d 1419, 1425 n.6 (11th Cir. 1997).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To establish deliberate indifference, Lindley must prove: (1) an \u201cobjectively serious medical need\u201d; and (2) that Taylor \u201cacted with deliberate indifference to that need.\u201d Brown v. Johnson, 387 F.3d 1344, 1351 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">A serious medical need is \u201cone that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor\u2019s attention.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). In either case, \u201cthe medical need must be one that, if left unattended, poses a substantial risk of serious harm.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Lindley was arrested and booked into the City of Birmingham Jail on January 24, 2008. According to Lindley\u2019s affidavit, he began requesting treatment on January 28 for a sore on his leg that was \u201chighly inflamed\u201d and \u201cswollen.\u201d The condition of his leg worsened, and \u201cit became too painful to raise [his] pants leg over [his] knee.\u201d He \u201cwould eat little if any food due to [his] fever and nausea.\u201d Lindley was scheduled to be transported to the Shelby County Jail on February 2, 2008, but the Shelby County deputies at first refused to move him and told Birmingham Jail personnel that he needed immediate medical attention. By the time he arrived at the Shelby County Jail that same day, Lindley \u201cwas unable to walk under [his] own power.\u201d The nurse who examined him upon arrival noted that Lindley had an abscess with a \u201cblackened center\u201d and recommended immediate medical attention. After processing, Lindley was transported directly to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a staph infection. He underwent two surgeries, leaving him with an open wound \u201cfrom the top of [his] thigh to mid calf\u2019 that took approximately ten months to heal.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">Taylor claims that Lindley did not meet his burden of establishing a serious medical need because he \u201cnever deposed any doctors, nurses or other medical personnel regarding [his] alleged [staph infection].\u201d However, Lindley\u2019s hospital records describe a \u201cstaph infection in his [ ] lower extremity\u201d that required the removal of \u201c[l]arge amounts of necrotic fascia.\u201d Even if Lindley\u2019s specific diagnosis were not clear from his medical records, his affidavits establish that he had a rapidly worsening infection whose severity should have been obvious to trained nurses. In fact, the nurse who examined him at the Shelby County Jail recommended immediate medical attention. In light of the foregoing, we agree with the district court that Lindley has demonstrated a serious medical need.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">Lindley must also show that Taylor was deliberately indifferent to this serious medical need. To satisfy this element, Lindley must prove that: (1) Taylor had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>subjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm; (2) she disregarded that risk; (3) by conduct that was more than gross negligence. Goebert, 510 F.3d at 1326-27. Whether a defendant had subjective knowledge of the risk of serious harm is a question of fact, which can be demonstrated by circumstantial evidence. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 842, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1981, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). In a case concerning a delay in treatment, we decide whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was more than gross negligence based on: \u201c(1) the seriousness of the medical need; (2) whether the delay worsened the medical condition; and (3) the reason for the delay.\u201d Goebert, 510 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Lindley \u201cspecifically recalled] reporting [his] medical need to Nurses Fredia Taylor and Allinda Brown\u201d and filling out medical request forms four times a day between January 28 and February 2. During the week of January 28, he also showed his knee, which was \u201cclearly swollen, red and very warm to the touch,\u201d to Taylor and Brown. After it became too painful for Lindley to raise his pants over his knee, he again \u201cspecifically remember[ed]\u201d showing his infection to Taylor and other jail staff. During the relevant time period, a \u201cstaff [sic] infection\u201d is mentioned three times in the ledger maintained by the jail. The entire time, Lindley alleges that he was given only Tylenol to manage the pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">These allegations support the inference that Taylor had \u201csubjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm\u201d and \u201cdisregarded] [ ] that risk.\u201d Goebert, 510 F.3d at 1327. Lindley\u2019s affidavit indicates that he showed his leg to Taylor in serious enough condition that she should have provided prompt medical attention. The fact that deputies and a nurse from Shelby County recognized the severity of Lindley\u2019s infection the same day he left the Birmingham Jail bolsters this inference. Regarding whether Taylor\u2019s conduct amounted to more than gross negligence, Lindley\u2019s hospital records indicate that he arrived with an \u201cextensive infection of the right lower extremity, which was not responding to antibiotics.\u201d A reasonable jury could conclude that Taylor\u2019s decision to offer no treatment besides Tylenol for six days allowed the infection to worsen to the point that antibiotics were no longer effective, leading to the extensive loss of tissue and skin. See Goebert, 510 F.3d at 1327 (finding that a reasonable jury could conclude that a delay in treatment caused the loss of the plaintiffs child). Taken in the light most favorable to Lindley, the facts alleged establish that Taylor was deliberately indifferent to his medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">Because Lindley has properly identified a violation of his constitutional right to adequate medical care for purposes of surviving Taylor\u2019s motion for summary judgment, we next consider whether that right was clearly established at the time of the violation. This Court must determine whether a \u201creasonable official\u201d would understand that what she was doing violated the right in question. Coffin v. Brandau, 642 F.3d 999, 1013 (11th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (quotation omitted). In this Circuit, a right can be clearly established in three ways. Terrell v. Smith, 668 F.3d 1244, 1255 (11th Cir. 2012). First, cases from the United States Supreme Court, the Eleventh Circuit, or the highest court of the state where the relevant events took place (here, the Alabama Supreme Court) may clearly establish the right. Id. at 1256. \u201cA judicial precedent with materially identical facts is not essential for the law to be clearly established, but the preexisting law must make it obvious that the defendant\u2019s acts violated the plaintiffs rights in the specific set of circumstances at issue.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Youmans v. Gagnon, 626 F.3d 557, 563 (11th Cir. 2010) (per curiam). Second, a legal principle announced in caselaw may establish the right \u201cwith obvious clarity to the point that every objectively reasonable government official facing the circumstances would know that the official\u2019s conduct did violate federal law.\u201d Gilmore v. Hodges, 738 F.3d 266, 279 (11th Cir. 2013) (quotation omitted). Third, an official\u2019s conduct may be \u201cso bad that case law is not needed to establish that the conduct cannot be lawful.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). Cases successfully invoking the second and third rationales are rare. Coffin, 642 F.3d at 1015.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Taylor does not argue that existing case-law failed to give her \u201cfair warning that [her] alleged treatment of [Lindley] was unconstitutional.\u201d Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 2516, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002). Instead, she says that she should not be deprived of liability because Lindley \u201cdid not prove that he had MSRA or a staph infection.\u201d However, the district court identified specific Circuit precedent that gave Taylor the requisite notice that Lindley\u2019s condition was serious enough to require treatment. In Andujar v. Rodriguez, 486 F.3d 1199 (11th Cir. 2007), this Court held that dog bites on the arrestee\u2019s upper thigh created a serious medical need. Id. at 1203. The plaintiff was \u201ccrying in pain, and [] his ability to walk was impaired\u201d because of the bites. IcL Here, Lindley had an obvious sore on his leg that was red, swollen, and later developed a blackened center. His condition worsened until it was too painful for him to undress himself and \u201ceven impossible for [him] to get out of bed.\u201d By February 2, he could not walk or even \u201csit upright.\u201d These symptoms were sufficiently similar to those described in Andujar to establish that Lindley needed treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Another case from our Circuit, Mandel v. Doe, 888 F.2d 783 (11th Cir. 1989), establishes that Taylor\u2019s treatment of Lindley was \u201cso cursory as to amount to ... deliberate indifference.\u201d Id. at 789. In Mandel, the plaintiff suffered a hip injury which worsened to the point \u201cthat he could barely stand.\u201d Id. at 785. The plaintiff repeatedly requested treatment over the course of two months, but was misdiagnosed with muscle inflammation and only given aspirin or a muscle relaxant. Id. at 785-86. By the time he was released, he needed a complete hip replacement. Id. at 787. In this case, Lindley likewise complained of pain so severe that it prevented him from standing. And yet the only treatment he was provided before leaving the Birmingham Jail was Tylenol. After Man-del, a reasonable nurse would know that this was constitutionally inadequate care.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Indeed, legal principles announced by this Circuit have also established this right such that \u201cevery objectively reasonable government official facing the circumstances would know that the official\u2019s conduct did violate federal law.\u201d Gilmore, 738 F.3d at 279. This Court has stated that \u201can official acts with deliberate indifference when he intentionally delays providing an inmate with access to medical treatment, knowing that the inmate has ... an urgent medical condition that would be exacerbated by delay.\u201d Lancaster, 116 F.3d at 1425. This general statement sufficiently establishes that not treating Lindley even after he became feverish and could no longer get out of bed for meals was deliberate indifference. Because a reasonable nurse would have known that refusing Lindley treatment in his condition was a constitutional violation, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that Taylor is not entitled to qualified immunity with respect to Lindley\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s denial of state-law immunity with respect to Lindley\u2019s negligence claim. Taylor argues that she is entitled to state-agent immunity under Ex parte Cranman, 792 So.2d 392 (Ala. 2000), and discretionary-function immunity under Alabama Code \u00a7 6-5-338. Neither argument has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">In Cranman, a plurality of the Alabama Supreme Court clarified the scope of Alabama\u2019s state-agent immunity doctrine. Under Alabama law, a state agent is immune from civil liability if she is engaged in:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-7\">(1) formulating plans, policies, or designs; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-8\">(2) exercising his or her judgment in the administration of a department or agency of government, including, but not limited to, examples such as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-9\">(a) making administrative adjudications;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-10\">(b) allocating resources;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-11\">(c) negotiating contracts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-12\">(d) hiring, firing, transferring, assigning, or supervising personnel; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-13\">(3) discharging duties imposed on a department or agency by statute, rule, or regulation, insofar as the statute, rule, or regulation prescribes the manner for performing the duties and the State agent performs the duties in that manner; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-14\">(4) exercising judgment in the enforcement of the criminal laws of the State, including, but not limited to, law-enforcement officers\u2019 arresting or attempting to arrest persons; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-15\">(5) exercising judgment in the discharge of duties imposed by statute, rule, or regulation in releasing prison-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-16\">ers, counseling or releasing persons of unsound mind, or educating students.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajgf\">Cranman, 792 So.2d at 405. After Cranman, the Alabama Supreme Court established a burden-shifting framework to analyze claims of state-agent immunity. First, the defendant must demonstrate that \u201cthe plaintiffs claims arise from the defendant\u2019s performance of a discretionary function.\u201d Hollis v. City of Brighton, 950 So.2d 300, 306 (Ala. 2006) (quotation omitted). The burden then shifts to the plaintiff to \u201cestablish that the defendant acted in bad faith or with malice or willfulness.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-17\">Taylor fails at the first step. She claims that her conduct falls under Cram man\u2019s third category: \u201cdischarging duties imposed on a department or agency by statute, rule, or regulation.\u201d Id. However, she has not identified any \u201cstatute, rule, or regulation prescribing] the manner for performing [her] duties.\u201d Id. As such, she is not entitled to state-agent immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-18\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-19\">Taylor also claims discretionary-function immunity under Alabama Code \u00a7 6-5-338. The statute provides, in relevant part, \u201c[e]very peace officer ... who is employed or appointed pursuant to the Constitution or statutes of this state ... shall have immunity from tort liability arising out of his or her conduct in performance of any discretionary function within the line and scope of his or her law enforcement duties.\u201d Ala. Code \u00a7 6-5-338(a). According to the statute, a peace officer is one \u201cempowered ... to execute warrants, to arrest and to take into custody persons who violate [the law].\u201d Id.; see also Walker v. City of Huntsville, 62 So.3d 474, 501 (Ala. 2010). Taylor has presented no evidence that she is empowered to perform the duties of a peace officer. Therefore, she cannot claim discretionary-func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>tion immunity under Alabama Code \u00a7 6-5-338.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">We hold that Lindley\u2019s claims are not time-barred because his amended complaint \u201crelates back\u201d to his original complaint. Because we also conclude that Taylor is not entitled to qualified immunity or state-agent immunity, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-6\">.
