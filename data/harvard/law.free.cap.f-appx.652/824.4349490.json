Borges argues that the district court applied an improper standard of care in determining whether the Coast Guard was negligent and disregarded testimony from his expert witnesses. The United States argues that the district court should have dismissed Borges\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Because the district court had jurisdiction to adjudicate Borges\u2019s complaint, and the evidence supports its finding that the Coast Guard was not negligent, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">The United States argues that Borges failed to satisfy a precondition for a waiver of sovereign immunity to maintain his action under the Public Vessels Act, but the district court correctly de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>termined that the Public Vessels Act did not govern Borges\u2019s complaint. Under the Public Vessels Act, \u201c[a] national of a foreign country may not maintain a civil action [against the United States in per-sonam in admiralty for damages caused directly by a public vessel] unless the government of that [foreign] country, in similar circumstances, allows nationals of the United States to sue in its courts.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 31102(a)(1), 31111. The Supreme Court has interpreted \u201cthe phase \u2018caused by a public vessel\u2019\u201d as including when \u201cthe vessel was the physical instrument that caused the physical damage\u201d and when \u201cthe vessel ... caus[ed] the harm although the actual cause is the negligence of the personnel in the operation of the ship\u201d because it would be illogical to \u201callow[] recovery for collision and refus[e] recovery for damages caused by other movements of the offending vessel.\u201d <em>Canadian Aviator v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 215, 224, 225, 65 S.Ct. 639, 89 L.Ed. 901 (1945). Borges did not seek damages for an injury caused by the Coast Guard vessel or by its negligent operation. Borges alleged that he developed a chronic bone infection and \u201cnumerous complications\u201d because medical personnel onboard the vessel treated his broken and lacerated ankle instead of evacuating him to a hospital. As we held in <em>Uralde v. United States, </em>614 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir. 2010), a complaint \u201cbased [on] the Coast Guard\u2019s decisions regarding whether and how to provide proper care and timely access to medical treatment of a passenger on a private vessel interdicted at sea\u201d is \u201cdistinct from the operation of a public vessel\u201d so \u201cneither the [Public Vessels Act] nor its reciprocity requirement applies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Borges\u2019s complaint fell within the scope of the waiver of sovereign immunity in the Suits in Admiralty Act, which \u201ccovers all remaining admiralty claims, including those simply <em>involving </em>public vessels,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1286 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30903(a). Because Borges complained that \u201cCoast Guard personnel [were] negligent in performing functions other than those \u2018in the operation of public vessels, ... [his complaint] f[e]ll under the [Suits in Admiralty Act], rather than the [Public Vessels Act].\u201d <em>See Uralde, </em>614 F.3d 1288. The district court had jurisdiction to adjudicate Borges\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Borges argues that the district court erred by evaluating the medical personnel under the standard of care applied to good Samaritans, but we need not address that issue. We can readily affirm based on the finding of the district court that there was \u201cno evidence ... of negligence on the part of the Coast Guard or its personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Federal law provides that \u201c[i]n order to render aid to distressed persons ... the Coast Guard may perform any and all acts necessary to ... aid persons,\u201d 14 U.S.C. \u00a7 88(a)(1), when and where \u201cCoast Guard facilities and personnel are available and can be effectively utilized,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 88(b)(1). Under maritime law, \u201ca shipowner owes the duty of exercising reasonable care to[ ] those lawfully aboard the vessel who are not members of the crew.\u201d <em>Kermarec v. Compagnie Generate Transatlantique, </em>358 U.S. 625, 630, 79 S.Ct. 406, 3 L.Ed.2d 550 (1959). To prove negligence, Borges had to establish that the Coast Guard owed him a duty that it breached and that was the proximate cause of his injury and that he \u201csuffered actual harm.\u201d <em>Franza v. Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd., </em>772 F.3d 1225, 1253 (11th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">We cannot say the district court clearly erred in finding that the medical personnel \u201cprovided reasonable medical treatment\u201d and that there was \u201cno evidence ... of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>negligence.\u201d <em>See Krys v. Lufthansa German Airlines, </em>119 F.3d 1515, 1525 (11th Cir. 1997). Borges arrived on the Coast Guard vessel with a laceration on his right ankle that exposed the bone, after which medical personnel, as the district court stated succinctly, \u201ccleansed [Borges\u2019s] wound, closed the wound to prevent ... interference from further debris, provided [him] with antibiotics, continuously monitored [his] condition, and quickly evacuated [him]\u201d when he exhibited \u201can elevated blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate.\u201d At the hospital, Borges underwent an x-ray and was discharged two hours later with instructions to treat the wound and to visit an orthopedic surgeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Borges also argues that the district court erroneously disregarded testimony from, his expert witnesses, but we disagree. In its order, the district court recounted that Borges\u2019s \u201cexpert witness Dr. Jan Pieter Hommen stated [in her deposition] that administering Rocephin [to guard against possible infection] was appropriate\u201d and that \u201cexpert witness nurse Michele Myers-Glower [testified] that administering the antibiotic Rocephin within three hours of [Borges] coming aboard the [Coast Guard vessel] complied with her understanding of the applicable nursing standard of care.\u201d Myers-Glower testified that it fell below the standard of care not to evacuate Borges within six hours of assessing his wound, but she stated on cross-examination that using saline to irrigate Borges\u2019s wound was proper; there was no evidence that the Coast Guard used any non-sterile equipment on Borges; the medical personnel closed Borges\u2019s wound with staples to prevent further injury in the event he was transported by boat; and physicians at the hospital did not detect that Borges\u2019s ankle was infected. Although a third expert, Dr. H. Barry Baker, an infectious disease specialist, testified that the decision not to immediately transfer Borges fell below the standard of care and that the delay was a primary factor in Borges\u2019s complications, the district court apparently discounted the doctor\u2019s testimony because he \u201cadmitted that he could not speak to the applicable standard of care aboard\u201d a Coast Guard vessel. Overall, the testimony of Borges\u2019s expert witnesses supported the finding that the treatment administered by the medical personnel was not the proximate cause of Borges\u2019s infection. <em>See Franza, </em>772 F.3d at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">We AFFIRM the judgment in favor of the United States.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
