The district court ruled that White\u2019s complaint was barred by the two-year statute of limitation for personal injuries. <em>See </em>Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 9-3-33. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">On July 19, 2013, White complained that he had been arrested without \u201cprobable cause or arrest warrants.\u201d White alleged that, on May 17, 2011, Hiers arrived at White\u2019s workplace to investigate a theft and that Hiers questioned White, seized a \u201chandgun [that White had stored] in his backpack, which was under [his] desk,\u201d and left. Later that day, Hiers arrested White for carrying a concealed weapon and then White was \u201cdetained [in jail] for several hours until he was released on bail.\u201d On January 10, 2012, the state court nol prossed the charge against White.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">The district court granted White\u2019s application to proceed in forma pauperis and reviewed his complaint to determine if it was frivolous. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). Later, the district court took judicial notice of the docket sheet in White\u2019s criminal case, which stated that on May 18, 2011, he had appeared before a magistrate judge and had been released on bond. The district court made a preliminary determination that White\u2019s complaint was untimely because his claim for false arrest had accrued on May 18, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-14\">White argued that he did not receive an \u201cinitial appearance hearing\u201d and that the statute of limitation did not commence running until he was arraigned on October 26, 2011. White submitted a copy of his bond, which stated that \u201c[n]o preliminary hearing will be held in cases where the accused has posted bond\u201d unless requested in writing. White also submitted a copy of the warrantless arrest affidavit that Hiers executed on May 17,2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-15\">Hiers and the City moved for summary judgment on the ground that White\u2019s complaint was untimely, and the district court granted the motion. The district court reasoned, based on <em>Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2001), that White\u2019s claim for false imprisonment accrued on May 18, 2011, when his \u201cbail [had been] set[ ], ... his detention had ended,\u201d and his \u201ccase was \u2018bound over\u2019 to the state court on the basis of [Hiers\u2019s] warrantless arrest affidavit.\u201d The district court ruled that White\u2019s complaint, which he filed in July 2013, was \u201coutside the two year statute of limitations period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-16\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b807-17\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s application of a statute of limitations and its grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.\u201d McCaleb v. </em>A.O. <em>Smith Corp., </em>200 F.3d 747, 750 (11th Cir. 2000). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">A claim for false arrest without a warrant accrues \u201cwhen the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action, that is, when the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.\u201d <em>Wallace, </em>549 U.S. at 388, 127 S.Ct. 1091 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Because a false arrest without a warrant \u201cis a species of\u2019 false imprisonment, in order \u201cto determine the beginning of the limitations period [for a warrantless false arrest], [a court] must determine when [the plaintiffs] false imprisonment came to an end.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388, 389, 127 S.Ct. 1091. \u201cReflective of the fact that a false imprisonment consists of detention without legal process, a false imprisonment ends once the [plaintiff] becomes held pursuant to such process\u2014 when, for example, he is bound over by a magistrate or arraigned on charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 127 S.Ct. 1091.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">White\u2019s claim for false arrest accrued on May 18, 2011. As the district court stated, White was held pursuant to \u201c\u2018legal process\u2019 ,.. no later than May 18, 2011.\u201d On that date, a magistrate judge reviewed White\u2019s charges to fix the amount of his bond and he was released on bail. White was bound over for arraignment under bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The district court did not err by entering summary judgment against White\u2019s complaint about a false arrest. Georgia law, which provides the governing statute of limitation, provides that \u201c[a]etions for injuries to the person shall be brought within two years after the right of action accrues.\u201d Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 9-3-33. White had two years from May 18, 2011, when he became held pursuant to legal process, to commence an action for false arrest. White waited more than two years, until July 19, 2013, to file his complaint. White\u2019s complaint against Hiers and the City was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">White argues that legal process did not begin until either September 30, 2011, when he was charged by accusation, or October 26, 2011, when he was arraigned, but these arguments fail. Even if we were to accept as true White\u2019s assertion that he was entitled to an \u201cinitial appearance hearing\u201d after being charged by accusation, that fact would not affect when his claim for false arrest accrued. And, as the district court stated, the date of White\u2019s arraignment was of no moment because \u201carraignment is not the only \u2018legal process\u2019 that can signal when the limitations period begins to accrue.\u201d The Court in <em>Wallace </em>did not provide an exhaustive list of situations that constitute the initiation of legal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of Officer Hiers and the City of Riverdale.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
