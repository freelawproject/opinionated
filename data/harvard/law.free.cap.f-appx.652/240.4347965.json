On April 19, 2014, Silva h\u00e1d removed approximately thirty family pictures from a wall inside her home and intentionally burned the photos on the tile floor of her living room. As a result, smoke filled the room. Observing no flames and believing that the fire was extinguished, Silva opened the back door of the house to help disperse the smoke and moved to the back patio. Thereafter, Silva heard a smoke alarm activate within her house, and returning inside, Silva observed that the ceiling had. been discolored by smoke. Silva disabled the smoke alarm, disposed of the alarm in the garbage, and opened the \u2018front door because smoke was still present within the house. She then exited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>her home and went to her car, which was parked directly in front of the house. At some time later,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Silva noticed that her home was on fire, and she called emergency services. The fire department arrived and extinguished the fire, but not before the fire caused damage to the home and its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Silva submitted a claim to Plaintiff-Ap-pellee Garrison Property and Casualty Company (Garrison) for the policy limits on her homeowner\u2019s insurance policy, totaling more than $75,000. Garrison thereafter filed the present action in federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, seeking a declaratory judgment on its liability for insurance coverage for the fire damage to Silva\u2019s home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 2, 2015, Garrison moved for summary judgment, arguing that Silva\u2019s claim was not covered by the insurance policy because the loss was not \u201csudden or accidental.\u201d The district court granted the motion, finding that Silva could not demonstrate that she suffered a covered loss because the conflagration that damaged her home was not \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d The district court thereafter entered final judgment in favor of Garrison, and Silva timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>\u201capplying the same standard as the district court.\u201d <em>Johnston &amp; Johnston v. Conseco Life Ins. Co., </em>732 F.3d 555, 561 (5th Cir. 2013). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \u201cA genuine dispute as to a material fact exists \u2018if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rogers v. Bromac Title Servs., L.L.C., </em>755 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir. 2014) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). And we construe all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Johnston &amp; Johnston, </em>732 F.3d at 561. \u201cIn diversity cases, this court applies the substantive law of the forum state, Mississippi.\u201d <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. LogistiCare Solutions, LLC, </em>751 F.3d 684, 688 (5th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">Silva contends that the district court, in finding that her loss was not covered by the insurance policy, resolved .several genuine disputes of material fact relating to whether the loss of the house as a result of the fire was \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d \u201c \u2018Under Mississippi law a plaintiff has the burden of proving a right to recover under the insurance policy sued on,\u2019 and this basic burden never shifts from the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Broussard v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>523 F.3d 618, 625 (5th Cir. 2008) (quoting <em>Britt v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>566 F.2d 1020, 1022 (5th Cir. 1978)). \u201cThe interpretation of insurance policy language is a question of law.\u201d <em>Robichaux v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>81 So.3d 1030, 1035 (Miss. 2011). In the present matter, the insurance policy covered \u201c \u2018sudden and accidental\u2019, direct, physical loss to tangible property described in [the insurance policy].\u201d And the contract unambiguously defines the term \u201csudden and accidental\u201d as \u201can abrupt, fortuitous event which is unintended from the perspective of a reasonable person.\u201d <em>See Lewis v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>730 So.2d 65, 68 (Miss. 1998) (holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>that \u201cwhen the words of an insurance policy are plain and unambiguous, the court will afford them their plain, ordinary meaning and will apply them as written\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">On appeal, Silva points to a number of alleged factual disputes purportedly resolved by the district court. All of those alleged disputes relate to her deposition testimony that she believed the fire she started by burning her photos was extinguished and that the subsequent fire affecting her home was \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, Silva has failed to offer any evidence supporting that assertion. <em>See Forsyth v. Barr, </em>19 F.3d 1527, 1533 (5th Cir. 1994) (\u201c[Unsubstantiated assertions are not competent summary judgment evidence,\u201d). Such unsupported assertions in \u201cdeposition testimony setting forth ultimate or conclusory facts and conclusions of law are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Clark v. America\u2019s Favorite Chicken Co., </em>110 F.3d 295, 297 (5th Cir. 1997). Having considered the entire record, Silva has failed to present sufficient evidence to raise a genuine dispute that the fire that destroyed her home was \u201csudden and accidental\u201d and, thus, covered under the insurance policy. The district court consequently did not err in granting Garrison\u2019s summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\">. In her deposition, Silva stated that she may have fallen asleep in her car.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\">. Silva asserted counterclaims for breach of contract and bad faith. The district court granted summary judgment for Garrison on Silva\u2019s counterclaims, and Silva does not challenge that determination on appeal. <em>See SEC v. Recite, </em>10 F.3d 1093, 1096 (5th Cir. 1993) (''[I]ssues not raised at all are waived.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b264-7\">. Silva also contends that the district court improperly resolved a factual dispute when the court stated that Silva \"sat in her car (perhaps napping) while the smoke aired out of the house.\" However, the district court never made an express finding that Silva was asleep and, instead, was only referencing Silva\u2019s own testimony that she thought she may have fallen asleep.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
