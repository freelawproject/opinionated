Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion, while the court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Amendment 784 amended U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l), which was inapplicable to the calculation of Mincy\u2019s guidelines range. U.S, Sentencing Guidelines Manual, supp. to app. C, Amendment 784, at 77 (2015). Insofar as the amendment clarified what constituted relevant conduct for a \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) enhancement, Mincy\u2019s offense level did not run afoul of that clarification. Mincy has not shown that his appeal involves a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
