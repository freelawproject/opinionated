On appeal, Madrid-Manzo argues that his sentence is unreasonable. Having considered the parties\u2019 briefs and reviewed the record, we find no abuse of discretion by the district court. The record shows that the court properly based its sentence on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors after fully considering the parties\u2019 arguments at sentencing. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir. 2010). We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In so doing, we ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error and then examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. This examination includes an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the district court must impose a sentence sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes set forth therein, including promoting respect for the law, providing just punishment for the offense, deterring criminal conduct, and protecting the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The court is also instructed to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-14\">On appeal, Madrid-Manzo argues that his sentence was greater than necessary to comply with the purposes set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and that a sentence in the range of 15-21 months would have been more reasonable. He also contends that he readily admitted his guilt, and, therefore, should have received a shorter sentence. Finally, he avers that the district court placed too much emphasis on his failure to present himself in a timely manner for his first sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-15\">These arguments do not persuade us that the district court abused its discretion. In the proceedings below, the court explained the \u00a7 3553(a) factors it relied on when imposing the sentence, describing how those factors supported the sentence it selected. The court stated that it took into account Madrid-Manzo\u2019s arguments, his apology, his lengthy criminal history, the circumstances of his arrest, his likelihood of reoffending, the seriousness of his offense, and the objectives of punishment, deterrence, and incapacitation. These are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>proper considerations under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. The court was free to consider any information relevant to Madrid-Manzo\u2019s character and conduct, including his failure to appear at his first sentencing hearing. And it was within the court\u2019s discretion to give that factor more weight than others. <em>See United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir. 2007) (noting that the weight given to any \u00a7 3553(a) factor is \u201ccommitted to the sound discretion of the district court\u201d (internal quotation mark omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Moreover, the record reflects that the district court emphasized other, additional factors during sentencing, including Madrid-Manzo\u2019s lengthy criminal history and his risk of reoffending, which are also factors properly within the district court\u2019s discretion to consider and weigh. Hence, the district court here concluded that a 37-month sentence was appropriate based on its weighing the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and we will not reweigh those factors in the absence of clear error. <em>See id. </em>Finally, the sentence the court chose to impose was within the applicable advisory guideline range of 30-37 months and well below the statutory maximum of 10 years, which are both strong indicia of the sentence\u2019s reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alvarado, </em>808 F.3d 474, 496 (11th Cir. 2015); <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">For these reasons, Madrid-Manzo has not persuaded us that his 37-month sentence is unreasonable, and we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
