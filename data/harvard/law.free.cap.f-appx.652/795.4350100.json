A.L. and P.L.B. filed a complaint in district court against Jackson alleging various violations of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, and the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The district court dismissed the complaint, Jackson moved for sanctions, and the court granted Jackson\u2019s motion. This appeal followed. After thorough review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in granting Jackson\u2019s motion for sanctions. We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b818-17\">While attending school at Jackson, A.L. qualified as a student with a disability under the IDEA and Section 504. Beginning in 2010, A.L. and P.L.B. initiated three due process hearings against Jackson, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that Jackson failed to provide A.L. a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in violation of the IDEA and Section 504.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Two of those hearings remained pending when A.L. and P.L.B. filed their district court complaint. The only completed hearing concerned a request by A.L. and P.L.B. for injunctive relief. Specifically, they sought an order requiring Jackson to provide A.L. certain special education services during the pen-dency of the remaining two due process hearings. In June 2012, the presiding ALJ denied A.L,\u2019s and P.L.B.\u2019s request for in-junctive relief, finding that \u201c[ojnly the civil courts have [the] power and authority [to grant injunctive relief] and [AL.\u2019s and P.L.B.\u2019s] remedy lies there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-18\">A.L. and P.L.B. filed their district court complaint in September 2012. In the complaint, they raised claims for (1) injunctive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>relief under the IDEA and Section 504,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) declaratory relief based on the First Amendment, (3) denial of FAPE, (4) Section 504 discrimination, and (5) retaliation under the IDEA and Section 504. Th\u00e9 district court dismissed all of these claims because it found that A.L. and P.L.B. failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Thereafter, Jackson moved for Rule 11 sanctions. In considering the motion, the district court determined that <em>CP v. Leon County School </em>Board<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> precluded all of A.L.\u2019s and P.L.B.\u2019s claims and that A.L.\u2019s and P.L.B.\u2019s counsel represented the plaintiff in <em>CP. </em>Based solely on these findings, the court concluded that A.L.\u2019s and P.L.B.\u2019s counsel knowingly filed a legally frivolous complaint on their behalf, thus warranting sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s award of Rule 11 sanctions for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Massengale v. Ray, </em>267 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir. 2001) (per curiam). \u201cA district court ruling based on an erroneous interpretation of the law or a clearly erroneous reading of the evidence would constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Attwood v. Singletary, </em>105 F.3d 610, 612 (11th Cir. 1997) (per curiam); <em>see also Indus. Risk Insurers v. M.A.N. Gutehoffnungsh\u00fctte GmbH, </em>141 F.3d 1434, 1448 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">When faced with a motion for Rule 11 sanctions, a district court must determine \u201cwhether the [non-movant]\u2019s claims are objectively frivolous\u201d and \u201cwhether the person who signed the pleadings should have been aware that they were frivolous.\u201d <em>See Baker v. Alderman, </em>158 F.3d 516, 524 (11th Cir. 1998). In other words, the \u201cstandard for testing conduct under Rule 11 is \u2018reasonableness under the circumstances\u2019 and \u2018what was reasonable to believe at the time\u2019 the pleading was submitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSanctions may be appropriate when the plain language of an applicable statute and the case law preclude relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cHowever, the purpose of Rule 11 is to deter frivolous lawsuits and not to deter novel legal arguments or cases of first impression.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The dismissal of an action, \u201cin and of itself, does not mean that an action is frivolous or warrants the imposition of sanctions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">A district court may award Rule 11 sanctions \u201c(1) when a party files a pleading that has no reasonable factual basis; (2) when the party files a pleading that is based on a legal theory that has no reasonable chance of success and that cannot be advanced as a reasonable argument to change existing law; or (3) when the party files a pleading in bad faith for an improper purpose.\u201d <em>Massengale, </em>267 F.3d at 1301 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the district court granted Jackson\u2019s motion for sanctions because it concluded that A.L.\u2019s and P.L.B.\u2019s pleading had no reasonable chance of success under controlling <em>precedent </em>\u2014 CP.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">A.L. and P.L.B. argue that their complaint was not frivolous because <em>CP </em>did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>preclude their claim for injunctive relief. As such, they assert that the district court abused its discretion in granting Jackson\u2019s motion for sanctions. We agree. The district court\u2019s determination that <em>CP </em>rendered A.L.\u2019s and P.L.B.\u2019s request for an injunction frivolous was \u201cbased on an erroneous interpretation of the law.\u201d <em>See Attwood, </em>105 F.3d at 612. And, under the record before us, there is no alternative basis to support a finding that the request was \u201cobjectively frivolous\u201d and that A.L.\u2019s and P.L.B.\u2019s counsel \u201cshould have been aware that [it] w[as] frivolous.\u201d <em>See Baker, </em>158 F.3d at 524. Therefore, the court abused its discretion in concluding that A.L.\u2019s and P.L.B\u2019s pleading had no reasonable chance of success. <em>See Attwood, </em>105 F.3d at 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\"><em>CP </em>had no bearing on the viability of A.L.\u2019s and P.L.B.\u2019s request for an injunction because <em>CP </em>addressed a different type of legal claim: a merits-based IDEA claim. <em>See Sierra Club v. Ga. Power Co., </em>180 F.3d 1309, 1310 (11th Cir. 1999) (per curiam) (When considering a request for an injunction, \u201cwe do not review the intrinsic merits of the case.\u201d). In <em>CP, </em>the plaintiff-student claimed that the defendant-school board denied him FAP\u00c9 by failing to update his educational placement while the parties were litigating a prior IDEA action. <em>See </em>483 F.3d at 1156-57. Hence, the issue presented in <em>CP </em>was whether the school board previously violated the student\u2019s IDEA rights. <em>See id. </em>Based on the IDEA\u2019S \u201cstay-put\u201d provision, we found no such violation. <em>See id. </em>at 1158. Under that provision, \u201cduring the pendency of any [IDEA] proceedings ... unless the [school board] and the parents [or student] otherwise agree, the child shall remain in [his] then-current educational placement ... until all such proceedings have been completed.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1156 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the student and the school, board were unable to agree to a new educational placement while the relevant IDEA proceedings were pending, we concluded that the school board \u201cproperly maintained [the student\u2019s] placement under the stay-put [provision].\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 115&amp;</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">In contrast to the student in <em>CP, </em>A.L. and P.L.B. sought an injunction in an effort to obtain allegedly critical educational services for A.L. while an ALJ considered the merits of their IDEA and related claims. Although the basis for this claim, like the claim in <em>CP, </em>arose during the pendency of IDEA proceedings, this claim did not present a question as to whether Jackson denied A.L. FAPE while the stay-put provision was in effect. Instead, it required a determination as to (1) whether A.L. and P.L.B. had a \u201csubstantial likelihood of success\u201d with respect to their underlying IDEA claims; (2) whether A.L. would have suffered \u201cirreparable injury\u201d without the immediate injunctive relief sought; (3) whether the \u201cthreatened injury\u201d to A.L. outweighed the damage the injunction would have caused Jackson; and (4) whether the injunction would have been \u201cadverse to the public interest.\u201d <em>See McDonald\u2019s Corp. v. Robertson, </em>147 F.3d 1301, 1306 (11th Cir. 1998) (summarizing the standard for injunctive relief). Thus, <em>CP </em>considered a legal question distinct from the question presented by A.L.\u2019s and P.L.B.\u2019s claim for an injunction, and <em>CP </em>did not control the claim. The district court committed legal error in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">Putting aside <em>CP, </em>the record before us does not offer any alternative grounds to uphold the district court\u2019s decision. Jackson' argues that, regardless as to whether <em>CP </em>is controlling, we should affirm the decision because A.L.\u2019s and P.L.B.\u2019s request for an injunction was objectively frivolous in that it clearly did not meet the \u201csubstantial likelihood of success\u201d prong of the injunction standard. However, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>no basis in the record to support such a finding. Given that Jackson never raised this argument before the district court and the court dismissed all of A.L.\u2019s and P.L.B.\u2019s claims due to a failure to exhaust, the record is devoid of information related to the merits of the injunction claim. In addition, even assuming the district court could have found that the claim was frivolous based on the \u201csubstantial likelihood of success\u201d prong, the record provides no support for a finding that A.L.\u2019s and P.L.B.\u2019s counsel \u201cshould have been aware\u201d of that frivolity. <em>See Baker, </em>158 F.3d at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">A.L.\u2019s and P.L.B.\u2019s request for an injunction also was not objectively frivolous based on exhaustion grounds. The ALJ ruled on the request in its June 2012 order and the order explicitly stated that the proper forum for A.L. and P.L.B. to pursue injunctive relief was civil court. Moreover, although our circuit has yet to address in a published opinion whether a request like A.L.\u2019s and P.L.B.\u2019s is improper under the IDEA\u2019S exhaustion requirement, several of our sister circuit have determined that such a request is permissible. <em>See, e.g., Doe v. Brookline Sch. Comm., </em>722 F.2d 910, 912, 917 (1st Cir. 1983) (reaffirming that a party seeking to depart from the \u201cstatus quo\u201d \u201cpending [IDEA] review\u201d can move for a preliminary injunction); <em>Digre v. Roseville Sch. Indep. Dist. No. 628, </em>841 F.2d 245, 251 (8th Cir. 1988) (The family can \u201cinvoke[e] the general equitable powers of the district court under the [IDEA] to grant preliminary injunctive relief to protect [the student] from irreparable harm.\u201d); <em>Johnson ex rel. Johnson v. Special Educ. Hearing Office, </em>287 F.3d 1176, 1180 (9th Cir. 2002) (per curiam) (examining a student\u2019s request for an injunction).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Accordingly, the district court abused its discretion in granting Jackson\u2019s motion for sanctions. <em>See Indus. Risk Insurers, </em>141 F.3d at 1450 (holding that the district court abused its discretion in awarding sanctions because its decision was based on an erroneous interpretation of a relevant order).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-11\">.
