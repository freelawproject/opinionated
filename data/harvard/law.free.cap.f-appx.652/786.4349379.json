Ricardo Eloi apr proached the car, pulled out a gun, and ordered Rivera out of the vehicle. After taking Rivera\u2019s phone, Ricardo Eloi told him to open the trunk. As Rivera complied, Ricardo Eloi\u2019s fellow assailants, Stanley Fleurant and Ricky Eloi,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>- came out of the shadows. Together, the three men attempted to push Rivera into the trunk of his car. When Rivera resisted and pleaded to be let go in exchange for his money and other personal items, Ricky Eloi hit him over the head with a gun and one of the three said, \u201cjust shoot him already.\u201d As Ricardo Rivera heard the click of a gun, the police arrived and his assailants fled. The police quickly apprehended all three in the surrounding neighborhood and recovered the gun used in the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">For their involvement in the May 15 incident, Fleurant and Ricardo Eloi were charged with attempted carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119, and brandishing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ricardo Eloi pleaded guilty to both counts. Fleurant proceeded to trial. At the close of the government\u2019s case-in-chief, Fleurant moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for attempted carjacking. The district court denied that motion and the jury found him guilty of both counts. The district court imposed consecutive sentences on Fleurant of 108 months for attempted carjacking' and 84 months for brandishing a firearm. It imposed consecutive sentences on Ricardo Eloi of 180 months for attempted carjacking and 84 months for brandishing a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">Fleurant and Ricardo Eloi both appealed. Fleurant challenges his conviction and sentence, while Ricardo Eloi challenges only his sentence. Fleurant contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Both Fleurant and Ricardo Eloi contend that their sentences are unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">Fleurant first contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal. Rule 29 provides that \u201cthe court on the defendant\u2019s motion must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a). We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 29 motion. United States v. Willner, 795 F.3d 1297, 1307 (11th Cir.2015). In doing so, \u201c[w]e resolve all reasonable inferences and credibility evaluations in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict and ask whether any reasonable juror could have found [the defendant] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119 makes it a crime for one \u201cwith the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm [to] take[] a motor vehicle that has been transported, shipped, or received in interstate or foreign commerce from the person or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation, or [to] attempt[ ] to do so.\u201d See also United States v. Diaz, 248 F.3d 1065, 1096 (11th Cir.2001) (enumerating the elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>of carjacking under \u00a7 2119). Fleurant argues that the evidence does not establish that he attempted to \u201ctake\u201d Rivera\u2019s car. He asserts, for example, that he and his fellow assailants never demanded the car, they never entered the car, and they never attempted to take Rivera\u2019s car key, which presumably would have been necessary to take the car itself. As a result, Fleurant says, the evidence shows only that he attempted to take Rivera\u2019s personal belongings, not his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Viewing the evidence in the' light most favorable to the government, as we must, the evidence was sufficient to establish that Fleurant attempted to take Rivera\u2019s car. A reasonable jury could conclude from the circumstances that taking Rivera\u2019s phone and putting him in the trunk of his car was merely a prelude to taking the car itself, which was interrupted by the arrival of police. That Conclusion is bolstered by the fact that Fleurant and his fellow assailants never demanded Rivera\u2019s, money or other possessions, aside from the phone, and even ignored Rivera\u2019s offers to give them anything he had. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Fleurant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Fleurant next contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion and the defendant bears the burden of showing that the sentence is unreasonable. United States v. Kuhlman, 711 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2013). When imposing a sentence, the district court must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion when it (1) fails to afford consideration to relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors.\u201d United States v. Campa, 459 F.3d 1121, 1174 (11th Cir.2006) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Fleurant argues that the district court failed to appropriately consider two \u00a7 3553(a) factors: first, \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1); and second, \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities,\u201d id. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Fleurant maintains that the court failed to consider his limited role in the .carjacking as well as other potentially mitigating personal characteristics, which resulted in an unwarranted disparity between his sentence and the sentence of his codefendant, Ricky Eloi. Fleurant received a 108-month sentence with respect to his conviction for attempted carjacking, while Ricky Eloi received a 57-month sentence for the same conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">We have stated that \u201cthere can be no \u2018unwarranted\u2019 sentencing disparities among codefendants who are not similarly situated.\u201d United States v. Azmat, 805 F.3d 1018, 1048 (11th Cir.2015); see also United States v. Regueiro, 240 F.3d 1321, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cDisparity between the sentences imposed on codefen-dants.is generally not an appropriate basis for relief on appeal.\u201d). For example, a difference in sentences is not unwarranted \u201cwhen a cooperating defendant pleads guilty and receives a lesser sentence than a defendant who proceeds to trial.\u201d United States v. Langston, 590 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). That is true \u201ceven when a cooperating defendant receives a \u2018substantially shorter\u2019 sentence than a defendant who goes to trial.\u201d United States v. Cavallo, 790 F.3d 1202, 1237 (11th Cir.2015). Codefendants are also not similarly situated when they have different criminal histo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>ries. See United States v. Holt, 777 F.3d 1234, 1270 (11th Cir.2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Ricky Eloi and Fleurant received different sentences, but they were not similarly situated. Ricky Eloi pleaded guilty, while Fleurant proceeded to trial. Their different criminal histories also led to different offense levels and different sentencing ranges under the guidelines. Because they were not similarly situated, the difference in sentences was not unwarranted. See Langston, 590 F.3d at 1237; Cavallo, 790 F.3d at 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Like Fleurant, Ricardo Eloi contends that his sentence is unreasonable. He first challenges the district court\u2019s two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, which served as the basis for the court\u2019s denial of a two-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s determination about whether a defendant obstructed justice only for clear error and we will not find clear error unless our review of the record leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d United States v. Poirier, 321 F.3d 1024, 1035 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted). The sentencing guidelines list as an example of obstructing justice \u201cproviding materially false information to a judge or magistrate judge.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n.4(F). The guidelines further define \u201cmaterial\u201d information as information that, \u201cif believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n.6. For sentencing purposes, \u201cthe threshold for materiality is conspicuously low.\u201d United States v. Dedeker, 961 F.2d 164, 167 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">At his change of plea hearing, Ricardo Eloi told the magistrate judge that he did not possess a firearm during the offense. At sentencing, the district court found that statement was materially false because he had possessed a gun during the offense. Ricardo Eloi does not now dispute that his statement was false. He asserts only that the statement was not material because it would not have affected the magistrate judge\u2019s decision to accept or reject his change of plea. But the statement would have been relevant to other judicial determinations, such as sentencing, and it would, if believed, have tended to affect those determinations. So it was material. See United States v. Campa, 529 F.3d 980, 1017 (11th Cir.2008) (finding that a sentence adjustment \u201cwas appropriate whether or not significant hindrance occurred\u201d when the defendant provided false information to a magistrate judge at a detention hearing). The district court did not err in applying an enhancement for obstruction of justice and denying a decrease for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Ricardo Eloi next contends that the district court erred in imposing a five-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3) based on the severity of his victim\u2019s injury. \u201cThe severity of a victim\u2019s injuries is a factual determination and thus reviewed for clear error.\u201d United States v. Price, 149 F.3d 352, 353 (5th Cir.1998). The guidelines provide for a four-level enhancement when the victim sustains a serious bodily injury, a six-level enhancement when the victim sustains a permanent or life-threatening injury, and a five-level enhancement when the victim sustains an injury that falls between serious bodily injury and permanent bodily injury. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(B), (C), (E). For sentencing purposes, \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d includes \u201cinjury involving extreme physical pain or ... requiring medical intervention.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n.l(L). By contrast,.\u201cpermanent bodily injury\u201d includes \u201can obvious disfigurement that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>likely to be permanent,\u201d id. \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n.l(J), and \u201cencompasses injuries that may not be terribly severe but are permanent,\u201d United States v. Torrealba, 339 F.3d 1238, 1246 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The district court imposed a five-level enhancement based on its finding that the victim, Rivera, suffered an injury that fell between serious bodily injury and permanent bodily injury. When Ricardo Eloi and his co-assailants attacked Rivera, they hit him in the head with a gun. The resulting laceration required Rivera to go to the hospital where he received stitches that left a scar. Based on photographic evidence as well as its own observation of Rivera in court a year after the attack, the district court determined that the scar constituted a permanent disfigurement. Based on the record before us, we cannot say the district court clearly erred in making that determination or imposing the five-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(E). To the contrary, based on the district court\u2019s findings, it conceivably might have been -within its discretion to impose a six-level enhancement for permanent bodily injury under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(C), but we need not decide that.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Finally, Ricardo Eloi argues that the district court did not properly consider the sentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Like Fleurant, he argues that the district court\u2019s improper weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors resulted in an unwarranted disparity between his sentence and the sentences of his codefen-dants. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). With respect to the attempted carjacking conviction, Ricardo Eloi received a sentence of 180 months, Fleurant received a sentence of 108 months, and Ricky Eloi received a sentence of 57 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">As we have already explained, however, a difference in the sentences of codefen-dants is not unwarranted when they are not similarly 'situated. See Azmat, 805 F.3d at 1048; Langston, 590 F.3d at 1237. The codefendants here were not similarly situated. The district court found that Ricardo Eloi, unlike his codefendants, had obstructed justice by providing a materially false statement to a magistrate judge. The district court also considered his violent criminal history, which involved assaults and weapons, that was not shared by his code-fendants. See Holt, 777 F.3d at 1270. Because Ricardo Eloi was not similarly situated to his codefendants, any sentencing disparity was not unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">Ricardo Eloi also asserts that the district court improperly weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by considering acquitted conduct related to a previous carjacking for which he was charged. To begin with, the district court may consider acquitted conduct \u201cso long as that conduct has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d United States v. Watts, 519 U.S. 148, 157, 117 S.Ct. 633, 638, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997); see also United States v. Faust, 456 F.3d 1342, 1347-48 (11th Cir. 2006). In this case, however, we don\u2019t have to get that far because there is no indication that the district court considered the acquitted conduct in reaching its sentencing decision. To the contrary, the transcript from the sentencing hearing indicates that the district court refrained from considering the acquitted conduct on the ground that \u201cthere was an issue with regard to misidentification, and that was clear from the jury\u2019s verdict [of acquittal].\u201d We therefore find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b810-6\">. Ricardo Eloi and Ricky Eloi are brothers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\">.
