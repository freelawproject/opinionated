Stat. \u00a7 768.16 <em>et seq. </em>Luis Antonio Valdivia, a Sears employee, drove his personal vehicle to a bank during his morning break, failed to put the vehicle in park before climbing out, and hit Ms. Morera when, in attempting to stop the vehicle, he pressed the accelerator instead of the brake. The district court ruled that Sears was not vicariously liable for Valdi-via\u2019s conduct because it occurred outside the scope of his employment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-14\">Sears employed Valdivia as an assistant manager at its auto center in Hialeah, Florida. Valdivia\u2019s salaried position entailed \u201cmanaging the Auto Center and Associates\u201d to \u201censure[] consistent, timely and accurate service delivery to customers.\u201d On December 18, 2012, Valdivia arrived at the auto center earlier than usual, about ten minutes after 6:00 a.m., to help admit a crew to clean the store before it opened for customers around 8:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-15\">Around 7:20 a.m., Valdivia took a morning break and drove approximately one-half a mile to a bakery to purchase breakfast. He drove to the parking lot of a bank and ate his breakfast while listening to the radio. Valdivia failed to shift the transmission to park, and when he climbed out of his vehicle, it began to roll forward. Valdi-via returned to his vehicle, but pressed the gas pedal inadvertently and struck Ms. Morera.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-16\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo. Williams v. Obstfeld, </em>814 F.3d 1270, 1275 (11th Cir. 2002). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-17\">Under Florida law, which the parties agree applies, \u201c[a]n employer may be vi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>cariously liable to third parties under the principle of respondeat superior for damages and injuries caused by its employee\u2019s negligent acts which are committed within the scope and course of his employment.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Godfather\u2019s Pizza, Inc., </em>570 So.2d 1351, 1353-54 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1990). An employee acts \u201cwithin the scope of his employment ... only if (1) the conduct is of the kind the employee is hired to perform, (2) the conduct occurs substantially within the time and space limits authorized or required by the work to be performed, and (3) the conduct is activated at least in part by a purpose to serve the master.\u201d <em>Sussman v. Fla. E. Coast Props., Inc., </em>557 So.2d 74, 75-76 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1990). \u201c[F]or an employer to be vicariously liable ..., the employee\u2019s conduct must in some way further the interests of the employer or be motivated by those interests.\u201d <em>Bennett, </em>570 So.2d at 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The district court did not err by entering summary judgment in favor of Sears. Sears was not vicariously liable for Valdi-via\u2019s conduct because it was not \u201csomething [his] employment contemplated.\u201d <em>See Weiss v. Jacobson, </em>62 So.2d 904, 906 (Fla. 1953). As the district court stated, \u201c[t]he act of eating breakfast and listening to the radio in his personal vehicle while on a personal break approximately one-half mile away from the Auto Center was not the kind of conduct Mr. Valdivia was hired to perform as Auto Center Assistant Manager, did not occur within the time and space limits authorized or required by the work to b\u00e9 performed and was not activated by a purpose to serve [Sears].\u201d Similar to the spa employee in <em>Sussman </em>who was acting outside the scope of her employment when she struck a pedestrian after deviating five blocks from her normal route to work to purchase a birthday cake at her manager\u2019s request, 557 So.2d at 76, Valdivia\u2019s accident occurred during a personal break. Morera argues that Sears is liable because Valdivia was \u201con call at all times ... during business hours,\u201d but Val-divia\u2019s accessibility did not place the accident within the scope of his employment. Valdivia\u2019s supervisor, Jesus Santos, testified, without dispute, that if contacted about an emergency at the auto center, Valdivia would finish \u201cwhatever he was doing .., [before] go[ing] back [to] take care of the customer.\u201d Santos testified that when managers and assistant managers are at lunch or on a break, they are \u201con [their] own time\u201d and \u201c[t]he customer has to wait.\u201d Because Valdivia hit Ms. Morera while acting outside the scope of his employment, Sears was not legally responsible for the tragic mishap.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of Sears.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
