Bell was sentenced as a career offender under United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.1, but the offense level used to calculate his guideline range was derived using the drug-quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, because the \u00a7 2D1.1 offense level was greater than the offense level under the career-offender table. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (\u201c[I]f the offense level for a career offender from the table in this subsection is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the table in this subsection shall apply.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Relying on that quirk, Bell argues that he is eligible for a sentence reduction because Amendment 782, which lowered the base offense levels in the drug-quantity table, lowered the. guideline range on which his sentence was based. He also argues that, under current law, he is not a career offender because the prior convictions used to enhance his sentence no longer qualify as predicate crimes of violence. After careful review, we affirm the denial of Bell\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-12\">After a jury trial, Bell was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. Bell\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated his base offense level at 38 using the drug-quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). The PSR added a two-level increase for possession of a firearm and a two-level increase for obstruction of justice, yielding an adjusted offense level of 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-13\">The PSR also determined that Bell was a career offender, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, for having at least two prior felony convictions for crimes of violence. Relevant to this appeal, Bell had two Florida state convictions for carrying a concealed weapon. Due to his career-offender status, Bell\u2019s criminal history category rose from V to VI. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b) (\u201cA career offender\u2019s criminal history category in every case ... shall be Category VI.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-14\">Under the career-offender table, Bell\u2019s offense level was 37, because the statutory maximum penalty for Bell\u2019s instant convictions was life imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(l). However, because the offense level from the career-offender table (level 37) was less than the offense level for the underlying offense (level 42), the PSR followed the instructions of \u00a7 4B1.1(b) and used the greater of the two levels (level 42) to determine Bell\u2019s guideline range. This established a guideline range of 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>At Bell\u2019s sentencing in 2005, the district court overruled Bell\u2019s objection to the career-offender enhancement and stated that Bell \u201cqualif\u00ede[d] as a career offender.\u201d The court also overruled Bell\u2019s other objections to the PSR and adopted the guideline range calculated therein. The court sentenced Bell to a total term of 360 months in prison. We affirmed Bell\u2019s sentence on direct appeal, concluding that his two prior convictions for carrying a concealed weapon constituted crimes of violence and that the \u00a7 4B1.1 career-offender enhancement was properly applied. <em>United States v. Bell, </em>218 Fed.Appx. 885, 898-99 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In 2014, the Sentencing Commission issued Amendment 782, which further reduced the offense level for certain drug-trafficking offenses. In 2015, Bell filed the present counseled \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Bell argued that even though he was found to be a career offender, he was not sentenced as such, so he should be able to benefit from reductions to the drug-quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) on which his guideline range was based. He also noted that in 2008, this Court reversed its prior precedent, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), and held that \u201cthe crime of carrying a concealed firearm may no longer be considered a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1351-52 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The district court denied Bell\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The court agreed with the government that Bell was ineligible for a sentence reduction due to his career-offender status. The court, also noted that Bell could not challenge his status as a career offender in the limited \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. Bell now brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the Sentencing Guidelines and the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">A district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must recalculate the applicable guideline range by substituting only the amended guideline for the one originally used. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). \u201cAll other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain intact.\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">The overarching purpose of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is to \u201cgive[ ] the defendant an opportunity to receive the same sentence he would have received if the guidelines that applied at the time of his sentencing had been the same as the guidelines that applied after the amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012). In other words, the \u201cgoal is to treat a defendant sentenced before the amendment the same as those sentenced after the amendment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">A defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction if the retroactively applicable amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Therefore, \u201c[wjhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>tence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1328, 1330 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Here, the district court properly found that Bell was ineligible for a sentence reduction due to his career-offender status. It is undisputed that the court found Bell to be a career offender at his original sentencing, even if that determination now appears to be clearly erroneous. Therefore, we must re-apply the career-offender guideline, \u00a7 4B1.1, when determining the effect of Amendment 782. <em>See Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760. Section 4Bl.l(b) provides, in relevant part, \u201c[I]f the offense level for a career offender from the table in this subsection is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the table in this subsection shall apply.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). The career-offender table sets forth various offense levels based on the severity of the underlying offense, by reference to the maximum sentence authorized by statute. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">At Bell\u2019s original sentencing, the district court used the offense level \u201cotherwise applicable\u201d \u2014 the one calculated using \u00a7 2D1.1 \u2014 because it was greater than the career-offender offense level. <em>See id. </em>After Amendment 782, and assuming Bell\u2019s calculations are accurate, that is no longer the case. Bell\u2019s offense level under the career-offender table (level 37) is now greater than the offense level otherwise applicable (level 36). As a result, if Amendment 782 had been in effect at the time of Bell\u2019s original sentencing, the court would have used level 37 instead of level 36 to calculate his guideline range,- <em>See Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1206. Using an offense level of 37, along with the original criminal history category of VI, establishes the same guideline range of 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. Accordingly, Bell is not eligible for a reduction because, while Amendment 782 reduced his base offense level, the amendment did not have the effect of lowering his applicable guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Bell contends that re-applying the career-offender guideline, when it clearly no longer applies under <em>Archer, </em>violates the goal of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which is \u201cto treat a defendant sentenced before the amendment the same as those sentenced after the amendment.\u201d <em>Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1206. He asserts that a defendant today \u201cwith the same record as Mr. Bell would not be sentenced as a career offender.\u201d True enough, but Bell\u2019s argument misunderstands the limited scope of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">The Supreme Court has made clear, consistent with our long-settled precedent, that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not authorize a sentencing or resentencing proceeding.\u201d <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 825, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2690, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. Rather, the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is limited to determining the effect, and potentially giving the defendant the benefit, of a retroactively applicable amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines, leaving all other original sentencing decisions unchanged. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. In that way, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) permits courts to treat defendants who were sentenced both before and after the amendment the same, but only with respect to that specific, retroactively applicable amendment. <em>See Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1206 (\u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is to give a defendant the benefit of a retroactively applicable amendment to the guidelines.\u201d). Treating Bell the same as a similarly situated defendant sentenced today in <em>all </em>respects would convert the limited proceeding authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) into a full resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">While we understand Bell\u2019s efforts to achieve some relief from his career-offender status, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>the relief he seeks. Section 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues\u201d such as his challenge to the application of the career-offender enhancement. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 782; <em>see Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 831, 130 S.Ct. at 2694 (under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), \u201cany mistakes committed at the initial sentencing are imposed anew if they are not corrected\u201d). The rule of lenity does not apply in these circumstances because the statute is not ambiguous. <em>See Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 825-27, 831, 130 S.Ct. at 2690-91, 2694.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In sum, we affirm the denial of Bell\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because, due to his status as a career offender, Amendment 782 did not have the effect of lowering his applicable guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
