The action was based on the theory of negligence and arose out of an intersection collision between two vehicles, in one of which plaintiff was a passenger. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>The intersection was controlled by an electrical traffic control signal. The defendant, Jesse Henderson, died before the trial, and the case was revived against his administratrix, Dorothy Henderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Defendant, appellant, hereinafter referred to as defendant, complains of error in the trial in ten respects:</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">1. That the verdict of the jury was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">2. That the verdict of the jury is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">3. That the verdict is unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">4. That the court erred in refusing to give instructions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 requested by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">5. That the verdict was inspired by passion and prejudice and was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">6. That the court erred in permitting testimony to be introduced pertaining to the birth of the child, when there was no claim made in the petition claiming any irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">7. The court erred in admitting evidence concerning the issuance of the summons to the defendant to prejudice decedent and impassion the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">8. The court erred in refusing to permit the blackboard, which was offered and admitted as an exhibit, to go to the jury room.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-13\">9. The court erred in permitting the answers to improper hypothetical questions submitted by plaintiff\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-14\">10. For errors in admission and exclusion of evidence and/or exhibits as shown by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-15\">We will first consider assignment of error No. 4. As to the first branch of this claim of error, special charge No. 1 requested by defendant and refused by the court reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-16\">\u2018\u00a3 The court instructs you that the driver of a motor vehicle has the right to proceed across an intersection if any portion of his car has entered into the intersection while the traffic signal at such intersection is either green or yellow (caution) for traffic in a direction in which he is moving.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-17\">\u00a3\u00a3I therefore say to you, that if any part of defendant\u2019s vehicle entered into the intersection of East 79th Street and Quincy Avenue, going in a westerly direction at a time when the traffic control signal at said intersection was either green or yellow (caution) that the defendant had a right to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>operating his vehicle across said intersection without interruption.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">This request for a special charge is not a correct statement of the law in view of the provisions of Section 4511.13, Revised Code, and the state of the evidence regarding the entering of decedent\u2019s vehicle into the intersection. The trial court properly refused this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The second branch of defendant\u2019s claim of error No. 4 relates to the failure of the trial court to give the following special request of defendant to charge before argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">\u201cI charge you, ladies and gentlemen, that the law requires plaintiff to prove all material elements of plaintiff\u2019s case by a preponderance of all the evidence. This includes proof of the injuries claimed to have been sustained and their proximate causal relationship to the accident set forth in plaintiff\u2019s petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">\u201cSo if you find by a preponderance of all the evidence in favor of the plaintiff, you will in considering damages consider only those damages which have been proven by a preponderance of all the evidence to be caused proximately by the accident and exclude any injuries or physical defects which have not been proven by the preponderance of all of the evidence to be proximately caused by said accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">This is a correct statement of the law pertinent to an issue in this case and should have been given by the trial court. There was a conflict of medical testimony in the record as to whether or not a ganglion which appeared on the back of plaintiff\u2019s right hand at the wrist some months after the accident was proximately caused by said accident. It was removed surgically by a surgeon approximately nine months after the accident. The surgeon testified that his physical examination prior to surgery revealed a two centimeter mass at that point on the hand. The report of the operation in the hospital stated that the incision of one inch plus was made over a one centimeter mass. The same surgeon testified that in his opinion, based upon a reasonable medical certainty, the accident was a proximate precipitating cause of the appearance of the ganglion on the connective tissue of plaintiff\u2019s right wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">An examining physician for defendant, who examined plaintiff on September 22, 1958, about a month and a half after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>accident, testified that he found no evidence at that time of any formation of a ganglion in or about the right wrist. He also testified that plaintiff told him that she had had some soreness about her forearm and wrist before he examined her. This physician, testifying as a witness for the defendant, gave as his expert opinion that the ganglion later discovered was not due to trauma sustained in the accident of August 4, 1958. The plaintiff received emergency treatment at Polyclinic Hospital after the accident on August 4, 1958, and the diagnosis at that time was \u201cslight muscle strain left side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">It is our determination that the failure to give this charge at defendant\u2019s request was prejudicially erroneous to the substantial rights of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The special charge requested by defendant and refused by the trial court which is the basis of branch No. 3 of this claim of error was correctly rejected by the trial judge because it was, in part, repetitive of the previous request quoted immediately above.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Going now to assignment of error No. 7, we find the following testimony in the reoord concerning the issuance of a traffic summons to the decedent after the accident by investigating police officers. The first excerpt is from the evidence given by patrolman John Yezerski of the Cleveland Police Department.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\"><em>( C </em>45s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. Officer, would you tell me what you did at the time of your investigation? A. On investigation, when we completed our investigation, we transferred Jesse Henderson # <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">\u201cMr. Opaskar: Objection. Just a minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">\u201cThe Court: Yes, you may tell in your own words, officer, just exactly what you did as you arrived at the scene, what you saw, what you heard, and then stop. Just in your own words you may tell what you did or saw or heard. You are limited to that. Because you were not there when it happened, were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">\u201cWitness: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-12\">\u201cThe Court: You were called by radio, I take it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-13\">\u201cWitness: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-14\">\u201cThe Court: Tell in your own words what you saw and heard while you were there. You are limited to that, now, by the rules. A. I issued a traffic summons - ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\u201cMr. Opaskar: I object to anything like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-3\">\u201cThe Court: What you saw and heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">\u2018 \u2018 Mr. Character: He is saying what he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">\u201cThe Court: That doesn\u2019t mean you are guilty because an officer gives a ticket. But I am telling you what you saw and heard now. Hold it down to that, position of cars, who you talked to there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">\u201cThe Witness: I can\u2019t recall now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">\u00cd\u00cd* # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">\u201cQ. I would like to ask you at this time, after refreshing your memory with the report, to tell me what you did at the scene of the accident or anything you now recall you did at that time. A. We interviewed both parties involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">\u201cThe Court: You and Schaefer together?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">\u2018 \u2018 The Witness: Patrolman Schaefer and myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-11\">\u201cThe Court: Were you together when you interviewed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-12\">\u2018 \u2018 The Witness: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-13\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Go on. A. And then patrolman Schaefer wrote out this report. While he was writing out the report I wrote out a traffic summons for - -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-14\">\u201cMr. Opaskar: Objection to any traffic summons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-15\">\u201cThe Court: Let it stand because it is not prejudicial. The fact he wrote a summons out means nothing, with having to do with the man\u2019s guilt or innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-16\">\u201cQ. You wrote out a summons to whom, officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-17\">\u201cMr. Opaskar: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-18\">\u201cA. Jesse Henderson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-19\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court: Let him show what he did now, means nothing to liability here, if anything, help the officer clarify what he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-20\">\u201cQ. You recall anything else you did at that time? A. No, sir, I cannot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-21\">Obviously, from that series of questions and answers and the colloquy between the court and counsel, the police officer believed that Jesse Henderson was at fault in the accident and issued a summons requiring him to appear in traffic court. The question as to where the fault lies in a civil case is the ultimate question for a jury to decide under proper instructions, and the opinion of a witness, directly or by implication, which in effect determines that question, is improper, and if permitted is prejudicially erroneous to the party against whom the opinion is directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>It is urged in plaintiff\u2019s brief that the court below ordered the jury to disregard the testimony as to what the officers did in issuing the summons and further ordered the same stricken from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">This is the pertinent excerpt in that regard from the testimony of the second police officer, patrolman Frank Schaefer, who followed patrolman Yezerski on the witness stand at the afternoon session of the trial on April 16, 1963:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">\u201cQ. Did you talk with the parties involved in the accident? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">\u201cQ. Did you talk with them together? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">\u201cQ. What else did you do at the time of the accident? A. In addition to making out the accident report form we issued a citation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">\u201cMr. Opaskar: Objection. Not trying a police court case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">\u201cThe Court: I know, but what the officers did, it is part of the whole. The fact a man was issued a citation---.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-10\">\u201cMr. Opaskar: Exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-11\">\u201cThe Court:---or the fact he was arrested has nothing to do with his guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-13\">\u201cMr. Opaskar: They are investigators, not judges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-14\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t think it is prejudicial. Anybody can be arrested whether or not guilty; is that true, officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-15\">\u201cThe Witness: That is very true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-16\">\u201cThe Court: Sure, that is the law. You got to be arrested and convicted. But it is true. I say that is what they did in that case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-17\">\u201cMr. Opaskar: Exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-18\">\u201cThe Court: They acted upon what they were told there. They didn\u2019t see it. So it is not prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-19\">\u201cQ. You may finish the statement you started before the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-20\">---. A. In addition to making the accident report we issued a citation to the driver of car---.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-22\">\u201cMr. Opaskar: Objection as to who he issued a citation to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-23\">\u201cThe Court: I will hear it, strike it out what they did. Jury will disregard it. Gentlemen, - - as my theory, but the jury could be influenced by that, but I said the fact that a man or woman is arrested has nothing to do with their guilt however.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-24\">\u201cMr. Character: Exception to the ruling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>In onr opinion, the prejudicial error in admitting the previous testimony of patrolman Yezersld was not cured by the trial court\u2019s statement made, as indicated, <em>supra, </em>in the course of patrolman Schaefer\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">Following the testimony of the two police officers and in connection with the plaintiff\u2019s case, plaintiff called as a witness, William H. Brewer, a deputy clerk in the Cleveland Municipal Court, Criminal Branch, who was one of several persons having custody of criminal court records and dockets. Interrogation on direct examination proceeded, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">\u201cQ. Have you, pursuant to a subpoena, brought with you the records pertaining to case No. 651,991, the same being City of Cleveland versus Jesse Henderson? A. I have the judge\u2019s docket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">\u201cQ. Judge\u2019s docket? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">\u201cQ. Would you explain to the jury what the judge\u2019s docket is, please ? A. This is a book in which the judge makes the entry, describing the finding, whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty, and the sentence that is imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">\u201cQ. Now calling your attention to September 22, 1958, is there an entry in the case that I have just referred to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">\u201cMr. Opaskar: Just yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">\u201cThe Court: Is there an entry? Yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-11\">\u201cA. The entry I have here \u2014 that is correct. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-12\">\u201cQ. Would you tell us what the entry is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-13\">\u201cMr. Opaskar: Objection. Wait a minute. Let me see it. I want to be heard on this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-14\">At this point there was an extended argument by counsel to the court out of the hearing of the jury. It was considered over night and the following morning the offer of witness Brewer\u2019s prospective testimony about a plea being entered on a judge\u2019s docket in the Cleveland Municipal Court in the case of City of Cleveland v. Jesse Henderson on September 22, 1958, was withdrawn by counsel for plaintiff. No explanation was given to the jury, and they were not instructed to disregard Brewer\u2019s preliminary testimony relating to that point. While a plea of guilty on behalf of the defendant, Jesse Henderson, to a charge of traffic violation in connection with the collision between the two cars, which is the subject of this lawsuit, would probably have been properly admissible as an admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>against interest, still the apparent effort to establish the fact of this plea as such admission was not handled properly. When witness Brewer\u2019s testimony is considered in connection with the police officer\u2019s testimony, we are constrained to conclude that the trial court permitted immaterial and irrelevant evidence to be heard by the jury which was prejudicial to defendant\u2019s substantial rights and constituted prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\">We find no error in considering the defendant\u2019s other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">For the reason stated, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b48-6\">Kovachy, P. J., and Artl, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
