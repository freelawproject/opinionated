Stevenson, a defendant in the trial court and the appellee here, was the managing editor, published the following article, upon which the suit for libel was based.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">\u201cPublicity and Tragedy Stalk Sheppard Case</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO\">\u201cBy Don Miller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">\u201cPublicity, discipline and tragedy continue to stalk the world famous Sheppard murder case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">\u201cWhile \u2018Dr. Sam\u2019 sits behind prison walls, the import of the July 4, 1954 murder continues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-8\">\u201cJuly 4, 1954 \u2014 Marilyn Sheppard battered to death; with her died an unborn child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">\u201cJanuary 7, 1955 \u2014 Mrs. Ethel Sheppard, Dr. Sam Sheppard\u2019s mother, shoots herself to death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-10\">\u201cJanuary 18, 1955 \u2014 Dr. Richard A.

But to me that was the real cause when Dr. Richard A. Sheppard died.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-4\">\u2018 \u2018 Stephen Sheppard has kept alive the sensationalism, adding to it at regular intervals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">\u201cWho will be his next victim?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The petition not only included the publication set out above, but pleaded the following innuendo:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">\u201cThat said publications were intended to convey to the community at large the impression that the plaintiff, Dr. Stephen Sheppard [a doctor of osteopathic medicine practicing in the circulating area of the newspaper], was responsible for the wrongful death of five people and that it was calculated to and did hold plaintiff up to public scorn, hatred and ridicule and that by such publication * * * [defendant] meant and intended to mean that plaintiff, Dr. Shephen Sheppard, was responsible for the untimely and wrongful deaths of five people and would continue to wrongfully cause the death of additional people and was so understood by readers of said publication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">It is the law in this state that if a publication is not libelous per se, such publication is not actionable in the absence of pleading and proof of special damages. An action for libel per quod can be maintained only with allegations and proof of special damages. <em>Cleveland Leader Printing Co. </em>v. <em>Nethersole, </em>84 Ohio St., 118, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 978. If a publication is libelous per se, special damages need to be neither pleaded nor proved for the maintenance of the action. In the case now under review, it is agreed by all counsel in oral argument and brief that special damages are not pleaded. In the appellant\u2019s brief appears this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">\u201cIt is * * * plaintiff-appellant\u2019s contention that the article in and of itself is libelous per se; that no innuendo is needed, and that, therefore, the plaintiff-appellant need not plead special damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">If, therefore, the article is not libelous per se, the action of the court in sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the petition was not error; to the contrary, if the article is libelous per se, the court erred and the judgment must be reversed, because the question of whether words of a publication are libelous per se or not is for the court and not a jury. <em>Mauk </em>v. <em>Brundage, </em>68 Ohio St., 89, 62 L. R. A., 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>It is generally accepted doctrine that words and phrases which are libelous per se carry the presumption of malice, falsity and damages, unless published on a privileged occasion, and that words and phrases which are libelous per se do not need an innuendo; and conversely, that words and phrases which need an innuendo are not libelous per se, but per quod. <em>Becker </em>v. <em>Toulmin, Jr., </em>165 Ohio St., 549; 53 Corpus Juris Secundum, 43, Libel and Slander, Section 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\">The pleader in the case before us plead an innuendo, which of course we must treat as surplusage, as our only question is whether the language of the published article itself constitutes libel per se without the innuendo. The innuendo cannot be used to aver a fact, introduce new matter, or alter, enlarge, extend or restrict the import of the language in the published article, <em>Becker </em>v. <em>Toulmin, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Pursuant to principles of law established by the courts of Ohio, this court is of the opinion that the published article is not libelous per se; and, since it is conceded that special damages were not pleaded in the petition, it was the duty of the trial court to sustain the demurrer and dismiss the petition. See: <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>The Beacon Journal Publishing Co., </em>66 Ohio App., 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b36-6\">Hunsicker, P. J., and Stevens, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
