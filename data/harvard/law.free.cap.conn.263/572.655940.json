Tarullo, appeals from the judgment of the trial court dismissing his appeal from the granting of a wetlands and watercourses permit in connection with a proposed residential subdivision in the town of Wolcott. He contends that the trial court improperly affirmed the decision of the named defendant, the inland wetlands and watercourses commission of the town of Wolcott (commission), because: (1) the commission failed properly to consider alternatives that would cause less or no environmental impact to the wetlands and watercourses, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41 (a) (2);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>(2) the commission\u2019s finding that there were no feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed wetlands and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>watercourses activity was not supported by substantial evidence in the record. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The defendant Chestnut Wolcott, LLC (developer), applied to the commission for a wetlands and watercourses permit in conjunction with a residential subdivision that it proposed for certain property located south of Spindle Hill Road in Wolcott (site). The site consists of approximately eighty-one acres of land adjacent to Chestnut Hill Reservoir (lake).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The proposed development of the site requires some activity in the wetlands and watercourses on the site. The plaintiff owns real property that abuts the site. He intervened in the proceedings before the commission pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and later appealed from the commission\u2019s issuance of the wetlands and watercourses permit to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-34 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the trial court dismissed his appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The relevant facts are as follows. The permit application that gives rise to this appeal proposes a thirty lot residential subdivision, each lot approximately one and one-third acres in size. Two of the thirty proposed lots have lake frontage. Approximately fifteen acres of the site are protected wetlands and watercourses. The application requests permission for two regulated activities, both of which involve activity in a watercourse. The first regulated activity is the construction of a common driveway that intersects a man-made intermittent watercourse channel. The driveway is necessary for access to the site from public roads. The driveway impacts 1300 square feet of the watercourse. The second activity impacts both a man-made and a natural watercourse channel to insert a conveyance mechanism for a storm drainage system. This regulated activity will affect approximately one fifth of an acre of the watercourse. The developer also proposed that approximately thirty-two acres of the site be dedicated to open space and a 150 foot buffer be created between the lake and the development.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The application at issue in the present case was filed on November 17, 1998, after the developer\u2019s two prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>inland wetlands and watercourses applications for the site failed to gamer the commission\u2019s approval.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the denial of the second of the earlier applications, the developer scaled back the intensity of the proposed development for the site and reduced the impact to the wetlands and watercourses. The number of lots proposed for the site was reduced from forty-nine to thirty-five.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The amount of open space was increased from eleven acres to 32.5 acres. The developer also reduced the extent of roadways and driveways on the site from 4100 linear feet to 2300 linear feet, a reduction of almost one-half. The number of subdivision lots with lake frontage was reduced from five to two. Originally, nineteen lots were proposed to be located on regulated land; no lots in the current application are located on regulated land. All of these changes resulted in a reduction of the number of proposed regulated activities for the site from nine to two.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The commission conducted a public hearing on the application, heard testimony from numerous experts, and received many reports. When the application was discussed after the public hearing, members of the commission closely questioned Mark Provonost, the Wolcott town engineer, and Anthony P\u00e1nico, the independent expert hired by the commission to review the application, about the impact of the proposed development on the wetlands and watercourses. The commission approved the application on January 27, 1999, after more than one year of considering development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>proposals for the site. The approval was subject to several conditions recommended by P\u00e1nico and Provonost. In its approval resolution, the commission specifically found that it had considered feasible and prudent alternatives to the activities proposed in the application.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly dismissed his appeal despite the commission\u2019s failure to consider alternatives to the proposed development of the site that would cause less or no environmental impact to the wetlands and watercourses as required by \u00a7 22a-41 (a) (2). The defendants dispute the plaintiffs interpretation of \u00a7 22a-41 (a) (2) and, farther, counter that the plaintiffs interpretation of the statute would be burdensome and unmanageable. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Before analyzing the plaintiffs claim, we must first consider the continued viability of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands </em>Agency, 226 Conn. 579, 628 A.2d 1286 (1993). The plaintiff claims that <em>Samperi </em>should be disregarded as a guide in the interpretation and application of \u00a7 22a-41 because the statute was amended in 1996, subsequent to the decision in the case, and the statutory amendments rendered parts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the decision obsolete.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We conclude that <em>Samperi, </em>still provides valid guidance in the proper interpretation and application of \u00a7 22a-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In 1993, when <em>Samperi </em>was decided, \u00a7 22a-41 required that the commission find that \u201ca feasible and prudent alternative [to the proposed activity in the wetlands and watercourses] does not exist.\u201d Id., 580; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 22a-41 (b). The statute failed, however, to provide definitions for \u201cfeasible\u201d or \u201cprudent.\u201d See <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Agency, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 580. This court therefore provided a construction for those terms.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">We also provided, however, an interpretation of \u00a7 22a-41 that local wetlands and watercourses commissions have relied on to guide their decisions regarding \u00a7 22a-41 (a) (2). The plaintiffs in <em>Samperi </em>argued that the agency was required to create a record demonstrating its consideration of each and every alternative to a proposed incursion or regulated activity in a wetland. Id., 589. We rejected that argument, stating \u201cthe statute does not permit an agency to grant a permit if the agency finds that a feasible and prudent alternative exists with regard to any of the incursions or regulated activities. We disagree, however, that the agency\u2019s decision-making process in this regard requires explicit consideration of each proposed alternative . . . .\u201d Id., 589-90. We concluded that \u00a7 22a-41 did not require the wetlands agency \u201cto consider and rule on each and every possible alternative presented to it.\u201d Id., 590. We then addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>the manner in which the applicant could satisfy its burden of establishing the absence of a feasible and prudent alternative to the activity proposed in the wetlands. Id., 593</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">\u201cThe evidentiary burden imposed on the applicant to demonstrate that its proposal is the only feasible and prudent alternative will ordinarily require an affirmative presentation to that effect. If only one alternative is presented, the inland wetlands agency can approve the application for a permit only if no other feasible and prudent alternatives exist. In practical terms, this will usually require that the applicant present evidence of more than one alternative to the local agency.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">In 1996, the legislature amended \u00a7 22a-41, adding a requirement that a wetlands and watercourses commission should consider six factors when considering a permit application. See Public Acts 1996, No. 96-157, \u00a7 2. Among the factors to be considered are \u201cany feasible and prudent alternatives to . . . the proposed regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no environmental impact to wetlands or watercourses . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41 (a) (2). Absent from the statutory amendment and the legislative history is any criticism or intention to alter this court\u2019s conclusions in <em>Samperi </em>concerning how commissions and applicants should address the feasible and prudent alternatives requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The legislature is presumed to know of our interpretation of statutes and must make its intention known if it intends to overrule our conclusion as to the proper analysis of an issue. See <em>Gil </em>v. <em>Courthouse One, </em>239 Conn. 676, 686, 687 A.2d 146 (1997); <em>Murach </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>196 Conn. 192, 200 n.14, 491 A.2d 1058 (1985). The legislature did not express any intention to alter our interpretation of \u00a7 22a-41 in <em>Samperi. </em>In fact, the legislative history of the amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>ment to \u00a7 22a-41 in 1996 reveals that the legislature intended to amend the statute to be consistent with <em>Samperi </em>in some respects.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We therefore, reject the plaintiffs contention that <em>Samperi </em>is no longer a useful guide to interpretation of \u00a7 22a-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">We now turn to the merits of the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly found that the commission did consider feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed wetlands activity as required by \u00a7 22a-41 (a) (2). The trial court\u2019s findings as to what the commission considered are findings of fact that will be reversed only if they are clearly erroneous. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lipscomb, </em>258 Conn. 68, 74, 779 A.2d 88 (2001). We conclude that the trial court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The trial court began its analysis of this issue by noting that the commission specifically found that feasible and prudent alternatives had been investigated. See footnote 7 of this opinion. The trial court then reviewed the record of the proceedings before the commission. The record revealed that the commission had considered the two prior applications for the site, both of which proposed more numerous and more intrusive activities in the wetlands and watercourses on the site than those proposed in the application. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>further found that the record revealed that the developer and the commission and its staff together reviewed various additional alternatives with regard to development of the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Agency, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 592-93, we established that it is sufficient for a commission to consider as many alternatives as necessary until the balance between economic development and wetlands and watercourses protection has been achieved. \u201c[F]or a wetlands permit to issue, the local inland wetlands agency must determine that the alternative presented by the applicant is not only sound from an engineering standpoint but is also economically reasonable in fight of the social benefits derived from the activity. . . . An alternative will be deemed to be a feasible and prudent alternative only if it meets both criteria.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 595. The developer also is not required to submit plans or drawings for all alternatives proposed. <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>212 Conn. 710, 726, 563 A.2d 1339 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">We agree with the trial court and the reasoning of several other Superior Court decisions that have concluded that the review of multiple wetlands applications for a site can constitute the consideration by the agency of feasible and prudent alternatives. See <em>DeAngelis </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Commission, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Docket No. CV96132755 (May 16, 1997); <em>Pielmier </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbuiy, Docket No. CV950128564 (March 19, 1997). As a result of reviewing successive applications for the same site, the commission can judge firsthand the feasibility and prudence of alternate development schemes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Our review of the record shows that it amply supports the trial court\u2019s findings that the commission did consider feasible and prudent alternatives to the wetlands activity proposed in the application. In support of his claim that the trial court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous, the plaintiff relies on a single statement by one of the developer\u2019s experts, Terrence Myers, an engineer, who stated at the public hearing on the application, that \u201cthis [application] has the least amount of impact of any proposal that we did.\u201d The plaintiff mistakenly views this as a concession that other possible alternatives with lesser wetlands impact were not considered. The commission is required to consider other alternatives only if they are both feasible and prudent. By definition, \u201cprudent\u201d involves a consideration of economic reasonableness. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-38 (18); <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Agency, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 594-95. The plaintiff has not directed us to any part of the record that shows that the commission failed to consider any <em>feasible and prudent </em>alternative that would cause less or no environmental impact to wetlands or watercourses. The plaintiff therefore has failed to establish that the trial court\u2019s findings in this regard were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly determined that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s finding that there were no feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed wetlands and watercourses activity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>We begin by setting forth the standard of review that will govern our analysis of this issue. \u201cIn challenging an administrative agency action, the plaintiff has the burden of proof. . . . The plaintiff must do more than simply show that another decision maker, such as the trial court, might have reached a different conclusion. Rather than asking the reviewing court to retry the case de novo . . . the plaintiff must establish that substantial evidence does not exist in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s decision. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\u201cIn reviewing an inland wetlands agency decision made pursuant to the act, the reviewing court must sustain the agency\u2019s determination if an examination of the record discloses evidence that supports any one of the reasons given. . . . The evidence, however, to support any such reason must be substantial; [t]he credibility of witnesses and the determination of factual issues are matters within the province of the administrative agency. . . . This so-called substantial evidence rule is similar to the sufficiency of the evidence standard applied injudicial review of jury verdicts, and evidence is sufficient to sustain an agency finding if it affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. . . . The reviewing court must take into account [that there is] contradictory evidence in the record . . . but the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Agency, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 587-88; accord <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>203 Conn. 525, 540-42, 525 A.2d 940 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of this issue. For its assistance in reviewing the developer\u2019s applications, the commission hired Pan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>ico, an independent expert. In reaching its decision, the trial court concluded that the commission relied primarily on P\u00e1nico, who reported to the commission that there were no feasible and prudent alternatives to the final plan put forth by the developer. In his report P\u00e1nico stated: \u201cThe Commission\u2019s determination to not approve the original application has resulted in the further examination of other feasible and prudent alternatives having acceptable impacts. Ultimately, this resulted in the subject Application and revised proposal, reflecting a dramatic lessening in potential environmental impacts, a significant reduction in the potential number of homes and reduced road construction. Based on sound engineering analysis, <em>there are no other feasible and prudent alternative plans that allow access to the useable, non-wetlands portion of the site to achieve the application\u2019s objectives.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Panico\u2019s report to the commission also detailed the significant changes the developer had made from the original plan, and asserted that these changes would result in a minimal impact on the wetlands and watercourses on the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In addition to P\u00e1nico, many of the developer\u2019s experts also testified that the final plan was the most feasible and prudent alternative. Four experts testified for the developer during the site application proceedings. David H. Lord, a soil scientist and environmental consultant with Soil Resource Consultants, testified that the developer had designed the site plan to avoid the wetlands and watercourses located on the site, causing as minimal an impact to the wetlands and watercourses as feasibly possible. Priscilla W. Baillie, an ecologist and botanist with Marine and Freshwater Research Service, opined that the \u201cimprovements in the site plan are very significant, and potential impacts on the lake have been substantially mitigated.\u201d Keith Shortsleeve, a geologist with SMC Environmental, testified concerning water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>sample tests he conducted at the site to monitor various contaminants, averring that \u201cthere were no significant impacts between the up-gradient and down-gradient surface waters at the site.\u201d Lastly, throughout the application process, Terrence Myers, the developer\u2019s professional engineer, detailed the various alternatives proposed for the site to the commission and avowed that the final plan application was more environmentally prudent than any other alternative the developer had proposed previously to the commission. The developer also presented reports from Penelope C. Sharp, a certified wetland consultant, who performed a field investigation of the site. Her report maintained that most of the recommendations she had suggested to reduce the impact on the wetlands and watercourses during the first application process had been implemented in the final application process and that the proposal for the site contained in the final application would not \u201cresult in major changes to the wetland functions . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The plaintiff offered the testimony of two experts during the meetings: George Logan, a professional wetlands scientist and certified wildlife biologist for REMA Ecological Services, LLC; and Kenneth Wagner, an aquatic scientist for ENSR International. The plaintiff and his experts did not offer any proposed alternatives to the developer\u2019s plans, but expressed serious concern that: (1) the application to the commission was not filed concurrently with the Wolcott planning and zoning commission as is required by the Wolcott inland wetlands regulations; (2) the proposed development of the site would risk wildlife preservation; (3) no alternatives that had less impact on the wetlands and watercourses had been proposed; and (4) the development would negatively affect the water quality on the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">In the present case, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>there were no feasible and prudent alternatives to the activity proposed in the application. No fewer than six experts testified that the activity proposed in the application would have minimal impact on the wetlands and watercourses. Among the six was P\u00e1nico, the commission\u2019s independent expert, who advised the commission that there were no feasible and prudent alternatives to the application. The record clearly illustrates that the commission had a substantial basis in fact for its determination. We conclude that the trial court properly determined that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s findings that there were no feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed wetlands and watercourses activity for the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The plaintiff asserts that the trial court improperly concluded that there was substantial evidence to support the commission\u2019s decision because the commission relied only on its expert and the developer\u2019s experts. The credibility of witnesses, however, is entirely within the province of the commission. <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Agency, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 588. The commission\u2019s hiring of an independent expert to assist in the review of the wetlands applications for the site was a reasonable and sound step that demonstrates that the commission proceeded to review the applications for the site in a conscientious manner. It was in no way improper for the commission to rely on the opinion it received from the independent expert that it had retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41 provides: \u201c(a) In carrying out the purposes and policies of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45a, inclusive, including matters relating to regulating, licensing and enforcing of the provisions thereof, the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>sioner shall take into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances, including but not limited to:</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">\u201c(1) The environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses;</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">\u201c(2) The applicant\u2019s purpose for, and any feasible and prudent alternatives to, the proposed regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no environmental impact to wetlands or watercourses;</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">\u201c(3) The relationship between the short-term and long-term impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity of such wetlands or watercourses;</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">\u201c(4) Irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources which would be caused by the proposed regulated activity, including the extent to which such activity would foreclose a future ability to protect, enhance or restore such resources, and any mitigation measures which may be considered as a condition of issuing a permit for such activity including, but not limited to, measures to (A) prevent or minimize pollution or other environmental damage, (B) maintain or enhance existing environmental quality, or (C) in the following order of priority: Restore, enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse resources;</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">\u201c(5) The character and degree of injury to, or interference with, safety, health or the reasonable use of property which is caused or threatened by the proposed regulated activity; and</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">\u201c(6) Impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses outside the area for which the activity is proposed and future activities associated with, or reasonably related to, the proposed regulated activity which are made inevitable by the proposed regulated activity and which may have an impact on wetlands or watercourses.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">\u201c(b) (1) In the case of an application which received a public hearing pursuant to (A) subsection (k) of section 22a-39, or (B) a finding by the inland wetlands agency that the proposed activity may have a significant impact on wetlands or watercourses, a permit shall not be issued unless the commissioner finds on the basis of the record that a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist.

The commission approved all four applications. The plaintiff has appealed only from the application regarding section IV.
