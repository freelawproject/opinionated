App. 669, 785 A.2d 1181 (2001). The defendants claim that, even if the Appellate Court properly determined that they otherwise had been given adequate notice of the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on \u00a7 52-557n, that statute does not abrogate governmental immunity. We agree with the Appellate Court that \u00a7 52-557n allows the plaintiffs to bring a direct cause of action for negligence against the defendants and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The Appellate Court opinion sets forth the following relevant facts and procedural history. \u201cThe plaintiffs brought this action against the defendants for injuries that Tonisha Spears sustained on June 28,1994. On that date, a motor vehicle struck her after she was pushed into the road by a high pressure stream of water flowing from a fire hydrant, which had been opened by an unauthorized person. The hydrant did not have a safety device or a cap to prevent unauthorized openings as of the date of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u201cIn their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants were negligent for failing to install safety devices on the hydrant and for failing to inspect it. The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, however, did not mention any statutory authority that abrogated the defendants\u2019 governmental immunity. The defendants, in their answer, pleaded that immunity as a special defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\u201cOn December 16,1998, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that the plaintiffs\u2019 action was barred by the doctrine of governmental immunity because they failed to cite any statute in their complaint that abrogated the immunity. To advance that position, the defendants cited <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>Haven, </em>[243 Conn. 763, 707 A.2d 1251 (1998)], in their memorandum of law supporting the motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs, in response, filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. In the memorandum, the plaintiffs mentioned for the first time \u00a7 52-557n as abrogating the defendants\u2019 immunity. The plaintiffs also distinguished <em>Williams, </em>noting that the plaintiffs in that case never relied on \u00a7 52-557n throughout the proceedings. See id., 766. In contrast, the plaintiffs [in the Appellate Court] emphasize^] that although they did not specifically plead the statute in the complaint, the defendants were sufficiently apprised of the statute in the plaintiffs\u2019 memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u201cDuring oral arguments on the motion for summary judgment, the parties reiterated their positions. The defendants also claimed at oral argument [on their motion] that pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-3 (a), \u2018[w]hen any claim made in a complaint ... is grounded on a statute, the statute shall be specifically identified by its number.\u2019 The [trial] court, in response, noted that the language of that section has been interpreted to be directory rather than mandatory. In addition, the court found the facts of the present case to be remarkably similar to those of <em>Williams </em>and [found] that in both <em>Williams </em>and the present case, the plaintiffs relied solely on their claim of common-law negligence and, at no time, advanced any statutory basis for the defendants\u2019 liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u201cThe [trial] court granted the defendants\u2019 motion, holding that although Practice Book \u00a7 10-3 (a) has been read as directory rather than mandatory, <em>Williams </em>is controlling on the present case.\u201d <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>supra, 66 Conn. App. 671-73. Thereafter, the Appellate Court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment, concluding that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to plead \u00a7 52-557n in their complaint was not fatal under the circumstances of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>case. Id., 676. Specifically, the Appellate Court determined that the trial court improperly had relied on <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 763, because, unlike the plaintiff in <em>Williams, </em>the plaintiffs in the present case had apprised the defendants sufficiently of their reliance on \u00a7 52-557n by raising the statute in their memorandum of law in opposition to the motion for summary judgment and in oral argument before the trial court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>supra, 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">As an alternate ground for affirmance, the defendants contended that the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on \u00a7 52-557n as a basis for abrogating the defendants\u2019 immunity was improper. Id., 677. The Appellate Court disagreed, determining that \u00a7 52-557n abrogates governmental immunity, thus allowing a direct cause of action for negligence against the defendants. Id., 680. Thereafter, we granted the defendants\u2019 petition for certification, limited to the following question: \u201cDoes ... \u00a7 52-557n permit a plaintiff to bring a direct cause of action in negligence against a municipality?\u201d <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>259 Conn. 915, 792 A.2d 852 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The certified question on appeal raises an issue of statutory construction and, therefore, our review is plenary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Russo, </em>259 Conn. 436, 447, 790 A.2d 1132, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 879, 123 S. Ct. 79, 154 L. Ed. 2d 134 (2002). \u201cThe process of statutoiy interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schiano </em>v. <em>Bliss Exterminating Co., </em>260 Conn. 21, 34, 792 A.2d 835 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Of particular relevance in this case is the related principle that \u201c[w]hen a statute is in derogation of common law or creates a liability where formerly none existed, it should receive a strict construction and is not to be extended, modified, repealed or enlarged in its scope by the mechanics of [statutory] construction. ... In determining whether or not a statute abrogates or modifies a common law rule the construction must be strict, and the operation of a statute in derogation of the common law is to be limited to matters clearly brought within its scope.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vitanza </em>v. <em>Upjohn Co., </em>257 Conn. 365, 381, 778 A.2d 829 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u201cThis court has previously stated that [a] municipality itself was generally immune from liability for its tortious acts at common law .... We have also long recognized that, [u]nder our rule, the principle of governmental immunity extends to the construction and maintenance of fire equipment as well as to its use for fire protection. . . . We have also recognized, however, that governmental immunity may be abrogated by statute. . . . Thus, the general rule developed in our case law is that a municipality is immune from liability for negligence unless the legislature has enacted a statute abrogating that immunity.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 766-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Against this background, we turn to the certified question: whether \u00a7 52-557n permits a plaintiff to bring a direct cause of action in negligence against a municipality. \u201cAs with all issues of statutory interpretation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>we look first to the language of the statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gipson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>257 Conn. 632, 639, 778 A.2d 121 (2001). The language of \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, a political subdivision of the state shall be liable for damages to person or property caused by: (A) The negligent acts or omissions of such political subdivision or any employee, officer or agent thereof acting within the scope of his employment or official duties . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">This language clearly and expressly abrogates the traditional common-law doctrine in this state that municipalities are immune from suit for torts committed by their employees and agents. Cf. <em>Babes </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>247 Conn. 256, 263-64, 721 A.2d 511 (1998) (noting General Statutes \u00a7 52-556 is statutory waiver of state\u2019s immunity in wrongful death action); <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>211 Conn. 370, 381, 559 A.2d 701 (1989) (noting legislature\u2019s waiver of state\u2019s immunity under General Statutes \u00a7 31-51g for employer\u2019s discharge of employee exercising constitutional rights). The presence of the savings clause, \u201cexcept as otherwise provided by law,\u201d pertains only to state and federal statutes, not to the common law. <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 191-92, 592 A.2d 912 (1991). Therefore, the legislature has manifested its intention to abrogate governmental immunity under the statute. Moreover, because the pertinent legislative history surrounding \u00a7 52-557n (a) is silent as to the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the statute, the defendants cannot rely on it to support a contrary interpretation. Cf. <em>Schiano </em>v. <em>Bliss Exterminating Co., </em>supra, 260 Conn. 45 (\u201clegislative history of [General Statutes] \u00a7 31-303 and the language of other provisions of the [Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] relating to the commissioner\u2019s authority to make an award of fees constitutes compelling evidence that, <em>despite the statutory language, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>legislature did not intend for attorney\u2019s fees to be subject to the penalty provided for in \u00a7 31-303\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The defendants, however, advance three arguments in support of their contention that \u00a7 52-557n (a) does not permit a direct cause of action in negligence against a municipality. Specifically, they contend that the Appellate Court improperly construed the statute as abrogating municipal immunity because: (1) that interpretation creates a conflict with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-465 (a)* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 7-308,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> both of which provide for indemnifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>cation of municipal employees; (2) the absence of relevant legislative debate when the legislature enacted \u00a7 52-557n (a) indicates that it did not intend to abrogate common-law governmental immunity from negligence actions; and (3) by allowing a direct cause of action against a municipality under \u00a7 52-557n, which does not require that an employee be named as the tortfeasor, the Appellate Court eliminated the defense of qualified immunity. We reject all of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The defendants first contend that the legislature did not intend to abrogate governmental immunity under \u00a7 52-557n (a) because such a result would permit a plaintiff to circumvent the procedural requirements under \u00a7\u00a7 7-465 (a) and 7-308 (b), which allow a plaintiff to bring a joint action against a municipal employee and the indemnifying municipality if the plaintiff files with the municipality within six months a notice of his or her intention to bring such an action. See footnotes 5 and 6 of this opinion. The defendants contend that, because \u00a7 52-557n (a) imposes no such procedural requirement, plaintiffs would be able to use the statute to avoid dismissal of actions against municipalities otherwise time barred under \u00a7\u00a7 7-465 (a) and 7-308 (b). We are not persuaded by the defendants\u2019 reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u201cIn construing two seemingly conflicting statutes, we are guided by the principle that the legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law .... Accordingly, [i]f two statutes appear to be in conflict but can be construed as consistent with each other, then the court should give effect to both.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nizzardo </em>v. <em>State Traffic Commission, </em>259 Conn. 131, 157, 788 A.2d 1158 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The causes of action under the statutes are independent and are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, our statutes are replete with instances in which actions are authorized against the same defendant based upon the same course of conduct, subject to the plaintiff satisfying different procedural requirements, such as statutes of limitations. Had the legislature intended \u00a7 52-557n to incorporate the procedural requirements of \u00a7 7-465 or \u00a7 7-308, it could have referenced them. Cf. General Statutes \u00a7 31-306b (employer\u2019s failure to comply with notice requirements under statute does not excuse dependent of deceased employee from filing workers\u2019 compensation claim within time period prescribed under General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c). In the absence of any indication of the legislature\u2019s intent to require plaintiffs to comply with the procedural requirements under either \u00a7 7-308 or \u00a7 7-465 before invoking \u00a7 52-557n, we decline to engraft such language onto the statute. See <em>Laliberte </em>v. <em>United Security, Inc., </em>261 Conn. 181, 186, 801 A.2d 783 (2002) (declining to impose limitation in absence of provision in General Statutes \u00a7 31-307 [a] permitting discontinuance of workers\u2019 compensation total disability benefits based on incarceration). Similarly, had the legislature intended to retain \u00a7 7-465 or \u00a7 7-308 as the exclusive remedy, it could have done so in the text of \u00a7 52-557n as it did with regard to defective highway claims by its explicit reference to General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>We farther note that subsection (b) of \u00a7 52-557n, which references subsection (a), sets forth many exceptions under which an injured party may not pursue a direct action in negligence against a municipality.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is noteworthy that circumstances under which a plaintiff may bring an action under either \u00a7 7-308 or \u00a7 7-465 against the municipality is not one of the enumerated exceptions. \u201cWe have stated that [ujnless there is evidence to the contrary, statutory itemization indicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>that the legislature intended [a] list to be exclusive.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>260 Conn. 219, 225, 796 A.2d 502 (2002); see also <em>Gay &amp; Lesbian Law Students Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>236 Conn. 453, 476, 673 A.2d 484 (1996) (\u201c \u2018[w]here express exceptions are made, the legal presumption is that the legislature did not intend to save other cases from the operation of the statute\u2019 \u201d); <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>232 Conn. 91,101, 653 A.2d 782 (1995) (legislature\u2019s express exclusion of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-60 from General Statutes \u00a7 46a-86 [c] and [d] evidences intent not to authorize compensatory damages, other than back pay as provided for in subsection [b], and attorney\u2019s fees for employment discrimination). In the absence of any such reference to \u00a7 7-308 or \u00a7 7-465, we conclude that the statutes can coexist and that a party may choose to rely on either statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Next, the defendants argue that, because \u00a7 52-557n is such a radical departure from the common law, the silence in the pertinent legislative history surrounding \u00a7 52-557n indicates that the legislature did not intend to abrogate common-law governmental immunity. In essence, the defendants ask us to interpret the absence of debate by the legislature when enacting the statute as evidence that the legislature did not intend to abrogate the common law, even though the language of the statute indicates otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">This argument is without merit. \u201c [R] eliance on legislative silence is misplaced. It is a basic tenet of statutory construction that we rely on the intent of the legislature as that intent has been expressed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dept. of Social Services </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>247 Conn. 686, 706, 724 A.2d 1093 (1999). While we agree with the defendants that the absence of pertinent legislative debate on this statute is <em>perhaps </em>peculiar in light of the fact that the statute abrogates governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>immunity, we cannot accept the absence of such debate as evidence that the legislature did not intend to abrogate common-law governmental immunity when the language of the statute plainly dictates otherwise. We often have stated that in determining whether a statute abrogates or modifies a common-law rule the construction must be strict. \u201cIt must be remembered [however] that the principle of narrowly construing statutes that purport to change the common law is not an absolute rule, but rather merely an important [guideline] to the determination of legislative meaning. To permit [the construction of the statute] to displace the conclusions that careful interpretation yields . . . would be a disservice to the legislative process, as well as to the judicial exercise of interpreting legislative language based upon the premise that the legislature intends to enact reasonable public policies.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>245 Conn. 385, 406 n.14, 715 A.2d 27 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The defendants\u2019 final contention is that, by allowing a direct cause of action under \u00a7 52-557n, the court precludes as a matter of law the defense of qualified immunity. They claim that municipalities indirectly are affected by the defense because, if a plaintiff brings an action against an employee and the municipality under \u00a7 7-465, the employee may assert qualified immunity and thereby alleviate the municipality\u2019s duty to indemnify under that statute. Thus, according to the defendants, a direct cause of action under \u00a7 52-557n, which does not require that an employee be named as the tortfeasor, would essentially destroy the defense of qualified immunity. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u201cThe [common-law] doctrines that determine the tort liability of municipal employees are well established. <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>228 Conn. 640, 645, 638 A.2d 1 (1994). Although historically [a] municipality itself was generally immune from liability for its tortious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>acts at common law; <em>Ryszkiewicz </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>193 Conn. 589, 593, 479 A.2d 793 (1984) . . . [municipal] employees faced the same personal tort liability as private individuals. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Housing Authority, </em>[208 Conn. 161, 165, 544 A.2d 1185 (1988)]. <em>Evon </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>211 Conn. 501, 505, 559 A.2d 1131 (1989). Over the years, however, [t]he doctrine of [qualified] immunity has provided some exceptions to the general rule of tort liability for municipal employees. <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 645. Generally, a municipal employee is liable for the misperformance of ministerial acts, but has a qualified immunity in the performance of governmental acts. Id. Governmental acts are performed wholly for the direct benefit of the public and are supervisory or discretionary in nature. <em>Gauvin </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>187 Conn. 180, 184, 445 A.2d 1 (1982). In contrast, [m]inisterial refers to a duty which is to be performed in a prescribed manner without the exercise of judgment or discretion. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 464, 471, 356 A.2d 176 (1975). . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u201cA municipal employee\u2019s immunity for the performance of discretionary governmental acts is, however, qualified by three recognized exceptions: first, where the circumstances make it apparent to the public officer that his or her failure to act would be likely to subject an identifiable person to imminent harm . . . second, where a statute specifically provides for a cause of action against a municipality or municipal official for failure to enforce certain laws . . . and third, where the alleged acts involve malice, wantonness or intent to injure, rather than negligence. . . . <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 645. Thus, [t]he presumption is that qualified rather than absolute immunity is sufficient to protect government officials in the exercise of their duties. <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>[500 U.S. 478,486-87, 111 S. Ct. 1934,114 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1991)]; see <em>also Malley </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>[475 U.S. 335, 340, 106 S. Ct. 1092, 89 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>2d 271 (1986)]; <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 807, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1982). <em>DeLaurentis </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>220 Conn. 225, 243, 597 A.2d 807 (1991).\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Rioux, </em>229 Conn. 716, 727-28, 643 A.2d 1226 (1994), on appeal after remand, 38 Conn. App. 546, 662 A.2d 15 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In light of these principles, we reject the defendants\u2019 claim that permitting a direct cause of action against the municipality under \u00a7 52-557n, which does not require that an employee be named as the tortfeasor, would essentially destroy the defense of qualified immunity because it is supported neither by the purpose underlying the defense nor the statutory scheme. When a municipal employee is sued, he or she may assert qualified immunity as a common-law defense. This defense is intended to protect the employee, not the municipality that otherwise is cloaked with its own immunity absent express statutory abrogation. While a benefit accrues to the municipality when the employee successfully establishes qualified immunity, by permitting the municipality to avoid liability for indemnification, the defense is intended to benefit the employee in the exercise of his or her governmental duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Additionally, as we previously noted, \u00a7\u00a7 52-557n and 7-465 are coextensive. We recognize that there <em>may </em>be circumstances under which a municipality is held liable under \u00a7 52-557n where it would have been able to avoid liability had suit been brought jointly against the employee and the municipality under \u00a7 7-465. This outcome, however, results from a clear legislative expression of an intent to abrogate municipal immunity independent of the availability of a claim under \u00a7 7-465.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIs\">joins, concurring. I agree with the majority that General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) \u201cclearly and expressly abrogates the traditional common-law doctrine in this state that municipalities are immune from suit for torts committed by their employees and agents. . . . Therefore, the legislature has manifested its intention to abrogate governmental immunity under the statute.\u201d (Citations omitted.) I also concur in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">I write separately to note my agreement with the majority insofar as it has declined to extend further the purposive approach to statutory interpretation first announced in <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577-78, 816 A.2d 562 (2003). The purposive approach requires the statutory interpreter to consider all of the circumstances surrounding the enactment of the legislation in attempting to divine the legislative intent even when the language of the statute under interpretation is clear and unambiguous. See id., 566, 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">Specifically, I agree with the majority\u2019s rejection of the defendants\u2019 argument that the lack of any relevant legislative debate on \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) suggests that the legislature did not intend to abrogate the common law. This seems to be a straightforward application of the commonsense notion that, when the legislature speaks \u201cclearly and expressly,\u201d there is no further requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>that the legislative history also affirmatively reflect that expressed intent. In short, I agree with the majority\u2019s rejection of the theory that nothing means something. Finally, I would only note that, in light of the majority\u2019s conclusion that the legislature has spoken \u201cclearly and expressly,\u201d even affirmative legislative history favoring the defendants\u2019 interpretation should not change the result in this case.
