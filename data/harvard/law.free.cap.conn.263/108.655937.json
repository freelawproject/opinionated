Specifically, the defendant argues that: (1) the lease between the plaintiff and the airport authority evidenced the plaintiffs intent to utilize the airport as source of profit; (2) by virtue of the lease, the defendant does not have the same privileges as the plaintiff with respect to the use of the airport; and (3) the airport authority constitutes a \u201cperson, association or private corporation\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12-74. The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly declined to render a judgment declaring the respective rights, duties and obligations of the parties pursuant to the Tweed-New Haven Airport Authority Act, General Statutes \u00a7 et seq. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>\u201cOur examination of the record and briefs and our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>consideration of the arguments of the parties persuade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>us that the judgment of the trial court should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>affirmed.
