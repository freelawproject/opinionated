More specifically, the certified question requires that we determine whether the exclusivity provision of the product liability act, General Statutes \u00a7 52-572n (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> serves to prevent the plaintiff from also asserting a particular claim under CUTPA. Under the circumstances of the present case, we answer the certified question in the negative.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The plaintiff, Mark Gerrity, brought this action as executor of the estate of his mother, Judith S. Gerrity (decedent), in the Superior Court. The defendants, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (Reynolds) and Lorillard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Tobacco Company (Loiillard), removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The District Court certified one question of law to this court, which we accepted. See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The District Court\u2019s certification order includes the question of law sought to be answered by this court and a list of six allegations. Although not stipulating to the allegations as facts to be taken as true, the defendants agree that the plaintiff <em>asserts </em>these allegations in his complaint. The following summary of the case, as set forth in this opinion, is based on the District Court\u2019s certification order and an examination of the plaintiffs underlying complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The plaintiff brought this action in four counts, seeking to recover damages relating to the death of the decedent from lung cancer. Counts one and two are brought under the product liability act and are based on the allegation that the defendants\u2019 cigarettes are defective. Counts three and four are based on the allegation that the defendants engaged in unfair trade practices in violation of CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The plaintiff alleged that the defendants\u2019 cigarettes are defective and unreasonably dangerous because they are addictive and cause lung cancer. The plaintiff also asserted that the defendants designed and manufactured their cigarettes to enhance their addictive nature. The plaintiff further alleged that, prior to June 30,1969, Lorillard, in an effort to induce consumers to begin and continue smoking, expressly warranted that its cigarettes were safe for their normal use, and that if it were to discover otherwise, it would advise consumers of this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The plaintiff further alleged that the defendants engaged in an industry-wide scheme to defraud consumers into believing that there was a bona fide scientific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>dispute regarding the addictive nature of cigarettes and the health hazards associated with them. In furtherance of this scheme, the plaintiff asserted, the defendants issued false public statements, failed to disclose evidence of the addictive nature of cigarettes, increased the nicotine levels in cigarettes, neutralized warnings of smoking related health hazards, and targeted minors in advertising their products. Finally, the plaintiff alleged that the decedent suffered injuries because she relied on Lorillard\u2019s express warranty that its cigarettes were safe for their normal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In this wrongful death action, the plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs and other equitable relief. The defendants contend that the exclusivity provision of the product liability act precludes the plaintiffs CUTPA claim. The plaintiff argues, to the contrary, that the exclusivity provision was never intended to preclude a cause of action brought under CUTPA. We conclude that, because an examination of the plaintiffs underlying complaint reveals that the particular CUTPA claim alleged here reasonably can be construed to be outside the scope of the product liability act, the CUTPA claim is not barred and may be asserted in conjunction with the product liability act claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In order to answer the certified question, we must analyze the language of the exclusivity provision. We recently articulated our process of statutory interpretation in <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 816 A.2d 562 (2003). \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Thus, this process requires us to consider all relevant sources of the meaning of the language at issue, without having to cross any threshold or thresholds of ambiguity. Thus, we do not follow the plain meaning rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u201cIn performing this task, we begin with a searching examination of the language of the statute, because that is the most important factor to be considered. In doing so, we attempt to determine its range of plausible meanings and, if possible, narrow that range to those that appear most plausible. We do not, however, end with the language. We recognize, further, that the purpose or purposes of the legislation, and the context of the language, broadly understood, are directly relevant to the meaning of the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u201cThis does not mean, however, that we will not, in a given case, follow what may be regarded as the plain meaning of the language, namely, the meaning that, when the language is considered without reference to any extratextual sources of its meaning, appears to be <em>the </em>meaning and that appears to preclude any other likely meaning. In such a case, the more strongly the bare text supports such a meaning, the more persuasive the extratextual sources of meaning will have to be in order to yield a different meaning.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 577-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">We begin our analysis with the language of the statute itself. The exclusivity provision of the product liability act provides: \u201cA product liability claim<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> . . . may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>asserted and shall be in lieu of all other claims against product sellers,* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> including actions of negligence, strict liability and warranty, for harm<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> caused by a product.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-572n (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The exclusivity provision makes the product liability act the exclusive means by which a party may secure a remedy for an injury caused by a defective product. The legislature stated that a product liability claim, as defined by the product liability act, \u201cshall be in lieu of <em>all other claims against product sellers . . . for harm caused by a product.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-572n (a). We have previously reached this conclusion when interpreting the exclusivity provision. See <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>212 Conn. 462, 471, 562 A.2d 517 (1989) (\u201c[t]he legislature clearly intended to make our products liability act an <em>exclusive remedy </em>for claims falling within its scope\u201d [emphasis added]); cf. <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>200 Conn. 562,571,512 A.2d 893 (1986) (\u201cthe products liability statute provides an exclusive remedy and . . . plaintiffs cannot bring a common law cause of action for a claim within the scope of the statute\u201d). The issue presented by the certified question, therefore, is whether the plaintiffs CUTPA claim falls within the scope of the product liability act. If it does, then it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>precluded and may not be asserted in conjunction with the product liability act claim. If, however, the CUTPA claim falls outside the purview of the product liability act, it may be asserted and the exclusivity provision will not serve as a bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">As noted previously, the legislature defined a product liability claim to include all claims or actions brought for personal injury, death or property damage caused by the allegedly defective product. General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m (b). The legislature also provided that the damages are caused by the defective product if they arise from the \u201cmanufacture, construction, design, formula, preparation, assembly, installation, testing, warnings, instructions, marketing, packaging or labeling of any product.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m (b). In addition, a product liability claim is defined broadly to include, but not be limited to, all actions based on \u201c[sjtrict liability in tort; negligence; breach of warranty, express or implied; breach of or failure to discharge a duty to warn or instruct, whether negligent or innocent; misrepresentation or nondisclosure, whether negligent or innocent.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m (b). Finally, the legislature defined \u201c \u2018[h]arm\u2019 \u201d for purposes of the act to include \u201cdamage to property, including the product itself, and personal injuries including wrongful death.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m (d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These definitions must be read together, with the understanding that the product liability act was designed in part to codify the common law of product liability,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and in part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>to resolve, by legislative compromise, certain issues among the groups interested in the area of product liability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The product liability act, however, was not designed to eliminate claims that previously were understood to be outside the traditional scope of a claim for liability based on a defective product. Given this contextual framework, we conclude that a product liability claim under the act is one that seeks to recover damages for personal injuries, including wrongful death, or for property damages, including damage to the product itself, caused by the defective product.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Therefore, the language of the exclusivity provision makes clear that the product liability act was intended to serve as the exclusive remedy for a party who seeks recompense for those injuries caused by a product defect. The language of the exclusivity provision, however, suggests that it was not designed to serve as a bar to additional claims, including one brought under CUTPA, either for an injury not caused by the defective product, or if the party is not pursuing a claim for \u201cpersonal injury, death or property damage . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The statute\u2019s legislative history, to which both parties refer, supports this interpretation. With regard to the exclusivity provision, Senator Salvatore C. DePiano, one of the product liability act\u2019s main proponents, stated: \u201c[The exclusivity provision] sets forth that the Bill is intended as a substitute for prior theories for harm caused by a product. This section is intended to cut down on the number of counts in a complaint for injuries caused by a product. <em>It is not intended to affect </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>other state statutory schemes such as anti-trust acts or the state unfair trade practice act.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 22 S. Proc., Pt. 14, 1979 Sess., pp. 4636-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Senator DePiano\u2019s statement buttresses our conclusion that, although the product liability act serves as the exclusive remedy for claims falling within its scope, other claims, such as one under CUTPA, which fall <em>outside </em>the scope of the product liability act, are not barred. We construe Senator DePiano\u2019s statement to express the legislative intent that other statutory remedies are not to be viewed as, per se, falling within the exclusivity provision\u2019s bar, solely because they rest in part on the sale of a product. If, however, a party brings a CUTPA claim and seeks to use that statutory scheme when the claim is, in reality, one falling within the scope of the product liability act, then the exclusivity provision applies. This is true, as Senator DePiano\u2019s statement suggests, not because the legislature enacted the product liability act with a mind to preclude all CUTPA causes of action, but because the purported CUTPA claim would be revealed to be nothing more than a product liability act claim dressed in the robes of CUTPA. Again, we consider the product liability act to be the legislature\u2019s expression of a singular means by which product defect claims may be pursued. Other claims, however, outside the scope of the product liability act are not prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">We conclude that the plaintiffs CUTPA claim may be asserted in conjunction with the product liability act claim. We reach this conclusion based on the following analysis of the plaintiffs second amended complaint. In part, at least, the plaintiffs CUTPA claim does not seek a remedy for personal injury, death or property damage. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m (b). The plaintiff seeks, rather, to use CUTPA so as to redress merely a <em>financial injury </em>suffered by the decedent, of a kind that has never been regarded as part of the traditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>tort remedy for harm caused by a defective product. The plaintiff alleged that the decedent was forced to pay a higher price for the defendants\u2019 cigarettes than she would have had to pay in the absence of the wrongful course of conduct allegedly engaged in by the defendants.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The financial injury allegedly suffered by the decedent and for which the plaintiff seeks to use CUTPA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>to provide a remedy, cannot reasonably be construed to be a claim for \u201cpersonal injuiy, death or property damage . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m (b). For this reason, the plaintiffs CUTPA claim may be brought in conjunction with a claim under the product liability act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The defendants also contend that the plaintiff is precluded, under CUTPA, from seeking restitution and disgorgement of profits on behalf of the public. We decline to address this argument.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The scope of our review in a case involving a certified question from a federal court is ordinarily limited to the issue raised by that question. See <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>254 Conn. 799, 818, 761 A.2d 705 (2000). The narrow issue presented through the certified question is whether the exclusivity provision of the product liability act precludes the plaintiff from using CUTPA to assert a claim for damages resulting from the defendants\u2019 alleged scheme to conceal and misrepresent a product defect. We have addressed that issue through this opinion. Even if we were to assume that the defendants are correct that the plaintiff is precluded from obtaining damages on behalf of the public, that does not change our analysis or the result of the question certified to us by the District Court. We reached our conclusion that the plaintiff is not precluded from asserting his claim under CUTPA because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>that claim is not one for personal injuries, death or property damage. The types of damages permitted under CUTPA and to whom they are available, is beyond the scope of this certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The answer to the certified question is: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">No costs shall be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">In this opinion BORDEN and VERTEFEUILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-199b, the Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act, provides in relevant part: \u201c(d) The Supreme Court may answer a question of law certified to it by a court of the United States ... if the answer may be determinative of an issue in pending litigation in the certifying court and if there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision or statute of this state. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-572n (a) provides: \u201cA product liability claim as provided in sections 52-240a, 52-240b, 52-572m to 52-572q, inclusive, and 52-577a may be asserted and shall be in lieu of all other claims against product sellers, including actions of negligence, strict liability and warranty, for harm caused by a product.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b142-8\"> The United States District Court for the District of Connecticut asked this court to answer the following question: \u201cWhere a plaintiff seeks to recover damages under the Connecticut Product Liability Act . . . for injuries caused by an allegedly defective product, does the exclusivity provision of the [product liability act] preclude an action under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act . . . based on the product seller\u2019s alleged scheme to misrepresent and conceal the defect?\u201d <em>Gerrity </em>v. <em>R.J.
