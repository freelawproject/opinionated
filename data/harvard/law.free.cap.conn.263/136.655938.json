The issue presented by this appeal is whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k, which provides for a sentence enhancement of five years imprisonment when a qualifying felony is committed with a firearm,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposes separate enhancements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>of five years each where a defendant is convicted of multiple qualifying felonies arising from the same incident. We conclude that \u00a7 53-202k does provide for the enhancement of the sentence for each qualifying offense of which a defendant is convicted. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u201cThe jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In the early morning hours of August 17, 1997, the defendant was a passenger in a vehicle in Hartford with two other individuals. The three men decided to rob a drug dealer and the defendant drove one of the occupants to his car so that he could retrieve his gun. The three men drove around Hartford but could not find a drug dealer to rob .... Eventually, the defendant and one of the other men exited the car and came upon the victim, James Boland, who had just been dropped off in front of his house. Boland, a member of the neighborhood block watch program, was armed and proficient in the use of firearms. As the defendant and one of the other men approached Boland, a gunfight ensued in which Boland returned fire. Boland and the defendant both suffered gunshot wounds.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>69 Conn. App. 717, 719-20, 796 A.2d 596 (2002). Boland died as a result. Id., 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The defendant was convicted of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> attempt to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 53a-134 (a) (2),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 53a-134 (a) (2), and carrying a pistol or revolver without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id., 719. Thereafter, the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court improperly had imposed three separate sentence enhancements under \u00a7 53-202k. Id. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The defendant petitioned for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court to this court, and we granted the petition, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the trial court properly enhanced the defendant\u2019s sentence for each quahfying felony?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>261 Conn. 904, 802 A.2d 854 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">After fully considering the briefs and arguments of the parties, we conclude that the judgment of the Appellate Court should be affirmed. The thoughtful and compre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>hensive opinion of the Appellate Court properly resolved the issue in this certified appeal. A further discussion by this court would serve no useful purpose.
