The board concluded that Atlantic Mutual was solely responsible for the medical and disability expenses of the plaintiff, Mary Ann Hatt,* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and could not seek apportionment of any part of its liability for those expenses from Fireman\u2019s Fund. Atlantic Mutual appeals<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from, and we affirm, the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The record reveals that the facts and procedural history relevant to the disposition of this appeal are not in dispute. The plaintiff has worked full-time for the named defendant, Burlington Coat Factory, since September, 1982. She initially was hired as a sales associate and then was promoted to department manager in 1986. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>The plaintiffs work duties in both positions required her to be on her feet constantly for approximately eight hours per day. On February 19, 1988, she suffered an injury to her left ankle and foot when she stepped on the base of a clothing rack while moving it through the store. The plaintiff promptly reported her injury and was treated by William Jones, an orthopedist. She was disabled for ten to fourteen days following this injury, and she continued to suffer \u201cknife-like\u201d pain in her left foot after she returned to work. Despite her constant pain, the plaintiffs duties did not change when she returned to work and continued to require her to stand for long hours. She returned to Jones in June, 1989, because of her continuing pain. He diagnosed her with a severe muscle and ligament strain to her left foot, noting a deformity, but concluded that X rays showed no evidence of a fracture or of other bone or joint abnormalities. At that examination in June, 1989, Jones found that the plaintiff had suffered a permanent impairment as a result of the injury and rated her as having a 10 percent disability of the left foot. Jones then prescribed orthotic supports for the plaintiffs foot. Fireman\u2019s Fund, as the workers\u2019 compensation liability insurer for Burlington Coat Factory at that time, issued <em>a </em>voluntary agreement, which a commissioner approved on January 24, 1990, indemnifying the plaintiff for this disability, and paying her other disability and medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The plaintiff continued to see Jones for treatment of her injury into the 1990s. She also continued to work for Burlington Coat Factory, remaining constantly on her feet for more than forty hours per week. During the early 1990s, her pain progressively worsened. The plaintiffs injury and its accompanying pain grew progressively worse to the point that, by 1994, the appearance of her left foot had changed dramatically.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>continued to see Jones for treatment; in October, 1995, after taking X rays, he prescribed new orthotics and increased her disability rating to 25 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In August, 1997, Fireman\u2019s Fund filed notice with the commissioner that it intended to contest liability for the plaintiff\u2019s continued treatment on the ground that the treatment was unrelated to the original 1988 injury. At that point, the plaintiff was still seeking additional medical opinions. In October, 1997, the plaintiff returned to Jones, who stated that, despite her continued pain, he did not think surgery was warranted for her injured foot. In 1998, Fireman\u2019s Fund sent the plaintiff to Vincent Santoro, another orthopedist, for an independent medical evaluation. In a May, 1998 report, Santoro concluded that the plaintiff had developed arthritis in her left foot, along with a progressive deformity and flattening of the arch. Santoro found that the arthritis was a more recent development because, in his opinion, the 1995 X rays showed that the plaintiff did not suffer arthritis at that time. He diagnosed her condition in 1998 as posterior tendon dysfunction with a secondary flat foot deformity. Santoro concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s left foot condition was unrelated to aging and was caused by aggravation of her initial compensable injuries resulting from her work duties from 1988 to 1999. He also determined that this condition could have resulted from a single trauma, or through a progressive degenerative process. Santoro concluded that the plaintiff had a 25 percent permanent disability of her left foot, and that it required surgery. Subsequently, in 1998, the plaintiff adopted Santoro as her treating physician. In March, 2000, Santoro performed corrective surgery on the plaintiffs left foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">When Santoro examined the plaintiff in May, 1998, Burlington Coat Factory was no longer insured for workers\u2019 compensation by Fireman\u2019s Fund, and was insured by Atlantic Mutual. In August, 1998, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>filed, with the commissioner, a notice of claim for compensation \u201cfor May 19, 1998 left and right foot injuries sustained after February 19,1988, caused by continued exposure to her occupation at [Burlington Coat Factory].\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In September, 1998, Atlantic Mutual filed notice with the commissioner of its intention to contest liability for these injuries. In September, 1999, Stephen Selden, an orthopedist, examined the plaintiff at the request of Atlantic Mutual. Selden agreed with Santoro\u2019s diagnosis of a left posterior tendon dysfunction and his conclusion that surgery was a reasonable treatment. Selden disagreed, however, with Santoro\u2019s conclusion as to the etiology of the plaintiffs condition. Selden concluded that her condition in 1999 was the result of a combination from her initial 1988 injury, aging and excess weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">At a hearing on the matter, the commissioner accepted Santoro\u2019s conclusions rather than Selden\u2019s, concluding that Santoro was in a better position to assess the etiology of the plaintiff\u2019s condition. The commissioner determined that the plaintiffs condition on May 19, 1998, was \u201can injury which arose during and out of the coruse of her employment . . . .\u201d The commissioner stated that this condition was a cumulative injury that was the result of work activities following the initial 1988 injury. The commissioner further concluded that the liability for the plaintiffs post-May 19, 1998 disability from work and all associated medical expenses should be shared between the two insurers, Fireman\u2019s Fund and Atlantic Mutual, allocating 75 percent of the liability to Fireman\u2019s Fund and the remaining 25 percent to Atlantic Mutual. Pursuant to \u00a7 31-299b, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the commissioner ordered Atlantic Mutual, as primary payor, to pay the plaintiffs total compensation and the associated medical expenses, and then ordered Fireman\u2019s Fund to reimburse Atlantic Mutual for 75 percent of those expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Fireman\u2019s Fund then petitioned the board for review of the commissioner\u2019s decision. Fireman\u2019s Fund claimed that the commissioner improperly had apportioned to it 75 percent of the liability for the plaintiffs medical and disability benefits. Fireman\u2019s Fund contended that the entire liability should have been assigned to Atlantic Mutual because it was the employer\u2019s insurance carrier at the time of the second injury. Atlantic Mutual moved to dismiss Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s appeal to the board as untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The board denied Atlantic Mutual\u2019s motion to dismiss because it concluded that Fireman\u2019s Fund lacked proper notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision, and reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision, holding that Atlantic Mutual, as Burlington Coat Factory\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier at the time of the plaintiffs injury, solely was liable for the plaintiffs medical and disability expenses as a result of the second injury. The board determined that the plaintiff had in fact suffered two separate and distinct injuries to her left foot: (1) the single accident in 1988; and (2) a second injury resulting from multiple years of repetitive trauma. The board concluded that the apportionment scheme under \u00a7 31-299b was inapplicable because that statute addresses single injuries such as occupational diseases or repetitive traumas, namely, conditions resulting from a \u201cperiod of prolonged exposure spanning a time continuum involving multiple employers or insurers.\u201d In the board\u2019s view, \u00a7 31-299b was not intended to \u201capportion liability among two or more entirely separate and identifiable injuries.\u201d The board then relied on our decision in <em>Fimiani </em>v. <em>Star Gallo Distributors, Inc., </em>248 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>635, 729 A.2d 212 (1999), and concluded that, despite the closing of the second injury fund to new claims and our decision in <em>Mund </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 Cooperative, Inc., </em>139 Conn. 338, 94 A.2d 19 (1952), \u00a7 31-349 required that the employer and its carrier at the time of the second injury remain solely liable for all expenses stemming from that injury, \u201cdespite the role the . . . first injury played in causing [the] current condition.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Atlantic Mutual claims that the board improperly denied its motion to dismiss the appeal of Fireman\u2019s Fund as untimely after concluding that Fireman\u2019s Fund lacked proper notice under General Statutes \u00a7 31-321<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> sufficient to trigger the ten day appeal period provided under General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 31-301 (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Atlantic Mutual also makes two apportionment claims that are conceptually related, despite having bases on distinct statutory grounds. In addressing these claims, we first review the history of the law governing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>availability of apportionment in both the second injury and occupational disease or repetitive trauma settings. See part III A of this opinion. With this valuable historical perspective, we then address Atlantic Mutual\u2019s contentions that the board improperly: (1) concluded that \u00a7 31-349 abrogated common-law apportionment and that \u00a7 31-349 (d) renders the insurer at the time of the employee\u2019s second injury solely liable for disability claims that previously would have been transferred to the second injury fund, even when the second injury was aggravated by the prior compensable injury; and (2) concluded that the apportionment scheme of \u00a7 31-299b applies only to cases of repetitive trauma or occupational disease, and not to situations when the claimant has suffered two entirely separate and distinct injuries. We disagree with all of Atlantic Mutual\u2019s claims, and we affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Atlantic Mutual\u2019s claims involve the board\u2019s construction of various workers\u2019 compensation statutes. These claims, therefore, are all governed by the same standard of review. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>232 Conn. 311, 317, 654 A.2d 1221 (1995). \u201cIt is well established that [although not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and [the compensation] review board. . . . However, [w]e have determined . . . that the traditional deference accorded to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statutory term is unwarranted when the construction of a statute . . . has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny [or to] ... a governmental agency\u2019s time-tested interpretation . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Southington, </em>259 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Conn. 783, 787, 792 A.2d 76 (2002); see also <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 317. We have not previously construed the statutes at issue in this context. Our review in this case is, therefore, plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In construing the workers\u2019 compensation statutes at issue, we follow the method of statutory interpretation recently articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 816 A.2d 562 (2003). \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Thus, this process requires us to consider all relevant sources of the meaning of the language at issue, without having to cross any threshold or thresholds of ambiguity. Thus, we do not follow the plain meaning rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u201cIn performing this task, we begin with a searching examination of the language of the statute, because that is the most important factor to be considered. In doing so, we attempt to determine its range of plausible meanings and, if possible, narrow that range to those that appear most plausible. We do not, however, end with the language. We recognize, further, that the purpose or purposes of the legislation, and the context of the language, broadly understood, are directly relevant to the meaning of the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u201cThis does not mean, however, that we will not, in a given case, follow what may be regarded as the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>meaning of the language, namely, the meaning that, when the language is considered without reference to any extratextual sources of its meaning, appears to be <em>the </em>meaning and that appears to preclude any other likely meaning. In such a case, the more strongly the bare text supports such a meaning, the more persuasive the extratextual sources of meaning will have to be in order to yield a different meaning.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 577-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">TIMELINESS OF FIREMAN\u2019S FUND\u2019S APPEAL TO THE BOARD</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">We first consider Atlantic Mutual\u2019s claim that the board improperly rejected its motion to dismiss Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s appeal for lack of timeliness because Fireman\u2019s Fund did not file its first petition for review until after the expiration of the ten day appeal period set forth under \u00a7 31-301 (a). Atlantic Mutual claims that the board improperly concluded that receipt by counsel for Fireman\u2019s Fund of a facsimile (fax) of the commissioner\u2019s decision one day before the expiration of the ten day appeal period was not proper notice of the decision under \u00a7 31-321 and, therefore, did not preclude Fireman\u2019s Fund from filing its appeal after the expiration of the prescribed time limit. We agree with the board\u2019s ruling and conclude that the fax did not constitute proper notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision under \u00a7 31-321.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of this claim. The commissioner issued its decision on December 4, 2000. Firemen\u2019s Fund filed two petitions for review of the commissioner\u2019s decision with the board; the first on December 22, 2000, and the second on January 8, 2001. Firemen\u2019s Fund was and continues to be represented by the law firm Genovese, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Vehslage and LaRose<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Genovese). In February, 2000, Genovese moved its office from Farmington to Rocky Hill. The workers\u2019 compensation commission (commission) was duly notified and began routinely to send all hearing notices to Genovese\u2019s Rocky Hill address starting on March 1, 2000. When it notified Genovese of the commissioner\u2019s award in the present case, however, the commission mistakenly mailed the requisite notice to Genovese\u2019s previous address in Farmington. This error delayed Genovese\u2019s receipt of the certified letter; it did not receive the letter until January 3, 2001, while the other parties or their counsel all received their copies of the decision by December 6, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">On December 13, 2000, Genovese personnel contacted the commission\u2019s district office to inquire whether a decision had been issued in the present case. At approximately 2:30 p.m. that day, nine days after the commissioner had issued its decision, a commission employee faxed a copy of the decision to Genovese. Genovese, thus, had actual notice of the decision one day before the appeal deadline. Genovese, however, did not file Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s first petition to the board for review until December 22, 2000. Atlantic Mutual moved to dismiss the appeal as untimely filed. The board denied the motion, citing our decision in <em>Kudlacz </em>v. <em>Lindberg Heat Treating Co., </em>250 Conn. 581, 738 A.2d 135 (1999), as \u201cimplicitly [contemplating] the delivery of notice via certified mail or other equivalent service under \u00a7 31-321 as a necessary component of meaningful notice for the purpose of determining appeal periods under \u00a7 31-301 (a).\u201d The board, therefore, concluded that a party\u2019s responsive obligation, such as the need to file a timely appeal, could not be triggered in the absence of the commissioner\u2019s compliance with statutorily prescribed delivery methods.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>We have interpreted \u00a7 31-301 (a) to \u201cinclude a requirement of notice to the party who might wish to appeal.\u201d <em>Trinkley </em>v. <em>Ella Grasso Regional Center, </em>220 Conn. 739, 743, 601 A.2d 515 (1992). This construction is mandated by \u201c[fjundamental rights to procedural due process . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. In light of this compelling concern, we have articulated a framework to determine the commencement and tolling of the ten day appeal period under \u00a7 31-301 (a). That period begins to run on the date the commissioner <em>sends </em>notice of the decision to the party. <em>Kulig </em>v. <em>Crown Supermarket, </em>250 Conn. 603, 604, 738 A.2d 613 (1999); see also <em>Conaci </em>v. <em>Hartford Hospital, </em>36 Conn. App. 298, 303, 650 A.2d 613 (1994). If the party is represented by counsel, the ten day appeal period begins to run on the date that the commissioner sends notice to counsel. <em>Schreck </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>250 Conn. 592, 598, 737 A.2d 916 (1999). The ten day appeal period is tolled if \u201cthe aggrieved party establishes that, through no fault of [its] own, [it] did not receive notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision within ten days of the date that it was sent.\u201d <em>Kudlacz </em>v. <em>Lindberg Heat Treating Co., </em>supra, 250 Conn. 590-91. A party that has established that it failed to receive notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision through no fault of its own \u201calso must establish that the appeal was filed within ten days from the date that [it] actually received notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision.\u201d Id., 591 n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The notice requirement of \u00a7 31-301 (a) has constitutional significance. See id., 588; <em>Trinkley </em>v. <em>Ella Grasso Regional Center, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 743. We have recognized the \u201cobvious unfairness inherent in depriving an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>aggrieved party of the right to appeal the commissioner\u2019s decision solely because of a failure of notice beyond that party\u2019s control,\u201d and we have stated that \u201cwe will not lightly presume that the legislature intended such a result. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Kudlacz </em>v. <em>Lindberg Heat Treating Co., </em>supra, 250 Conn. 588. <em>Kron </em>v. <em>Thelen, </em>178 Conn. 189, 423 A.2d 857 (1979), is particularly instructive on this point. In <em>Kron, </em>we held that, when the Probate Court \u201cby mistake or accident,\u201d failed to inform the plaintiff of its decision, \u201c[t]he plaintiffs statutory right of appeal could not be defeated by the mistake of the Probate Court\u201d; id., 196; and that \u201cthe statute fixing the time of appeal from a decree of the Probate Court is subject to the implied requirement that the court give notice of its decree before the thirty-day appeal period becomes operative.\u201d Id., 197. In rendering our decision in <em>Kron, </em>we recognized that \u201c[fundamental tenets of due process . . . require that all persons directly concerned in the result of an abdication be given reasonable notice and the opportunity to present their claims or defenses.\u201d Id., 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">We now turn to whether the fax from the commission constitutes proper notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision. Section 31-321 defines proper notice in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings as follows: \u201cUnless otherwise specifically provided, or unless the circumstances of the case or the rules of the commission direct otherwise, any notice required under this chapter to be served upon an employer, employee or commissioner shall be by written or printed notice, <em>service personally or by registered or certified mail </em>addressed to the person upon whom it is to be served at his last-known residence or place of business. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">When a statute providing a party with a time-sensitive right to appeal contains service and notice prescriptions, we usually have required strict compliance with those procedural requirements. Cf. <em>Pacelli Bros. Trans</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>portation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pacelli, </em>189 Conn. 401, 414, 456 A.2d 325 (1983) (\u201c[w]here a party seeks the benefit of a statute requiring a prescribed form of notice to trigger its operation, we have insisted upon strict compliance with the statutory requirement\u201d); <em>Tarnopol </em>v. <em>Connecticut Siting Council, </em>212 Conn. 157, 163-64, 561 A.2d 931 (1989) (\u201c[a] statutory right to appeal [from the determination of an administrative agency] may be taken advantage of only by strict compliance with the statutory provisions by which it is created\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in <em>Kindl </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>69 Conn. App. 563,573-74, 795 A.2d 622 (2002). Furthermore, although the legislative history is silent on this issue, the statute\u2019s language evinces the legislature\u2019s intent to restrict permissible methods of service under \u00a7 31-321 to personal delivery and registered or certified mail. When construed in light of the \u201ctenet of statutory construction known as expressio unius est exclusio alter\u00e1is, translated as the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Marrocco </em>v. <em>Giardino, </em>255 Conn. 617, 637, 767 A.2d 720 (2001); the language of \u00a7 31-321 indicates that the legislature considered only personal delivery and registered or certified letters as acceptable methods of service. See also <em>Chairman, Criminal Justice Commission </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 193, 200, 585 A.2d 96 (1991) (\u201c[a] statute which provides that a thing shall be done in a certain way carries with it an implied prohibition against doing that thing in any other way\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Accordingly, our construction of \u00a7 31-321 and \u00a7 31-301 (a) leads us to conclude that strict compliance with the statutory methods of service under \u00a7 31-321 is necessary to constitute meaningful notice under \u00a7 31-301 (a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Atlantic Mutual claims that compliance with \u00a7 31-321 is not necessary to satisfy the requirement of \u201cmeaningful notice.\u201d We disagree. In particular, Atlantic Mutual relies on <em>Vega </em>v. <em>Waltsco, Inc., </em>46 Conn. App. 298, 699 A.2d 247 (1997), and the board\u2019s decisions in <em>DeFelippi </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>4349 CRB-5-01-1 (January 15, 2002), and <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>New Haven Register, </em>1945 CRB-3-94-1 (September 6, 1995). Atlantic Mutual\u2019s reliance on these cases for this proposition is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">In <em>DeFelippi, </em>the board held that despite the dictates of \u00a7 31-321, a party could <em>protect </em>its right to appeal by faxing a copy of its petition to the board on the tenth day, while mailing the original and required copies for arrival on the following day. In <em>Fleming, </em>a claimant moved to preclude the employer\u2019s notice of intention to contest liability because the employer had sent the forms to the claimant and commission via regular mail, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>not certified or registered mail, as required under \u00a7 31-321. The board affirmed the commissioner\u2019s denial of the motion to preclude, concluding that \u201cequitable considerations\u201d play apart in the statute\u2019s application, that the applicable time limitations were complied with, and that the claimant was not prejudiced by the violation. <em>DeFelippi </em>and <em>Fleming </em>are, therefore, both distinguishable from the present case, which involves the commission\u2019s potentially harmful, and not a litigant\u2019s harmless, noncompliance with the rule dictating the form of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Atlantic Mutual\u2019s reliance on <em>Vega </em>v. <em>Waltsco, Inc., </em>supra, 46 Conn. App. 298, is similarly misplaced. In <em>Vega, </em>the Appellate Court distinguished workers\u2019 compensation cases from regular civil matters and held that to commence the running of the ten day appeal period, \u201cmeaningful notice\u201d of a decision does not require the board to send notice concurrently to a represented party\u2019s attorney, so long as notice is sent to the party itself. Id., 303. In <em>Vega, </em>the Appellate Court defined \u201cmeaningful notice\u201d as \u201cthe content of notice that is required to inform adequately the aggrieved party of the commissioner\u2019s findings. Meaningful notice gives the aggrieved party sufficient information to make a knowledgeable decision as to the next step in the litigation process.\u201d Id., 304. Indeed, <em>Vega\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cmeaningful notice\u201d demands the conclusion we reach in the present case. We note that, unlike most other methods of service, including fax, the methods prescribed by the legislature in \u00a7 31-321, e.g., certified mail, provide the recipient, the board, and the courts with specific knowledge and definite proof of when the commission actually <em>sent </em>notice of its decision. This is indisputably essential information that a party needs \u201cto make a knowledgeable decision as to the next step in the litigation process\u201d; id.; particularly in light of our previous holdings that the relevant ten day appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>period begins when notice of the decision is <em>sent </em>by the commission. See <em>Kulig </em>v. <em>Crown Supermarket, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 604; <em>Schreck </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 598; <em>Kudlacz </em>v. <em>Lindberg Heat Treating Co., </em>supra, 250 Conn. 590-91. We, therefore, conclude that the commission\u2019s failure to comply strictly with statutorily prescribed methods of notice and service under \u00a7 31-321 will not trigger a party\u2019s obligation to file an appeal under \u00a7 31-301 (a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, the board properly denied Atlantic Mutual\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">THE AVAILABILITY OF APPORTIONMENT UNDER \u00a7 31-349</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">We now turn to Atlantic Mutual\u2019s claims that the board improperly concluded that it is precluded from seeking apportionment under the common law. Specifically, Atlantic Mutual contends that the board improperly determined that: (1) \u00a7 31-349 abrogated common-law apportionment in second injury cases; and (2) that \u00a7 31-349 (d), which closed the second injury fund to new claims, requires the insurer at the time of the second injury to retain sole liability for a claimant\u2019s second injury. We disagree with these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">We recognize that the legislature does not act in a vacuum; accordingly, consideration of the historical circumstances surrounding enactments informs our determination of the legislature\u2019s policy goals. Our review of the circumstances surrounding the enactment of, and subsequent modifications to, the second injury fund legislation provides us with valuable insight into whether the legislature intended: (1) \u00a7 31-349 to abrogate common-law apportionment; and (2) by closing the second injury fund to new claims in \u00a7 31-349 (d), to require the insurer at the time of the second injury to become solely liable for that claim. Accordingly, we consider case law in existence when the legislation was enacted because \u201c[w]e have repeatedly observed that traditional common law principles can inform the General Statutes and can assist us in determining how the statutes are to be interpreted and applied.\u201d <em>Rich-Taubman Associates </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>236 Conn. 613, 620, 674 A.2d 805 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Our historical perspective on second injury liability begins with this court\u2019s decision in <em>Mages </em>v. <em>Alfred, Brown, Inc., </em>123 Conn. 188, 193 A. 780 (1937), which was decided after the enactment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, but prior to the creation of the second injury fund. In <em>Mages, </em>the claimant sustained separate compensable injuries on two occasions, one, to his spine, while working for a coal company in 1935, and the other, to his left shoulder and back, while working for an oil delivery company in 1936. Id., 190. The coal company fully compensated the claimant for his 1935 injury. Id. At the time of his second injury, the claimant had not fully recovered from the first injury. Id. The commissioner had concluded that the existing damage from the already-compensated first injury was a substantial contributing factor to the disability resulting from the second injury. Id. This court held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>second employer was solely responsible for compensating the claimant for all of the consequences of the second injury, concluding that the first employer already had \u201ccompensated him in full for the first injury and ... is not liable for the present disability, caused solely by the second accident.\u201d Id., 195. In so holding, the court distinguished the earlier decision in <em>Plecity v.McLachlan Hat Co., </em>116 Conn. 216,164 A. 707 (1933), which allowed common-law apportionment in a case where \u201cthree insurers had issued successive policies, each covering part of a period of employment extending over several years; the plaintiff suffered a single injury [mercury poisoning] to which his employment during the entire period materially contributed; and . . . held that the policies were to be construed to impose liability upon all three of them.\u201d <em>Mages </em>v. <em>Alfred Brown, Inc., </em>supra, 195. The court emphasized, in <em>Mages, </em>the distinction between the two separate compensable injuries sustained on different occasions at issue in that case, and the single injury suffered over an extended period of time in Plecity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Id. This court\u2019s decision in <em>Mages </em>also reflected the general guiding principle of workers\u2019 compensation law, that \u201ccompensation does not depend upon the condition of health of the employee or upon his freedom from liability to injury through a constitutional weakness or latent tendency. If the injury is the cause of the disability, it is compensable even though such an injury might not have caused the disabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>ity if occurring to a healthy employee or even an average employee.\u201d Id., 192. We have noted that, as a result of this general rule, \u201c[e]mployers . . . hesitated to hire handicapped persons because if a previously injured or disabled employee were then injured on the job, the employer would be required to compensate the employee for the entire resulting disability even though the severity of the second injury might have been attributable substantially to the preexisting condition.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 319-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">To address this problem, in 1945, \u201cthe legislature established the [second injury] fund, primarily to encourage the employment of persons with an existing disability and, at the same time, to provide adequate workers\u2019 compensation benefits for them.\u201d Id., 320. Its enactment was spurred by the return of injured World War II veterans to the workforce. 38 H.R. Proc., Pt. 16, 1995 Sess., p. 5946, remarks of Representative James O\u2019Rourke. The second injury fund also was intended to \u201crelieve employers from the hardship of liability for those consequences of compensable injury not attributable to their employment . . . especially considering that the combined effect of a successive injury to someone with a preexisting disability can far exceed the combined allowances for each injury existing separately.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 320. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>\u201c[U]nder the second injury scheme enacted in 1945, an employer was required to pay only that portion of benefits that were attributable to the second injury, and the fund was required to pay any compensation that was attributable to the claimant\u2019s prior injury.\u201d <em>Fimiani </em>v. <em>Star Gallo Distributors, Inc., </em>supra, 248 Conn. 645. Liability was determined and apportioned on a case-by-case basis. Id., 646. The scope of the injuries covered under the original second injury fund legislation, however, was quite limited.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The next major development occurred in 1952 with this court\u2019s decision in <em>Mund </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 Cooperative, Inc., </em>supra, 139 Conn. 338. In <em>Mund, </em>the court held that liability for the claimant\u2019s injuries could be apportioned between his employer\u2019s first and second insurers. Id., 344. In <em>Mund, </em>the claimant sustained a back injury in 1946 that rendered him totally, but temporarily, disabled. Id., 340. The injury was diagnosed as a possible ruptured disc at the fourth and fifth lumbar interspace, complicated by existing \u201ccongenital anomalies.\u201d Id. The claimant\u2019s recovery was slow and, by January, 1950, he was diagnosed with a 15 percent permanent disability as a result of the 1946 injury. Id. In June, 1950, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>plaintiff sustained another accidental injury at work that reopened his original ruptured disc. Id., 341. The claimant\u2019s employer had different workers\u2019 compensation insurers in 1946 and 1950. Id., 340. The commissioner had concluded that the \u201ctwo accidents were equal, concurrent and contributing causes of the plaintiffs disability since that date, the second injury being superimposed upon and an aggravation of the condition remaining from the first injury.\u201d Id., 341. This court accepted the commissioner\u2019s determination regarding causation and concluded that, on the facts, the claimant\u2019s injury in <em>Mund </em>was more analogous to the single injury with multiple insurers scenario <em>of Plecity, </em>wherein this court permitted apportionment, than to the two separate injuries of <em>Mages, </em>in which the second employer was solely hable.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Id., 344-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In 1959, and again in 1967, the legislature made significant changes to the second injury fund legislation. The 1959 amendment eliminated the enumerated list of eligible injuries, replacing it with the far more comprehensive terms of \u201cpreexisting incapacity\u201d and \u201cinjury.\u201d See Public Acts 1959, No. 580, \u00a7 11. In 1967, the legislature streamlined the administrative process and attempted to eliminate the difficulties inherent in the existing case-by-case apportionment process by amending \u00a7 31-349 to limit the employer\u2019s liability for a second injury to a predetermined period of 104 weeks. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 320-21, citing Public Acts 1967, No. 842, \u00a7 20. \u201cThis allocation of liability was intended to charge the employer only with an approximation of those benefits attributable solely to the second, employment related injury,\u201d with the second injury fund assuming sole liability for benefits paid after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>initial 104 weeks. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 320. This allocation reflected a legislative determination that benefits paid after 104 weeks would be attributable to the preexisting injury. <em>Fimiani </em>v. <em>Star Gallo Distributors, Inc., </em>supra, 248 Conn. 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In 1995, the legislature, responding to the recommendation of a blue ribbon commission, closed the second injury fund to new claims in an effort to reduce the financial burden on the fund, which had, in the apt words of one representative, \u201cbecome a major financial disaster or near-disaster that possibly threatened the future economic health of our state.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> 38 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 5946, remarks of Representative O\u2019Rourke; see also <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 311,319, 702 A.2d 1180 (1997). The legislature amended subsection (d) of \u00a7 31-349 through No. 95-277, \u00a7 3, of the 1995 Public Acts (P.A. 95-277), which closed the second injury fund to claims for injuries occurring on or after July 1, 1995. Section 31-349 (d) provides in relevant part: \u201cAll such claims shall remain the responsibility of the employer or its insurer under the provisions of this section.\u201d When it enacted the 1995 amendment, during debate, the legislature implicitly acknowledged the policy behind the original second injury fund legislation, which was to prevent employment discrimination against the disabled. See 38 S. Proc., Pt. 15, 1995 Sess., p. 5485, remarks of Senator John Kissel; 38 H.R. Proc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>supra, p. 5946, remarks of Representative O\u2019Rourke. Senator Kissel stated, however, that \u201cthe original reason for having the Second Injury Fund ... no longer exists\u201d because \u201c[s]ince the end of World War II, many changes have taken place, not only in the State of Connecticut, but in the United States. We\u2019ve had the Americans with Disabilities Act as well as many other state and federal laws which guarantee an individuals right to be hired, even if they have some sort of disability or handicap.\u201d 38 S. Proc., supra, p. 5485. With the benefit of this historical background, we now turn to the issue of whether the legislature intended (1) \u00a7 31-349 to abrogate common-law apportionment in second injury cases, and (2) by closing the second injury fund to new claims in \u00a7 31-349 (d), to require the insurer at the time of the second injury to become solely liable for that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Atlantic Mutual claims that the board improperly concluded that common-law apportionment is no longer available to second injury employers and their insurers because it was abrogated by \u00a7 31-349. Specifically, Atlantic Mutual contends that, when second injury fund relief is not available, our decision in <em>Mund </em>v. <em>Farmers' Cooperative, Inc., </em>supra, 139 Conn. 338, stands for the proposition that the second injury employer or its insurer may seek apportionment of liability with previous employers or insurers. Atlantic Mutual further claims that the board incorrectly inteipreted our decision in <em>Fimiani </em>v. <em>Star Gallo Distributors, Inc., </em>supra, 248 Conn. 645, as rendering the second employer solely liable for the consequences of the second injury. Finally, Atlantic Mutual maintains that precluding apportionment will frustrate the legislative objective of preventing disability-based employment discrimination. We disagree, and we address these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>We first address Atlantic Mutual\u2019s contention that our decision in <em>Mund </em>provides for common-law apportionment when second injury fund relief is unavailable. We disagree because <em>Mund </em>did not contemplate two separate and distinct injuries; rather, it was decided in a context involving aggravation of a <em>single preexisting </em>injury. <em>Mund </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 Cooperative, Inc., </em>supra, 139 Conn. 344. In permitting apportionment of liability for the claimant\u2019s injuries, this court\u2019s application of common-law causation principles<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> led the court to conclude that the situation in <em>Mund </em>was much closer to the single progressive occupational disease found in <em>Plecity </em>v. <em>McLachlan Hat Co., </em>supra, 116 Conn. 228, than to the separate and distinct injuries found in <em>Mages </em>v. <em>Alfred Brown, Inc., </em>supra, 123 Conn. 195, wherein apportionment was not permitted. <em>Mund </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 Cooperative, Inc., </em>supra, 344. We, therefore, characterize <em>Mund </em>as a repetitive trauma case, that, along with <em>Plecity, </em>served as part of the genesis of \u00a7 31-299b, <em>not </em>\u00a7 31-349. See footnote 13 of this opinion; see also part IV of this opinion. In light of this distinction, our preceding historical analysis, and the holding in <em>Mages </em>v. <em>Alfred Brown, Inc., </em>supra, 195, we conclude that common-law apportionment between employers and insurers simply did not exist in a case of separate and distinct second injuries. Inasmuch as our inquiry is framed by the unchallenged factual conclusion that the plaintiff had in fact suffered two separate and distinct injuries to her left foot, no such apportionment is available in the present case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>We next address Atlantic Mutual\u2019s claim that the board incorrectly interpreted our decision in <em>Fimiani </em>as rendering the second employer solely liable for the consequences of the second injury. We disagree. In <em>Fimiani, </em>we addressed the issue of whether \u00a7 31-349 permitted the \u201c[second injury] fund to accept liability only for the portion of benefits due a claimant that is attributable solely to the claimant\u2019s second injury . . . .\u201d <em>Fimiani </em>v. <em>Star Gallo Distributors, Inc., </em>supra, 248 Conn. 642. We rejected the second injury fund\u2019s argument \u201cthat it is responsible for the portion of the benefits that is attributable only to the <em>second </em>injury . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 646. In making this argument, the second injury fund contended: \u201c[T]he phrase [in \u00a7 31-349 (a)] \u2018less any compensation benefits payable or paid with respect to the previous disability\u2019 indicates an intention by the legislature to hold the first injury employer hable for compensation relating to the first injury.\u201d Id., 647. We rejected this claim, noting: \u201c[B]y its terms, \u00a7 31-349 requires the employer at the time of the second injury to pay all benefits during the first 104 weeks of the claimant\u2019s disability. Thereafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the fund similarly is required to accept \u2018all responsibility\u2019 for the benefits due to the claimant.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Id., 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Although the second injury fund is not the party seeking apportionment in the present case, we conclude that the board properly relied on our reasoning in <em>Fimiani </em>when it concluded that the second injury employer and its insurer at the time of that injury were solely liable for the plaintiffs injuries. In <em>Fimiani, </em>we made clear the proposition that after the second injury employer or its insurer paid the claimant benefits for 104 weeks, the second injury fund became completely responsible for all of the benefits due to the claimant. Id., 651. Under <em>Fimiani, </em>the first employer or its insurer simply bears no responsibility for the consequences of the second injury. Taken in the context of \u00a7 31-349 (d), which provides that \u201c[a]ll such claims shall remain the responsibility of the employer or its insurer,\u201d we conclude that the board\u2019s reliance on <em>Fimiani </em>was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">We further disagree with Atlantic Mutual\u2019s contention that precluding apportionment will frustrate the legislative objective of preventing disability-based employment discrimination. \u201cStatements of legislators often provide strong indication of legislative intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ehlers, </em>252 Conn. 579, 593, 750 A.2d 1079 (2000). The legislative history indicates that, on closing the second injury fund to new claims, the legislature contemplated the second injury employer or its insurer remaining solely liable for the consequences of the second injury.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> During the House <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>debate on P.A. 95-277, Representative O\u2019Rourke stated: \u201c[W]e close the fund to the vast majority of claims that it now accepts, returning these cases to the regular Workers\u2019 Compensation system where they belong.\u201d 38 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 5948. We also infer this intent from the continuing concern expressed by certain legislators about preventing employment discrimination, as well as their recognition that employers are now bound by antidiscrimination laws<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> that did not exist when the second injury fund legislation first was enacted. See 38 S. Proc., supra, p. 5485, remarks of Senator Kissel. In light of these facts, we conclude that precluding apportionment in second injury cases does not undermine the legislature\u2019s objective of preventing employment discrimination on the basis of physical disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Atlantic Mutual also claims that the board improperly concluded that \u00a7 31-349 (d) renders the employer or its insurer at the time of the second injury solely liable for the claim. We disagree. We reach this conclusion based on our reading of the language of \u00a7 31-349 (d) in the context of the entire Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, as well as our review of the pertinent legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u201cAs with any issue of statutory interpretation, our initial guide is the language of the statutory provisions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shawhan </em>v. <em>Langley, </em>249 Conn. 339, 344, 732 A.2d 170 (1999); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 564. \u201c [Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nizzardo </em>v. <em>State Traffic Commission, </em>259 Conn. 131,158, 788 A.2d 1158 (2002). We presume that when the legislature enacted \u00a7 31-349 (d), it was aware of and considered the language contained in the other provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. See <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>v. <em>New London, </em>236 Conn. 710, 717, 674 A.2d 845 (1996). \u201c[W]e are guided by the principle that the legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law .... [T]his tenet of statutory construction . . . requires us to read statutes together when they relate to the same subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pantanella </em>v. <em>Enfield Ford, Inc., </em>65 Conn. App. 46, 55, 782 A.2d 141, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 930, 783 A.2d 1029 (2001) . Accordingly, \u201c[i]n determining the meaning of a statute . . . we look not only at the provision at issue, but also to the broader statutory scheme to ensure the coherency of our construction.\u201d <em>Schiano </em>v. <em>Bliss Exterminating Co., </em>260 Conn. 21, 42, 792 A.2d 835 (2002) . \u201cWhere a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject ... is significant to show that a different intention existed. . . . That tenet of statutory construction is well grounded because [t]he General Assembly is always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or non-action will have upon any one of them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>v. <em>New London, </em>supra, 717. \u201cWe have previously recognized that our construction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act should make every part operative and harmonious with every other part insofar as is possible .... In applying these principles, we are mindful that the legislature is presumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>to have intended a just and rational result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schroeder </em>v. <em>Triangulum Associates, </em>259 Conn. 325, 339, 789 A.2d 459 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The relevant language of \u00a7 31-349 (d) provides: \u201cAll such claims <em>shall remain the responsibility </em>of the employer or its insurer . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Atlantic Mutual contends that, although this provision renders the second injury employer or its insurer liable for the second injuiy, it does not preclude apportionment because it does not state \u201cwho is to pay the entire disability.\u201d We disagree with this interpretation because, in \u00a7 31-299b, the legislature explicitly provided for an apportionment scheme in the single injury and multiple employer or insurer scenario. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 31-299b; see also part IV of this opinion. The relevant apportionment language in General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 31-299b provides that \u201cthe employer who last employed the claimant prior to the filing of the claim, or the employer\u2019s insurer, shall be <em>initially liable </em>for the payment of such compensation. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) That statute then sets out an elaborate mandatory fact-finding and apportionment procedure for the commissioner to follow should the commissioner issue an award pursuant to that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In comparison, \u00a7 31-349 (d) is completely devoid of even the suggestion of any such procedure or language. Moreover, when the legislature enacted \u00a7 31-349 (d), \u00a7 31-299b and its apportionment scheme already had been in existence for approximately fifteen years. We also note that, although the legislative history of \u00a7 31-349 (d) reflects the General Assembly\u2019s concern about disability-based employment discrimination, the recorded history is completely silent about apportionment as a means of preventing such discrimination. See 38 S. Proc., supra, p. 5485, remarks of Senator Kissel; 38 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 5948, remarks of Representative O\u2019Rourke; see also footnote 21 of this opinion. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u201c[r]elated statutory provisions, or statutes in pari materia, often provide guidance in determining the meaning of a particular word [or phrase]\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Dept. of Correction, </em>221 Conn. 41,45-46,601 A.2d 539 (1992); the absence of apportionment language in \u00a7 31-349 (d), taken in the context of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in its entirety, leads us to determine that the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 31-349 (d), intended that the last employer be solely liable for the benefits of the second injury. We, therefore, conclude that apportionment is not an available form of relief for the second injury employer or its insurer under \u00a7 31-349 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">THE AVAILABILITY OF APPORTIONMENT UNDER \u00a7 31-299b</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Finally, we address Atlantic Mutual\u2019s claim that the board improperly concluded that the apportionment scheme under \u00a7 31-299b applies only to cases of repetitive trauma or occupational disease, and not to situations where the claimant suffers two entirely separate and distinct injuries. We disagree and conclude that the application of \u00a7 31-299b is limited to cases of ongoing repetitive trauma or occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 31-299b provides in relevant part: \u201cIf an employee suffers an <em>injury or disease </em>for which compensation is found by the commissioner to be payable according to the provisions of this chapter, the employer who last employed the claimant prior to the filing of the claim, or the employer\u2019s insurer, shall be <em>initially liable </em>for the payment of such compensation. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) The issue presented, therefore, is whether the legislature intended the term \u201cinjury or disease,\u201d as used in \u00a7 31-299b, to apply only to single instances of occupational diseases and repetitive trauma, and not to the consequences of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>separate injuries on separate occasions. We conclude that the legislature so intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Our conclusion as to the legislature\u2019s intent finds ample support in the language of the section, the pertinent legislative history, and the canons of statutory construction. \u201cAs with any issue of statutory interpretation, our initial guide is the language of the statutory provisions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shawhan </em>v. <em>Langley, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 344; <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 564. We note that the pertinent language of \u00a7 31-299b, \u201can injury or disease,\u201d uses nouns in the singular, rather than the plural. This choice of language suggests that the legislature contemplated a scenario of multiple employers or insurers bearing responsibility for a single injury suffered by an employee\u2014i.e., an occupational disease that developed over the course of an employee\u2019s career. Cf. <em>Shawhan </em>v. <em>Langley, </em>supra, 344 (\u201c[t]he language of the [offer of judgment] statute, which is framed in the singular, suggests, albeit not unambiguously or conclusively, that the statute contemplates one offer of judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Moreover, the legislative history of \u00a7 31-299b indicates that the legislature intended the statute to apply only to occupational diseases and repetitive trauma. \u201cStatements of legislators often provide strong indication of legislative intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ehlers, </em>supra, 252 Conn. 593. In debates on the bill in the Senate shortly before it was adopted, Senator Michael J. Skelley, then chairman of the labor committee, explained that the statute was intended to secure rapid, full compensation for employees in injury cases where there are multiple employers or insurance carriers.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> 24 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1981 Sess., p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>1416. Senator Skelley also expressly referred to the problems that coverage disputes created, \u201cparticularly [in] occupational disease casefs].\u201d Id. In further explaining the bill and its apportionment provision, Senator Skelley used an example of a construction employee developing mesothelioma as a result of multiple exposures to asbestos. Id., p. 1418.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Moreover, \u201c[i]t is now well settled that testimony before legislative committees may be considered in determining the particular problem or issue that the legislature sought to address by the legislation. . . . This is because legislation is a purposive act . . . and, therefore, identifying the particular problem that the legislature sought to resolve helps to identify the purpose or purposes for which the legislature used the language in question.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Matey </em>v. <em>Estate of Dember, </em>256 Conn. 456, 484-85, 774 A.2d 113 (2001). In the present case, testimony before the joint standing labor committee indicates that the legislature was contemplating single injuries or illnesses. For example, Betty Tianti, then secretary-treasurer of the Connecticut AFL-CIO, testified that the bill \u201cspeaks to one of the problems . . . insofar as the asbestos count is concerned. In the case of occupational illnesses, quite often the gestation comes over a long period of time .... Or, in the case of repetitive trauma . . . you have a period of maybe ten, 15, 20 years, at which time you could have changed your job or the employer could have changed a carrier and you come to a point in time where the illness or the injury is definitely determined to be work related. \u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Public Employees, Pt. 2, 1981 Sess., p. 340. In explaining his organization\u2019s position opposing the bill\u2019s apportionment provision, Douglas Bamert, regional vice president of the Alliance of American Insurers, made multiple references to \u201coccupational disease claims\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>and multiple exposures. Id., p. 355. Indeed, a colloquy between Bamert and Senator Skelley refers, by way of example, to silicosis, an occupational disease. See id., p. 358. All other recorded testimony discusses the bill\u2019s impact in addressing multiple exposures in occupational disease cases and does not mention separate instances of injury. See id., p. 358, remarks of John Anderson, counsel to the Connecticut Business Administrative Association; id., p. 378, remarks of James Brown, general counsel to the Insurance Association of Connecticut. The totality of the testimony taken by the labor committee indicates that, when the legislature enacted \u00a7 31-299b, it contemplated single injuries resulting from multiple exposures, such as repetitive trauma and occupational disease, not two or more entirely separate and identifiable injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Our conclusion that the legislature intended \u00a7 31-299b to cover only single injuries or illnesses is buttressed by our long-standing \u201c[presumption] that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes . . . and that [statutes are to be interpreted with regard to other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Matey </em>v. <em>Estate of Dember, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 480. When \u00a7 31-299b was enacted in 1981, \u00a7 31-349 had already been in effect for many years. The problem, therefore, of properly compensating employees who had suffered multiple, but separate and identifiable, injuries had, since 1945, been addressed under \u00a7 31-349 by the second injury fund. See, e.g., <em>Fimiani </em>v. <em>Star Gallo Distributors, Inc., </em>supra, 248 Conn. 643 (exploring legislative history). It follows that when the legislature enacted \u00a7 31-299b, its sole goal was to address the situation wherein an employee, suffering from a single occupational illness or repetitive trauma occasioned by multiple hazard exposures, was not receiving prompt and adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>compensation as a result of coverage disputes between employers or insurers. The legislature did not intend the scope of \u00a7 31-299b to include the very different situation that was addressed already by second injury legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Atlantic Mutual contends that the general definition of \u201c \u2018injury\u2019 \u201d provided by General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A), indicates that the legislature did not intend to limit the applicability of \u00a7 31-299b to repetitive trauma or occupational disease cases. We disagree. Section 31-275 (16) (A) provides: \u201c \u2018Personal injury\u2019 or \u2018injury\u2019 includes, in addition to accidental injury which may be definitely located as to the time when and the place where the accident occurred, an injury to an employee which is causally connected with his employment and is the direct result of repetitive trauma or repetitive acts incident to such employment, and occupational disease.\u201d Limiting the application of \u00a7 31-299b to cases of repetitive trauma or occupational disease, however, is not inconsistent with this definition. Common sense dictates that apportionment between various insurers or employers, as provided under \u00a7 31-299b, is unnecessary when the time and place of an accidental injury maybe pinpointed.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Connor </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>260 Conn. 435, 439, 797 A.2d 1081 (2002) (\u201c[i]n construing a statute, common sense must be used and courts must assume that a reasonable and rational result was intended\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Moreover, other definitions in \u00a7 31-275 expressly contemplate the second injury scenario in the present case by discussing terms such as \u201c \u2018[pjrevious disability,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018[s]econd disability,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018[s]econd injury.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>See General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (20), (22) and (23).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201cWe have previously recognized that our construction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act should make every part operative and harmonious with every other part insofar as is possible . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schroeder </em>v. <em>Triangulum Associates, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 339. We, therefore, reject Atlantic Mutual\u2019s argument that the definition of \u201c \u2018injury\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A) expands \u00a7 31-299b beyond a single instance of repetitive trauma or occupational disease. In light of the statute\u2019s language, legislative history and place within the workers\u2019 compensation statutory scheme, we conclude that the board properly determined that \u00a7 31-299b is applicable only to single instances of occupational disease or repetitive trauma and, therefore, properly refused to invoke the apportionment provision of \u00a7 31-299b.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The decision of the boar d is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">In this opinion BORDEN, KATZ and VERTEFEUILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 provides: \u201c(a) The fact that an employee has suffered a previous disability, shall not preclude him from compensation for a second injury, nor preclude compensation for death resulting from the second injury. If an employee having a previous disability incurs a second disability from a second injury resulting in a permanent disability caused by both the previous disability and the second injury which is materially and substantially greater than the disability that would have resulted from the second injury alone, he shall receive compensation for (1) the entire amount of disability, including total disability, less any compensation payable or paid with respect to the previous disability, and (2) necessary medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>care, as provided in this chapter, notwithstanding the fact that part of the disability was due to a previous disability. For purposes of this subsection, \u2018compensation payable or paid with respect to the previous disability\u2019 includes compensation payable or paid pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, as well as any other compensation payable or paid in connection with the previous disability, regardless of the source of such compensation. \u201c(b) As a condition precedent to the liability of the Second Injury Fund, the employer or its insurer shall: (1) Notify the custodian of the fund by certified mail no later than three calendar years after the date of injury or no later than ninety days after completion of payments for the first one hundred and four weeks of disability, whichever is earlier, of its intent to transfer liability for the claim to the Second Injury Fund; (2) include with the notification (A) copies of all medical reports, (B) an accounting of all benefits paid, (C) copies of all findings, awards and approved voluntary agreements, (D) the employer\u2019s or insurer\u2019s estimate of the reserve amount to ultimate value for the claim, (E) a two-thousand-dollar notification fee payable to the custodian to cover the fund\u2019s costs in evaluating the claim proposed to be transferred and (F) such other material as the custodian may require. The employer by whom the employee is employed at the time of the second injury, or its insurer, shall in the first instance pay all awards of compensation and all medical expenses provided by this chapter for the first one hundred four weeks of disability. Failure on the part of the employer or an insurer to comply does not relieve the employer or insurer of its obligation to continue furnishing compensation under the provisions of this chapter. The custodian of the fund shall, by certified mail, notify a self-insured employer or an insurer, as applicable, of the rejection of the claim within ninety days after receiving the completed notification. Any claim which is not rejected pursuant to this section shall be deemed accepted, unless the custodian notifies the self-insured employer or the insurer within the ninety-day period that up to an additional ninety days is necessary to determine if the claim for transfer will be accepted. If the claim is accepted for transfer, the custodian shall file with the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the district in which the claim was filed, a form indicating that the claim has been transferred to the Second Injury Fund and the date that such claim was transferred and shall refund fifteen hundred dollars of the notification fee to the self-insured employer or the insurer, as applicable. A copy of the form shall be mailed to the self-insured employer or the insurer and to the claimant. No further action by the commissioner shall be required to transfer said claim. If the custodian rejects the claim of the employer or its insurer, the question shall be submitted by certified mail within thirty days of the receipt of the notice of rejection by the employer or its insurer to the commissioner having jurisdiction, and the employer or insurer shall continue furnishing compensation until the outcome is finally decided. Claims not submitted to the commissioner within said time period shall be deemed withdrawn with prejudice. If the employer or insurer pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>vails, or if the custodian accepts the claim all payments made beyond the one-hundred-four-week period shall be reimbursed to the employer or insurer by the Second Injury Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u201c(c) If the second injury of an employee results in the death of the employee, and it is determined that the death would not have occurred except for a preexisting permanent physical impairment, the employer or its insurer shall, in the first instance, pay the funeral expense described in this chapter, and shall pay death benefits as may be due for the first one hundred four weeks. The employer or its insurer may thereafter transfer liability for the death benefits to the Second Injury Fund in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection (b) of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">\u201c(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, no injury which occurs on or after July 1, 1995, shall serve as a basis for transfer of a claim to the Second Injury Fund under this section.

No notification fee shall be required for notices submitted pursuant to this subsection.

I fully agree with and join the well reasoned majority opinion. I write separately solely to express my doubt about the viability, if any, of the concept of common-law apportionment in the context of our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>The concept apparently stems from this court\u2019s somewhat Delphic decision in <em>Mund </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 Cooperative, Inc., </em>139 Conn. 338, 344, 94 A.2d 19 (1952), in which we appeared to approve of common-law notions of apportionment of liability among employers and insurers. Since then, however, we repeatedly have stated that workers\u2019 compensation law is purely a matter of statute. See, e.g., <em>Cantoni </em>v. <em>Xerox Corp., </em>251 Conn. 153, 159-60, 740 A.2d 796 (1999); <em>Discuillo </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster, </em>242 Conn. 570, 576, 698 A.2d 873 (1997). We also have seen the broad expansion, and then the contraction, of the second injury fund, as well as various other workers\u2019 compensation statutes addressing specific apportionment questions. To the extent, therefore, that <em>Mund </em>permitted a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner to employ common-law, as opposed to statutory, concepts of apportionment, I have grave doubts as to its continued viability.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-12\"> I recognize that, as the majority opinion discloses, it is not necessary to examine that question in the present case, because this case does not squarely present it, and I fully agree with that wise approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b338-5\">ZARELLA, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aog\">concurring. I concur in the result reached by the majority but write separately because I disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis. The majority opinion provides a textbook example of the <em>Courchesne</em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> approach to statutory interpretation under which a court \u201cpick[s] and choose [s] from among various tools of interpretation\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 621, 816 A.2d 562 (2003) <em>(Zarella, J., </em>with whom <em>Sullivan, C. J., </em>joins, dissenting); instead of focusing on the plain language of the statute under interpretation. In my view, the application of that philosophy makes this otherwise very simple case needlessly confusing. Specifically, the <em>Courchesne </em>methodology induces the majority to engage in a lengthy analysis of the genealogy of the workers\u2019 compensation statute at issue, the common law and the statute\u2019s legislative history that ultimately is rendered moot by virtue of the majority\u2019s conclusion based on the statute\u2019s text.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>The majority states that the primary questions in this case are: (1) whether General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 abrogates common-law apportionment between workers\u2019 compensation insurance carriers; and (2) whether \u00a7 31-349 (d), which closed the second injury fund to the transfer of claims for injuries occurring on or after July 1, 1995, renders the workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier, at the time of an employee\u2019s injury, solely liable for disability payments made in connection with that injury, when that injury, although separate and distinct from a previous injury, had been aggravated by the previous injury. See part III of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">If, as the majority concludes, the answer to the second question is yes, then the first question is irrelevant. I simply fail to see how the majority, having concluded that \u00a7 31-349 (d) renders \u201cthe last employer . . . solely liable for the benefits of the second injury,\u201d possibly could conclude that common-law apportionment nevertheless is possible under \u00a7 31-349. In other words, the majority, quite sensibly, determines that the text of \u00a7 31-349 (d), which provides that \u201c[a]ll [second injury] claims shall remain the responsibility of the employer or its insurer,\u201d and the lack of any statutory apportionment procedure in \u00a7 31-349 lead to the conclusion that \u201cthe legislature, in enacting \u00a7 31-349 (d), intended that the last employer be solely liable for the benefits of the second injury.\u201d In light of this conclusion, how could there possibly be any common-law apportionment that would allow the last employer to avoid sole liability for the benefits of the second injury?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Despite the simplicity of this textual conclusion, however, which the majority finally reaches in part III of its opinion, the majority engages in an extensive discussion of the circumstances surrounding the enactment of and subsequent modifications to \u00a7 31-349, case law, legislative history and genealogy prior to concluding that \u201ccommon-law apportionment is no longer available to second injury employers . . . .\u201d Although I share Justice Borden\u2019s doubts concerning the viability of the apportionment principles enunciated by this court in <em>Mund </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 Cooperative, Inc., </em>139 Conn. 338, 344-45, 94 A.2d 19 (1952), surely, apportionment is no longer available in light of the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe legislature, in enacting \u00a7 31-349 (d), intended that the last employer be solely hable for the benefits of the second injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In my view, the majority\u2019s holistic approach to statutory interpretation under which all factors are considered does little more than cloud its own textual analysis and conclusions. What would the majority have done if it had determined that <em>Mund </em>provided for common-law apportionment? Would it have disregarded its conclusion that the legislature provided that the second employer shall be solely hable? Such are the questions engendered by an approach to statutory interpretation that fails to pay proper heed to the fundamental role that a statute\u2019s text plays in its interpretation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-6\"> <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 816 A.2d 562 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b339-6\"> To the extent that the majority suggests that, notwithstanding the expressed legislative intent in \u00a7 31-349 (d) to render the second employer solely liable, there still is a possibility of <em>common-law </em>apportionment, I disagree. Such reasoning is akin to the reasoning that this court employed in <em>Bhinder </em>v. <em>Sun Co., </em>246 Conn. 223, 717 A.2d 202 (1998), in which the court recognized a common-law action for apportionment between negligent and intentional tortfeasors notwithstanding the fact that the negligence apportionment statute did not provide for such apportionment.
