The decedent had been murdered while on the job, and the plaintiff brought this action for the contractual benefits. A jury found that the defendants had breached the contract for benefits, and that the plaintiff was entitled to prejudgment interest on the award at the rate of 10 percent per annum, but declined to calculate the amount of the interest. When the jury returned its verdict without calculating the amount of the interest, the trial court, <em>D Andrea, J., </em>returned the jury to the jury room with instruction that it may do so. In the jury\u2019s absence, the court stated that, if the jury did not calculate the amount of the interest, the court would do so. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendants objected to this unorthodox procedure. The jury then returned with the same award, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>and the same finding that the plaintiff was entitled to prejudgment interest at 10 percent per annum, but without calculating the amount of the interest. The court accepted the verdict, again with neither party objecting to the court\u2019s stated intention of calculating the amount of the interest. Subsequently, the trial court set the entire verdict aside on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to support the award of damages and that the jury\u2019s verdict had been influenced by sympathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The plaintiff then appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed the judgment of the trial court, and remanded the case to that court with direction to reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Rejouis </em>v. <em>Greenwich Taxi, Inc., </em>57 Conn. App. 778, 788, 750 A.2d 501 (2000). Upon the remand, the trial court, <em>Mints, J., </em>calculated the interest at 10 percent per annum, and chose the initial date of the interest calculation to be the filing date of the plaintiffs complaint. Thereafter, the defendants appealed to the Appellate Court challenging the trial court\u2019s award of interest. The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, without opinion. <em>Rejouis </em>v. <em>Greenwich Taxi, Inc., </em>69 Conn. App. 904, 798 A.2d 500 (2002).
