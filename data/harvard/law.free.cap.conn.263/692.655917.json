Rocque, the commissioner of environmental protection, appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the Appellate Court concluding that General Statutes \u00a7 22a-371<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> affords no discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>to the defendant to decide whether to conduct a hearing regarding the sufficiency of the application by the plaintiff, Miller\u2019s Pond Company, LLC, for a permit to divert water and to remove gravel under the Connecticut Water Diversion Policy Act, General Statutes \u00a7 22a-365* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> et seq. <em>Miller\u2019s Pond Co., LLC </em>v. <em>Rocque, </em>71 Conn. App. 395, 406, 802 A.2d 184 (2002). We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-369,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff applied to the defendant for a permit to divert water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>and remove gravel from a man-made lake known as Miller\u2019s Pond in Waterford. After reviewing the plaintiffs application, the defendant issued a \u201crejection notice,\u201d informing the plaintiff that its application was insufficient because it failed to include a potential user of the diverted water as a coapplicant pursuant to the requirements under the regulations of the department of environmental protection (department). The defendant also notified the plaintiff that the rejection notice did not bar the plaintiff from submitting a corrected application.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed the decision of the defendant to the trial court, claiming that it was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>to a hearing to determine whether its application was incomplete. The trial court dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, the trial court reasoned that \u00a7 22a-371 does not require that the defendant conduct a hearing to determine whether an application is complete and, accordingly, the defendant\u2019s action did not constitute a final decision in a contested case, as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 4-166,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> pursuant to the appeal process set forth by General Statutes \u00a7 4-183<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA). On appeal, the Appellate Court disagreed, concluding that the defendant\u2019s notice of rejection was indeed a final decision in a contested case and that under the statutory scheme prescribed in \u00a7 22a-371, a hearing was required. <em>Miller's Pond Co., LLC </em>v. <em>Rocque, </em>supra, 71 Conn. App. 407. Accordingly, the Appellate Court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment. Id., 410. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">On appeal to this court, the defendant claims that there has been no final decision in a contested case within the meaning of the UAPA. Specifically, the defendant claims that: (1) there is no specific statute authorizing the plaintiffs appeal from a rejection notice; (2) there is no legal right, duty or privilege at issue because none was adjudicated by the defendant; and (3) the statutory and regulatory framework, including the department\u2019s rules of practice regarding water diver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>sion applications, do not require a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing before the defendant issues a rejection notice due to the lack of a required signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">\u201cOur examination of the record and briefs and our consideration of the arguments of the parties persuade us that the judgment of the [Appellate Court] should be affirmed. The issues were resolved properly in the [Appellate Court\u2019s] concise and well reasoned [majority opinion], . . . Because that [majority opinion] fully addresses all arguments raised in this appeal, we adopt it as a proper statement of the issues and the applicable law concerning those issues. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>259 Conn. 45, 55-56, 787 A.2d 530 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\"> We granted certification limited to the following question: \u201cDid the Appellate Court, properly conclude that the actions of the defendant, the commissioner of environmental protection, was a final decision in a contested case within the meaning of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act?\u201d <em>Miller\u2019s Pond Go., LLC </em>v. <em>Rocque, </em>261 Conn. 936, 806 A.2d 1064 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-371 provides: \u201c(a) Within one hundred twenty days of receipt of an application for a permit, the commissioner shall determine if there is any additional information that he deems necessary to carry out the puiposes of sections 22a-365 to 22a-378, inclusive.
