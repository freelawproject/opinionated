Order reversed, without costs; motion for summary judgment denied; and judgment dated April 4, 1962 which was entered upon said order vacated. In our opinion, issues of fact exist as to whether the County of Rockland acquired and conveyed title to the real property which is the subject of this action; such issues should be resolved after a plenary trial. Beldock, P. J., Kleinfeld, Brennan, Hill and Hopkins, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
