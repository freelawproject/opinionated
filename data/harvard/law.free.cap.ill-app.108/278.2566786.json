Kaplan. a,s receiver, the amount of an insured loss suffered by complainant Thomas.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-4\" pgmap=\"301\">Plaintiffs in error contend that by the demurrer the defendant admits:</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-5\" pgmap=\"301\">First. That it made a contract of insurance with the complainant Thomas.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A5H\" pgmap=\"301\">Second. That the policy it actually issued and delivered to the complainant Thomas, was not in fact the contract made, but that by an error or mistake an important clause, namely, \u201c other insurance permitted,\u201d was left out.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-7\" pgmap=\"301\">Third. That by reason of a loss occurring, a liability accrued upon the defendant to pay the complainant Thomas, or his representative, the amount of the policy, namely, $2,500.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-8\" pgmap=\"301\">Fourth. That such liability has never been paid or satisfied.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-9\" pgmap=\"301\">Fifth.

That the issue tried in that suit was whether or not the defendant was estopped from setting up the clause of the policy against other insurance by reason of having notice and knowledge of other insurance upon the property insured at the time the policy was issued.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASG\" pgmap=\"301\">Seventh. That plaintiff recovered judgment on that issue, from which the defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals, where, on the first hearing, an opinion was rendered by that court, holding that no remedy at law existed because plaintiff could not avoid the express stipulation of the policy in that action. (United Firemen\u2019s Ins. Co. v. Thomas, 82 Fed. 406.)</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-13\" pgmap=\"301\">Eighth. That a rehearing was granted by that court and a new opinion rendered leaving the issue raised by the pleading to be determined by proof. United Firemen\u2019s Ins. Co. v. Thomas, 92 Fed. 127.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-14\" pgmap=\"301\">Ninth.

That after an appeal w\u00a7ls taken by plaintiff upon that judgment to the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court of the United States, in Northern Assurance Co. v. Grand View Bldg. Ass\u2019n, 183 U. S. 308, held the same as the Court of Appeals in its first opinion, namely, that no action at law could be maintained on the policy in question.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aca\" pgmap=\"302\">Eleventh. That it was owing to the Court of Appeals taking back its first opinion, granting a rehearing and rendering another opinion, that resulted in the judgment of the Circuit Court. Had the Court of Appeals stood by its first decision there would have been no second trial and no judgment against the complainant Thomas.</p><attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AYi\" pgmap=\"302\">Bulkley, Gray &amp; More and William M.

Johnson v. Roberts, 102 Ill. 655.</p> <p id=\"b302-12\" pgmap=\"302(42) 303(93)\">Prom the bill it appears that with full knowledge of the facts the plaintiffs began suit in t\"he United States Circuit Court upon the policy as written and delivered; that judgment for the plaintiffs in this action at law was rendered, from which the defendant took an appeal with the result that after two hearings in the United States Court of Appeals the judgment of the Circuit Court was reversed and the cause remanded; that thereafter another trial was had and a judgment rendered for the defendant. That from this the defendant took an appeal which it afterward dismissed, leaving the judgment for the defendant of the United States Circuit Court in full force; that thereafter, more than eight years after the alleged loss, this bill .to reform the policy was filed.</p> <p id=\"b303-4\" pgmap=\"303\">The bill sets forth the following as a part of the policy:</p> <blockquote id=\"b303-5\" pgmap=\"303\">\u201cNo suit or action on this policy, for the recovery of any claim, shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity until after full compliance by the insured with all the lore-going requirements, nor unless commenced within twelve months next after the fire.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b303-6\" pgmap=\"303\">The validity of this clause is not disputed.</p> <p id=\"b303-7\" pgmap=\"303\">We do not regard the fact that, prior to the expiration of one year from the fire, a receiver for the insured was appointed by the Superior Court, and within a year a suit at law begun in the United States Circuit Court, as excepting the present suit from the operation of the condition of the policy as to the commencement of suit.</p> <p id=\"b303-8\" pgmap=\"303\">The plaintiffs, by electing to bring an action at law upon the policy in its original form and prosecuting that action to final judgment thereon, conclusively elected to regard the policy as the true contract with the insurance company, and thereby abandoned any right they might have had to have it reformed in equity.
