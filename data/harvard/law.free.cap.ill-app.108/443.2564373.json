Appellants signed the following agreement and delivered it to appellee:</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-7\" pgmap=\"466\">\u201c Chicago, Sept. 5, 1901.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-8\" pgmap=\"466\">Please insert my advertisement in the Western Bowlers\u2019 Journal, to occupy the space of 2 inches s. c. page, for the term of ____ months, for which I hereby agree to pay you or .your order the sum of $1.50 per issue, payable upon publication.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-11\" pgmap=\"466\">The agreement was on a printed form with certain blank spaces to be filled out. At the time of delivery the blank space for the number of months was left a blank, it being the express understanding of the parties that it should not be filled, and that the advertisement might be discontinued by appellants at any time after its first publication upon notice to the appellee.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-12\" pgmap=\"466(162) 467(37)\">The advertisement was published for several weeks, appellants paying $1.50 for each publication; but becoming dissatisfied they notified appellant to discontinue. He, however, continued to publish and by threats of suit obtained payment from appellants several times. They gave him another notice which he again disregarded, and upon their refusal to pay he .sued them in justice\u2019s court and recovered judgment by default against them for $9, which they paid. Afterward another suit for the recovery of $6 was brought against them by appellee, and upon the trial when he offered the above agreement in evidence, they learned for the first time that it had been materially altered by the insertion of the figures \u201c36\u201d before the word \u201cmonths,\u201d thus making it appear on the face of the instrument that the subscription was to be in force for thirty-six months. This insertion was made by appellee fraudulently and without authority from or ratification by appellants. Appellee threatens to continue publishing the advertisement for the full thirty-six months and to bring suit for every publication, if appellants refuse payment. Under the altered agreement they are still liable for thirty-one months at the rate of $6 a month.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-4\" pgmap=\"467\">The bill prays that the agreement be canceled and annulled and that appellee be restrained from bringing suit at law therein.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-5\" pgmap=\"467\">Charles F. Lowy, attorney for appellants; Winston &amp; Munro, of counsel.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-6\" pgmap=\"467\">Church, McMurdy &amp; Sherman, attorneys for appellee; William A. Bither, of counsel.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b467-7\" pgmap=\"467\">Mr. Justice Stein</author> <p id=\"AO1\" pgmap=\"467\">delivered the opinion of the' court.</p> <p id=\"b467-8\" pgmap=\"467\">The facts of this case do not bring it within Siegel v. Trust and Savings Bank, 33 Ill. App. 225, 131 Ill. 509. The $1.50 agreed to be paid by appellants for each issue is payable, not at a fixed, specific date, but \u201c upon publication.\u201d The instrument therefore was not negotiable, being payable in a contingent, uncertain event. Husband v. Epling, 81 Ill. 172.</p> <p id=\"b467-9\" pgmap=\"467\">But assuming it to be negotiable, there was still a defense to it at law, even in the hands of an innocent purchaser for value. The instrument became absolutely void by reason of the fraudulent alteration. Vannatta v. Lindley, 198 Ill. 40.</p> <p id=\"b467-10\" pgmap=\"467\">For the appellee it is further urged that the judgment of the justice in the case which went against appellants by default and which they subsequently paid is a conclusive adjudication of all questions now sought to be raised by them, including the one relating to the alleged forgery. Without definitely passing upon this contention, it is clear that either the judgment does so operate between the parties, or if it does not, then appellants have a good defense at law to any suit brought by appellee upon the instrument. In either case their bill can not be maintained, and was obnoxious to a demurrer.</p> <p id=\"b467-11\" pgmap=\"467\">The decree of the Superior Court will be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
