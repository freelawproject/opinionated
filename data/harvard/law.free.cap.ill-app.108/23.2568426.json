The building fronted on Washington street and extended south to Meridian street, both of which streets run east and west. The building was ninety feet in width and 183 feet in length from north to south, and was situated on the southeast corner of Washington and Union streets. The east wall of the building was one-half on Beidler\u2019s and one-half on appellee\u2019s land, in accordance with the party-wall agreement. Subsequently,' at various times, commencing with June 6, 1888, and ending August 1, -1895, appellee purchased from Jacob Beidler and paid for parts of the party wall. The parts so purchased by her are, in all, 119 feet in length from Washington street south, and thirty-eight feet in height. The following diagram shows the east face of the wall, the entire part thereof purchased by appellee, and the different purchases.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-6\" pgmap=\"50\">[[Image here]]</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-29\" pgmap=\"50\">Appellee erected on her ground a brick stable, extending from Washington street south 183 feet, substantially to Meridian street. Extending south 119 feet from Washington street, appellee\u2019s stable was joined to the party wall; but the south sixty-four feet of the stable was not so joined, but had an independent west wall, leaving a small space between said south sixty-four feet of the stable and the party wall, ,</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-30\" pgmap=\"50(12) 51(230)\">On the morning of October 7, 1899, the east half of the building erected by Jacob Beidler was destroyed by fire, except a portion of the front. There was about fifty-six feet of the second floor left standing on the 17th, but two days later a part of that fell through to the basement, leaving about thirty-five feet standing. The floors above that were somewhat less. The outer walls of the building were standing. The party wall on the morning after the fire was out of plumb, was bulged out, and was cracked from the top to the basement. There were several thousand tons of debris that fell through into the basement, among which were several hundred tons of paper in large rolls; this paper and other debris was afire and continued to burn for eleven or twelve days after October 17th. On the afternoon of the 20th the city fire-wreckers, under a contract, started to take down the east Avail by placing men on the top and had them knock the brick off and onto the debris inside. From one and a half to two stories had been torn down, when, about 3 or 3:30 o\u2019clock p. m., on October 28, 1899, the balance of the east wall fell toward the east and down upon Mrs. Emily A. King\u2019s building and destroyed the same, except about twenty feet in front, which was considered of no value in rebuilding.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-4\" pgmap=\"51\">At the date of the fire appellee\u2019s building was leased to the National Biscuit Company by written lease from February 1, 1889, till April 30, 1904, at a rental of $103.33 per month.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-5\" pgmap=\"51\">The fire occurred about 12:40 o\u2019clock in the morning of October 17, 1899. George Beidler, appellant, who represented the Beidler heirs, and had sole control of the Beidler building, testified that he went to the building about 12:55 o\u2019clock in the morning and remained there until eight o\u2019clock, and that, at the latter hour, the entire building, from the roof to the basement, Avas crushed through, except a space from the front of the forty-two feet back, running down to the second floor. The appellants were doing business as \"The heirs of Jacob Beidler,\u201d and October 17, 1899, appellee addressed to them a registered letter as follows:</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-5\" pgmap=\"52\">\u201c Chicago, October 17, 1899.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-6\" pgmap=\"52\">Heirs of Jacob Beidler, 179 West Washington street, City.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-7\" pgmap=\"52\">Gentlemen : I hereby notify you that the walls of the building owned by you, and recently destroyed by fire, on West Washington street adjoining my property, are in a dangerous condition, and ask that you-protect the same at once, as I am informed that if there is a strong wind the east wall of your building is liable to fall on my property at any time.

Barry, who was chief building inspector for the city of Chicago, October 18, 1899, examined the building at that date, and found that most of the interior had been burned out, and that the east wall was out of plumb. In the evening of that day he saw George Beidler, who said he was the agent for the building, and told him that the east wall was in a dangerous condition and must be taken down at once, and asked him whom he, witness, should serve notice on, and George Beidler told him to make it out to him, whereupon witness served said Beidler with the following notice :</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-11\" pgmap=\"52\">\u201cOctober, 18, 1899.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-12\" pgmap=\"52\">The Estate of Jacob Beidler :</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-13\" pgmap=\"52\">You are hereby notified, as one of the owners of buildings numbers 130 and 132 West Washington street, that the walls of said building are in danger of falling.

Three men were engaged in the work that afternoon. On the following days from ten to fifteen men were so engaged. The evidence tended to prove that the wall could have been taken down in from four to six days, but up to three to 3:30 o\u2019clock p. m., October 28, 1899, it had not been taken down, and at that hour it fell on appellee\u2019s building.</p><attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-4\" pgmap=\"53\">William J.

As to the remainder of said wall, the court instructs you that it was the duty of the defendants to exercise reasonable care in respect to the same. It is for you to say from the evidence whether, from the time George Beidler, who acted for himself and his co-defendants in the care and management of said building, knew of the fact that said wall had been injured and damaged by fire, he used reasonable care and diligence in respect to the portion of said wall for which plaintiff had not paid one-half of the value, to prevent damages or injury to them for the same, or whether he was guilty of negligence in respect thereto. The question whether he exercised reasonable care and diligence in respect thereto, and is guilty of negligence, is a question of fact to be decided and determined by the jury from all the evidence in the case. If you, from the evidence, find that the plaintiff was without fault, and that defendants were guilty of negligence in respect to said portion of said wall for which plaintiff had not paid one-half the value, and that by reason and in consequence of such negligence said portion of said wall fell and injured the barn of plaintiff, you will find the defendants guilty; and on the other hand if you find the defendants exercised reasonable care in respect to said portion of said wall and are not guilty of negligence -in respect to the same, you will find the defendants not guilty.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b56-8\" pgmap=\"56(9) 57(265)\">Instruction 11 is criticised as being an abstract proposition of law. The instruction is a correct interpretation of the contract between the parties, and it was within the province of the court to give it for the enlightenment of the jury. Counsel, in his argument, says, \u201c Instructions 12, 13, 14, and the one given by the court on its own motion tell the jury specifically that appellee had no right to touch that part of the party wall not paid for by her, and that she had no right to brace or protect the party wall from falling, if the same could have been done, and that she had no rights in or to that portion of the wall not paid for by her,\u201d and claims that the instructions were erroneous in these respects. Instructions 11 and 12 informed the jury what the title of Beidler and his heirs was prior to the purchase by appellee of any part of the wall, and their title, after the purchase by appellee of part of the wall, in respect to the part of the wall not purchased by her, and their responsibility as to the part not so purchased. The 13th and 14th instructions are to the effect that appellee had no legal right to go on or touch any part of the wall not purchased by her. The instruction given by the court of its own motion instructs the jury as to the responsibility of appellants-in respect to the part of the wall not purchased by appellee, and on the question of negligence, etc. We think the instructions given substantially correct.</p> <p id=\"b57-4\" pgmap=\"57\">Appellants\u2019 counsel contends that after appellee elected to use a part of the wall and paid therefor, \u201c the rights relative to repairs of the party wall were changed as to the whole wall,\u201d and in support of this view quotes from the party wall agreement the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b57-5\" pgmap=\"57\">\u201c And the parties hereto further covenant and agree that if it shall become necessary to repair or rebuild any portion of said party wall or walls, before said party of the second part shall use or pay for her portion of the same, the expense or cost of such repairing or rebuilding shall be borne by the said first party; and further, if it shall become necessary to so repair or rebuild after the said party of the second part shall have used or paid for her portion of said wall, then and in that event the cost of such repairing or rebuilding shall be borne equally by the parties hereto, to the extent that they are each using said wall.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b58-3\" pgmap=\"58\">Appellants argue, in substance, that appellee, by the last part of the language quoted, was bound to contribute to the cost of repair or rebuilding to the extent she is using the wall; that she was using about one-fourth of it, and therefore, if the repairing or rebuilding of any part of the wall becomes necessary, even though it be a part not purchased or used by her, she must pay her proportion of the cost. From this conclusion counsel deduces the corollary that appellants and appellee are interested, as it were, per my et per tout in every part of the wall, in the proportion of their respective interests, and that the duty to repair being common, neither can be liable to the other.</p> <p id=\"b58-4\" pgmap=\"58\">We can not concur in the premise of counsel that the words, \u201c then and in that event the cost of such repairing or rebuilding shall be borne equally by the parties thereto, to the extent that they are each using said wall,\u201d are to be interpreted as meaning that each shall contribute to such cost as to every part of the wall. In interpreting any provision of a contract, the entire contract must be considered. This is elementary. The contract in question in express terms binds appellee to pay for only such part of the wall as she shall purchase, and it would be inconsistent with this to require that she should contribute to the cost of repairing or rebuilding any and every part of the wall which she did not purchase and did not use. By the agreement, the expense of repairing or rebuilding before the use of any part of the wall by appellee, devolves on appellants, but when appellee uses any part of the wall, she is to contribute to such expense as to the part she is using. The language is not that each shall pay in proportion to his interest, but that the cost \u201c shall be borne equally by the parties hereto to the extent that they are each using said wall,\u201d meaning clearly, to the extent that they are both using said wall.</p> <p id=\"b58-5\" pgmap=\"58(36) 59(56)\">Appellant George Beidler, who acted for himself and the other appellants, recognized that the duty of taking down the wall devolved on appellants. When asked by the building inspector who should be served with notice to take down the wall, he told the inspector to make it out to the agent of the Beidler estate, and the inspector served the notice on him. Also, the contract for taking down the wall was made by appellants. Had appellee interfered with the work, it would probably have been urged against her right to recover.</p> <p id=\"b59-4\" pgmap=\"59\">Mickel v. York, 175 Ill. 62, is a case similar to the present. There was a party wall agreement between the parties, which contained the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b59-5\" pgmap=\"59\">\u201c And this indenture further witnesseth, that the said party of the first part does hereby covenant, promise, grant and agree that the said party of the second part, their heirs and assigns, shall and may, at all times hereafter, have the full and free liberty and privilege of joining to and using said partition above mentioned, as well below as above the surface of the ground, and along the whole length or any part of the length thereof, any building which he or they, or any of them, may desire or have occasion to erect on the said lot of the party of the second part, and to sink the joist of such building or buildings into the said partition to the depth of....inches, and no further; provided always, nevertheless, and on this express condition, that the said party of the second part, their heirs and assigns as aforesaid, before proceeding to join any building to the said partition wall, and making any use thereof or breaking into the same, shall pay or secure to be paid unto the said party of the first part, his heirs and assigns aforesaid, the full moiety or one-half part of the value of said party wall, or so much thereof as shall be joined to or used as aforesaid, which value shall be the cost price at the time when such wall is to be used by said party of the second part, as fixed, estimated and assessed by three disinterested mason contractors.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b59-8\" pgmap=\"59\">The same provisions, in almost the same language, are contained in the agreement in the present case. Mickel had not, at the time of the fire, elected, to use any part of the wall. York, nevertheless, contended that the wall, when completed, belonged to both the parties, each owning the half resting on his lot, and an easement in the soil on which the other half rested. The court say:</p> <blockquote id=\"b59-9\" pgmap=\"59(22) 60(253)\">\u201c Where a party wall of adjoining buildings rests partly upon the soil of each owner, and was constructed as a party wall, the owners are neither joint owners nor tenants in common of such wall. Each is possessed in severalty of his own soil up to the dividing line, and of that portion of the wall which rests upon it; but the soil of each, with the wall belonging to him, is burdened with an easement or servitude in favor of the other, to the end that it may afford a support to the wall and building of such other. But where a party wall has been constructed on the line between adjacent lots, resting partly on each, by one of the lot owners, under a parol or written agreement, by which agreement the other owner agrees to pay one-half of the value of the wall when he elects to use it, the builder of the wall owns it absolutely, with a permanent right in him and his grantees to have one-half the wall stand on the land of the other while the other retains title, and also after it has passed to an assignee with notice of the rights of the owner of the wall. If, however, by agreement, the owner of the lot who did not build the wall has a right to elect to pay one-half its value and use the same, and he does so, he thereby becomes the owner of not only the one-half standing upon his own land, but has an easement in the other half standing on the lot of the one who built the wall.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b60-5\" pgmap=\"60(202) 61(68)\">Authorities cited by the court fully sustain the opinion. In the present case Jacob Beidler, deceased, who erected the wall on the dividing line between the lots, was, as the court instructed the jury, the exclusive owner of the wall up to the time when appellee paid for a part of it, in accordance with the agreement between Beidler and her. After appellee purchased and paid for that part of the wall to which her building was partly attached, she was the owner of the part so purchased, which was standing on her own land, and of an easement in the land of Beidler, on which the other half of the part so purchased was resting; and Beidler continued to be the sole owner of all that part of the wall not purchased by appellee, and, consequently, responsible as such owner, and so the court instructed the jury. By the very terms of the agreement, appellee could become the owner of only such part of the wall as she should purchase, in accordance with the agreement. She purchased only thirty-eight feet in height by one hundred and nineteen feet in length. That only-she owned. Necessarily, therefore, Beidler, while living, owned, and his heirs, appellants, now own, all that part of the wall not purchased by appellee, and, as owners, they are clearly responsible for any neglect in regard to it resulting in injury to others. Such neglect is within the legal maxim, sie utere tno ut alienum non laedas, of which appropriate instances are given in Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 8th Am. Ed., star page 366 et sequens.</p> <p id=\"b61-4\" pgmap=\"61\">See also, McChesney v. Davis, 86 Ill. App. 380, and 18 Am. and Eng. Ency., 1st Ed., pp. 3-15, and cases cited in notes. In the cases cited, and in such cases as we have observed, the agreement was to pay half the expense of the party wall when the party not building should elect to use it; but no reason is perceived why the parties may not agree, as they did in -the present case, that the party not building may purchase and pay for any part of the wall, and care only for the part purchased and paid for. In this case they carried out the agreement as made. On each purchase of a part by appellee, an estimate was made of the cost price of such part at the date of the purchase, and payment was made as per the estimate.</p> <p id=\"b61-5\" pgmap=\"61\">Counsel for appellants complains of the refusal of the following instructions asked by appellants:</p> <blockquote id=\"b61-6\" pgmap=\"61\">6. \u201c The court instructs the jury that if you believe from the evidence that the wall in question was in a dangerous and unsafe condition for several days and that the plaintiff had knowledge of the dangerous and unsafe condition, and that it was apparent from the dangerous and unsafe condition of the wall in question that it would fall and injure the property of the plaintiff, then it was the duty of the plaintiff to use ordinary care and diligence to protect her property and to prevent the injury if she could have done so at a moderate expense; and if through her negligence in not doing so. her property was damaged, she can not recover, and you should find the issues for the defendants.\u201d</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b61-7\" pgmap=\"61(67) 62(11)\">7. \u201c The court instructs the jury that if you believe from the evidence that the plaintiff had knowledge of the condition of the wall of which she complains, and if at a moderate expense or by the exercise of ordinary care and effort she could have protected her property from the alleged injury, and she failed and neglected to do so, then she can .not recover, and you should find the issues for the defendants.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b62-5\" pgmap=\"62\">Instruction 6 apparently assumes that appellee was guilty of negligence, and was, as we think, properly refused. By another instruction given for appellants the jury, were instructed that if they believed the plaintiff was guilty of negligence which contributed to the injury, she could not recover, and they should find for the defendants; and by the instruction given by the court of its own motion, above quoted, the court required the jury to find, in order to warrant a verdict for the plaintiff, not only that the defendants were negligent, but \u201c that plaintiff was without fault.\u201d We find no reversible error in the refusal of these instructions.</p> <p id=\"b62-6\" pgmap=\"62\">Appellants\u2019 counsel, at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and also at the close of all the evidence, requested the court to instruct the jury to find the defendants not guilty, and counsel contends that the refusal of each of these instructions was error, for two reasons: namely, that no negligence on the part of the defendants was shown, and that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. The questions whether the defendants were guilty of negligence which caused the injury, and whether the plaintiff omitted to exercise ordinary care, were submitted to the jury by defendants\u2019 fifth instruction quoted in the argument for appellants. The instruction is as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b62-7\" pgmap=\"62\">\u201c The court instructs the jury that to entitle the plaintiff to recover the jury must believe from the evidence that the injury complained of was occasioned by the carelessness or negligence of the defendants or their servants in the manner charged in the declaration. And if the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff was guilty of negligence contributing to the injury, then the plaintiff can not recover, and the jury should find for the defendants.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b62-8\" pgmap=\"62(52) 63(37)\">If the evidence fairly and reasonably tended to prove the plaintiff\u2019s case as stated in the declaration, it would have been error to take the case from the jury. Having carefully considered the evidence and the arguments of counsel, we are of opinion that the evidence not only tended to prove the plaintiff\u2019s case, but that the verdict is sustained by the evidence, and certainly is not manifestly contrary to the weight of the evidence. It is not contended that the sum awarded as damages is excessive.</p> <p id=\"b63-4\" pgmap=\"63\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
