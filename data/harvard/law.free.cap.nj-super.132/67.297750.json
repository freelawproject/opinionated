S. C.,</author>\n<p id=\"ARQ\">Temporarily Assigned. Defendant appeals from a judgment of the County Court finding him guilty of a violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-50(b) (operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate was impaired). He was fined $100 and costs, and his driver\u2019s license was revoked for a period of six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">At about 1:20 in the morning of November 11, 1972, while operating his motor vehicle northbound on the Garden State Parkway, defendant was arrested by a State trooper and charged with a violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-50 (a) (operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor). He was tried in the Municipal Court of the Borough of Elmwood Park, found guilty of a violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-50(b) (operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate was impaired), fined $100 and costs, and his driver\u2019s license was revoked for a period of six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">Defendant took an appeal to the Bergen County Court. Because of a malfunction of the sound recording machine used at the time of the hearing in the municipal court, the tapes could not be transcribed. Since no transcript was available, a plenary trial <em>de novo </em>without a jury was had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>in the County Court as provided by <em>R. </em>3:23-8(a). The charge on which defendant was tried was the one on which he had been found guilty by the municipal court, <em>i. e., </em>a violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-50(b). Only one witness testified at the trial \u2014 the State trooper who made the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">On this appeal from the judgment of the County Court defendant contends, as he did in effect before the County Court, that his \u201cconstitutional right not to be placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense was violated.\u201d lie says that \u201cTo subject him to a second plenary trial for the same offense effectively deprives the defense of a meaningful cross-examination since the State\u2019s witnesses, already cross-examined at the first trial, can anticipate such in their direct examination.\u201d He also contends that the State did not sustain the burden of proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">We find no merit in either of the defendant\u2019s contentions. Here, because of a malfunction of the sound recording machine used, it was not possible to obtain a transcript of the proceedings in the municipal court. There is no claim that the malfunction occurred other than by accident. There was no verbatim record or sound recording made pursuant to <em>R. 7 </em>:A-5 in the court from which the appeal was taken. Accordingly, the appeal was, by <em>R. </em>3 :23-8(a), required to \u201coperate as an application for a plenary trial de novo without a jury\u201d in the County Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">While the rule designates the proceedings as a \u201ctrial de novo\u201d, the <em>de novo </em>review is appellate. <em>State v. Lanish, </em>103 <em>N. J. Super. </em>441, 444 (App. Div. 1968), aff\u2019d o. b. 54 <em>N. J. </em>93 (1969), <em>City of Passaic v. Passaic County, </em>54 <em>N. J. Super. </em>254, 259 (App. Div. 1959); <em>R. </em>3:23-1. Defendant cannot prevail on his claim of double jeopardy. He was found guilty in the municipal court. It was he who appealed to the County Court seeking the appellate review contemplated by <em>Rule </em>3 :23. In the absence of a record of the trial in the municipal court, the review to which he was entitled and which he received was by trial <em>de novo </em>without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>a jury on a charge of the \u201c\u2019lesser offense\u201d of which he was found guilty, <em>i. e., </em>operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate was impaired. <em>State v. Lanish, supra. </em>Such trial <em>de novo </em>was for his benefit. <em>State v. </em>DeBonis, 58 <em>N. J. </em>182, 188-189 (1971). The State did not in way attempt to \u201charass\u201d or \u201c\u201coppress\u201d him \u201c\u201cby multiple prosecution or punishment for the same offense.\u201d See <em>State v. </em>Currie, 41 <em>N. J. </em>531, 536 (1964). In the circumstances, there is no force whatever to defendant\u2019s claim of double jeopardy. See <em>State v. </em>Farmer, 48 <em>N. J. </em>145 (1966), <em>cert. den. </em>386 <em>U. S. </em>991, 87 <em>S. Ct. </em>1305, 18 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>335 (1967); Note, \u201cDouble Jeopardy: The Reprosecution Problem,\u201d 77 <em>Harv. L. Rev. </em>1272 ,1274 (1964); 4 Blackstone, <em>Commentaries </em>335-336 <em>(Lewis ed. </em>1922) at 1725-1726.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The only testimony in the case was that of State Trooper Mueller. He testified that he was assigned to the Bloomfield Station on the Garden State Parkway; that at about 1:20 a.m. on November 11, 1972, he observed a motor vehicle, a \u201c\u201cblue, carry-all type station wagon van combination, travelling northbound in the right-hand lane\u201d; that he proceeded to follow the vehicle for about 2 miles, i. e., from about post number 156.5 to post number 158.5; that it was travelling at about 50 to 55 miles an hour; that he observed the driver \u201c\u201ctravelling from the right-hand lane, partially into the center lane and from the center lane right into the back-hand lane and from the right-hand lane partially onto the shoulder\u201d; that \u201cThis took place several times\u201d; that there were no other cars in the lanes in-involved in his driving; that he directed the driver over to the shoulder of the roadway; that when he approached the driver (defendant) and instructed him to produce his driver\u2019s license and registration, he \u201cdetected a strong odor of alcoholic beverage on his breath\u201d; that \u201c\u201chis manner of speaking was blurred and his eyes were bloodshot\u201d; that when \u201c\u201che stepped from his vehicle * * * he had to hold on to prevent from falling\u201d; that after what he \u201cconsidered a lengthy amount of time\u201d defendant produced his driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>license; that defendant attempted to locate his vehicle registration, bnt was unsuccessful; that he asked the defendant if he had been drinking and the defendant told him that \u201che had a few beers\u201d; that he had defendant walk heel to toe along the shoulder white line and that the defendant \u201cdeviated from the line slightly\u201d, and that at the police barracks he refused to take the breatholizer tost.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">There is ample evidence in the record to support the finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The judgment of the County Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
