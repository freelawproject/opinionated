FREDERICK FISHER, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b335-6\">Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b335-7\">Submitted January 28, 1975</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AM-J\">Decided February 7, 1975.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b336-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Before Judges Matthews, Eritz and Bottee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b336-12\"><em>Mr. Stanley G.

J. S. A. </em>2A: 139-1) and carrying weapons without first having obtained a permit <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:151-41). Ultimate^ he was sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>to two to three years in State Prison on each count, the sentences on the respective counts to be served concurrently. He now appeals on the ground that no factual basis for the plea was elicited during the taking of the plea, as is required by <em>R. </em>3 :9\u20142.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"> The rule clearly directs that a judge taking a plea \u201cshall not accept such plea without first addressing the defendant personally and determining by inquiry of defendant and others, in the court\u2019s discretion, that * * * there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d There is no question at all hut that the judge below failed to comply with the mandate of the rule, although he did ascertain that the waiver of indictment and trial by jury was signed voluntarily and with an understanding of what the words therein meant. Thereafter the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">THE COURT: You are charged with receiving stolen property. Ton are charged with carrying weapons without a permit or an ID card.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">Do you understand the nature of those offenses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">THE DEFENDANT FISHER: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">We need not here decide the minimum inquiry necessary to satisfy the requirement of the rule, for we are satisfied that merely asking defendant if he read the formal language of the charge and understood that language is not sufficient. For one thing \u2014\u25a0 and we do not suggest that there are not others \u2014a \u201cyes\u201d-\u201cno\u201d inquiry relating to defendant\u2019s understanding of the nature of the offenses with which he is charged is not at all productive with respect to whether defendant's understanding is in fact correct, an essential purpose of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Satisfied that there was manifest error below (although it was never raised until this appeal), we turn to what, if anything, should be done here about it in the circumstances of this case. The State suggests, and we agree, that where an appeal is brought after sentence in criminal actions in which a guilty plea has been entered, the considerations affecting the determination should be akin to those in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>volved on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea after sentence. When such a motion is first made after sentence our courts generally require a demonstration of manifest injustice before the plea and sentence are set aside. <em>State v. Deutsch, </em>34 <em>N. J. </em>190, 198 (1961). Innocence or guilt is relevant even with respect to a motion before sentencing. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>131 <em>N. J. Super. </em>252 (App. Div. 1974). In the matter before us not only does defendant not here argue his innocence, but his guilt is too manifestly apparent upon the record to be ignored. In such circumstances, the error, though obvious and not to be condoned, is not ground for reversal. The time is long since past that all trial errors necessarily lead to reversal. <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N. J. </em>325 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Defendant also argues here that his sentence was excessive and a mistaken exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion. Considering the circumstances of the offenses and defendant\u2019s record, we find no merit in this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
