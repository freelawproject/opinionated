A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ARi\">This is an appeal from a determination and order of the Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control of the State of New Jersey (Director) in which he dismissed an appeal by Margate Civic Association (Association) from the action of the Board of Commissioners of the City of Margate (Board) approving the application by George Naame and Manaam, Inc. (Manaam) for a place-to-place transfer of a plenary retail consumption license to include as part of its licensed premises the building immediately adjacent thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Manaam is the holder of a plenary retail consumption license (C-16) for premises known as Maloney\u2019s Tavern located at <em>23 </em>South Washington Avenue, Margate, New Jersey. Manaam operates the tavern on the ground floor of the licensed premises serving alcoholic beverages and at times a limited sandwich menu. These premises are owned by Manaam. In fall 1972 Manaam purchased the adjacent premises known as and located at 27 South Washington Avenue. These premises consist of a building substantially similar to the 23 South Washington Avenue building, and its ground floor has been used as a restaurant for many years. The two buildings are separated by a common alleyway three to four feet wide, the street end of which is closed off by a fence to prevent public passage. Both premises are zoned for commercial use.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">In May 1973 Manaam applied to the Board for a place-to-place transfer of its plenary retail consumption license to include, in addition to the premises at 23 South Washington Avenue where it operated Maloney\u2019s Tavern, the adjacent premises at 27 South Washington Avenue where it intended to operate as \u201cMaloney\u2019s Beef and Brew.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Board conducted a hearing and approved the application. Manaam thereupon repaired and remodeled the 27 South Washington Avenue building to accommodate a bar and tables and began operations as Maloney\u2019s Beef and Brew serving a limited food menu. While Maloney\u2019s Tavern and Maloney\u2019s Beef and Brew each had a separate entrance, Manaam operated them as a single business entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The Association appealed from the approval of the application by the Board to the Director who designated a hearing officer for the appeal. At the conclusion of the hearing the hearing officer submitted his report in which he recommended that the action of the Board be reversed. The hearing officer found that the two buildings were not structurally joined and that Manaam operated them as \u201ctwo distinct enterprises independent of each other save ownership.\u201d He concluded that under the circumstances a plaeeto-place transfer of the existing license would result in splitting the license and violating the provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>33 :1\u201426 and Margate Ordinance No. 730. Director Bower disagreed and in a well-reasoned opinion affirmed the Board\u2019s approval of the place-to-place transfer and dismissed the Association\u2019s appeal, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">I find, under the facts herein, that although the buildings do not physically adjoin one another, the operations of these establishments are operated as a single unit, and hence can be considered as one single place of business within the meaning of the statute. <em>Re Beisch, </em>Bulletin 81, Item 10; <em>Re Gallagher\u2019s, supra. </em>[A. <em>B. C. Bull. No. </em>1945, <em>Item </em>1.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">Thus, I find that the said transfer was not violative of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>33 :1-26 or of the subject local ordinance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">In sum, I conclude that the respondent Board acted in the circumspect and reasonable exercise of its discretionary authority on granting the said transfer. Therefore, the recommendation of the Hearer to reverse the action of the Board is disapproved. s\u2019 * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The Association contends on this appeal that <em>N. J. S. A. </em>33 :1-26 and Margate Ordinance No. 730 prohibit the granting o\u00ed a place-to-place transfer of the plenary retail consumption license to include both premises, and that the Director abused his discretion by approving Manaam\u2019s application for such transfer. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"> The responsibility for the administration and enforcement of the alcoholic beverage laws relating to the transfer of a liquor license from place-to-place or to cover enlarged premises is primarily committed to municipal authorities. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>33:1-19, 24; <em>Lyons Farms Tavern v. Mun. Bd. Alc. Bev., Newark, </em>55 <em>N. J. </em>292, 302 (1970). Local boards considering applications for such transfers are invested by our Legislature with wide discretion, and their principal guide in making a determination is the public interest. <em>Id., </em>303; <em>Lubliner v. Bd. of Alcoholic Bev. Con., Paterson, </em>33 <em>N. J. </em>428, 446 (1960). See <em>Tp. Committee of Lakewood Tp. v. Brandt, </em>38 <em>N. J. Super. </em>462, 466 (App. Div. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\"> Once the local board has made its determination, the municipality\u2019s action is broadly subject to appeal to the Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control who conducts a <em>de novo </em>hearing of the appeal, making the necessary factual and legal determinations on the record before him. <em>Fanwood v. Rocco, </em>33 <em>N. J. </em>404, 414 (1960). However, the rule is well established that the Director will not substitute his judgment for that of the local board or reverse the ruling if reasonable support for it can be found in the record. On judicial review the court will generally accept the Director\u2019s factual findings as well as his ultimate determination unless unreasonable or illegally grounded. <em>Lyons Farms Tavern v. Mun. Bd. Alc. Bev., Newark, supra, </em>55 <em>N. J. </em>303; <em>Fanwood v. Rocco, supra, </em>33 <em>N. J. </em>414-415.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>33:1-26 in pertinent part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">* * s\" Licenses are not transferable except as hereinafter provided. A separate license is required for each specific place of business and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the operation and effect of every license is confined to the licensed premises. * * <em>tr</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"> While the Alcoholic Beverage Law does not explicitly define \u201cspecific place of business\u201d, the obvious purpose of this statutory requirement is \u201cto prevent the splitting of licenses and indirect avoidance of the maximum license limitations.\u201d <em>Essex Co., etc., Stores Ass\u2019n v. Newark, etc., Bev. Cont., </em>64 <em>N. J. Super. </em>314, at 321 (App. Div. 1960). Thus, in the <em>Essex </em>case, <em>supra, </em>we held that this requirement was satisfied where each of the several liquor departments in Bamberger\u2019s Newark store was operated \u201cas a single entitjr under its complete domination.\u201d Here, too, \u201cMaloney\u2019s Tavern\u201d and \u201cMaloney\u2019s Beef and Brew\u201d are operated by Manaam \u201cas a single entity under its complete domination.\u201d They are not operated separately and distinct from each other. In fact, the receipts from each are commingled ; one bank account is maintained for the entire business operation, and all employees are hired, fired and paid by a single employer \u2014 Manaam. While the two South Washington Avenue buildings are not physically joined or attached and each has a separate entrance off South Washington Avenue, they are immediately adjacent to one another, separated only by a narrow alleyway, the street end of which is fenced off, prohibiting public passage. These buildings and the premises upon which they stand, including the alleyway, are all owned by Manaam. Thus, the physical arrangement of the buildings and manner in which the \u201cTavern\u201d and the \u201cBeef and Brew\u201d are operated compel the conclusion that they constitute a single \u201cspecific place of business\u201d within the intendment of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>33 :1\u201426.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The result reached here is in accord with prior administrative construction of the statute. It is clear that the contemporaneous and practical construction of a statute over a period of years by the agency charged with its enforcement without interference by the legislature is evidence of its conformity with the legislative intent and may be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>substantial weight by the court. <em>Service Armament Co., et als. v. Hyland, </em>131 <em>N. J. Super. </em>38 (App. Div. 1974). See also, <em>Pringle v. Department of Civil Service, </em>45 <em>N. J. </em>329, 332-333 (1965); <em>Automatic Merchandising Council v. Glaser, </em>127 <em>N. J. Super. </em>413, 420 (App. Div. 1974), and <em>Housing Auth. of Jersey City v. Dept. of Civil Service, </em>87 <em>N. J. Super. </em>146, 149 (App. Div. 1965). In <em>Essex Co., etc., Stores Ass\u2019n v. Newark, etc., Bev. Cont., supra, </em>the court considered the administrative construction of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>33: 1-26, pointing out 64 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 322:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">Since the particular point appears to be <em>res nova, </em>in our courts, administrative construction of the relevant statute is entitled to great weight, especially when such construction is substantially contemporaneous with the enactment of the statute and is followed for many years. [Citations omitted.] Since 1935 the Director has interpreted <em>11. S. </em>33 :1-26, now <em>N. J. S. A. </em>33 :1-26, to require only one license under circumstances similar to those herein. For example, in <em>A. B. C. Bull. No. </em>241, <em>item </em>8 (1938), it was held that a single license could cover two social halls on the opposite sides of a public highway, one used in summer and the other in winter, if \u201cso arranged and operated that they could be said to constitute a single place of business * \"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The construction placed upon the statute by the Director in <em>A. B. C. Bull. No. </em>241, <em>Item </em>8 (1938), referred to in the <em>Essex </em>case, <em>supra, </em>has been followed in principle by the Director in more recent decisions. See <em>Springdale Park, Inc. v. Tp. Comm. of Andover, </em>97 <em>N. J. Super. </em>270 (App. Div. 1967), and <em>Gallagher\u2019s Avalon Liquor Store, el als. v. Bd. of Commissioners of the Borough of Avalon, A. B. C. Bull. No. </em>1945, <em>Item </em>1 (1970). Accordingly, we concur in the findings of the Director that Manaam operated the \u201cTavern\u201d and \u201cBeef and Brew\u201d as a single place of business within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">We also hold that the granting of the plaee-to-place transfer of the plenary retail consumption license to include as part of the licensed premises the building immediately ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>jacent thereto was not prohibited by Margate Ordinance No. 730 which in pertinent part provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">That neither a Plenary Retail Consumption License nor a Plenary Retail Distribution License shall be transferred to any premises located within a circle having a radius of . . . (500) feet, measured from the center point at the main entrance of any existing licensed premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>33 :1-40 expressly confers upon municipalities in the State of New Jersey the power to limit by ordinance the number of retail licenses to sell alcoholic beverages. Pursuant to such statutory authority the governing body of Margate adopted Ordinance No. 730, requiring a minimum distance of 500 feet between licensed premises. In this connection it has been held that such ordinances do in fact \u201cresult in a limitation in the number of licenses, for the greater the intervening distance that must separate licensed premises, the fewer the number that may exist within the municipal boundaries.\u201d <em>Dal Both v. Div. of Alcoholic Beverage </em>Control, 28 <em>N. J. Super. </em>246, 252 (App. Div. 1953). We are satisfied that the Director\u2019s determination that the Margate Ordinance No. 730 was inapplicable to the enlargement of an existing licensed premises by a plaee-toplace transfer was correct. The granting of the place-to-place transfer to include as part of the licensed premises the building adjacent thereto did not increase the number of licenses in the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Finally, we conclude from our review of the entire record that the Director\u2019s findings are amply supported, and his determination and order dismissing the appeal by the Association from the action of the Board approving the application for the plaee-to-place transfer was not unreasonable or illegally grounded. Consequently, we will not interfere therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The determination and order of the Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-9\">The day after Manaam applied to the Board for approval of a plaee-to-place transfer of its license, the Association filed suit in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Superior Court, Law Division, Atlantic County, seeking to enjoin Manaam from structurally joining the 23 and 27 South Washington Avenue buildings, and to declare illegal and void the building permit issued by the Margate building inspector for such construction work. We are advised that this suit is still pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
