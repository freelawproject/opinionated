A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A7_\">Defendants Kajnai and Holt were convicted in a jury trial of possession of a controlled dangerous substance, heroin, in violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>24:21-20 (a) (1). Both were given suspended indeterminate sentences to \u201cYardville,\u201d and probation terms of five years and three years, respectively, were imposed. Each defendant has appealed and, with leave of court, has filed a separate brief urging various grounds for reversal of their convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">There was evidence from which the jury could find the following facts supportive of the convictions. Patrolman Warn approached a Volkswagen owned by defendant Rajnai which was in the parking lot of an apartment house. He observed Rajnai in the driver\u2019s seat, Holt in the rear behind the passenger\u2019s seat and two other passengers, one in the front and one in the rear. All had previously been in Holt\u2019s apartment. When the occupants were ordered out of the car the officer observed Holt reach down and throw something under an adjacent car, later identified as a package containing ten glassine packets of heroin, three syringes, some needles, a bottle cap and a piece of moist cotton. In the back seat of the car the officer found an envelope containing white powder which proved to be heroin and a wad of tissue soaked in alcohol. He also observed that a section of the floor boards in the rear of the vehicle was missing, leaving a hole approximately 7 x 14 inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Defendant Rajnai argues that the court erred in failing to grant his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the ease and that the finding of guilt as to him was contrary to the weight of the evidence. We reject both of these contentions. Considering all the circumstances there was sufficient evidence for the jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant Rajnai unlawfully possessed heroin in his vehicle on the night in question. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>24:21-20 (a) (1) makes it a crime to possess \u201cactually or constructively\u201d a controlled dangerous substance, such, as heroin, unless otherwise authorized by law. One who in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>tends to exercise control and dominion over an object, knowing its character, is said to be in possession of that object. <em>State v. Reed, </em>34 <em>N. J. </em>554, 557 (1961); <em>State v. Labato, </em>7 <em>N. J. </em>137, 148 (1951); <em>State v. </em>Reyes, 98 <em>N. J. Super. </em>506, 512 (App. Div. 1968), certif. den. 51 <em>N. J. </em>582 (1968). Actual physical, manual possession is not required if the intention to exercise such dominion and control over the object is manifest, in circumstances where it is reasonable to infer that the capacity to do so exists. <em>State v. Reyes, supra; State v. Brown, </em>67 <em>N. J. Super. </em>450, 454-455 (App. Div. 1961). Possession need not be exclusive but may be jointly exercised by two or more persons. <em>State v. Puckett, </em>67 <em>N. J. Super. </em>365, 376 (App. Div. 1960), aff\u2019d 34 <em>N. J. </em>574 (1961). Proof of possession may be by circumstantial evidence as well as direct evidence. See <em>State v. Humphreys, </em>54 <em>N. J. </em>406, 413-414 (1969); <em>State v. Reyes, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">In <em>State v. Humphreys, supra, </em>the court held that evidence was sufficient to support a conviction of a defendant for unlawful possession of a gun when defendant was in the front seat of a car and a revolver was found wedged between the cushions of the back seat. The court observed that the gun was \u201cwithin the zone of Humphreys\u2019 knowledge and control,\u201d and the jury could find an intention to exercise dominion over it. For similar reasons in the case at hand we find sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict. <em>Cf. Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N. J. </em>2, 6 (1969). Therefore, denial of defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal was correct. <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N. J. </em>454, 458-459 (1967). We also rej'ect Holt\u2019s contention that the verdict as to him was against the weight of the evidence. He was in the back seat where an envelope containing heroin was found, and the jury could have concluded that he was the one who threw away the package of heroin and paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"> Defendants Rajnai and Holt also contend that sufficient proof of the chain of possession was not established to support the admission into evidence of Exhibit S-3, the white envelope containing heroin. Although S-3 was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>produced with the other seized contraband on the first day of the trial, it was found at police headquarters and produced the following day when it was identified and its earlier absence explained. The trial judge was correct in admitting this evidence. The sufficiency of the foundation for the offer of an exhibit is left to the discretion of the trial judge. <em>State v. Brown, </em>99 <em>N. J. Super. 22, </em>27 (App. Div. 1968), certif. den. 51 <em>N. J. </em>468 (1968) Clearly there was no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">We find no error, also, in the admission of the syringes and bottle cap (a cooker) which had been discarded by the rear seat passenger, allegedly Holt. This narcotic paraphernalia was relevant to show intent and knowledge with respect to the possession of the heroin, at least as to the defendant Holt. It was circumstantial evidence applicable to both defendants and was part of the <em>res gestae </em>in that the possession of the paraphernalia was simultaneous with that of the heroin. <em>Evid. R. </em>55; <em>State v. Campisi, </em>47 <em>N. J. Super. </em>455 (App. Div. 1957), certif. den. 26 <em>N. J. </em>304 (1958). See also <em>State v. Williams, </em>110 <em>N. J. Super. </em>64 (App. Div. 1969), aff\u2019d o. b. 56 <em>N. J. </em>53 (1970); <em>State v. Smith, </em>84 <em>N. J. Super. </em>452, 460 (App. Div. 1964), certif. den. 43 <em>N. J. </em>270 (1964). Although evidence of \u201cother crimes\u201d may have some potential for prejudice, in the ease at hand we find no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in refusing to exclude this evidence under <em>Evid. R. </em>4.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Normally, a limiting instruction should be given by the trial judge <em>sua sponte </em>when \u201cother crime\u201d evidence is admitted so that the jury will not give it greater scope than is justified. <em>Evid. R. </em>6; <em>State v. Lair, </em>62 <em>N. J. </em>388 (1973); <em>State v. Campisi, supra, </em>47 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 458-460. No request for such an instruction was made at trial. Accordingly, the error will be disregarded unless it can be shown that it was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N. J. </em>325, 335-338 (1971). The failure to give a limiting instruction does not necessarily require the reversal of a conviction. See <em>State v. Lair, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>where a conviction was sustained despite the failure to limit the jury\u2019s consideration of defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions. The same result was reached where the trial court failed to give a limiting instruction as to the use of \u201cfresh complaint\u201d evidence in a rape ease. <em>State v. Tirone, </em>64 <em>N. J. 222, 227 </em>(1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Where the charge is unlawful possession of heroin, the relevancy of paraphernalia for the ingestion of the drug is obvious, and would be even to laymen. The introduction of such evidence lacks the capacity to create undue prejudice, especially where the drug itself has been introduced in evidence. It is difficult to imagine what useful purpose would be served by a limiting instruction in such a case, as contrasted with the ease in which a separate and distinct crime is proved against a defendant. Accordingly, we find the failure to give a limiting instruction harmless and no warrant for reversal. Elsewhere, in a number of jurisdictions, the failure to give a limiting instruction as to \u201cother crime\u201d evidence has been held not reversible error absent a request for a proper charge. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>478 <em>F. 2d 1315, </em>1318 (2 Cir. 1973), <em>cert. </em>den. 414 <em>U. S. </em>851, 94 S. Ct. 144, 38 L. Ed. 2d 100 (1973); <em>Petley v.

See also, 1 <em>Wigmore, Evidence </em>(3 ed 1940), \u00a713 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>at 301: \"the better opinion is that the <em>opponent of the evidence must ash for that </em>[limiting] <em>instruction; </em>otherwise, he may be supposed to have waived it as unnecessary for his protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">An additional contention raised by Holt is that the trial court erred in allowing Officer Warn to correct his testimony after refreshing his recollection from recorded testimony which he had previously given concerning Holt\u2019s position in the car. About four months before the trial the officer had testified on a motion to suppress evidence. He then placed Holt in the back seat on the passenger\u2019s side, and he testified that after he observed this occupant \"reach down\u201d he then saw a package rolling toward a nearby car. At the trial, however, Officer Warn first testified that Holt was in the front passenger seat. He was then asked to read his prior testimony. Thereafter, over objection, the court allowed him to state that he was mistaken, that Holt was seated in the rear of the car, on the passenger\u2019s side, and that he was certain of this. Defendant Holt contended then and now that the prosecutor was improperly allowed to impeach the testimony first given on direct examination by his own witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The rule that a party may not impeach his own witness may have derived from the practice in primitive trials of using \"oathhelpers\u201d or compurgators to support a party\u2019s cause and for whom the party implicitly vouched. A rule later developed preventing a defendant from discrediting his own witness, although in early times the prosecution was exempt from this restriction. <em>Johnson v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co., </em>208 <em>F. </em>2d 633, 635 (3 Cir. 1953), <em>cert. </em>den. 347 <em>U. S. </em>943, 74 S. Ct. 639, 98 L. Ed. 1091 (1954); <em>Becker v. Eisenslodt, </em>60 <em>N. J. Super. </em>240, 248 (App. Div. 1960); 3A <em>Wigmore, Evidence </em>(Chadbourn rev. 1970), \u00a7 896 at 659-660; see <em>Report of the N. J. Supreme Court Committee on Evidence, </em>60-61 (1963). The rule has long been modified in New Jersey to allow a party to neutralize adverse testimony which comes as a surprise to him. <em>Evid. R. </em>20 <em>; State v. Cooper, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>10 <em>N. J. </em>532, 560-561 (1952); <em>State v. D\u2019Adame, </em>84 <em>N. J. L. </em>386 (E. &amp; A. 1913). Here, however, the prosecutor contended at trial that he was not endeavoring to \u201cimpair the credibility\u201d of his own witness, nor to \u201cintroduce extrinsic evidence relevant upon the issue of credibility,\u201d as precluded by <em>Evid. R. </em>20. The prosecutor did not offer in evidence the prior testimony of the witness. The prosecutor merely asked to have the witness refresh his recollection as to testimony he previously gave on the subject to determine whether that testimony or his current testimony was correct. After doing so the witness then testified that he realized his error and that he was able to recall the events with certainty. While this practice is not to be encouraged, because it contains the same vice as leading questions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a trial judge should have discretion to permit this procedure in order to elicit \u201call relevant evidence.\u201d <em>Evid. R. </em>7(f); <em>State v. Kwiatkowski, </em>83 <em>N. J. L. </em>650, 653-654 (E. &amp; A. 1912); <em>State v. Silver, </em>2 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>479, 480, 127 <em>A. </em>545, 546 (Sup. Ct. 1924), aff\u2019d o. b. 101 <em>N. J. L. </em>232 (E. &amp; A. 1925); see <em>State v. Wisc, 19 N. J. </em>59, 77-78 (1955); 3A <em>Wigmore, op. cit., </em>\u00a7 904 <em>at </em>675; <em>McCormick, Evidence, </em>\u00a7 38 at 71 (1954); <em>cf. Nobero Co. v. Ferro Trucking, Inc., </em>107 <em>N. J. Super. </em>394, 404 (App. Div. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Dean Wigmore endorses the practice of allowing prior statements of a witness to be nsed in the \u201calways legitimate effort of the party to stimulate his witness\u2019 memory and obviate the effect of temporary forgetfulness.\u201d 3A <em>Wigmore, supra, </em>\u00a7 904 at 675. In support, Wigmore quotes from cases which go beyond the needs of the instant case, since, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>noted above, the prior contradictory statement was not used here to confront the witness openly nor to \u201cprobe\u201d the accuracy of his recollection. <em>Cf. Bullard v. Pearsall, </em>53 <em>N. Y. </em>230, 231-232 (Ct. App. 1873), quoted with approval in <em>People v. Freeman, </em>9 <em>N. Y. </em>2d 600, 217 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 5, 176 N. E. 2d 39 (Ct. App. 1961), where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">Such questions may be asked of the witness for the purpose of probing Ms recollection, recalling to his mind the statements he has previously made, and drawing out an explanation of the apparent inconsistency. This course of examination may result in satisfying the witness that he has fallen into error and that his original statements were correct; and it is calculated to elicit the truth. It is also proper for the purpose of showing the circumstances which induced the party to call him. Though the answers of the witness may involve Mm in contradictions calculated to impair his credibility, that is not a sufficient reason for excluding the inquiry; * * * inquiries calculated to elicit the facts, or to show to the witness that he is mistaken, and to induce him to correct his evidence, should not be excluded simply because they may result unfavorably to Ms credibility. * * * As a matter of course, such previous unsworn statements are not evidence, and when the trial is before a jury, that instruction should he given. [53 N. Y. at 231-232]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">While broad latitude may be allowed in examining a hostile witness, especially a party called by his adversary in a civil action (see <em>Becker v. Eisenstodt, supra), </em>it is clear that prior testimony, not itself offered in evidence, may be nsed in a limited fashion to refresh the recollection of a non-hostile witness. See also, <em>Hileman v. Indreica, </em>385 <em>Mich. </em>1, 187 <em>N. W. </em>2d 411 (Sup. Ct. 1971), holding that, in the presence of the jury, a witness may be confronted with his prior deposition for the purpose of \u201crefreshing his recollection.\u201d (The broad scope of the court\u2019s holding seems to have been influenced by the hostile interest of the witness.) If the recollection of the witness is not refreshed, however, and the proponent of the witness offers the prior statement in evidence, it can be used only for purposes of neutralization. <em>Evid. R. </em>20.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Accordingly, the judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-5\">ln <em>McCormick, Evidence, </em>\u00a7 38 at 71 (1954), it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">Moreover, as in the case of leading questions, he [the trial judge] may decline to permit the use of the aid to memory where he regards the danger of undue suggestion as outweighing the probable value, in the exercise of his discretion to control- the manner of the examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">See <em>Zimmer v.
