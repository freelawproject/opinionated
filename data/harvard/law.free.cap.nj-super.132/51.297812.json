A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aja\">Plaintiffs were new tenants in defendant\u2019s high rise apartment house in West New York and moved in on March 16, 1971. On the same day they reported to the office that there was a leak and the \"deadlock\u201d or bolt lock on the door did not work. Thereafter, the leak was repaired but the bolt lock was not, although the broken lock was reported on at least two other occasions. On March 24, someone entered the apartment and stole personal property valued at $6,100.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">According to the evidence, when the theft occurred, in addition to the non-functioning bolt lock, there was a slip <em>lock </em>on the door which was in working condition. This slip lock works through buttons on the door and provides a double lock. With respect to plaintiffs\u2019 apartment, however, since the bolt lock was inoperative, the door could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>double locked. The slip lock itself, while operable, could be manipulated in such a way that it would be possible to open the door without a key.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The trial court, as the trier of fact, determined that the landlord in this case had a duty to provide reasonable security against theft by providing locks on plaintiffs\u2019 apartment door. It was also found that up to and including the day of the theft, the landlord had not furnished adequate locks since the only operable lock on the door, the slip lock, could be easily released through the use of something flexible, like a piece of celluloid. The landlord had knowledge of the defect and sufficient time to repair or replace the bolt lock. Further, it was found that, since there had occurred recently a number of break-ins in high-rise apartments in the area, there was a foreseeable risk of theft because of apartment doors being inadequate^ or insufficiently secured. The court concluded that not only was it foreseeable that a theft might occur by \u201cslipping the lock\u201d but that access to the apartment by the robbers was gained in this way and that the negligence of defendant in not repairing the lock \u2014 or permitting plaintiffs to put on their own lock \u2014 was the proximate cause of the robbery. It also rejected the defense of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Defendant contends that it acted in a reasonable manner under the circumstances and its conduct regarding the repair and replacement of the bolt lock on plaintiffs\u2019 apartment did not constitute negligence. It emphasizes that, in addition to installing temporary and permanent locks on apartment doors, there was at least one operable lock on the door and that further security for the tenants of the apartment was provided by an automatic lock on the service door, an intercommunications system and the posting of a guard. It also asserts that plaintiffs\u2019 loss through robbery was not proximately caused by any dereliction of defendant but rather by an intervening act of a third person which was neither reasonably foreseeable nor subject to defendant\u2019s control. The additional finding of the court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>defendant refused to allow plaintiffs to install their own lock through a private locksmith is also challenged. The determination that this constituted added negligence on the part of the landlord, we do not uphold since the evidence did not support the court\u2019s primary finding that permission to repair the lock was actually sought by plaintiffs and specifically denied by the landlord. Our rejection of this finding, however, is not dispositive of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">It has been recognized that the mere relationship of landlord and tenant does not impose upon the landlord a duty to protect the tenant against the criminal activities of third persons. See generally, Annotation, \u201cLandlord\u2019s Duty to Protect Against Crime,\u201d 43 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 331 (1972). Keeovery against a landlord fox a loss occasioned by theft may, however, be predicated on a showing of negligence constituting a proximate cause of the loss. Such proximate cause can be established by demonstrating that according to the common experience of mankind the resulting injury was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the negligent act. <em>McCappin v. Park Capitol Corp., </em>42 <em>N. J. Super. </em>169, 172 (App. Div. 1956). As stated in <em>Genovay v. Fox, 50 N. J. Super. </em>538, 550-551 (App. Div. 1958), rev\u2019d on other grounds 29 <em>N. J. </em>436 (1959) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">The fact that the risk of harm to the plaintiff was attributable to voluntary activity of others not under the control of the defendant does not of itself preclude liability if the harm by human intervention was foreseeable and a reasonable man so situated would take precautions to prevent it. (citations omitted) * <em>* *' </em>The criminality of the activity is but one circumstance in the foreseeability of the harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Thus, while a duty may not be posited solely upon the relationship of landlord and tenant, a landlord does owe a duty to take reasonable steps to protect a tenant from foreseeable criminal acts committed by third persons. <em>Kline v. 1500 Mass. Ave. Apt. Corp., </em>141 U. S. App. D. C. 370, 439 <em>F. </em>2d 477 (D. C. Cir. 1970); <em>cf. Goldberg v. Housing Authority of Newark, </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>578 (1962) and <em>Mayer v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>Housing Authority of Jersey City, </em>84 <em>N. J. Super. </em>411 (App. 1964), aff\u2019d o. b. 44 <em>N. J. </em>567 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">In the context of the evidence, the critical issue affirmatively resolved by the trial court was whether it was reasonably foreseeable that a theft might occur because of defendant\u2019s failure to rectify the inadequate locks on plaintiffs\u2019 apartment door. In an analogous situation, it has been expressed that \u201cthe key to duty, negligence and proximate cause * * * is the foreseeability <em>vel non </em>to a reasonable man of an unreasonably <em>enhanced </em>hazard\" created by defendant\u2019s negligence. <em>Zinck v. Whelan, </em>120 <em>N. J. Super. </em>432, 445 (App. Div. 1972). Also, <em>Rappapori v. Nichols, </em>31 <em>N. J. </em>188 (1959); <em>Ney v. Yellow Cab Co., </em>2 <em>Ill. </em>2d 74, 117 <em>N. E. </em>2d 74 (Sup. Ct. 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The findings of the court, based upon the evidence, indicate that the apartment door was inadequately secured through defendant\u2019s neglect, that this unreasonably enhanced the risk or hazard of a break-in and robbery and that such an occurrence was reasonably foreseeable. The evidence was also sufficient to support the findings that defendant had ample notice that the door was not adequately secured and sufficient opportunity to correct this condition. Compare, <em>Tirado v. Lubarsky, </em>49 <em>Misc. </em>2d 543, 268 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 54 (N. Y. Civ. Ct.), aff\u2019d o. b. 52 Misc. 2d 527, 276 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 128 (App. Div. 1966). The evidence showed as well that entry in all probability was effected by slipping the lock of the apartment. In contrast to <em>Panglorne v. Weiss, </em>86 N. <em>J. L. </em>286 (E. &amp; A. 1914), as well as <em>Mc Cappin v. Park Capitol Corp., supra, </em>cited by defendant, the causal nexus in this case between the landlord\u2019s negligence and the tenant\u2019s loss was sufficiently shown. Proof of such causality need not be established to a certainty. The test as to whether defendants\u2019 act caused damage or loss is one of probability or likelihood. <em>Mc Cappin v. Park Capitol Corp., supra, </em>42 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 173; <em>Zinck v. Whelan, supra, </em>120 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 444-445; <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d \u00a7 448 (1964). Thus, the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the theft of plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>property was proximately caused by defendants\u2019 negligent conduct in permitting the door to remain inadequately secured was firmly based upon the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
