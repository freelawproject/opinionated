We affirm essentially for the reasons stated by the trial judge in his written opinion reported at 125 <em>N. J. Super. </em>546 (Law Div. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">On the cross-appeal of the Township of Wayne, we reverse that portion of the summary judgment which dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>missed its claim lor reimbursement for easements previously acquired by it and conveyed to the county pursuant to the above-described policy. The record before us is very sparse. Before oral argument, at our request, counsel stipulated in writing that the township had in fact so conveyed property to the county without \u201cmonetary payment\u201d to it. The record does not indicate the number of properties involved. At oral argument it was indicated that there were 80 \u201cplus.\u201d Likewise, we find no proof as to whether the municipality acquired these properties by purchase, condemnation or gift, and if by either of the first two methods, the compensation paid therefor. Additionally, the county now asserts that the township is entitled to reimbursement from the State of New Jersey for 50% of the cost of the acquisition of such lands. Whether the munieipalitj'- has sought or received such reimbursement is another pertinent fact not presently disclosed. In sum, by reason of all of the above, we conclude that the issue of the township\u2019s claim for reimbursement was not ripe for summary judgment and thus we reverse and remand for a plenary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The portion of the judgment involved in the county\u2019s main appeal is affirmed. The portion thereof involved in the township\u2019s cross-appeal is reversed and remanded for a plenary hearing. No costs to any party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
