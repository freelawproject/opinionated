A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ACD\">This appeal is addressed to the propriety of counsel fee in a tort action in which a substantial settlement was procured for a seriously injured infant and her guardian <em>ad litem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">Following a hearing approving the settlement plaintiffs\u2019 counsel moved before the assignment judge for determination of a reasonable fee pursuant to <em>R. </em>1:21\u20147(f). The application was for a fee representing 30% of plaintiffs\u2019 net settlement. The assignment judge was of the opinion that the sought fee was fair, reasonable and proper but he questioned his authority to grant it on the ground that the relaxation provisions of <em>R. </em>1:21-7 (f) may not apply to infant settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Counsel fees in infant tort cases are governed by <em>R. </em>1:21-7 \"(Contingent Fees)\u201d which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>=:= * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">(c) In any matter where a client\u2019s claim for damages is based upon the alleged tortious conduct of another, including products liability claims, * * * an attorney shall not * * * collect a contingent fee in excess of the following limits:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\"># * Sfr</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">(6) where the amount recovered is for the benefit of an infant * * * and the matter is settled without trial the foregoing limits shall apply except that the fee on any amount recovered up to $50,000 shall not exceed 25%.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The outer limits established on contingent fees are not absolute. <em>R. </em>1:21-7 (f) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">(f) If at the conclusion of a matter an attorney considers the fee permitted by paragraph (c) to be inadequate, an application on written notice to the client may be made to the Assignment Judge for the hearing and determining of a reasonable fee in light of all the circumstances. <em>* * *</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">See <em>Amer. Trial Lawyers Ass\u2019n. v. N. J. Supreme Cl., </em>126 <em>N. J. Super. </em>577, 583 (App. Div. 1974), aff\u2019d 66 N. <em>J. </em>258 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">We perceive nothing in the rule or in reason which would warrant limiting the rule\u2019s relaxation provision to all contingent fee eases except those involving infants. It is significant that in structuring the rule the Supreme Court caused the relaxation provisions thereof, <em>R. </em>1:21-7(f), to follow the limitation provisions, <em>R. </em>1:21-7 (c) \u2014\u2022 the former silent as to exceptions. The determinants of fee reasonableness, following an assertion of inadequacy, are \u201call the circumstances\u201d. When the rule is read as a whole it evidences a clear intention to make all contingent fees, including those in infants\u2019 tort eases, subject to increase with court approval in special cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">The circumstances here need not be detailed at length. It is enough to note that the matter was a products liability case wherein infant plaintiff suffered serious burns. The factual and legal issues as reflected in the pretrial order were difficult and complex, involving a variety of disparate contending parties. The record supports a finding that coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>sel\u2019s efforts were long, arduous and assiduous in achieving an excellent result for plaintiffs. We observe that, while not controlling, both the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>the infant\u2019s father and her mother consented to the increased fee. The record amply supports the assignment judge\u2019s conclusion that the sought fee was reasonable and would have been allowed by him except for his too narrow reading of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
