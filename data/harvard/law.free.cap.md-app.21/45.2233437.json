Myers, appellant, a member of the Maryland Bar, in all probability takes sharp issue with Frederick Lawrence Knowles (1869 - 1905) who penned in <em>Grief and Joy </em>that, \u201cJoy is a partnership.\u201d Myers\u2019s partnership with Milton Gordon <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> led to a judgment entered by Judge Perry G. Bowen, Jr. on a jury verdict in the Circuit Court for Calvert County<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against Myers and in favor of Xavier Aragona, Marie Aragona and Martin Aragona, appellees, in the amount of $310,000. The judgment is predicated upon an amended declaration charging that Milton Gordon, a law partner of Myers\u2019s, had \u201cwithin the scope of the partnership and within the scope of the agency of the said partnership, maliciously, deliberately, wantonly, and in violation of [his] fiduciary duty, misapplied [and] misappropriated\u201d funds belonging to the appellees which had been entrusted to the law firm of Gordon and Myers. The judgment was further founded on a second count charging negligence on the part of Myers in failing to discover that \u201chis law partner, Milton Gordon had misapplied, misappropriated, breached his fiduciary duty, and stolen the aforesaid sums which had been received by the partnership <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">On appeal to this Court Myers contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">(1) the trial judge erred in allowing an amendment to the original declaration because the amendment set forth a cause of action that was barred by the statute of limitations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">(2) the evidence failed to show that the appellant\u2019s partner, Milton Gordon, took the appellees\u2019 money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">(3) the appellants failed to establish a case of legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>malpractice because they did not show the elements of the action through expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">(4) the proof did not demonstrate that Myers\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of the appellees\u2019 loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The record discloses that the appellees, in 1963, retained the law firm of Gordon and Myers to perform services for the appellees in respect to real property matters. The appellees were engaged in the construction and development of real estate subdivisions. Gordon and Myers were to handle property settlements on behalf of two corporations that were owned equally by Xavier Aragona and his brother, Martin Aragona. During the period 1963 to August 1966 vast sums of money passed through the escrow account of Gordon and Myers. The sums originated from transactions involving Metropolitan Federal Savings and Loan Association, Metropolitan Financial Corporation and the appellees. Metropolitan Federal turned over to Gordon and Myers monies which were to be applied for the use of the appellees. Specifically, the monies were for the purpose of purchasing and releasing certain promissory notes made by appellees to Metropolitan Financial Corporation and which were secured by construction loans on certain real estate. As a result of the misappropriation of the funds the construction loans were not paid. Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation, which had insured the titles passed by Gordon, paid off the loans and was assigned the notes. The appellees were compelled to enter into an agreement whereby the title to the appellees\u2019 land was conveyed to Lawyers Title with an option to the appellees to repurchase under certain highly restrictive conditions. Subsequently, Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation foreclosed and the appellees lost not only the monies, but also the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Gordon and another lawyer, working directly under Gordon\u2019s supervision, handled the overwhelming majority of the settlements. Myers did, however, handle a few of them. The Gordon and Myers escrow account, into which the proceeds of the property settlements were deposited, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>was subject to an order of withdrawal signed by Gordon or Myers or either of two associates. The law firm used a \u201cSettlement Statement\u201d, which statement bore the legend \u201cGordon &amp; Myers, Attorneys at Law\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In February of 1966 Myers became aware of the fact that Gordon\u2019s involvement with the Five Point National Bank of Miami, Florida, was subject to investigation by the United States District Attorney in Miami. According to Myers, Gordon was subsequently indicted in Florida for a violation of the Federal banking laws. One day in August, 1966, Myers observed a great deal of activity in the firm\u2019s office, and Gordon told him, \u201cWe have trouble.\u201d Shortly thereafter Myers learned that there was a deficiency in the escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ_\">Xavier and Martin Aragona testified that they were led to believe that the firm of Gordon and Myers was a partnership and that Gordon and Myers had both referred to each other as \u201cmy partner\u201d. Myers, on the other hand, says that although the letterhead stated \u201cLaw Offices Gordon &amp; Myers\u201d and the \u201cSettlement Statement[s]\u201d bear the legend \u201cGordon &amp; Myers, Attorneys At Law\u201d, there was no partnership, but a \u201crelationship\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Myers informed the jury that the proceeds of the firm that were received from the general practice of law (i.e., the portion of the firm\u2019s business over which he exercised dominance) were divided on an equal basis between himself and Gordon. The earnings from the property settlement legal services, however, Myers said, were all retained, by Gordon. Myers claims that no partnership existed and that the letterheads were printed in the manner stated in the interest of economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The original declaration averred in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">\u201c2. Lawyer\u2019s Title Insurance Corporation, ... a Virginia Corporation, doing business in Maryland, directed the insured, Metropolitan Federal Savings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>&amp; Loan Association, Bethesda, Maryland, to pay $268,559.84,... to the law firm of Gordon <em>&amp; </em>Myers, settlement attorneys, to purchase said notes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">3. Milton Gordon, partner in the firm of Gordon <em>&amp; </em>Myers, issued a title insurance policy to Metropolitan Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, by which policy, in the event of default, Metropolitan Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association would be in the position of first party in a first deed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">4. Said Milton Gordon misappropriated the funds placed in trust with the firm of Gordon &amp; Myers and his whereabouts are presently unknown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">7. That as a proximate result of the misappropriation of the funds entrusted to the firm of Gordon &amp; Myers, plaintiffs were placed in a compromised financial position and have suffered great monetary and credit damages thereby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">8. Defendant Mitchell L. Myers, partner with Milton Gordon in the law firm of Gordon &amp; Myers, was negligent in that he knew or should have known that which he could have discovered upon a diligent inquiry, that the firm, through Milton Gordon, was acting improperly. Defendant, occupying the trusted position of attorney, owed a duty to parties involved with matters handled by his office, to see that they were handled properly and competently. By reason of defendant\u2019s negligence, in violation of his fiduciary relationship, plaintiffs have suffered and incurred great financial losses and burdens and jeopardized their credit standing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">The original declaration was filed on July 2, 1969, and thereafter some discovery proceedings were conducted. Present counsel for appellees entered his appearance on March 15, 1971, and the original counsel withdrew. On May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>5, 1972 the appellees filed a motion for leave to amend to which Myers interposed his objection. A hearing was held before Judge Bowen on June 23, 1972, and the motion for leave to amend was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The amended declaration set forth four counts. A directed verdict in favor of Myers on the third and fourth counts was entered by Judge Bowen at the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019s case, and the appellees concede the correctness of that ruling. Count I of the amended declaration averred a law partnership known as \u201cGordon and Myers\u201d, that Gordon and Myers had been employed to provide professional services for the appellees, that monies were received by Gordon and Myers for the use of the appellees, that Gordon misappropriated the money, and \u201cbecause of the partnership . . . Mitchell L. Myers, is liable for the wrongful acts and breach of fiduciary duty perpetrated by his law partner and the resultant injury to the plaintiffs.\u201d Count II, grounded in negligence, charged that Myers had \u201cfailed to inspect books of account and other financial records of the partnership, and further that he failed to make inquiry as to the application of the . . . funds or to familiarize himself with the transactions carried on by his law partner\u201d and that because of Myers\u2019s negligence he did not discover that Gordon had \u201cmisappropriated\u201d and \u201cstolen\u201d the monies belonging to the plaintiffs-appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The original suit was filed, as we have noted, on July 2, 1969, the cause of action having arisen when the malpractice was discovered, in late July or August of 1966, <em>Mumford v. Staton, Whaley &amp; Price, </em>254 Md. 697, 255 A. 2d 359 (1969),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>so that patently the suit was brought within the three year statutory period. Md. Ann. Code, Art. 57, \u00a7 1. In the instant case the overriding issue is whether the amendment to the declaration stated a new cause of action vulnerable to appellant\u2019s plea of limitations. The rule is that if an amendment sets forth a new cause of action, then limitations is measured from the time of the accrual of the cause to the date the amended declaration is filed, but if the amendment does not state a new cause of action, then limitations is determined with reference to the date of the original filing. <em>Doughty v. Prettyman, </em>219 Md. 83, 148 A. 2d 438 (1959); <em>Cline v. Fountain, Etc., Company, </em>214 Md. 251, 134 A. 2d 304 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The case now before us turns on whether Count I of the amended declaration, grounded upon \u201cThe Uniform Partnership Act\u201d, Md. Ann. Code Art. 73A, sets forth a new cause of action that was barred by the statute of limitations. In <em>Brooks v. Childress, </em>198 Md. 1, 81 A. 2d 47 (1951), a negligence causing death case, the Court of Appeals reversed in part because the trial judge refused to allow an amendment that sought to change the basis of the alleged liability of a father for the negligence of his seventeen year old son from agency to imputed negligence because the father had signed his son\u2019s application for a drivers license. At that time Md. Ann. Code Art. 66V2, \u00a7 85 (1947 supplement),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u201c(a) The application of any person under the age of eighteen (18) years for an instruction permit or operator\u2019s or chauffer\u2019s license shall be signed and verified, before a person authorized to administer oaths, by a parent or guardian of the applicant.... The Department [of Motor Vehicles] shall clearly set forth on the application the responsibilities assumed under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">\u201c(b) Any negligence of a minor under the age of eighteen (18) years when driving a motor vehicle upon a highway of this State shall be imputed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>the person who has signed the application of such minor....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">During the course of the trial, counsel received information that the father of the negligent youth had signed his son\u2019s application for a drivers license. Counsel then sought to amend his declaration and to base his theory of recovery against the youth\u2019s father on the Motor Vehicle Code, Art. 66V2, \u00a7 85 (b). The Court of Appeals speaking through Judge Collins said, at 13:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">\u201cThe main reason given by the trial judge in refusing the further amendment was that, if it were permitted, the second amended declaration would then state an entirely different cause of action from that then declared upon. With this conclusion... we do not agree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The Court then quoted extensively from <em>Zier v. Chesapeake Ry. Co., </em>98 Md. 35, 56 A. 385 (1903), wherein Chief Judge McSherry said for the Court, at 42-43:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">\u201cDid the amendment change, the cause of action? As we have said the suit was brought under Art. <em>67 of the Code, </em>which permits an action to be maintained to recover damages whenever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect or default;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> if the act, neglect or default (had death not ensued) would have entitled the injured party to recover damages in respect thereof. Now, the original declaration though defective was founded on the alleged negligence of the defendant. The fact that the <em>narr </em>was insufficient in law \u2014 that it did not accurately and formally set forth the real cause of action \u2014 did not prevent the suit itself from being a pending suit wherein the gravamen was the negligence of the defendant. When the amendment was made precisely the same cause of action was declared on'____The negligence alleged in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>count was the negligence of the defendant through its agents, but was none the less the negligence of the master, though as respects a servant of the master it was not actionable. In the second count the negligence alleged was again the negligence of the master in failing to exercise due care in the selection of the fellowservants by whom the injury was inflicted. But the suit to recover for the defendant\u2019s negligence was precisely the same after the amendment had been made that it was antecedently. The <em>statement </em>of the cause of action was different but the <em>cause of action </em>itself was identical. Injury resulting in death is what occasioned the suit. The imperfect statement of the case did not cause the correct statement of it to be a different cause of action. Being the <em>same </em>cause of action the accurate statement of it in the amended declaration did not convert the original suit into a new and different suit; and therefore did not warrant the filing of any other plea of the Statute of Limitations than such as could have been interposed to the original <em>narr\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The Court concluded in <em>Brooks </em>that the amended declaration was predicated upon the father\u2019s responsibility for the negligence of his son while driving with the permission of his father, and hence the amendment was allowable.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u201cThe Uniform Partnership Act\u201d, Md. Ann. Code Art. 73A, provides in \u00a7\u00a7 13 through 15:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">\u201c\u00a7 13. <em>Partnership bound by partner\u2019s wrongful act.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">Where, by any wrongful act or omission of any partner acting in the ordinary course of the business of the partnership, or with the authority of his copartners, loss or injury is caused to any person, not being a partner in the partnership, or any penalty is incurred, the partnership is liable therefor to the same extent as the partner so acting or omitting to act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\u00a7 <em>If Partnership hound by partner\u2019s breach of trust.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">The partnership is bound to make good the loss:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">(a) Where one partner acting within the scope of his apparent authority receives money or property of a third person and misapplies it; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">(b) Where the partnership in the course of its business receives money or property of a third person and the money or property so received is misapplied by any partner while it is in the custody of the partnership.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">\u00a7 15. <em>Nature of partner\u2019s liability.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">All partners are liable:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">(a) Jointly and severally for everything chargeable to the partnership under \u00a7\u00a713 and 14.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">(b) Jointly for all other debts and obligations of the partnership; but any partner may enter into a separate obligation to perform a partnership contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">Furthermore, \u00a7 16 of the same article states that when a person either orally, in writing or by his conduct represents himself, or consents to have another represent him as a partner in an existing partnership with one or more persons, \u201che is liable to any such person to whom any such representation has been made, who has, on the faith of such representation, given credit to the actual or apparent partnership. . . .\u201d The original declaration, while hardly a model of clarity, nevertheless did set forth the existence of the law partnership known as Gordon &amp; Myers, Gordon\u2019s misappropriation of funds belonging to the appellees, the partnership of Myers in the law firm, and a charge of negligence on the part of Myers in failing to see to it that the monies received by the firm for the use of appellees were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>handled in a proper and competent manner. In the light of <em>Brooks v. Childress, supra, </em>and <em>Zier v. Chesapeake Ry. Co., supra, </em>we think that the amended declaration did no more than clarify the inartfully drawn original suit. While the statement of the cause of action adopted a different format the cause of action itself was identical. The gist of both the original action and the amended one was the liability of Myers for the misappropriation, by his partner, of funds entrusted to the partnership. Even if no actual partnership existed between Gordon and Myers, Myers is nonetheless, by virtue of his using or allowing the use of the name \u201cGordon &amp; Myers, Attorneys at Law\u201d on the \u201cSettlement Statements]\u201d and \u201cLaw Offices Gordon &amp; Myers\u201d on letterheads estopped from denying the existence of the partnership. Md. Ann. Code Art. 73A, \u00a7 16; <em>McBriety v. Phillips, </em>180 Md. 569, 26 A. 2d 400 (1942); <em>Blaustein v. Oldfield, </em>135 Md. 162, 108 A. 485 (1919). He may not now be heard to say that he was not, in fact, a partner, but that Im and Gordon merely had a \u201crelationship\u201d. In the eyes of the law, that \u201crelationship\u201d is as much a partnership, insofar as third parties are concerned, as if there had been formal Articles of Partnership subscribed to by both Myers and Gordon.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The trial judge directed the jury to find a verdict in favor of the appellees on count one of the declaration \u2014 the count brought under \u201cThe Uniform Partnership Act\u201d. The judge told the jury, and properly so, that as a matter of law Myers was responsible for the misappropriation of funds from the partnership account by Myers\u2019s partner, Gordon. Md. Ann. Code Art. 73A, \u00a7\u00a7 13 - 15. During a colloquy between the court and counsel the judge told counsel that if he let the matter go to the jury on the partnership count only, and an appellate court reversed, the case would have to be retried. Therefore, the trial judge decided that out of an abundance of caution he would let the jury consider both counts of the declaration so that if he were wrong in his interpretation of the partnership law the case would, nevertheless, still have been decided on the question of the negligence, <em>vel non, </em>of Myers. The judge told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u201cNow I am going to ask you to bring in a special verdict to this extent. . .; on the first count the only question you will have to answer is, what are the damages. On the second count, you will have to answer, whether your verdict is for the Plaintiffs or for the Defendant and of course you can use the same figure for damages. That doesn\u2019t mean we are going to enter two judgments, we are going to enter a single judgment on that figure, but the figure will be the same which ever count [you] apply it to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Judge Bowen then prepared a written form which the jury completed, and when so completed read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">\u201cVerdicts -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af9\">Count I Plaintiff</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A27\">Count II Damages Plaintiff $310,000 V</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An0\">Defendant</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEc\">If for Plaintiff Damages $310,000</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-17\">It is apparent from the jury\u2019s verdict that the jury was of the opinion that Myers was negligent in his dealings with the appellees. We need not, however, in this appeal, decide any question of negligence on the part of Myers. Having determined the applicability of \u201cThe Uniform Partnership Act\u201d it is unnecessary to consider Myers\u2019s negligence, if any, because in the light of the law of partnerships any discussion relative to negligence on the part of Myers is rendered purely academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-18\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b76-19\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-10\">. <em>See </em>Gordon v.
