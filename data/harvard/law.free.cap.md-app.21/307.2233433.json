The facts are essentially undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">On 4 August 1971 the parties entered into a contract entitled \u201cStandard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Contractor\u201d which included as a part of the contract a document entitled \u201cGeneral Conditions of the Contract for Construction.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By the terms of this contract the appellee, Frederick Contractors, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the contractor), agreed, for a stipulated sum, to build for the appellant, Bel Pre Medical Center, Inc. (hereinafter referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>to as the owner), a two-story addition to the owner\u2019s nursing home in Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The relevant portions of the contract, in the order of their importance, provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">\u201c7.10.1 [General Conditions]. All claims, disputes and other matters in question arising out of, or relating to, this Contract or the breach thereof, except as set forth in Subparagraph 2.2.9 with respect to the Architect\u2019s decisions on matters relating to artistic effect, and except for claims which have been waived by the making or acceptance of final payment as provided by Subparagraphs 9.7.5 and 9.7.6, shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then obtaining unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. This agreement so to arbitrate shall be specifically enforceable under the prevailing arbitration law. The award rendered by the arbitrators shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">\u201c7.10.2 [General Conditions]. Notice of the demand for arbitration shall be filed in writing with the other party to the Contract and with the American Arbitration Association, and a copy shall be filed with the Architect. The demand for arbitration shall be made within the time limits specified in Subparagraphs 2.2.10 and 2.2.11 where applicable, and in all other cases within a reasonable time after the claim, dispute or other matter in question has arisen, and in no event shall it be made after institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such claim, dispute or other matter in question would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">\u201c2.2.7 [General Conditions]. Claims, disputes and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>other matters in question between the Contractor and tne Owner relating to the execution or progress of the Work or the interpretation of the Contract Documents shall be referred initially to the Architect for decision which he will render in writing within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\">\u201c2.2.9 [General Conditions]. The Architect\u2019s decisions in matters relating to artistic effect will be final if consistent with the intent of the Contract Documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">\u201c2.2.10 [General Conditions], Any claim, dispute or other matter that has been referred to the Architect, except those relating to artistic effect as provided in Subparagraph 2.2.9 and except any which have been waived by the making or acceptance of final payment as provided in Subparagraphs 9.7.5 and 9.7.6, shall be subject to arbitration upon the written demand of either party. However, no demand for arbitration of any such claim, dispute or other matter may be made until the earlier of: .1 the date on which the Architect has rendered his decision, or .2 the tenth day after the parties have presented their evidence to the Architect or have been given a reasonable opportunity to do so, if the Architect has not rendered his written decision by that date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">\u201c2.2.11 [General Conditions], If a decision of the Architect is made in writing and states that it is final but subject to appeal, no demand for arbitration of a claim, dispute or other matter covered by such decision may be made later than thirty days after the date on which the party making the demand received the decision. The failure to demand arbitration within said thirty days\u2019 period will result in the Architect\u2019s decision becoming final and binding upon the Owner and the Contractor. If the Architect renders a decision after arbitration proceedings have been initiated, such decision may be entered as evidence but will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>supersede any arbitration proceedings except where the decision is acceptable to the parties concerned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">On 12 January 1973 the architect and representatives of the owner and the contractor met to inspect the premises and to determine what items remained to be completed by the contractor. On 16 January 1973 the architect wrote a letter to the owner which stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">\u201cWe hereby certify that to the best of our knowledge, information and belief, and on the basis of our observation and inspection the Work has been completed In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contract Documents and that the entire balance found to be due the Contractor, except as noted below is due and payable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">We have attached herewith a copy of our final \u201cPunch List\u201d dated 12 January 1973. We feel an equitable sum of $5,000.00 should be withheld from final payment of retainage until this \u201cPunch List\u201d is complete.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The \u201cpunch list\u201d contains 58 separate minor items remaining to be done. On or about 16 January 1973, the contractor submitted written requisitions for payment. On 27 January 1973 a meeting took place between the owner and the contractor at which a dispute arose whieh was not then resolved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Final payment has not been made by the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">On 22 March 1973 the contractor recorded a mechanic\u2019s lien on the subject property and on 30 April 1973 filed a bill in equity to foreclose on the lien. On 22 May 1973 the owner made a demand upon the contractor for arbitration in which he charged that the contractor:</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">1) failed to construct the building according to specifications;</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">2) failed to recognize the architect as an employee of the owner;</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>3) interfered with the contractual relationship between the architect and the owner; and</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">4) failed to obtain certificates of payment signed by the architect.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">On 8 June 1973 the contractor refused to participate in the arbitration proceedings \u201cunless ordered by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">On 24 May 1973 the owner moved to strike the mechanic\u2019s lien on the grounds that arbitration was the sole and exclusive remedy which the contractor could utilize to enforce his rights. On 12 June 1973 this motion was denied. On 19 June the owner filed his answer to the contractor\u2019s bill of complaint. He admitted all of the contractor\u2019s allegations except the amounts in dispute, and averred that the contractor had waived his right to file a mechanic\u2019s lien by failure to demand arbitration. On 27 June 1974 the contractor applied for an ex parte injunction to stay the arbitration demanded by the owner on the ground that the owner had failed to demand arbitration within thirty days of the receipt of the architect\u2019s letter. The ex parte injunction was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">On 12 July a hearing was held to determine whether a permanent injunction enjoining the arbitration proceeding should issue. Judge Philip M. Fairbanks found that the question presented was \u201cwhether the provisions [\u00b6\u00b6 2.2.10 and 2.2.11 of the General Conditions] requiring demand for arbitration to be made within thirty days of the architect\u2019s decision apply or whether the provisions [\u00b6 7.10.2 of the General Conditions] requiring demands for arbitration to be made within a reasonable time after claim or within the statute of limitations apply.\u201d Judge Fairbanks determined that the architect\u2019s letter of 16 January 1973 constituted \u201chis decision that the work was completed and that the contractor was entitled to be paid;\u201d that under the contract the owner was required to demand arbitration \u201cwithin thirty days of the architect\u2019s letter, or at most within thirty days of January 27, 1973;\u201d and that the owner, therefore, had sought arbitration too late. The judge further found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u201ceven were the provisions of 2.2.10 and 2.2.11 not applicable, the owner\u2019s demand for arbitration comes not within a reasonable time, having been delayed until nearly a month after the filing of the mechanic\u2019s lien.\u201d An order permanently enjoining the parties from proceeding with arbitration was entered on 3 August 1973. It is this order from which the owner appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The question before us concerns the effect of an arbitration clause agreed to by the owner and the contractor. Appellant-owner contends here, as he did below, that the agreement of the parties to arbitrate \u201call claims, disputes, and other matters in question arising out of, or relating to this contract or the breach thereof\u2019 is binding upon the parties and precludes a court from determining the amount of money due for labor and materials furnished by the contractor to the owner. He insists that by agreement of the parties this issue must be determined by the arbitrator. Appellee-contractor does not dispute the fact that the issue of the amount of money due and owing for labor and materials is arbitrable under the terms of the agreement but contends that the owner waived his right to arbitration by failing to file a timely demand for arbitration. In support of this position the contractor argues, in the alternative, either that the architect\u2019s letter of 16 January 1973 constituted an \u201carchitect\u2019s decision\u201d within the meaning of Paragraph 2.2.10 of the agreement so that under Paragraph 2.2.11 a demand for arbitration was required to be filed within 30 days, or that a dispute arose at the meeting of 27 January 1973 so that under Paragraph 7.10.2 a demand for arbitration had to be filed within a reasonable time. The contractor asserts that in either event the demand for arbitration, made on 22 May 1973, was too late. The owner asserts that the architect\u2019s letter of 16 January 1973 is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>an \u201carchitect\u2019s decision\u201d so that he was not under an obligation to demand arbitration within 30 days; that his demand for arbitration was filed well within the period of limitations established by Paragraph 7.10.2 of the agreement and was therefore filed within a reasonable time; and, most importantly, that under the broad language of Paragraph 7.10.1 the very question of whether there was compliance on his part with the procedural requirements of the contract for the initiation of arbitration proceedings is to be determined by the arbitrator and not by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u201cSince time immemorial, governments have provided means, either in the person of the Sovereign himself, or in the form of courts, for settlement of disputes between subjects.\u201d Mullen, \u201cArbitration under Maryland Law,\u201d 2 <em>Md. L. Rev. </em>326 (1938). Arbitration is the process whereby parties voluntarily agree to substitute a private tribunal for the public tribunal otherwise available to them. The arbitration process provides a speedy, informal, relatively inexpensive, and private procedure for resolving controversies arising out of commercial transactions, as well as a tribunal uniquely qualified to resolve such disputes. <em>Schreiber v. Pac. Coast Fire Ins. Co., </em>195 Md. 639, 647, 75 A. 2d 108, 111-12 (1950); <em>Dominion Marble Co. v. Morrow, </em>130 Md. 255, 260, 100 A. 292, 293 (1917); <em>California Law Revision Comm\u2019n, A Study Relating to Arbitration </em>G-25 (1960); <em>M. Domke, The Law and Practice of Commercial Arbitration, </em>\u00a7 2.01 at 10 (1968); Aksen, \u201cResolving Construction Contract Disputes Through Arbitration,\u201d 23 <em>Arb. J. </em>141, 158 (1968); Cushman, \u201cArbitration and State Law,\u201d 23 <em>Arb. J. </em>162 (1968). The arbitrator is not a public official imposed upon the parties by a superior authority, and he is not required to administer justice for a community which transcends the parties. Rather, he is a part of the system of self-government created by and confined to the parties and designed to serve their specialized needs. The arbitrator is usually chosen because of the parties\u2019 confidence in his knowledge of the practices of the industry which enables him to employ considerations in fashioning his judgments which may be foreign to the expertise of the courts. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>parties expect that the arbitrator\u2019s competence and skill, based on his specialized knowledge and experience, will produce a judgment which is founded not only upon the literal meaning of the words appearing in the contract document itself, but also on their meaning in the context of the practices and customs associated with their use. <em>Schreiber v. Pac. Coast Fire Ins. Co., supra; </em>Phillips, \u201cA Lawyer\u2019s Approach to Commercial Arbitration,\u201d 44 <em>Yale L. J. </em>31, 40-41 (1934); <em>see </em>Shulman, \u201cReason, Contract, and Law in Labor Relations,\u201d 68 <em>Harv. L. Rev. </em>999, 1016-18 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The view of courts toward the arbitration process has been somewhat ambivalent. The common law, recognizing the value of arbitration, permitted parties to agree voluntarily that they would submit to arbitration their existing or possible future disputes. If the agreement to arbitrate was performed by the parties and an arbitrator\u2019s award obtained, the award would be enforced by the courts. <em>Nelley v. Baltimore City, </em>224 Md. 1, 8-9, 166 A. 2d 234, 237 (1960); <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Clark, </em>128 Md. 291, 309, 97 A. 911, 917 (1916). Indeed, suits to enforce an arbitrator\u2019s award were described as \u201cfavored\u201d actions, <em>Parr Construction Co. v. Pomer, </em>217 Md. 539, 543, 144 A. 2d 69, 72 (1958); <em>Dominion Marble Co. v. Morrow, supra; Lewis v. Burgess, </em>5 Gill. 129, 131 (1847); <em>Caton v. McTavish, </em>10 G. &amp; J. 192, 216-17 (1838); and the awards of arbitrators would not be set aside by the courts unless the arbitrator was guilty of fraud, misconduct or prejudice, had exceeded his authority, or had made a mistake in law or fact appearing on the face of the award. <em>Chillum v. Button </em>&amp; <em>Goode, </em>242 Md. 509, 517, 219 A. 2d 801, 806 (1966); <em>Parr Construction Co. v. Pomer, supra, </em>217 Md. at 543-44; 144 A. 2d at 72; <em>Witz v. Tregallas, </em>82 Md. 351, 369-70, 33 A. 718, 721-22 (1896); <em>Roloson v. Carson, </em>8 Md. 208, 220-22 (1855). But at common law it was also the general rule that, in the absence of legislative direction to the contrary, an executory agreement for arbitration of the ultimate rights of the parties, such as an agreement to arbitrate all future disputes that might thereafter arise, even though resort to arbitration was specified to be a condition precedent to court action, was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>enforceable and could not constitute a bar to legal or equitable redress in the courts. Courts and commentators reasoned that such a contract, which ousted the jurisdiction of the courts, was against public policy and illegal; or that such an agreement affected only the remedies available to the parties and not their substantive rights; or that such an agreement was revocable at will. <em>Eisel v. Howell, </em>220 Md. 584, 587-588, 155 A. 2d 509, 511 (1959); <em>Tomlinson v. Dille, </em>147 Md. 161, 167, 127 A. 746, 748 (1925). Thus, while suits to enforce an arbitration award were viewed as \u201cfavored\u201d actions, executory agreements for arbitration were consigned to an \u201cunfavored\u201d status and suits to compel arbitration or to stay court proceedings pending arbitration could not be brought.<footnotemark>3a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">In Maryland arbitration was governed by the common law rules until 1965, the year in which the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, Code (1957), Art. 7, was enacted by the General Assembly.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Uniform Arbitration Act is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>product of the National Conference of Commissioners on \u00dcniform State Laws and was approved in 1956. It has now been adopted by seventeen states, including Maryland.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The Maryland Act provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">\u201c\u00a7 1. A written agreement to submit any existing controversy to arbitration or a provision in a written contract to submit to arbitration any controversy thereafter arising between the parties is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. This article does not apply to an arbitration agreement between employers and employees or between their respective representatives unless it is expressly provided in such agreement that this article shall apply.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201c\u00a7 2. (a) <em>When court to order arbitration; expeditious hearing to determine issue; ordering arbitration or denial of application. </em>\u2014 On application of a party showing an agreement described in \u00a7 1, and the opposing party\u2019s refusal to arbitrate, the court shall order the parties to proceed with arbitration, but if the opposing party denies the existence of the agreement to arbitrate, the court shall proceed expeditiously to the determination of the issues so raised and sh9.ll order arbitration if found for the moving party, otherwise, the application shall be denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u201c(b) <em>Staying arbitration. \u2014 </em>On application, the court may stay an arbitration proceeding commenced or threatened on a showing that there is no agreement to arbitrate as described in \u00a7 1. Such an issue, when in substantial and bona fide dispute, shall be forthwith tried and the stay ordered if found for the moving party. If found for the opposing party, the court shall order the parties to proceed to arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\">\u201c(c) <em>Courts in which application may he made. </em>\u2014 If an issue referable to arbitration under the alleged agreement is involved in an action or proceeding pending in a court having jurisdiction to hear applications under subsection (a) of this section, the application shall be made therein. Otherwise and subject to \u00a7 17, the application may be made in any court of competent jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\u201c(d) <em>Stay of proceedings when order of arbitration or application therefor made; when order to include stay. </em>\u2014 Any action or proceeding involving an issue subject to arbitration shall be stayed if an order for arbitration or an application therefor has been made under this section or, if the issue is severable, the stay may be with respect thereto only. When the application is made in such action or proceeding, the order for arbitration shall include such stay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">\u201c(e) <em>When order not to he refused. </em>\u2014 An order for arbitration shall not be refused or an arbitration proceeding stayed on the ground that the claim in issue lacks merit or bona fides or because a valid basis for the claim sought to be arbitrated has not been shown.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The Uniform Arbitration Act constitutes a radical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>departure from the common law. Executory agreements to arbitrate are to be deemed \u201cvalid, irrevocable and enforceable,\u201d and suits to compel arbitration or to stay the action of a court pending arbitration may now be brought. The prime purpose of these provisions is to discourage litigation and to foster voluntary resolution of disputes in a forum created, controlled and administered according to the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate. <em>Maietta v. Greenfield, </em>267 Md. 287, 291, 297 A. 2d 244, 246 (1972); <em>Accord, School District No. 46 v. Del Bianco, </em>68 Ill. App. 2d 145, 215 N.E.2d 25, 31 (1966); <em>Layne-Minnesota Co. v. Regents of Univ. of Minn., </em>266 Minn. 284, 123 N.W.2d 371, 374-75 (1963). Thus, by its enactment, the General Assembly established a policy in favor of the settlement of disputes through the arbitration process and ended the ambivalence of courts under the common law. Not only suits to enforce an arbitrator\u2019s award, but also suits to compel arbitration and suits to stay court action pending arbitration, are now to be viewed as \u201cfavored\u201d actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">In accord with the legislative policy in favor of the enforcement of executory agreements to arbitrate, the Act strictly confines the function of the court in suits to compel arbitration to the resolution of a single issue: is there an agreement to arbitrate the subject matter of the dispute. What is sought in such suits is the enforcement of an agreement to arbitrate. Whether one is seeking a court order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration under \u00a7 2 (a), resisting a demand for arbitration and seeking an order staying it under \u00a7 2 (b), or seeking to stay a court action and obtain an order directing arbitration under \u00a7 2 (d), the question is always the same: is there an agreement to arbitrate? <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Where the language of the arbitration provisions is clear and precise, there is no problem for the court. If it is plain that the dispute sought to be arbitrated falls within the scope of the arbitration clause, arbitration should be compelled. If it is apparent, on the other hand, that the issue sought to be arbitrated lies beyond the scope of the arbitration clause, the opposing party should not be compelled to submit to arbitration, since there is no agreement to arbitrate. Where there is a broad arbitration clause, calling for the arbitration of any and all disputes arising out of the contract, all issues are arbitrable <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> unless expressly and specifically excluded. <em>McCandliss v. Ward W. Ross, Inc., </em>45 Mich. App. 342, 206 N.W.2d 455, 457 (1973); <em>Michigan Mutual Liability Co. v. Graham, </em>44 Mich. App. 406, 205 N.W.2d 289, 291 (1973); <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. McGee, </em>32 Mich. App. 539, 189 N.W.2d 44, 48 (1971);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Grover-Diamond Ass\u2019n v. American Arbitration Ass\u2019n, </em>Minn., 211 N.W.2d 787, 790 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">A problem is created for the court when the language of the arbitration provision is unclear as to whether the subject matter of the dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement. In such circumstances the legislative policy in favor of the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate dictates that the question should be left to the decision of the arbitrator. Whether the party seeking arbitration is right or wrong is a question of contract application and interpretation for the arbitrator, not the court, Code (1957), Art. 7, \u00a7 2 (e), and the court should not deprive the party seeking arbitration of the arbitrator\u2019s skilled judgment by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>attempting to resolve the ambiguity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under such circumstances arbitration should be compelled.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Here the parties agreed to submit to arbitration \u201call claims, disputes and other matters in question arising out of or relating to the contract or the breach thereof.\u201d Without first seeking arbitration the contractor filed suit to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien for money allegedly due and owing under the agreement. Thereafter the owner made a demand for arbitration of issues concerning the amount of money, if any, that was due and owing. The contractor refused to arbitrate and sought to stay the arbitration proceeding, not because the arbitrability of the substantive issues was questioned but rather because of a dispute as to whether the demand for arbitration had been timely made. Thus the question of substantive arbitrability is not before us. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>precise issue which we must resolve is whether the question of compliance with the procedural prerequisite of a timely demand growing out of the arbitrable dispute should be determined by the arbitrator or a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Neither Maryland nor any other state which has adopted the Uniform Arbitration Act has decided this issue.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, the identical question has been resolved by the United States Supreme Court in a suit brought by a labor organization to compel arbitration under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, </em>376 U. S. 543, 84 S. Ct. 909 (1964), the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>alleged that it had no duty to arbitrate a dispute found by the court to be arbitrable because the Union had failed to comply with certain of the procedural prerequisites to arbitration required by the governing collective bargaining agreement, including a requirement for a timely filing of the demand for arbitration.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> There the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\">\u201cWe think that labor disputes of the kind involved here cannot be broken down so easily into their \u2018substantive\u2019 and \u2018procedural\u2019 aspects. Questions concerning the procedural prerequisites to arbitration do not arise in a vacuum; they develop in the context of an actual dispute about the rights of the parties to the contract or those covered by it. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">\u201cDoubt whether grievance procedures or some part of them apply to a particular dispute, whether such procedures have been followed or excused, or whether the unexcused failure to follow them avoids the duty to arbitrate cannot ordinarily be answered without consideration of the merits of the dispute which is presented for arbitration....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">It would be a curious rule which required that intertwined issues of \u2018substance\u2019 and \u2018procedure\u2019 growing out of a single dispute and raising the same questions on the same facts had to be carved up between two different forums, one deciding after the other. Neither logic nor considerations of policy compel such a result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">\u201cOnce it is determined, as we have, that the parties are obligated to submit the subject matter of a dispute to arbitration, \u2018procedural\u2019 questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition should be left to the arbitrator. Even under a contrary rule, a court could deny arbitration only if it could confidently be said not only that a claim was strictly \u2018procedural,\u2019 and therefore within the purview of the court, but also that it should operate to bar arbitration altogether, and not merely limit or qualify an arbitral award. In view of the policies favoring arbitration and the parties\u2019 adoption of arbitration as the preferred means of settling disputes, such cases are likely to be rare indeed. In all other cases, those in which arbitration goes forward, the arbitrator would ordinarily remain free to reconsider the ground covered by the court insofar as it bore on the merits of the dispute, using the flexible approaches familiar to arbitration. Reservation of \u2018procedural\u2019 issues for the courts would thus not only create the difficult task of separating related issues, but would also produce frequent duplication of effort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">\u201cIn addition, the opportunities for deliberate delay and the possibility of well-intentioned but no less serious delay created by separation of the \u2018procedural\u2019 and \u2018substantive\u2019 elements of a dispute are clear. While the courts have the task of determining \u2018substantive arbitrability,\u2019 there will be cases in which arbitrability of the subject matter is unquestioned but a dispute arises over the procedures to be followed. In all of such cases, acceptance of Wiley\u2019s position would produce the delay attendant upon judicial proceedings preliminary to arbitration. As this case, commenced in January 1962 and not yet committed to arbitration, well illustrates, such delay may entirely eliminate the prospect of a speedy arbitrated settlement of the dispute, to the disadvantage of the parties (who, in addition, will have to bear increased costs) and contrary to the aims of national labor policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u201cNo justification for such a generally undesirable result is to be found in a presumed intention of the parties. Refusal to order arbitration of subjects which the parties have not agreed to arbitrate does not entail the fractionating of disputes about subjects which the parties do wish to have submitted. Although a party may resist arbitration once a grievance has arisen, as does Wiley here, we think it best accords with the usual purposes of an arbitration clause and with the policy behind federal labor law to regard procedural disagreements not as separate disputes but as aspects of the dispute which called the grievance procedures into play.\u201d 376 U. S. at 556-59, 84 S. Ct. at 918-19.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">This rule has been consistently followed and applied by federal courts.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">While the principles enunciated in <em>Wiley </em>do not flow from an interpretation of the Uniform Arbitration Act, the Congressional policy favoring the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate which led the Supreme Court to its resolution of this issue under \u00a7 301 are parallel to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>policies underlying the Uniform Arbitration Act. Under \u00a7 301 the function of the court is strictly confined to ascertaining whether the parties agreed to arbitrate the subject matter of the dispute.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> When the parties have agreed to submit any and all controversies arising out of the contract to an arbitrator, all issues other than those expressly and specifically excluded must be submitted to arbitration.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> All doubts concerning the arbitrability of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>subject matter of the dispute are to be resolved in favor of arbitration.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Once it is determined that an arbitrable issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>exists the parties are not to be deprived by the courts of the benefits of arbitration for which they bargained \u2014 speed in the resolution of the dispute and the employment of the specialized knowledge and competence of the arbitrator. <em>Wiley v. Livingston, supra, </em>376 U. S. at 557-58, 84 S. Ct. 918-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">We are convinced that the rule enunicated in the <em>Wiley </em>case, applicable to arbitration under collective bargaining agreements in suits brought under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, is sound and totally consistent with the intent and purposes of the Uniform Arbitration Act. The rule promotes the benefits of arbitration. It removes the \u201cdifficult task of separating related issues\u201d from the courts and avoids duplication of effort and unjustifiable delay. We believe that the application of <em>Wiley </em>to commercial arbitration would properly effectuate the legislative policy in favor of the enforcement of executory agreements to arbitrate which the Uniform Arbitration Act expresses.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>The application of <em>Wiley </em>to the instant case produces a clear result. Here the substantive arbitrability of the dispute is unquestioned and the only area of conflict relates to compliance with the procedural prerequisite of timeliness of the demand for arbitration. We can find no justification for the fractionating of a dispute which the parties agree to submit to arbitration. Accordingly we now hold that under an arbitration clause such as is present in this case, when parties are obligated to submit the subject matter of their dispute to arbitration, \u201cprocedural\u201d questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition should be left to the arbitrator.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The trial court erred in ordering a stay of arbitration.

Nor is it whether the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the contract in the second and third category [where it is unclear from the language of the arbitration clause whether the dispute sought to be arbitrated falls within it] may be so unreasonable as to go beyond the limits of his authority conferred by the agreement.

In his brief appellee cites a number of state and federal cases which have held that where parties to a contract that contains an enforceable agreement to arbitrate a dispute proceed to litigate it without objection from either party, there has been a mutual revocation of the arbitration agreement and the party failing to object to the litigation has waived his right to arbitration. None of these cases are apposite to the instant case in which the owner objected to the suit to enforce the mechanic\u2019s lien in his initial pleading on the grounds that the subject matter of the dispute was arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Appellee further cites a number of cases in which state courts have held that where a contract provided for the exclusive remedy of arbitration and timely demand for arbitration was not made, the right to arbitration had been waived. None of these cases were decided under the Uniform Arbitration Act and in none of them did the parties raise the issue before us of whether the question of compliance with the procedural prerequisites to arbitration should be decided by the arbitrator rather than the court. In each of these cases the court was asked to decide the issue of procedural compliance and no objection was made to having the issue resolved by the court. These cases stand for nothing more than the principle that a party failing to object to litigation concerning an arbitrable issue has waived his right to arbitration.

Ct. at 1353, where the Supreme Court, after explicating the benefits of arbitration in general and the special competence of the arbitrator in particular, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">\u201cThe Congress, however, has by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, assigned the courts the duty of determining whether the reluctant party has breached his promise to arbitrate. For arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit. Yet, to be consistent with congressional policy in favor of settlement of disputes by the parties through the machinery of arbitration, the judicial inquiry under \u00a7 301 must be strictly confined to the question whether the reluctant party did agree to arbitrate the grievance or did agree to give the arbitrator power to make the award he made. An order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute. Doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-9\"><em>Accord, e.g., </em>Peerless Pressed Metal Corp. v.
