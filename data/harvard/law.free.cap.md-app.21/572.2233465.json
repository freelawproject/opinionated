Moody was charged with the robbery and larceny of a watch. Appellant faced the identical charges in the same court because the juvenile court had waived jurisdiction over him on December 20, 1973, although the appellant\u2019s case before the Circuit Court had not come on for trial inasmuch as he had entered an appeal to this Court from the waiver order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">We have attached to this opinion Appendix A, which is part of the transcript of both the Moody trial and the appellant\u2019s subsequent contempt hearing. It would be superfluous to set forth in the text of this opinion the divers acts of the appellant that led to the contempt citation. Suffice it to say that the conduct of appellant, as reflected by Appendix A, leads to the inescapable conclusion that appellant so conducted himself as to demean the orderly administration of justice, depicted his contempt for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Circuit Court for Kent County, was rude, discourteous, disrespectful, disruptive, defiant and irascible even after being warned by Judge George B. Rasin that if appellant persisted he would be cited for contempt. The appellant did persist, was cited, adjudged guilty and sentenced to 179 days in the County Jail. Judge Rasin, at the outset of the contempt proceeding, stated that he thought an \u201cappropriate punishment\u201d to be \u201csome deprivation of . . . freedom, for some period of time that would be less than 6 months, which would not require a jury trial.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">In <em>Roll v. State, supra </em>at 48, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">\u201cAs direct contempts are those which occur in the presence of the court or so near to the court as to interrupt its proceedings, the judge is usually an observer of or has personal knowledge of the facts.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Augustine Birrell, <em>In the Name of Bodleian: Contempt of Court, </em>wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">\u201cAn ill-disposed person may exhibit contempt of court in divers ways \u2014 for example, he may scandalize the court itself, which may be done not merely by the extreme measure of hurling missiles at the presiding judge, or loudly contemning his learning or authority, but by ostentatiously reading a newspaper in his presence, or laughing uproariously at a joke made by someone else. Such contempts, committed as they are <em>in facie curiae, </em>are criminal offences, and may be punished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>summarily by immediate imprisonment without the right of appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It speaks well both for the great good sense of the judges and for the deep-rooted legal instincts of our people that such offences are seldom heard of. It would be impossible nicely to define what measure of freedom of manners should be allowed in a court of justice, which, as we know, is neither a church nor a theatre, but, as a matter of practice, the happy mean between an awe-struck and unmanly silence and free-and-easy conversation is well preserved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Without attempting to define the \u201cmeasure of freedom of manners . . . allowed in a court of justice\u201d, we think it indubitable that reasonable men would agree that appellant\u2019s conduct during the Moody trial was contemptuous, and that appellant carried such conduct forward into his own contempt hearing. Appellant\u2019s contention that his \u201cgestures were merely to get the attention of the Court so that he might testify; and his hostility was simply based upon an inner attitude toward a system which he felt was prejudicial\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> does not excuse him from patently disdainful conduct. We find no merit in appellant\u2019s assertion that \u201cthere is no factual support for the finding of contempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">An outcrop of appellant\u2019s contemptuous conduct poses an additional question of whether a juvenile who commits a direct contempt of a Circuit Court can be summarily adjudged in contempt or must be referred to a juvenile court for a waiver or delinquency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">By Laws 1969, Ch. 432, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the General Assembly set forth the legislative purpose of \u201cJuvenile Causes\u201d. Those purposes are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>\u201c(1) To provide for the care, protection, and wholesome mental and physical development of children coming within the provisions of this subtitle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">(2) To remove from children committing delinquent acts the taint of criminality and the consequences of criminal behavior, and to substitute therefor a program of treatment, training, and rehabilitation consistent with the protection of the public interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">(3) To place a child in a wholesome family environment whenever possible;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">(4) To separate a child from his parents only when necessary for his welfare or in the interest of public safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">(5) To provide judicial procedure for carrying out the provisions of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-11\">This subtitle shall be liberally construed to effectuate these purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">This Court in the case of <em>In re Hamill, </em>10 Md. App. 586, 271 A. 2d 762 (1970), in commenting upon the purpose of the Act said, at 590-91:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-13\">\u201c. . . [T]he Legislature intended no departure in philosophy from that underlying previous juvenile court enactments in Maryland, as interpreted by the Court of Appeals, <em>viz., </em>that juvenile proceedings are of a special nature designed to meet the problems peculiar to the adolescent <em>(In Re Fletcher, </em>251 Md. 520 [, 248 A. 2d 364 (1968)]); that the proceedings of a juvenile court are not criminal in nature and its dispositions are not punishments for crime <em>{In the Matter of Cromwell, </em>232 Md. 409 [, 194 A. 2d 88 (1963)]); that the juvenile law has as its underlying concept the protection of the juvenile, so that judges, in making dispositions in juvenile cases, think not in terms of guilt, but of the child\u2019s need for protection or rehabilitation <em>(In Re Johnson, </em>254 Md. 517 [, 255 A. 2d 419 (1969)]); that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>the juvenile act does not contemplate the punishment of children where they are found to be delinquent, but rather an attempt to correct and rehabilitate them in \u2018a wholesome family environment whenever possible,\u2019 although rehabilitation may have to be sought in some instances in an institution <em>(Moquin v. State, </em>216 Md. 524 [, 140 A. 2d 914 (1958)]).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\"><em>See also In re Arnold, </em>12 Md. App. 384, 278 A. 2d 658 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"A__A\">Courts Art. \u00a7 1-501 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">\u201c . . . Each [Circuit Court] has full common-law and equity powers and jurisdiction in all civil and criminal cases within its county, and all the additional powers and jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution and by law, except where by law jurisdiction has been limited or conferred exclusively upon another tribunal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">By \u00a7 3-804 of the Courts Art. it is further, in pertinent part, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">\u201c(a) The [juvenile] court has exclusive original jurisdiction over a child alleged to be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-11\">(1) Delinquent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-12\">(2) Dependent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-13\">(3) Neglected;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-14\">(4) In need of supervision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-15\">(5) Mentally handicapped.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-16\">In his argument to this Court, appellant contends that the above quoted provisions of the Courts Article and <em>Hamill, </em>demonstrate that juvenile courts have exclusive jurisdiction over persons under the age of 18 years who commit an act that would be a crime if committed by an adult, and, inasmuch as direct contempt, if committed by an adult would be a crime, the appellant, a juvenile, must be proceeded against in a juvenile court. We do not share that view.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Courts Art. \u00a7 1-202 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">\u201c(a) <em>Exercise of Power </em>\u2014 A court may exercise the power to punish for contempt of court or to compel compliance with its commands in the manner prescribed by the Maryland Rules or Maryland District Rules.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The Maryland Rule concerned with the procedure for punishment of direct contempt is P3 (a). That Rule states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">\u201ca. <em>Summary Punishment:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">A direct contempt may be punished summarily by the court against which the contempt was committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The fundamental reason why a court possesses the power to punish for contempt is not to protect the personage of the judge from real or imagined injury to his pride or dignity, but to assure the proper conduct of the orderly administration of justice over which the judge has been designated to preside. <em>Helmore v. Smith, </em>35 Ch. D. 449, 455 (1887). If we were to adopt appellant\u2019s point of view that Judge Rasin had no authority to dispose summarily of the <em>in facie curiae </em>contempt by a juvenile, we would erode the authority of the judge to conduct court proceedings in an orderly manner, strip a trial court of its right to deal with contemptuous, disruptive juvenile witnesses, render nugatory Md. Rule P3(a) in its application to juveniles and throw open wide the door to conduct creating chaotic courtroom conditions. We think the Legislature, in the adoption of the \u201cJuvenile Causes Act\u201d, never intended to deprive the courts of their authority to punish for direct contempt, those who commit such an act, be they juvenile or adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">We hold that Courts Art. \u00a7 3-804 a conferring exclusive original jurisdiction over a juvenile is inapplicable to a case of direct contempt committed in another court and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>court in which the contempt occurs possesses full power to deal with the contemptuous juvenile in the same manner as it would any adult person who had committed a similar offense. Apparently only four other jurisdictions having statutes conferring \"exclusive jurisdiction\u201d over juveniles upon the juvenile court, have been confronted with the question of whether a juvenile may be punished for direct contempt by the court in which the contempt is committed, <em>Bryant v. State, </em>256 Ind. 587, 271 N.E.2d 127 (1971), <em>In Re Williams, </em>306 F. Supp. 617 (D.D.C. 1969), <em>Application of Balucan, </em>44 Hawaii 271, 353 P. 2d 631 (1960), <em>Young v. Knight, </em>329 S.W.2d 195, 77 A.L.R.2d 994 (1959), and each has arrived at the same conclusion as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Although we have held herein that trial judges may summarily punish juveniles for direct contempt, they, however, should bear in mind, in meting out punishment, that they are dealing with a juvenile.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Lastly, the appellant contends that Judge Rasin should not have conducted the contempt proceeding inasmuch as he was the judge who was reviled by appellant. To support his argument appellant cites <em>Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, </em>400 U. S. 455, 91 S. Ct. 499, 27 L.Ed.2d 532 (1971), and attacks <em>State v. Roll, </em>267 Md. 714, 298 A. 2d 867 (1973). In <em>Mayberry, </em>at the end of a twenty-one day trial, the judge found Mayberry guilty of eleven criminal contempts and sentenced him to \u201cnot less than one nor more than two years for each of the 11 contempts or a total of 11 to 22 years.\u201d The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed in a split decision, 434 Pa. 478, 255 A. 2d 131 (1969). The Supreme Court of the United States granted <em>certiorari. </em>During the course of Mayberry\u2019s trial he hurled a series of opprobrious epithets at the trial judge including such remarks as, \u201cYou dirty sonofabitch\u201d; \u201cYou ought to be Gilbert and Sullivan the way you sustain the district attorney every time he objects to the questions\u201d; \u201c[You are a] dirty, tyranical old dog\u201d; \u201cI ask your Honor to keep your mouth shut while I\u2019m questioning my own witness\u201d; \u201cWhat are you working for? The prison authorities, you bum?\u201d; \u201cGo to hell. I don\u2019t give a good God damn what you suggest, you stumbling dog\u201d; \u201cYou started <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>all this bullshit\u201d; \u201cThis isn\u2019t the Spanish Inquisition\u201d and remarks of similar ilk all patently calculated to vilify and defile the trial judge. The Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Douglas said, at 462-63:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">\u201cThese brazen efforts to denounce, insult, and slander the court and to paralyze the trial are at war with the concept of justice under law. Laymen, foolishly trying to defend themselves, may understandably create awkward and embarrassing scenes. Yet that is not the character of the record revealed here. We have here downright insults of a trial judge, and tactics taken from street brawls and transported to the courtroom. This is conduct not \u2018befitting an American courtroom,\u2019 . . . and criminal contempt is one appropriate remedy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The Court further stated, at 466:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u201cInsults of that kind are apt to strike \u2018at the most vulnerable and human qualities of a judge\u2019s temperament.\u2019 <em>Bloom v. Illinois, </em>391 U. S. 194, 202.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The Court concluded that the facts in <em>Mayberry </em>required that the \u201cdefendant in criminal contempt proceedings should be given a public trial before a judge other than the one reviled by the contemnor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">We find <em>Mayberry </em>to be factually inapposite. There the contemnor was the accused conducting his own defense. Here the appellant was a \u201cself-subpoenaed\u201d witness in Moody\u2019s case. Moreover, the remarks made by appellant in the case now before us, while contemptuous, do not reach the high water mark of <em>Mayberry. Mayberry </em>does not hold that in all cases of contempt committed <em>in facie curiae </em>the trial judge is <em>ipso facto </em>disqualified from conducting the contempt proceeding. Both <em>Mayberry </em>and <em>Roll </em>suggest that if the judge waits until the end of the trial, however, before he proceeds against the contemnor it is the better practice to have a different judge conduct the contempt hearing. Criminal contempt proceedings before another judge are mandated, however, only in those extreme situations where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>the \u201cpersonal stings\u201d delivered by the contemnor are of such intensity, as in <em>Mayberry, supra, </em>as to cast a reasonable suspicion that the trial judge would conduct the contempt proceeding in a vindictive manner in order to sate his own personal grievance against the contemnor. Obviously each case must be judged by its own facts. Our perusal of the record in the instant case convinces us that Judge Rasin did not proceed against the appellant out of revenge, malice, or any other unworthy motive, nor do we perceive any reason why he should have disqualified himself. In fact, the record demonstrates that the judge not only conducted the contempt proceedings with dispatch, after the contempt had occurred, but exercised an admirable \u201cJobian\u201d restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">We find nothing in <em>State v. Roll, supra, </em>that is in conflict with <em>Mayberry. </em>In <em>Roll, supra, </em>Judge Digges said, at 733:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">\u201cAnd, while not required, when a judge waits until the end of the trial, it is generally wise to ask a fellow judge to rule on the nature of the conduct of the contemnor if it has in it elements of personal attack upon the judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-7\"><em>Mayberry </em>used substantially the same words. Mr. Justice Douglas stated, at 463-64:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">\u201cWhere, however, he [the trial judge] does not act the instant the contempt is committed, but waits until the end of the trial, on balance, it is generally wise where the marks of the unseemly conduct have left personal stings to ask a fellow judge to take his place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">\n<em>APPENDIX A.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">\u201c(Friday, March 29th, 1974 proceedings during Moody trial)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">(Judge [George B.] Rasin asked the Court to inquire of a man seated in the Court Room what his name was, as he had been making a disturbance in the Court Room while Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Mullins was testifying. Mr. Pinder stated the man said he would not give his name to anyone unless he was told whether he would be put on the witness stand or not. Judge Rasin then told the Jury we would be taking a recess at this time. Judge Rasin then asked if the Officer in the Court Room would take the man into custody for a moment. The jury went to their Jury Room.)</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Judge Rasin: Who is he?</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Deputy Metcalfe: Calvin Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Judge Rasin: That\u2019s Calvin Thomas?</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Deputy Metcalfe: Yes sir.

He\u2019s known as Chum Chum.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Judge Rasin: Now Mr. Thomas, you may remain in the Court Room and watch the proceedings, but you are not to hold your hands up, you are not to point to anyone, you are not to say anything to anybody. Otherwise we will have to remove you. Because I didn\u2019t know what all these gyrations were that you were going through, holding your hand up like that, and doing like that.

I have advised [appellant] of his right not to testify in this case, and to answer any questions that may tend to incriminate him, about any matters that may tend to incriminate him. But I would request that the Court further advise him.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-14\">Judge Rasin: Mr. Thomas, \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b603-15\">Mr. Thomas: Yes?</p>\n<p id=\"b603-16\">Judge Rasin: There are charges pending against you \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b603-17\">Mr. Thomas: I know it, Mr. Rasin.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-18\">Judge Rasin: Now wait a minute.

You don\u2019t have to answer any questions that could possibly get you into trouble later on for your own trials. Now you have a perfect right to answer if you want to, but you don\u2019t have to answer. Now you say you understand your rights? Is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Mr. Thomas: I dig it.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Judge Rasin: Now let me ask you this.

And if so, why?</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">A: I\u2019m not going to call the Judge no liar, but I don\u2019t remember stopping them.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Q: Was it your intent to disrupt this Court when you came here?</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">A: As I said before, it was my intent to try to help another brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">CROSS EXAMINATION BY MR.

I do remember.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-14\">Q: Do you remember looking to the jury and putting your second finger of your right hand underneath your nose, and then going straight up in the air like that, and then looking the jury right in the face?

Do you remember that?</p>\n<p id=\"b614-17\">A: I do remember, \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b614-18\">Q: Well, what type of procedure is that?</p>\n<p id=\"b614-19\">A: I do remember putting my hand under my nose, but I must be absent-minded to remember this.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Q: \u201cThis\u201d meaning abruptly pulling your hand up and over your nose and over your face?

Is there something you don\u2019t like about me?</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">A: I mean man \u2014 is there anything you don\u2019t like about me? Other than I\u2019m black?</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">Q: You are asking \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">A: Well ask me a question then. Repeat.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-16\">Q: I want you to answer my question.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-17\">A: I\u2019m going to answer. Repeat.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-18\">Q: My question is, what is it, since everybody has testified that you don\u2019t normally act this way \u2014 the Court has observed that you \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b615-19\">A: What is it I don\u2019t like about white people?</p>\n<p id=\"b615-20\">Q: What is it you don\u2019t like about us here in this Court Room?</p>\n<p id=\"b615-21\">A: Is that on black and white?

And I don\u2019t know, since I am not a medical doctor. I only wish to assure Calvin that the fact that he is black and I am white has absolutely nothing to do with these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">Calvin Thomas: It doesn\u2019t?</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">Judge Rasin: I would have held the same proceedings had he been an indian, red, or had he been an oriental, yellow \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b616-15\">Calvin Thomas: A white man?</p>\n<p id=\"b616-16\">Judge Rasin: Or had he been \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b616-17\">Calvin Thomas: No white man?</p>\n<p id=\"b616-18\">Judge Rasin: \u2014 a brown man, a Philippino, or had he been a white person. The color has nothing whatsoever to do with whether one misbehaves or doesn\u2019t misbehave in the Court Room. And until my hands are tied by some Appellate decisions, I intend to see that no one, regardless of race, creed, color, sex, or age acts as Calvin Thomas acted in this Court Room yesterday, and again today . . . .\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-14\">.
