Burch, Attorney General, Arthur A. Marshall, Jr., State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>and <em>John B. Wynes, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b255-9\">Moore, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AkE8\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">In a bench trial before the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County (Parker, J.) appellant, Lawrence Kennedy, then 17 years of age, was convicted of robbery with a deadly weapon and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and was sentenced to consecutive terms of ten and five years. His appeal raises no challenge to the merits of his conviction but is confined to the contentions that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">1) Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-2 (d) (3), containing the jurisdictional authorization for appellant\u2019s trial in the Circuit Court, is impermissibly and unconstitutionally vague; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-13\">2) the trial judge erred in refusing to consider the issue of waiver of jurisdiction to the juvenile court pursuant to Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 594A in the belief that appellant had waived this right by not filing a written petition prior to the issue being raised by defense counsel as a preliminary matter in open court on the day of trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-2 (d) (3), in effect at the time of appellant\u2019s indictment, provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">\u201c(d) <em>Exemptions. </em>\u2014 The [juvenile] court does not have jurisdiction over:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">(3) A proceeding involving a child who has reached his sixteenth birthday, alleged to have done an act in violation of \u00a7 488 of Article 27 concerning the crime of robbery with a deadly weapon, unless an order removing the proceeding to the juvenile court has been filed pursuant to \u00a7 594A of Article 27.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\u00a7 488 of Article 27 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">\u201cEvery person convicted of the crime of robbery or attempt to rob with a dangerous or deadly weapon or accessory thereto, shall restore to the owner thereof the thing robbed or taken, or shall pay him the full value thereof, and be sentenced to imprisonment in the Maryland Penitentiary for not more than twenty years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Appellant\u2019s precise contention before the trial court and on this appeal is that since Art. 27, \u00a7 488 does not create a crime itself but only provides a penalty for an existing common law crime, \u201cthere can be no violation of \u00a7 488\u201d (except a failure to restore the thing robbed or taken or to pay the victim the value thereof), and thus when Art. 26, \u00a7 70-2 (d) (3) rests jurisdiction in the juvenile court unless, <em>inter alia, </em>the child is alleged to have done an act in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 488, then Art. 26, \u00a7 70-2 (d)(3) \u201cis impermissibly vague and meaningless and does not accomplish its intended purpose of creating jurisdiction in the Circuit Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Despite its ingenuity, this argument is without merit. However infelicitously it was originally drawn, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-2 (d) (3) cannot reasonably be interpreted to refer to \u201cno violation\u201d nor indeed to any violation but one: the crime of robbery with a deadly weapon. Art. 27, \u00a7 488 admittedly does not create a crime but \u201cmerely provides a statutory penalty (and for the restoration of or payment for the thing taken) for the existing crime of robbery more severe when the robbery is committed with a dangerous or deadly weapon than when it is not.\u201d <em>Darby v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 407, 413 (1968). It is to be noted, on the other hand, that Art. 26, \u00a7 70-2 (d) (3) does not refer to \u201can act in violation of \u00a7 488 of Article 27 concerning <em>punishment for </em>the crime of robbery with a deadly weapon\u201d but to \u201can act in violation of \u00a7 488 ... concerning <em>the crime of robbery with a deadly weapon.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The unmistakable intent of \u00a7 70-2 (d) (3) is to exempt from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court (absent a waiver) cases alleging robbery of the aggravated sort for which \u00a7 488, at the same time, and from the same legislative motivation, prescribes an increased penalty. Art. 26, \u00a7 70-2 (d) (3) thus does not refer to a violation that Art. 27, \u00a7 488 has failed to create; rather, both are equally enactments \u201cconcerning the crime of robbery with a deadly weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation, that the intent of the legislature is to be sought in the first instance from the words used in the statute, and where there is no ambiguity or obscurity in the statute, the words used are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>conclusively presumed to embody the meaning of the legislature in enacting the statute,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> disposes of appellant\u2019s first contention. Only a contrived reading of Art. 26, \u00a7 70-2 (d) (3) would have it refer, as appellant argues, to an \u201cimpossible\u201d violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 488 instead of to the crime of robbery with a deadly weapon that the legislature clearly had in mind in enacting \u00a7 488. The courts will not, indeed, as appellant points out, \u201cpunish for a violation which does not come within the plain language of the ordinance or statute alleged to have been transgressed,\u201d <em>Groh v. County Commissioners, </em>245 Md. 441 (1967), but the language of Art. 26, \u00a7 70-2 (d) (3), for constitutional purposes, fairly and clearly identifies a criminal charge which, subject to Art. 27, \u00a7 594A, wrests the juvenile court of its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that the trial court erred in refusing to consider the issue of waiver of jurisdiction to the juvenile court absent a written pretrial motion. Art. 27, \u00a7 594A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">\u201cIn any case involving a child who has reached his fourteenth (14th) birthday but has not reached his eighteenth (18th) birthday at the time of any alleged offense excluded under the provisions of \u00a7 70-2 (d) (1) or (3) of Article 26, <em>the court exercising jurisdiction may transfer the case to the juvenile court if a waiver is believed to be in the interests of the child and/or society. </em>\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Unlike Art. 26, \u00a7 70-16, providing for waiver of jurisdiction to the criminal court after a petition has been filed alleging delinquency,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Art. 27, \u00a7 594A does not specifically provide for a waiver hearing nor enumerate \u201cfactors to be considered\u201d by the court in determining if waiver is indicated. Nor is there any Rule specifically applicable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>waiver of jurisdiction by the Circuit Court comparable to Rule 911 pertaining to waiver of jurisdiction by the Juvenile Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In the instant case appellant filed a pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of jurisdiction of the Circuit Court based on the alleged infirmity in Art. 26, \u00a7 70-2 (d) (3) discussed in I, <em>supra. </em>His motion did not request, in the alternative, waiver of the case to the juvenile court pursuant to Art. 27, \u00a7 594A; nor was it set for hearing prior to the trial date on May 22, 1973, although it had been filed on January 3, 1973. After the case was called on the day of trial, appellant moved to exclude the witnesses and waived a jury trial. Defense counsel then invited the court\u2019s attention to the pending motion to dismiss. The court heard argument and denied the motion. At that juncture, co-counsel for appellant asked to \u201caddress the Court on another matter which is adjunct to this, but is specifically not on the same point,\u201d and requested an order waiving appellant to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under \u00a7 594A. The State 'responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">\u201cThere has long been a procedure established . . . defendants have come in where they deem it appropriate and move the Court \u2014 file petitions, motion for appropriate relief to waive the matter back to the Juvenile Court. I think the same procedure was available in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The court agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">\u201cIt\u2019s been my experience, Mr. Brennan, that you can come in a case of this nature with a written petition prior to trial and have it set up for a special hearing. <em>But if you don\u2019t do it, then you waive it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">MR. BRENNAN: Our point, of course, as I indicated before, this statute does not \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">THE COURT: I understand your argument on it. I think a higher court would have to decide it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\">MR. BRENNAN: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-12\">THE COURT: <em>I think I am bound by the language of the statute.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>MR. BRENNAN: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">We are ready for trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The court\u2019s reference to the language of the statute was, we find, erroneous. The statute, previously quoted (p. 1) in its entirety, contains no waiver provisions nor is there any other statutory provision nor rule of procedure with respect to waiver,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> upon which the court could have placed reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">We agree with the position of appellant. that the clear intendment of Section 594A is that there be a judicial hearing on the question of waiver <em>to </em>the juvenile court and a weighing of factors similar to those prescribed in Article 26, \u00a7 70-16<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for consideration of waiver of jurisdiction <em>from </em>the juvenile court, including the nature of the offense, the child\u2019s, age and. mental and physical condition and the safety of the public. However, we reject out of hand appellant\u2019s contention below \u2014 predicated on Maryland Rule 911 \u2014 that such a waiver hearing should be initiated by the State\u2019s Attorney. The State is eminently correct that the onus is upon the accused. It is the latter\u2019s obligation, in the absence of any rule providing another procedure, to file a motion before trial pursuant to Rule 725 c and the matter should be determined before trial, as provided in Rule 725 d.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">We are not compelled to the conclusion, on the other hand, that appellant by-the tardiness of his application or his failure to present it in writing \u201cwaived\u201d the right given him by Art. 27, \u00a7 594A to request a determination of waiver <em>vel non </em>of jurisdiction to the juvenile court, nor do we think in the circumstances of this case that justice would best be served by so holding. Counsel for appellant may in. good faith have feared that to invoke by pretrial motion the qualifying clause of Art. 26, \u00a7 70-2 (d) (3) (\u201cunless an order removing the.proceeding to the juvenile court has been filed pursuant to \u00a7 594A of Article 27\u201d) would prejudice his attack upon the constitutionality of \u00a7 70-2 (d) (3). Art. 27, \u00a7 594A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>was enacted as part of Chapter 432 (Acts, 1969) substantially revising the subtitle Juvenile Causes. Courts Art. \u00a7 3-802 (6)(b) states that the subtitle shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">We conclude that the lower court erred in ruling that appellant had waived his right to a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 594A and that the proceeding should be remanded to the lower court, without affirmance or reversal, in order that a waiver hearing may be held by the trial court to determine, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>whether a waiver to the juvenile court was \u201cin the interests of the child and/or society.\u201d Prior to such hearing, the court may request that a study be made concerning appellant, his family, environment and other matters relevant to the disposition of the case. <em>(Cf. </em>Art. 26, \u00a7 70-16 (e), Courts Art. \u00a7 3-816 (d)). If upon remand it is determined by the trial court that waiver down to the juvenile court was not in the interest of appellant and/or society, the judgment of conviction shall stand, since there has been no appeal on the merits. On the other hand, if it is determined that the facts called for a waiver to the juvenile court, then the proceedings below shall have been <em>ab initio </em>a nullity and the trial court shall order the case to be transferred to the juvenile court. Compare <em>Franklin v. State, </em>264 Md. 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\n<em>Case remanded without affirmance or reversal for further proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-10\">.
