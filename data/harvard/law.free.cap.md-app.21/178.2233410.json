Nationwide had issued a policy to the father of the second permittee and the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>was covered by a so-called JR-11 endorsement to her father\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a carefully considered written opinion, the trial judge held that Maryland Indemnity was the primary insurer. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The so-called \u201comnibus clause,\u201d required by statute in a number of states,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is in addition to the general insuring clause and extends the protection of the automobile liability insurance policy to any person using the insured vehicle provided the use (or \u201cactual use\u201d) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is by the named insured or with his permission or consent. The clause, irrespective of language variations, clothes the named insured with broad authority to constitute other persons as \u201cadditional insureds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The Maryland Indemnity omnibus clause at issue in this case contains fairly standard provisions and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">\u201cDefinition of Insured, (a) With respect to the insurance for bodily injury liability and for property damage liability the unqualified word \u2018insured\u2019 includes the named insured and, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>named insured is an individual, his spouse if a resident of the same household, <em>and also includes any person while using the automobile </em>and any person or organization legally responsible for the use thereof, <em>provided the actual use of the automobile is by the named insured or such spouse or with the permission of either. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">With respect to the \u201csimple words, perhaps too simple, \u2018actual use . . . with the permission of,\u2019 \u201d the Court of Appeals has at least twice recorded its agreement with the observation of a dissenting judge in a 1960 New Jersey case <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that these words</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">\u201c. . . have engendered probably as much reported litigation as any common contractual phrase. The absence of any express definition of the key words, either legislatively or within the instrument, coupled with the infinite variety of factual situations arising, has resulted in the widest conceivable range of judicial approach, reasoning and result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Appellant\u2019s principal contention is that the trial court erred in determining that at the time of the accident in question the \u201cactual use\u201d of the automobile was by the named insured (William T. Kornke, Sr.) or with his permission, or, as alternatively stated, the court erred in its determination that Kornke, Sr. \u201chad, in fact, given to his son permission to operate the vehicle for the use as established by the facts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The facts are uncomplicated and substantially undisputed. They present the familiar picture of an 18 year old high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>school student, William T. Kornke, Jr., living at home with his parents in Baltimore County in June, 1968. He enjoyed permission to drive his father\u2019s car, a 1960 Chevrolet hardtop, for purposes of going to \u201cschool and work, mostly,\u201d and for those purposes drove the car \u201calmost every day.\u201d On these occasions he was not required to ask his father\u2019s permission to drive the car but rather \u201cit was agreed that it was my responsibility.\u201d When, however, he wanted to use the car for a date or other social purpose the case was somewhat different; then \u201cI always had to tell him that I was going out.\u201d This was, in effect, asking permission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">\u201c. . . I like asked that permission when I said, I am going out; that was like asking can I have the car also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">Q. Your father knew what you meant by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">A. Yes. ... If he didn\u2019t want me to use it, he would say, well, don\u2019t take the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">At the same time, William was under explicit instructions not to allow anyone else to drive the father\u2019s car. When he had first obtained his license his father had \u201cmade it clear like it was a law, a rule.\u201d Thereafter, \u201calong the way, ever so often he would mention that, you know, never let anybody drive your car,\u201d meaning in the present context, the father\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">On the evening of June 22, 1968 William had invited friends, about 15 people, home for crabs and beer. At about midnight the group decided to ride out to Billingslee Farm in Harford County and \u201cbuild a campfire near the river and sit around.\u201d William told his father that he was going out and the group set out in two other cars and the Kornke Chevrolet which had four occupants including William\u2019s date, Sue Peters, and her close friend, Lynanne Hampshire.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With William driving his father\u2019s car they drove north. When they were about equidistant between their destination and the Kornke home the car began to misfire. William had had similar trouble before with the car and each time would stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>and fix it, which involved essentially reattaching wires that had come loose from the top of the distributor. While attempting to replace one wire, however, he inadvertently touched the uninsulated portion of another and received an electric shock. He explained the effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">\u201cA. Well, I wasn\u2019t wearing any shoes and I was grounded right against the pavement and it knocked me back, knocked me from under the car. . . . the engine was running ... it knocked me back and numbed me pretty well, numbed my right hand and arm, and I decided ... let me see ... I was tired, also, because I was working quite a bit the past two weeks before that, and I just \u2014 my right arm and hand, I just couldn\u2019t move them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Since \u201cit was kind of taken for granted that we were headed out there, out still further, and we had a ways to go, we were only halfway there,\u201d the question arose as to who would drive. William was \u201clike ushered into the front seat.\u201d He did not ask anyone else to drive but \u201cjust mentioned that my arm was sore and I probably couldn\u2019t drive. ... It wouldn\u2019t be safe.\u201d He conceded that if no one had volunteered to drive, \u201c[w]e could have just sat there until my arm got okay and then taken off again.\u201d Lynanne Hampshire offered to drive, however, and when evidently there was no objection, she took over the wheel. For William\u2019s part, \u201cas soon as I was in the seat and my head was down ... it was no time before my eyes were closed and I was asleep.\u201d He was still asleep when the car struck a bridge abutment while Lynanne was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Upon these facts the trial court could readily conclude that 1) William Kornke, Jr. received permission from his father on the evening of June 22 to use the father\u2019s car for a social purpose; and 2) Kornke, Jr., in turn, consented to the operation of the car by Lynanne Hampshire for the continuation of the trip to the Billingslee Farm when, in his opinion, he became temporarily unable to drive. The question for decision, therefore, is whether in these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>circumstances the use of the car continued, until the time of the accident, with the permission of Kornke, Sr., and the effect of the express prohibition, repeatedly communicated by father to son, against allowing anyone else to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In 1965, then U. S. District Judge Harrison L. Winter observed that \u201cthere is no direct decision of the Maryland Court of Appeals deciding whether, or under what circumstances, a second permittee becomes an insured under an omnibus clause. . . .\u201d <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co. v. Pennsylvania Nat. Mut. Cas. Ins. Co., </em>238 F. Supp. 706 (D.C.D. Md. 1965), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>352 F. 2d 308 (4th Cir. 1965).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This remains true today. A review of applicable Maryland cases, however, points the way to the proper resolution of the issue upon the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Immediate guidance, in terms of the meaning of \u201cactual use\u201d as employed in the omnibus clause, is presented in the cases of <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty v. Mitnick, </em>180 Md. 604, 26 A. 2d 393 (1942) and <em>Melvin v. American Automobile Insurance Company, </em>232 Md. 476, 194 A. 2d 269 (1963), neither of which, however, involved the question of coverage <em>vel non </em>of a second permittee. <em>Mitnick </em>involved essentially the same omnibus clause as in this case. The named insured owner kept the car for the use of his granddaughter and her mother and the granddaughter regularly kept the key and did all the driving. At issue in the case was whether coverage under the omnibus clause extended to the granddaughter (first permittee) in circumstances where the accident occurred while she was a passenger in the car as it was being driven by another person with her permission. There was no evidence that the owner \u201cknew of Harrison\u2019s (second permittee) driving the car, or had consented to it; on the contrary, the only testimony on the point was that he had instructed his granddaughter to let nobody but herself drive it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>The violation of this prohibition, however, was apparently not urged by the insurer as grounds for the denial of coverage. Instead it limited its defense to the contention that permitted \u201cuse\u201d under the omnibus clause referred solely to the act of driving the car and not to taking it out while it was being driven by another. Chief Judge Bond, writing for the Court, rejected this contention, holding that using includes riding while another drives:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">\u201cBut using a car in the ordinary acceptation of the words seems clearly to include a borrower\u2019s making use of it by riding while driven by another. Mrs. Phillips [the granddaughter] was \u2018still the director of the enterprise, still the custodian of the instrumentality confided to [her] keeping, still the master of the ship.\u2019 <em>Grant v. Knepper, </em>245 N. Y. 158, 165, 156 N. E. 650, 652, 54 A.L.R. 845; <em>Arcara v. Moresse, </em>258 N. Y. 211, 179 N. E. 389; <em>Johnson v. O\u2019Lalor, </em>279 Mass. 10, 180 N. E. 525. And <em>see Appleman Automobile Liability Insurance, </em>1938 Ed., p. 107 and cases cited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">In <em>Melvin v. American Automobile Insurance Company, supra, </em>it was also argued by an insurer that the actual use of the car was by the driver and not the passenger, the owner\u2019s son, who had become tired and asked his friend to drive. The Court of Appeals (Judge Henderson, later Chief Judge, speaking for the Court) again rejected this contention, holding that the \u201cactual use\u201d at the time of the accident was by and for the benefit of the son:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">\u201cWe see no reason to limit the meaning of the words \u2018actual use\u2019 to the operation of a vehicle, where the operator is the agent or servant of another and subject to this immediate and present direction and control. There appears to be no case that has construed the words in the context of this policy, but there are cases in which the word \u2018use\u2019 has been so construed. In <em>Casualty Co. v. Mitnick, </em>180 Md. 604, 607, Chief Judge Bond, for this Court, said that \u2018using a car in the ordinary acceptation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the words seems clearly to include a borrower\u2019s making use of it by riding while driven by another.\u2019 <em>See also Arcara v. Moresse, </em>258 N. Y. 211; 179 N. E. 389; <em>Brown v. Kennedy, </em>48 N.E.2d 857 (Ohio); <em>Maryland Casualty Company v. Marshbank, </em>226 F. 2d 637, 639 (C.A.3d); <em>Osborne v. Security Insurance Company, </em>318 P. 2d 94, 99 (Cal. App.) and <em>Indemnity Ins. Co. v. Metropolitan Cas. Ins. Co. of N. Y., </em>166 A. 2d 355 (N.J.). These cases also indicate that \u2018actual use\u2019 means the particular use contemplated when permission is granted and relied on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">In <em>Melvin </em>the omnibus clause differed from that in <em>Mitnick </em>(and in the instant case) in extending coverage in the first instance to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">\u201c. . . (1) the named insured and any resident of the same household. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">Thus, the son \u201cwas covered as a resident of his father\u2019s household, and did not need to rely upon the permission granted\u201d for his authority to permit another to drive. This distinguished the case, the Court found, from those relied on by the insurer (citing 7 Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 4354) in which the policies granted coverage only to persons using the vehicle with the permission of the named insured and where \u201ccoverage depends . . . upon the scope of the permission granted.\u201d In <em>Melvin, </em>the Court said \u201cthe test is use rather than permission,\u201d and quoted with approval Appleman\u2019s definition of actual use\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">\u201cThe term \u2018actual use\u2019 refers to the actual employment of the vehicle at the time of the accident, <em>rather than to the identity of the operator at such time. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">The Court commented: \u201cThus, so far as the meaning of the words is concerned, the author would seem to agree that use and operation are not synonymous.\u201d 232 Md. at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">After <em>Melvin </em>in 1963, in a procession of cases before the Court of Appeals involving the omnibus clause, three of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>them in 1969, the results turned upon the Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpermission\u201d rather than \u201cuse.\u201d <em>Zurich Co. v. Monarch Co., </em>247 Md. 3, <em>supra; American Home Assurance Co. v. Erie Insurance Exchange, et al., </em>252 Md. 116, 248 A. 2d 887 (1969); <em>Cohen, Adm\u2019r v. American Home Assurance Co., </em>255 Md. 334, 258 A. 2d 225 (1969); <em>Goodwin v. Home Indemnity Co., </em>255 Md. 364, 258 A. 2d 220 (1969); <em>Unsat. C. &amp; J. Fund v. U. S. F. &amp; G. Company, </em>256 Md. 412, 260 A. 2d 279 (1970); <em>Keystone Insurance Company v. The Fidelity &amp; Casualty Company of New York, </em>256 Md. 423, 260 A. 2d 275 (1970).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">In <em>Erie Insurance Exchange, supra, </em>the Court quoted extensively from 7 Am. Jur. <em>2d Automobile Insurance, </em>\u00a7 119, \u201cScope of permission; deviation from permitted use\u201d wherein It is pointed out that, to determine whether the coverage of the omnibus clause applies to a given accident, it is first necessary to resolve two preliminary questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">1) Was the permission or consent of the named insured granted to the operator; and if so,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">2) was the vehicle being used at the time of the accident within the scope of the permission granted?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">With respect to the second question, the treatise points out, it may be necessary to determine the effect of deviations from the permitted use. Such deviations may result from:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-10\">a) the use of the vehicle for other purposes,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-11\">b) <em>the extention of the permission by its delegation to third persons, </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-13\">c) the use of the vehicle in violation of express instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-15\">Finally, the Courts are divided sharply as to the legal theory applicable in determining when a deviation will preclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>coverage under the omnibus clause. Three different rules have been adopted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">1) the strict or conversion rule, whereby any deviation, no matter how slight, will preclude coverage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">2) the liberal rule whereby it is held that once permission is given, it will extend to any and all uses of the vehicle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">3) the moderate or \u201cminor deviation\u201d rule under which the Courts hold that a slight deviation does not preclude coverage under the omnibus clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">In the <em>Erie </em>case, the language of the policy, \u201c. . . provided his [any other person using such automobile with the permission of the named insured] <em>actual operation </em>... is within the scope of such permission . . .,\u201d (emphasis added) was held to be \u201csufficiently explicit\u201d to preclude application of the liberal rule and, on the facts of the case, it was unnecessary to decide whether Maryland adheres to the strict or moderate rule. The sole question at issue \u2014 whether the driver was acting within the scope of the permission <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u2014 was answered negatively since the accident occurred some 2V2 hours after the driver had borrowed the car and it was headed in an altogether different direction than was represented to the owner. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\"><em>Cohen, Adm\u2019r, supra, </em>concerned an omnibus clause identical to that in the instant case and called for a decision as to its applicability to a son, Josephus, who borrowed the keys to his mother\u2019s car with the express understanding that a friend, Scott, and not Josephus, would do the driving. At the time of the accident, Josephus was behind the wheel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>there was no evidence to indicate that Scott was even in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Cohen </em>again found it unnecessary to decide \u201cwhether we follow the strict or conversion rule or the moderate or \u2018minor deviation\u2019 rule.\u201d To determine whether the use comes within the purview of the omnibus clause, it was held, requires an examination of \u201cthe total facts.\u201d Such examination compelled the conclusion that the use made by Josephus \u201cwas not within the scope of the permission granted and was not the particular use contemplated when the permission was granted.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Melvin </em>and <em>Mitnick, supra, </em>were distinguished on their facts. With respect to the latter, Judge Smith wrote (255 Md. at 348):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">\u201cIn <em>Mitnick, supra, </em>there was a general grant of use of the automobile. It was kept for the complete use of the granddaughter. It is true that she violated the instructions given to her by her grandfather when he told her that no one else was to operate the car, <em>but the car was generally available for her use and convenience and was being so used at the time of the accident. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The Court also distingushed <em>Melvin </em>factually and again its language is worth noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">\u201cIn <em>Melvin . . . </em>coverage was based on the fact that the car was really being used at the time by a member of the household who, therefore, was a named insured, a member of the household <em>who for his own convenience at the moment while using the car requested someone else to operate. </em>\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Adopting the language of <em>Melvin, </em>the Court in <em>Cohen </em>ruled that in a case where coverage is extended by the policy only to persons using the vehicle with the permission of the named insured (or other designated person) \u201ccoverage depends in that situation upon the scope of the permission granted,\u201d and that the term \u201cactual use\u201d in an omnibus clause means \u201cthe particular use contemplated when permission is granted and relied on.\u201d In <em>Goodwin v. The Home Indemnity Company, supra, </em>(decided the same day as <em>Cohen), </em>the Court, after restating the above interpretations of \u201cscope\u201d and \u201cactual use,\u201d found that the permission granted there to the operator \u201cwas to pick up the truck Saturday morning for the specific purpose of repair, not a Friday night (or early Saturday morning) escapade\u201d (as had ensued), and it held that on those facts coverage did not include the operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Two 1969 cases decided by the United States District Court for the District of Maryland are here pertinent, particularly in the light of the prediction, contained in each, that in Maryland the \u201cminor deviation\u201d rule would be held applicable. In <em>Mt. Beacon Insurance Company v. Williams, </em>296 F. Supp. 1094 (D.C.D. Md. 1969) the District Court had before it an omnibus clause similar to the one in the instant case. In deciding that of the three rules bearing on permissive use the Maryland Court of Appeals would adopt the so-called \u201cminor deviation\u201d rule in construing the policy in question, the Court (Thomsen, J.) referred to <em>Melvin </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">\u201cThe Maryland Court\u2019s discussion in the <em>Melvin </em>case indicates that such factors as the \u2018scope\u2019 of permission granted and the \u2018deviation\u2019 from that permission might be relevant in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>whether \u2018actual use\u2019 was \u2018with the permission of the named insured\u2019. Both of these factors would be relevant only if the \u2018minor deviation\u2019 rule were applicable in Maryland.\u201d At 1096.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The Court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">\u201cThe minor deviation rule must be applied to the facts of the particular case. . . . The facts of the present case are that Mrs. Bright [wife of insured] gave Williams permission to use the car only to drive her to the hospital and wait there to take her home. At the time of the accident, <em>Williams was operating the car for a purpose entirely foreign to the permission granted, and at a place and time far beyond what was reasonable to expect of one attempting to find a parking place around the Union Memorial Hospital. </em>The actual use by Williams was not a minor deviation from the \u2018particular use contemplated when permission [was] granted and relied on.\u2019 \u201d At 1100. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">And in <em>Travelers Corporation v. Kaminski, </em>304 F. Supp. 481 (D.C.D. Md. 1969), involving construction of a similar omnibus clause, the District Court (Kaufman, J.) agreed with the prediction in <em>Mt. Beacon </em>that \u201cMaryland, when faced with the issue [of a deviation from the permission granted], will adopt the \u2018minor deviation\u2019 rule.\u201d At 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">From our review of Court of Appeals decisions dealing with the construction of omnibus clauses and with appropriate deference to United States District Court decisions making \u201cinformed predictions\u201d as to future Maryland appellate rulings, we conclude that in Maryland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">1) Where coverage is extended by the omnibus clause only to persons using the vehicle with the permission of the named insured (or other designated person) coverage depends upon the scope of the permission granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-11\">2) In determining whether the scope of permission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>has been exceeded, Maryland has not expressly adopted the strict rule, the liberal rule, or the minor deviation rule. However, <em>Melvin </em>supports by implication the minor deviation rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\">3) \u201cActual use\u201d with the permission of the named insured is \u201cthe particular use contemplated when permission is granted and relied on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">4) Such use and the operation of the car at the time of accident are not \u201csynonymous,\u201d for using a car by a borrower includes riding in it while another drives, at least where the former remains \u201cthe custodian of the instrumentality confided to his keeping,\u201d or the latter \u201cis the agent or servant of another and subject to his immediate and present direction and control.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">5) There is no case in Maryland squarely addressing the issue of whether a restriction upon the operation of the car, <em>i.e., </em>a prohibition against permitting a third person to drive it, is <em>not </em>a factor in determining whether the operation of the car is in accordance with the particular use contemplated when permission was granted and relied on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\">6) Nevertheless, the thrust of Maryland decisions is that in determining whether the operation is within the permission required by the omnibus clause \u201cone must examine the total facts,\u201d and the facts of paramount significance respecting a clause for permitted use (as against permitted operation) do not pertain to the identity of the driver but to whether at the time of the accident the operation of the car was for a <em>purpose </em>germane to the permission granted, whether it was for the <em>convenience </em>of the named insured or the first permittee, and whether the latter was <em>present </em>in the car at the time of the accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">This latter construction of permitted use under an omnibus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>clause is in accord with the large majority of cases cited by the Court of Appeals in <em>Mitnick </em>and <em>Melvin, supra, </em>in support of the rule that \u201cuse\u201d and \u201coperation\u201d of the car are \u201cnot synonymous.\u201d Moreover it is in accord with the majority of cases in general deciding the issue of permitted use. As stated in 7 Am. Jur. 2d \u00a7 117:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">\u201cThe \u2018general rule\u2019 that a permittee may not allow a third party to \u2018use\u2019 the named insured\u2019s car has generally been held not to preclude recovery under the omnibus clause where (1) <em>the original permittee is riding in the car with the second permittee at the time of the accident, </em>or (2) <em>the second permittee, in using the vehicle, is serving some purpose of the original permittee. </em>The courts generally reason that under such circumstances the second permittee is \u2018operating\u2019 the car for the \u2018use\u2019 of the first permittee and that such \u2018use\u2019 is within the coverage of the omnibus clause. While some courts apparently would limit this qualification of the general rule to situations where the named insured has not specifically forbidden driving by a third person, <em>it is more generally held that operation by a third person under such circumstances falls within the protection of the omnibus clause even where such operation is specifically forbidden by the named </em>insured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">We conclude, therefore, as did the learned trial judge, that the total facts in this case support a finding that William, Jr. was still \u201cusing\u201d his father\u2019s car, even though Lynanne Hampshire was driving the car at the time of the accident, and that the \u201cactual use\u201d was with the permission of William, Sr. Certainly, at the time of the accident, the operation of the car by the second permittee was for a purpose germane to the permission granted by father to son; it was, at the very least, for the convenience of the first permittee (if not, indeed, a matter of necessity in the light of the son\u2019s testimony), and, of course, the first permittee was present in the car at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Does the fact that the father here had prohibited the operation of his vehicle by any person other than his son, preclude the extension to Lynanne of the coverage of Maryland Indemnity\u2019s omnibus clause? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\"><em>Indemnity Ins. Co. v. Metropolitan Cas. Ins. Co., </em>166 A. 2d 355 (N.J. 1960), <em>supra, </em>directly posed the question whether a prohibition as to operation was \u201cmaterial\u201d to a determination of permitted use of the car. The Supreme Court of New Jersey said it was not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">\u201cThe clause says nothing about operation of the vehicle. It is the use which must be permitted. . . . [I]n this context the words <em>use </em>and <em>operation </em>are not synonymous. The use of an automobile denotes its employment for some purpose of the user; the word <em>\u2018operation\u2019 </em>denotes the manipulation of the car\u2019s controls in order to propel it as a vehicle. <em>Use </em>is thus broader than <em>operation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\"><em>\u201cSince in this context the words operation and use have different meanings and the omnibus clause requires only that the use of the automobile be with the permission of the named insured, any prohibition as to the operation of the automobile is immaterial to a determination of coverage. </em>Thus, even though a driver has been expressly prohibited from operating the car, he is covered if the car was being used for a purpose permitted by the named insured.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">The Supreme Court of Delaware, in a similar case in which the second permittee had operated the car in violation of the named insured\u2019s prohibition, reached a similar result where a daughter borrowed her father\u2019s car to go to the beach and the father had admonished her not to let anyone else drive. Returning home, she asked her boyfriend to drive. He did and the inevitable accident occurred. The Delaware Court agreed with the New Jersey Court that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-10\">\u201cthe word \u2018use\u2019 and the word \u2018operation\u2019 in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>context are not synonymous. <em>The use of the vehicle concerned is the purpose for which its use is permitted. </em>As <em>long as that use has been permitted, it is immaterial how the vehicle is operated. </em>The insured having given his permission for a particular use, may not be heard to complain, nor may his insurance carrier be heard to complain that the operation of the vehicle in <em>performance of the use or purpose </em>has been conducted in a way which the insured not only did not contemplate but actually forbade.\u201d <em>Allstate Insurance Company v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>273 A. 2d 261 (Del. 1970). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\"><em>Arcara v. Moresse, </em>179 N. E. 389 (N.Y. 1932), cited by the Court of Appeals in both <em>Mitnick </em>and <em>Melvin, supra, </em>drew an equally sharp distinction between use and operation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201cAn owner in loaning his car may reasonably restrict the uses to which it may be put; consequently its employment for a proscribed purpose cannot be a permitted use. On the other hand, if the limiting instructions relate to the manner of operation, such as the speeding or careless pilotage of the car, though the instructions be disobeyed, nevertheless the use is with \u2018permission\u2019 of the owner. Maggio [first permittee] was not instructed that Barone [second permittee] should not be accepted as a guest; he was merely told that Barone must not drive. <em>The thing forbidden related to the operation of the car, not to the use which might be made of it. </em>We conclude that Maggio was \u2018using\u2019 the car with the \u2018permission\u2019 of the owner. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Of course, the rule that restrictions on the identity of the driver are of inferior significance in determining the scope of permitted use has not received universal acceptance. Thus in <em>Farmer v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Company of New York, </em>249 F. 2d 185 (4th Cir. 1957), the Circuit Court of Appeals, applying North Carolina law, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u201cWe know of no case, however, that goes to the extent of allowing an inference of permission in defiance of uncontradicted testimony, accepted in the District Court, that permission was not only withheld but that lending was specifically forbidden.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The factual situation in <em>Farmer </em>is not without significance, however. As recounted by the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201cDespite the strict prohibition which, according to the uncontradicted evidence, the father had imposed [on letting anyone else drive], Walter [first permittee] and his cousin James [second permittee] exchanged . automobiles. James proceeded, for an undisclosed purpose, to Danville, Virginia. . . . Whatever the explanation for this exchange, it had nothing to do with any purpose of Moses Jeffreys [the father], who was unaware of the event until later. . . . Walter was not then in the car, and the mission in which James was engaged was not one for Walter.\u201d At 187.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-7\"><em>See also Prisuda v. General Casualty Co. of America, </em>74 N.W.2d 777 (1956) upon which appellant relies but which we find unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">We think, all told, that a distinction is validly made between situations where the law denies coverage under the omnibus clause because the named insured expressly prohibited the use of the automobile by any person other than his permittee and a second permittee has used the car solely for his own benefit, <em>see also Western Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Grice, </em>422 F. 2d 921 (10th Cir. 1970); <em>Royal Indemnity Co. v. Clingan, </em>238 F. Supp. 448 (E.D. Tenn. 1965), modified on other grounds, 364 F. 2d 154 (6th Cir. 1966); 7 Appleman, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4361; Anno. 4 A.L.R.2d 10, 40, 61; and, on the contrary, where the law permits coverage because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-11\">a) the original permittee was riding in the car with the second permittee at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>accident, <em>see also Standard Accident Casualty Co. v. New Amsterdam Casualty Co., </em>249 F. 2d 847 (7th Cir. 1957); <em>Protective Fire and Casualty Co. v. Cornelius, </em>125 N.W.2d 179 (Neb. 1963); <em>Brooks v. Delta Fire and Casualty Co., </em>82 So. 2d 55 (La. App. 1955); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsT\">b) because the second permittee was serving some purpose or advantage of the first permittee when the accident occurred. <em>See also National Farmers Union Property &amp; Casualty Co. v. Lukins, </em>329 F. 2d 564 (8th Cir. 1964); <em>National Farmers Union Property </em>&amp; <em>Casualty Co. v. State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co., </em>277 F. Supp. 542 (D.C.D. Mont. 1967); <em>Loffler v. Boston Insurance Co., </em>120 A. 2d 691 (D.C. Mun. Ct. 1956).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Without being required to choose between the \u201cliberal rule\u201d and the moderate or \u201cminor deviation\u201d rule, <em>supra, </em>we hold that as both of the above tests were satisfied in the instant case, then upon either rule the Kornke automobile was being used within the scope of the permission granted by the named insured when the accident occurred, and that, therefore, Lynanne Hampshire was an insured under the omnibus clause of the Maryland Indemnity policy issued to Kornke, Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellant to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-12\">.
