Ann. Code Art. 53, \u00a7 45 (limitation on rental fee increases) to lots of land rented for mobile home and trailer use. The matter arose by way of a suit for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief brought by the appellee, Donald Fitzgerald, in his own behalf and \u201call other tenants of The Baysinger Trailer Park similarly situated,\u201d against Malcolm I. Glazer, appellant, following Fitzgerald\u2019s receipt of a notice, in March of 1973,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of an increase in rental in excess of the 5% limitation imposed by the legislature in Md. Ann. Code Art. 53, \u00a7 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">Judge Richard M. Pollitt, in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, declared the limitation on rental increases to be applicable to the rental of mobile home lots and held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>appellant, Glazer, was not entitled to increase rental charges beyond the level authorized by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Obviously, in order to answer the question posed to us we must determine the legislative intent in enacting the rental increase limitation law. Bearing in mind the caveats that, \u201cLaws are formed by the manners and exigencies of particular times. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u201c[t]he Legislature has the power to decide what the policy of the law shall be, and if it has intimated its will, however indirectly, that will should be recognized and obeyed,\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>163 F. 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1908); <em>Demory Brothers, Inc. v. Board of Public Works, </em>20 Md. App. 467, 316 A. 2d 529 (1974); <em>Board of Co. Comm\u2019rs v. Fleming, </em>13 Md. App. 261, 282 A. 2d 512 (1971), we now examine Laws of 1973, ch. 794, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">\u201cAn act to add new Section 45 to Article 53 of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1972 Replacement Volume), title \u201cLandlord and Tenant\u201d, to follow immediately after Section 44 thereof, and to be under the new subtitle \u201cLimitations on Rental Fee Increases\u201d, to impose certain limitations on the power of landlords to increase their rental fees; to provide certain exceptions to the limitations; to provide when this Act shall be superseded; to authorize local governments to enact measures concerning rental fees which supersede this act; to provide a severability clause; to provide this Act shall take effect on June 1,1973, and to provide that these limitations shall terminate on July 1, 1974.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">Whereas, The State of Maryland is confronted with an environmental crisis of emergency proportions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">Whereas, The State of Maryland is confronted with an economic crisis; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\">Whereas, Both of these crises have combined to create an emergency shortage in the availability of housing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Whereas, The Maryland General Assembly, in the exercise of its police power, believes it must take immediate action of a temporary nature for the duration of this crisis because of the termination of Federal Rent Stabilization on January 11, 1973; now, therefore,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">Section 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland, That new Section 45 be and it is hereby added to Article 53 of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1972 Replacement Volume), title \u201cLandlord and Tenant\u201d, to follow immediately after Section 44 thereof, to be under the new subtitle \u201cLimitations on Rental Fee Increases\u201d, and to read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">45. Limitations on Rental Fee Increases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">(A) No landlord renting four or more units may increase any rental fee for any residential premises or for the part of any premises which is used as a residence beyond an amount which is five percent (5%) of the rental fee which was in effect on January 11, 1973 except as provided in subsection (B). All rent increases subsequent to January 11, 1973, which exceed five percent (5%) of the rental fee which was in effect on that date shall be null and void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">(B) However, the landlord may also add to the rental fee permitted in subsection (A) the proportionate share of the amount of any increases in costs to the landlord for the premises since January 11, 1973, resulting from increases in real estate taxes, water and sewer charges, utility rates, and any actual cost of capital improvements constructed since that date. The calculation of the proportionate increase in rental fee shall be in accordance with the rules established under 6 Code of Federal Regulations 301.101 (A) (3) and (B) insofar as applicable. Written documentation of the basis upon which the proportionate increase in the rental fee is calculated shall be made available to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>the tenant at the time the tenant is notified of the rent increase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">(C) The rental fee for a residence vacant on the effective date of this section or becoming vacant thereafter may be increased by the landlord to an amount equal to the highest rent charged for a comparable residential unit in the same rental facility permitted under the terms of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">(D) The provisions of this section shall be superseded by reinstitution of federal rent stabilization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">(E) The governing body of any county and Baltimore City may enact laws, ordinances or regulations concerning rental fees covered by this section. These laws, ordinances and regulations shall supersede the provisions of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">(F) This section shall not apply to federally financed projects where the rent is determined as a percentage of the tenant\u2019s income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">(G) This Act shall expire July 1,1974.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">Section 2. And be it further enacted, that if any provision of this Act or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications thereof which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">Section 3. And be it further enacted, That this Act shall take effect June 1, 1973, and shall expire July 1, 1974, with no further action required by the General Assembly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">A reading of Laws of 1973, ch. 794, makes it apparent that the General Assembly was cognizant of 6 C.F.R. pt. 301 (1973)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because they specifically referred to that regulation in the text of ch. 794 and mandated that the proportional increases authorized by Md. Ann. Code Art. 53, \u00a7 45 (B) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>\u201cshall be in accordance with the rules established\u201d by the Federal Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">We look then to the Federal Regulations for guidance in determining intent when the Legislature, through ch. 794, sought to fill the void created by the expiration of Federal Rent Stabilization, 6 C.F.R., <em>supra. </em>The Federal Rent Stabilization regulation was bottomed upon the \u201cEconomic Stabilization Act of 1970\u201d and amendments thereto<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as implemented by the \u201cExecutive Orders\u201d of the President.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Federal Rent Regulations, 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.2 (1973) defined \u201cResidence\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">\u201c . . .a <em>housing unit, including </em>personal property such as a <em>mobile home </em>or a house boat, when offered for lease as a place of abode rather than as temporary lodging. <em>It also includes real property upon which the housing unit is situated </em>(or is to be situated if that unit is personal <em>property) and which is necessary for the convenient use of the unit, </em>and property owned by the lessor or owner of the unit, which is available for use by the lessee in connection with his use of the unit, and for which he must pay rent under the lease.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">When ch. 794 is read together with the Federal Regulation that inspired, if not sired, our statute, it becomes crystal clear that the Legislature was seeking to extend to the people of this State the same temporary economic protection it felt the Federal Government should have continued to afford. It is equally crystalline that the word \u201cunit\u201d as used in ch. 794 has exactly the same meaning that it had in 6 C.F.R. pt. 301 (1973). Accordingly, we hold that ch. 794 (Md. Ann. Code Art. 53, \u00a7 45) proscribed an increase in the rental fee sought to be charged by the appellant to the appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>insofar as the increase exceeds five percent (5%) of the rent, for mobile home lots, in effect on January 11, 1973, subject, however, to the additional allowable charges that may be imposed pursuant to the provisions of ch. 794, \u00a7 45 (B).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">We observe that the constitutionality of ch. 794 is not before us, and we express no opinion thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b468-12\"> Note: <em>Certiorari </em>denied, Court of Appeals of Maryland, July 25,1974.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-13\">. Md. Ann.

In determining legislative intent we may consider subsequent action by the Legislature in regard to a particular statute. Demory Brothers Inc. v. Board of Public Works, <em>supra. </em>The 1974 session of the General Assembly adopted by ch. 12 thereof a recodification of the Real Property Law of this State. The article of the code concerned with Real Property is now styled \u201cMd. Code, Real Property Article.\u201d The Real Property Article, which contains various effective dates, was signed into law by Governor Mandel on February 19, 1974. An amendment was offered to Laws of 1974, ch. 12. The amendment, designated as House Bill No. 719, is now an enrolled bill (i.e., one that has passed both houses of the Legislature and is awaiting gubernatorial action). House Bill No. 719 would add a new section, to be known as \u00a7 8-209, to the Real Property Article. \u00a7 8-209 is substantially the same as the present Md. Ann. Code Art. 53, \u00a7 45. It does, however, define a \u201cunit\u201d as \u201can apartment, townhouse, house, mobile home or mobile home lot.\u201d Charles, Dorchester and Worcester counties would be exempt from the provisions of \u00a7 8-209.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
