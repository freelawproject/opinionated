The policy includes a provision for payment of medical expenses. The exclusion under consideration reads as follows; \u201cThis policy does not apply to bodily injury sustained by any person if benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>therefor are in whole or in part either payable or required to be provided under any Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">It was stipulated that plaintiff, while in the course of his employment, was involved in an automobile accident and sustained bodily injury and medical expenses in connection therewith. It was further stipulated that plaintiff\u2019s employer had in force and effect workmen\u2019s compensation coverage but that at no time did plaintiff request payment of any of his medical expenses incurred as a result of the accident from either his employer or the workmen\u2019s compensation carrier. There is no language in the policy beyond that contained in the exclusion quoted above which requires or obligates plaintiff to seek workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. The trial court concluded that the purpose of the exclusion was \u201cto exclude from policy coverage expense for medical services for bodily injury which was in whole or in part either payable or required to be paid under California Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, . . . and is not predicated on and does not require that Plaintiff actually receive compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law in order to be operative.\u201d We agree and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">While it is true that \u201c. . . the burden rests upon the insurer to phrase exceptions and exclusions in clear and unmistakable language,\u201d <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>Glens Falls Ins. Co., </em>6 Cal.3d 699, at p. 701 [100 Cal.Rptr. 133, 493 P.2d 861]) and exclusionary clauses \u201cmust be conspicuous, plain and clear,\u201d <em>(Steven </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., </em>58 Cal.2d 862 [27 Cal.Rptr. 172, 377 P.2d 284]) when an exclusion meets these criteria it will be enforced according to its terms. <em>(New York Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hollender, </em>38 Cal.2d 73 [237 P.2d 510]; <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Shmitka, </em>12 Cal.App.3d 59 [90 Cal.Rptr. 399].)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In <em>Burkett </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>271 Cal.App.2d 360 [76 Cal.Rptr. 476], a case upon which plaintiff relies heavily, an exclusion in a disability insurance policy provided that the benefits were subject to deduction for amounts representing workmen\u2019s compensation benefits \u201cpaid or payable.\u201d The plaintiff there did not apply for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. The Court of Appeal in applying the rule of strict interpretation against the insurer held that the phrase \u201cpaid or payable\u201d could be interpreted to mean only workmen\u2019s compensation benefits either paid or awarded but not collected, and that language placed no obligation on the insured to apply for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>On the other hand, in <em>Laing </em>v. <em>Occidental Life Ins. Co., </em>244 Cal.App.2d 811, at page 814 [53 Cal.Rptr. 681], another division of the Court of Appeal held an exclusion which read \u201c \u2018... no Medical Expense Benefits shall be payable for or on account of: ... (4) Any bodily injury or sickness for which the person on whom claim is presented has or had a right to compensation under any workmen\u2019s compensation or occupational disease law, . . .\u2019 \u201d to be effective whether or not the insured had actually received such benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The Supreme Court of California in <em>Silberg </em>v. <em>California Life Ins. Co., </em>11 Cal.3d 452 [113 Cal.Rptr. 711, 521 P.2d 1103], citing with approval <em>Laing, supra, </em>along with comparable decisions from other jurisdictions, held that a clause which can, without conflicting or creating an ambiguity, when read in conjunction with other parts of the policy, be interpreted as excluding persons eligible for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits, will serve to deny coverage to such persons whether or not they receive such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The clause now engaging our attention is clear, unambiguous and not in conflict with other provisions of the policy.  Workmen\u2019s compensation coverage is an integral part of our insurance system in providing medical coverage for persons injured in the course of their employment, and a person who has been injured in the course of his employment through the acts of a third party tortfeasor generally looks to the workmen\u2019s compensation carrier as the primary provider of medical benefits. (For example, see <em>Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>57 Cal.2d 57 [17 Cal.Rptr. 369, 366 P.2d 641]; <em>Carden </em>v. <em>Otto, </em>37 Cal.App.3d 887 [112 Cal.Rptr. 749]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>3 Cal.3d 427 [90 Cal.Rptr. 737, 476 P.2d 105]; <em>Corley </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., </em>22 Cal.App.3d 447 [99 Cal.Rptr. 242].) Hence, it has become commonplace in various forms of medical and disability insurance policies to include an exclusion from the policy for benefits obtainable under workmen\u2019s compensation law. These exclusions are clearly consistent with public policy. (See Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.2; Veh. Code, \u00a7 16454; <em>Key Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>7 Cal.App.3d 209 [86 Cal.Rptr. 542].)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The exclusion in question here applies whether workmen\u2019s compensation benefits are \u201cpayable\u201d either \u201cin whole or in part\u201d and manifests a clear intention to exclude coverage for any injury incurred in the course aiid scope of employment and to leave the entire matter of medical coverage under those circumstances to the workmen\u2019s compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>The term \u201cpayable\u201d is defined in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary as \u201ccapable of being paid; suitable to be paid; admitting or demanding payment; justly done, legally enforceable.\u201d Under that definition th,e word \u201cpayable\u201d standing alone might be ambiguous. <em>(Burkett </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., supra, </em>271 Cal.App.2d 360.) However, the additional language \u201cor required to be provided under any workmen\u2019s compensation law\u201d creates an exclusion which is susceptible of only one reasonable and ' logical interpretation.. That interpretation is that the policy excludes coverage for an injury for which the- insured is eligible for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. The plaintiif\u2019s voluntary decision not to seek those benefits cannot expand the insurer\u2019s liability under the contract of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Roth, P. J., and Fleming, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 28, 1975.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
