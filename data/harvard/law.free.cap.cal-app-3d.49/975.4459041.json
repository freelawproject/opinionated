Plaintiff Sunkist Growers, Inc. appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">The agreed statement of facts, as relevant, follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-8\">\u201c1. Plaintiff is a corporation which on November 25, 1969 delivered to Defendant at Wilmington, California 5540 containers of citrus fruit for transportation from Wilmington to Honolulu, Hawaii.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-9\">\u201c2. Defendant was on November 25, 1969 and is today a corporation principally engaged in the common carriage by water of cargo between the Pacific Coast of the United States and Hawaii. Cargo is usually delivered to a Hawaiian consignee by Defendant in seven to ten days after the cargo is delivered to Defendant in Wilmington.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-10\">\u201c3. The cargo which is the subject of this cause of action was not transported from Wilmington to Honolulu pursuant to the contract. Rather, the cargo was redelivered from Defendant to Plaintiff at Wilmington after February 2, 1970. Had the cargo been transported pursuant to the contract, it would have been delivered to Plaintiff in Honolulu on approximately December 5, 1969.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-11\">\u201c4. Plaintiff filed suit in this Court on February 2, 1971.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">In its appellate brief, plaintiff elaborates upon the facts appearing in the settled statement. We do not consider such matter which was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>before the superior court, and which is no part of the record before us. (See 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7 218, p. 4208.)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">It will be noted from the settled statement that the cargo of citrus fruit \u201cshould have been delivered\u201d to Hawaii on or before December 5, 1969, and that plaintiff\u2019s action was filed more than one year after that date. On the other hand, defendant\u2019s return of the cargo to plaintiff, the shipper, in Wilmington after February 2, 1970, was within one year of the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Plaintiff contends that the <em>redelivery </em>of the citrus fruit to it by defendant at Wilmington, although contrary to the contract for carriage to Hawaii, was' the \u201cdelivery of the goods\u201d contemplated by the act. It follows, it is argued, that the action filed within one year of such redelivery was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Defendant maintains that the act\u2019s reference to \u201cdelivery of the goods\u201d means delivery of the cargo, according to the contract of carriage, or the bill of lading, at the point of destination, here Hawaii. Such a delivery having never been made, it insists that the critical point of time was the date when the cargo \u201cshould have been delivered\u201d in Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">We have concluded that the contention of defendant is the correct one, and that the superior court properly entered summary judgment in favor of that party.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">The court in <em>States Steamship Co. </em>v. <em>American Smelting &amp; Refining Co., </em>339 F.2d 66. (cert, den., 380 U.S. 964 [14 L.Ed.2d 155, 85 S.Ct. 1109]), considered the act\u2019s requirement that an action for loss or damage to cargo be \u201cbrought within one year after delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered.\u201d The court held (p. 68): \u201cThe wording compels the conclusion that said provision was intended to apply only to claims which relate directly to a <em>breach of a carrier\u2019s duty to make timely delivery of the goods in good order and condition.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) After consideration of relevant authority the court stated (pp. 68-69): \u201cThe cases are not at variance with this view. The limitation provision of Section 3(6) has been applied mainly to instances involving damage directly to the cargo. <em>It has also been applied where there has been delay in, or failure of, delivery or departure. </em>See Commercio Transito Internazionale, Ltd. v. Lykes Bros. Steamship Company, 243 F.2d 683 (2d Cir. 1957); Badhwar v. Colorado Fuel and Iron Corp., 138 F.Supp. 595 (S.D.N.Y. 1955), aff'd, 245 F.2d 903 (2d Cir. 1957), cert, denied, 355 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>U.S. 862, 78 S.Ct. 95, 2 L.Ed.2d 68 (1957); Singer Hosiery Mills of New York v. Cunard White Star, Ltd., 199 Misc. 389, 102 N.Y.S.2d 762 (1951); Albert Isbrandtsen Company, 7 Misc.2d 67, 160 N.Y.S.2d 772 (1957). In the above cited cases the damage arose directly from and was related directly to a failure to - make a proper delivery of the cargo owner\u2019s goods.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">The application of the act\u2019s statute of limitations \u201cwhere there has been delay in, or failure of, delivery or departure,\u201d is wholly inconsistent with its being tolled until some indefinite point of time when the goods might be returned to the shipper at the port of the ship\u2019s actual or contemplated departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In the case at bench defendant had failed to make \u201ctimely delivery of the goods\u201d to the cargo\u2019s consignee in Hawaii. The act\u2019s one-year statute of limitations (\u00a7 1303(6)) accordingly commenced running on the day when the \u201cgoods should have been delivered,\u201d which was no later than December 5, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Other authority has similarly concluded. Speaking of the act\u2019s statute of limitations, it was said in <em>Zifferer </em>v. <em>Atlantic Lines, Ltd., </em>278 F.Supp. 736, 739-740: \u201cThe one year time for suit clause is of the greatest importance. The suit must be brought within one year, even if the carrier fails to comply with his obligations under the law and the contract.\u201d The obvious meaning is that upon the carrier\u2019s failure to comply with its contract of safe carriage either because of damage to, or failure to deliver, the goods, the term of the statute commences running.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">This construction is consistent with the principle that it is the contract, or bill of lading, between the shipper and carrier that determines their respective rights and liabilities. Upon delivery of damaged goods, or failure to timely deliver the goods, at their agreed-upon destination in contravention of the contract of carriage, the statute must reasonably commence its operation. \u201cThe bill of lading, required to be issued by the initial carrier upon an interstate shipment, \u2018governs the entire transportation and thus fixes the obligations of all participating carriers to the extent that the terms of the bill of lading are applicable and valid.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Galveston Wharf Co. </em>v. <em>Ry. Co., </em>285 U.S. 127, 134-135 [76 L.Ed. 659, 664, 52 S.Ct. 342].) And as said in <em>A. M. Collins &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Panama R. Co., </em>197 F.2d 893, 897 (cert, den., 344 U.S. 875 [97 L.Ed. 677, 73 S.Ct. 168]): \u201cAll parties concerned with a negotiable ocean bill of lading, the carrier, the shipper, the consignee, the discounting bank, and the insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>underwriter, are alike interested not so much in the method as in the <em>result </em>to be achieved, the delivery of the cargo at the port of destination in good condition. The bill of lading contract with the carrier covers that completed service from the time of loading of the goods to their discharge from the ship. <em>The extent of liability of the carrier and of other persons performing that service under the carrier does not depend upon the means adopted but is governed by the contract covering the entire </em>service.\u201d (Italics partially added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Statutes of limitations \u201cmust necessarily fix <em>definite </em>periods of time.\u201d <em>(California Sav. etc. Soc. </em>v. <em>Culver, </em>127 Cal. 107, 110 [59 P. 292]; italics added; see also <em>Chas. L. Harney, Inc. </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>217 Cal.App.2d 77, 90-91 [31 Cal.Rptr. 524]; <em>Fidelity &amp; Dep. Co. </em>v. <em>Claude Fisher Co., </em>161 Cal.App.2d 431, 437 [327 P.2d 78].) Under the construction contended for by plaintiff, where goods are undelivered at their destination when they \u201cshould have been delivered\u201d the one-year statute of limitations would ordinarily commence running. But then upon their redelivery to the shipper at some future time at the port of original shipment (or perhaps elsewhere) the statute which had run, in whole or in part, would commence anew, obviously a quite unreasonable result. \u201cIt is the duty of the courts, whenever possible, to interpret statutes so as to make them workable and reasonable.\u201d <em>(City of Santa Clara </em>v. <em>Von Raesfeld, </em>3 Cal.3d 239, 248 [90 Cal.Rptr. 8, 474 P.2d 976].)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">We accordingly hold that the statute of limitations of the act, found in 46 United States Code Annotated section 1303(6) [46 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1303(6)], commences running on the date of delivery of the goods or on the date the goods should have been delivered, at their destination, according to the bill of lading or other contract for their carriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">The summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Molinari, P. J., and Weinberger, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 15, 1975, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 10, 1975.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b796-11\">Retired judge of the superior court sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
