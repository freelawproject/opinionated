Novak (Novak) filed an application with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>alleging injury arising out of and occurring in the course of her employment as a housekeeper for the period July 1, 1969, through March 30, 1972. Said injury was to her chest, legs, arteriosclerosis and hernia.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Novak\u2019s employer Buena Ventura Gardens (BVG) and Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna), its carriers, raised the affirmative defense of the statute of limitations pursuant to Labor Code sections 5405 and 5412.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The matter came to hearing on July 23 and August 30, 1974. A finding and award in favor of Novak was issued on November 28, 1974. BVG and Aetna filed a timely petition for reconsideration with the Board. On January 27, 1975, the Board issued an order denying reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">BVG and Aetna now petition this court for a writ of review and, following an inquiry and determination to annul, vacate and set aside Board\u2019s opinion and order denying reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Contention</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Petitioners contend that the Board exceeded its powers and acted improperly and unreasonably in issuing a finding and award not supported by substantial evidence and existing law when it found that Novak was not barred by the statute of limitations and that her injury arose out of and occurred in the course of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">All parties are in general agreement regarding the following facts. Novak worked at the Buena Ventura Gardens under the supervision of Whitney A. Elliot (Elliot) from July 1, 1969, to March 30, 1972, performing the duties of housekeeper. This involved cleaning a 285-unit apartment complex. Her work was considered strenuous but she was considered competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">There is some disagreement as to just when Novak began complaining of pain in her chest and legs and shortness of breath. She began seeing a Dr. Ludington of the Buena Ventura Medical Clinic in August of 1972. At that time Novak showed symptoms of hypertension, coronary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>ischemia and occult congestive heart failure. There is no indication that Dr. Ludington informed Novak of these diagnoses at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The parties agree that by March of 1972 Novak had made Elliot aware of the pain in her chest and legs and of her continuing shortness of breath. At this time Elliot found it necessary to hire an assistant to aid Novak with her assigned tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">On March 30, 1972, while at work Novak experienced severe pain in her chest and legs. She notified Elliot of this. Elliot instructed Novak\u2019s husband and a fellow employee of Elliot, to take Novak to see a doctor immediately.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">During late March or early April<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Novak was specifically informed of the nature and severity of her condition and that said condition was caused by the \u201cstrain of the working and overwork.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Elliot denies any further direct knowledge of Novak\u2019s condition. He testified that he never spoke with any of Novak\u2019s physicians or saw any medical reports. Elliot was informed by Novak\u2019s husband on March 30, 1972, that Novak would not be back to work for a while. Two weeks later Novak was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Elliot is uncertain as to whether he and. Novak ever discussed a worker\u2019s compensation claim for this ailment. However, it appears that Elliot at some point received some of Novak\u2019s medical bills. It was Elliot who referred said bills and Novak to the California State Employment Development Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\"><em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>12 Cal.3d 726 [117 Cal.Rptr. 79, 527 P.2d 631], controls the disposition of this appeal. The factual situations are amazingly analogous.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>In <em>Reynolds, </em>the claimant experienced pain in his left arm and chest during the course of a normal work day. He complained to his supervisor of said discomfort. He experienced a heart trauma in the presence of his supervisor, who ordered an ambulance to take Reynolds to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The only event not present in the instant case was that in <em>Reynolds </em>the supervisor actually accompanied Reynolds to the hospital and was present when the doctor informed Reynolds of the nature and cause of his condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><em>Reynolds </em>held that the claimant was not barred from filing a workmen\u2019s compensation claim, even though more than a year had passed prior to the filing of his claim, because the employer had failed to comply with Labor Code section 138.4 and title 8, chapter 4.5, sections 9816,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 9817<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 9859<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the California Administrative Code which require that an employer notify his employee of his rights to compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>In <em>Reynolds, </em>the Supreme Court recognized an affirmative duty on the employer to notify a claimant pursuant to the above code sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u201cPG&amp;E, however, was required, under administrative rules issued by the Administrative Director, Division of Industrial Accidents, Department of Industrial Relations, to notify petitioner that there was a possibility he would be entitled to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits and, since it apparently denied that he was entitled to benefits, to send him an unequivocal statement to that effect.\u201d <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>at page 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The issue here therefore is whether Elliot Could be considered to have had enough knowledge of Novak\u2019s condition to come within the affirmative duty recognized in <em>Reynolds.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Elliot was aware of Novak\u2019s weakening condition during March of 1972. He actually saw her on March 30, 1972, while she was in great discomfort. He ordered her to be taken to a doctor immediately. He was informed by Novak\u2019s husband upon her return from the doctor that Novak would not be back to work for a while. On April 15, 1972, he terminated Novak due to her condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>It would appear Elliot should have been aware of the presence of a condition that would be aggrevated by Novak\u2019s continuing to work. This should have put him on notice that such a condition might have been work related.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">A great deal of time has been spent in petitioner\u2019s brief herein concerning the fact that Elliot lacked contact with Novak\u2019s doctors and the fact that he did not receive any medical reports. He knew that she became disabled while on the job on March 30, 1972. He also knew on April 15, 1972, that she would not be able to return to work. He also knew enough about Novak\u2019s medical condition to recommend her' filing for State Disability Insurance. He went so far as to secure the forms for her. In our view under the facts the following principle recognized by <em>Reynolds </em>is applicable:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\"><em>Reynolds (supra) </em>specifically states at page 729: \u201cThe clear purpose of these rules is to protect and preserve the rights of an injured employee.... Since the employer is generally in a better position to be aware of the employee\u2019s rights, it is proper that he should be charged with the responsibility of notifying the employee . . . that there is a possibility he may have a claim....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">If the spirit of <em>Reynolds </em>is to be maintained, one cannot allow an employer to evade his duty simply because he has received no formal medical evidence from the employee as to the precise medical cause of the employee\u2019s ailment.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">While admittedly BVG did not have precise technical medical knowledge of Novak\u2019s condition, BVG did have knowledge that Novak sustained the disability during the period of actual employment, that it was probably permanently disabling and that it might conceivably be work caused or related. BVG had a duty to either give written notice of denial of benefits under Administrative Code section 9859 or written notice that a possible claim might exist under Administrative Code section 9816 in order to commence the running of the statute of limitations. BVG did neither. It may not now argue that the statute of limitations ran while Novak was ignorant of her rights of which it had a duty to advise her. It may not take advantage of its own neglect of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Notice commencing the statute of limitations is not related to notice that the injuiy may be work related but rather that there may be benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>available. After notice of potential benefits the statute of limitations commences as to the timely filing of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The writ of review is discharged and the petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Stephens, Acting P. J., and Ashby, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Petitioners\u2019 application for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 20, 1975.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-11\">Assigned by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-12\">formerly Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board.

Novak claims the referral was on March 30, 1972 and first visit during the first week in April. A letter from Dr. Ludington to Dr. Buckley, the cardiologist who examined Novak and gave her the diagnosis, is dated March 21, 1972. Buckley\u2019s records indicate Novak saw him throughout March.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b391-13\">Administrative record, page 90, line 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Section 9816 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">\u201c9816.
