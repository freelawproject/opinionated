J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9e\">The question presented on this appeal is whether in a declaratory relief action the trial court properly determined that a policy of insurance issued by Pacific Indemnity Company (hereinafter \u201cPacific\u201d) provided for primary insurance coverage. We have concluded that this determination was correct and that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">The underlying factual situation presented in the instant case is as follows: on October 6, 1969, Milton Butler and Carl Swafford, employees of Underground Construction Co. (hereinafter \u201cUnderground\u201d), were engaged in the placing of casings underneath a highway for the installation by Underground of water lines for a water company. On that day Elmer Smith, an employee of Howard Supply Company (hereinafter \u201cHoward\u201d) drove a truck and trailer loaded with casings to the jobsite. The truck and trailer were owned by Howard and the casings had been ordered by Underground from Howard. In the process of unloading the casings from the trailer-Swafford used a piece of equipment known as a \u201cHoptoe 300\u201d which was owned by McAllister Leasing Company (hereinafter \u201cMcAllister\u201d) and which McAllister had leased to Underground. In the unloading process a casing fell on Smith who sustained fatal injuries. Smith\u2019s heirs filed a wrongful death action against Underground and Butler as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">Underground was the insured under a liability policy issued by United Pacific Insurance Company (hereinafter \u201cUnited\u201d) with applicable limits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>of $100,000. Howard and McAllister were the named insureds under a policy issued by Pacific with applicable limits of $300,000. Underground and Butler filed the instant declaratory relief action naming Pacific and McAllister as defendants. The gist of the complaint is that Underground and Butler are additional insureds under the policy issued by Pacific to McAllister and Howard, that said insurance policy provides primary coverage to Underground and Butler for any liability incurred in the wrongful death action and that Pacific is obligated to defend Underground and Butler in said action.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Pacific and McAllister answered the complaint denying its allegations and cross-complained against Underground, Butler and United. McAllister\u2019s cross-complaint alleges that the policy issued by United, which affords liability coverage to Underground and Butler, provides coverage for all persons or business entities using vehicles owned and/or operated by Howard or McAllister, including the loading and unloading of such vehicles, and that McAllister is an additional insured under such policy; that such policy provides primary coverage; and that United is obligated under such policy to defend McAllister and to indemnify it against liability in the wrongful death action. Pacific, in its cross-complaint, incorporated McAllister\u2019s allegations and alleges further that its policy provides excess coverage under the coverage provided by United \u201cor at least prorates with said policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The trial court determined that the policy issued by Pacific insures the liability of Underground and Butler in the wrongful death action; that said insurance is primary over the policy of United; that Pacific is obligated to defend Underground and Butler in the wrongful death action; and that Underground and Butler were entitled to recover the sum of $1,388.93 against Pacific for expenses incurred in the wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">In the present case it is undisputed that Underground and Butler are additional insured\u2019s under Pacific\u2019s policy. The issue is as to the meaning and application of the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses contained in the respective insurance policies issued by United and Pacific.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The \u201cother insurance\u201d clause in United\u2019s policy provides as follows: \u201cIf at the time of an occurrence any valid and collectible insurance is available to the insured (in this or any other carrier), except insurance purchased to apply in excess of the limit of liability of this policy, no insurance shall be afforded hereunder as respects such occurrence; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>except, if the applicable limit of liability of this policy exceeds the applicable limit of liability of such other insurance, this policy shall afford excess insurance over such other insurance sufficient to afford the insured a combined limit of liability equal to the limit of liability of this policy. Insurance under this policy shall not be construed to be concurrent or contributing with any other insurance whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Pacific\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">\u201c6. <em>Other Insurance:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">\u201c(a) The insurance afforded by this policy is primary insurance, except when stated to apply in excess of or contingent upon the absence of <em>other insurance. </em>When this insurance is primary and the insured has other insurance which is stated to be applicable to the loss on an excess or contingent basis, the amount of the company\u2019s liability under this policy shall not be reduced by the existence of such other insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">\u201c(b) When both this insurance and other insurance apply to the loss on the same basis, whether primary, excess or contingent, the company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of the loss than that stated in the applicable contribution provision below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">\u201c(1) <em>Contribution by Equal Shares. </em>If all such other valid and collectible insurance provides for contribution by equal shares, the company shall not be liable for a greater proportion of such loss than would be payable if each insurer contributes an equal share until the share of each insurer equals the lowest applicable limit of liability under any one policy or the full amount of the loss is paid, and with respect to any amount of loss not so paid the remaining insurers then continue to contribute equal shares of the remaining amount of the loss until each such insurer had paid its limit in full or the full amount of the loss is paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">\u201c(2) <em>Contribution by Limits. </em>If any of such other insurance does not provide for contribution by equal shares, the company shall not be liable for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limit of liability under this policy for such loss bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-11\">\u201c(c) When both this insurance and other insurance apply to the loss, whether on the same basis or otherwise, and all of the policy forms of such other insurance do not contain a \u2018Contribution by Equal Shares\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>provision similar to paragraph (b)(1) above, this insurance shall be excess over any other valid and collectible insurance available to the insured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">Pacific contends that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause in United\u2019s policy is an \u201cescape\u201d clause. Such a clause is one that provides for avoidance of liability when there is other valid insurance. <em>(Peerless Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>144 Cal.App.2d 617, 621 [301 P.2d 602].) It is asserted by Pacific that since an \u201cescape\u201d clause denies coverage altogether it is therefore void as against public policy. Accordingly, Pacific argues that United\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause is nonexistent and the only coverage afforded Underground and Butler is the primary coverage for such insureds as is provided in United\u2019s policy. It is urged further by Pacific that its \u201cother insurance\u201d clause provides for excess coverage over and beyond the insurance afforded by United.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Alternately, Pacific argues that if United\u2019s policy is held to be permissible then both policies at issue contain excess clauses and that any loss, therefore, must be prorated on the same ratio that the applicable policy limit of each carrier bears to the total available coverage. As applied to the present case Pacific asserts that such proration must be effected as follows: The total coverage being $400,000 ($300,000 for Pacific and $100,000 for United), Pacific\u2019s limit of liability would be three-fourths of the loss and United\u2019s one-fourth of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The construction of the two policies is a question of law, no parol evidence having been offered or received in aid thereof. <em>(Union Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Chandler, 4 </em>Cal.App.3d 716, 724 [84 Cal.Rptr. 756]; see <em>Estate of Russell, </em>69 Cal.2d 200, 213 [70 Cal.Rptr. 561, 444 P.2d 353]; <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Development Co., </em>62 Cal.2d 861, 865-866 [44 Cal.Rptr. 767, 402 P.2d 839].) Under these circumstances we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s interpretation. In construing the pertinent provisions of the two policies we observe the principle that if possible a contract should be construed to be valid and enforceable rather than void as against public policy. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1643, 3541; <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>16 Cal.2d 253, 256 [105 P.2d 971, 130 A.L.R. 1003]; <em>Entremont </em>v. <em>Whitsell, </em>13 Cal.2d 290, 297 [89 P.2d 392].)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">We advert to Pacific\u2019s contention that \u201cescape\u201d clauses are void as against public policy. This contention is not meritorious. No case has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>come to our attention nor has any been cited to us which holds that \u201cescape\u201d clauses are void per se.  The applicable principle appears to be that \u201cescape\u201d clauses are not favored in the law and that, where they are in conflict with the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause in another policy covering the same risk with the result that if both clauses are given validity the insured is left unprotected, the \u201cescape\u201d clause will be disregarded and the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in both policies will be given effect on a basis of applicable proration. (See <em>Peerless Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., supra, </em>at pp. 621-623; <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund etc. Ins. Companies </em>v. <em>State Farm etc. Ins. Co., </em>273 Cal.App.2d 445, 450 [78 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>38]; <em>Oregon Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>195 F.2d 958, 959-960; see <em>\u201cOther </em>Insurance\u201d <em>Clauses Conflict, </em>5 Stan. L.Rev. pp. 147-150.) As long as the insured is protected and financial responsibility is provided for the protection of the public an \u201cescape\u201d clause is not contrary to public policy or the law. (See <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Weekes </em>(Fla.) 74 So.2d 367, 369.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Pacific\u2019s reliance on <em>Peerless </em>and <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund </em>is misplaced. In <em>Peerless </em>there was a conflict between an \u201cescape\u201d clause and an \u201cexcess\u201d clause which would have produced the inequitable result of leaving the insured unprotected. To obviate such a result the \u201cescape\u201d clause was disregarded and proportionate liability between the insurers was upheld. (144 Cal.App.2d at pp. 622-623.) In <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund, </em>although the court alluded to the \u201cso-called \u2018escape clause\u2019 of the type declared to be invalid in <em>Peerless Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., . . </em>.\u201d it did not hold that \u201cescape\u201d clauses are void as against public policy. To the contrary, the provision in the policy before it containing \u201cescape\u201d elements was held not to be an invalid \u201cescape\u201d clause. (273 Cal.App.2d at p. 450.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Adverting to the subject clause in United\u2019s policy we observe that although it is formulated like an \u201cescape\u201d clause it is in reality a composite of an \u201cescape\u201d and an \u201cexcess\u201d provision. It permits escape if the loss is less than any other insurance protection and provides excess insurance if and insofar as its coverage exceeds all other valid insurance combined. (See <em>Peerless Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., supra, </em>144 Cal.App.2d 617, 620-623.) Our inquiry, therefore, is directed to the validity and effect of United\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause when it is considered in relation to Pacific\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause since both of the insurance policies involved in the present case cover the same risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">We observe that Pacific\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause provides that the policy affords primary insurance \u201cexcept when stated to apply in excess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>... of other insurance.\u201d (Par. 6(a).) Under the provisions of paragraph 6(c), the insurance provided for in Pacific\u2019s policy is \u201cexcess over any other valid and collectible insurance available to the insured\u201d when such insurance and the other insurances apply to the loss and the other insurance does not contain a \u201ccontribution by equal shares\u201d provision similar to that provided in paragraph 6(b)(1) of Pacific\u2019s policy. United\u2019s policy does not contain such a \u201ccontribution by equal shares\u201d provision. Where there is such \u201cexcess\u201d insurance and the other insurance does not contain a \u201ccontribution by equal shares\u201d provision paragraph 6(b)(2) comes into play. That paragraph provides that Pacific shall not be liable for a greater proportion of the loss than its applicable limit of liability under the policy bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">We are thus projected to the question whether United\u2019s insurance coverage constitutes \u201cvalid and collectible insurance available to the insured\u201d named in or covered by Pacific\u2019s policy. The \u201cother insurance\u201d provision of United\u2019s policy expressly provides that if there is any valid and collectible insurance available to its insured no insurance is afforded the insured except that if the applicable limit of United\u2019s policy exceeds the liability of the other valid insurance then United\u2019s policy affords excess insurance over such other insurance sufficient to afford the insured a combined limit of liability equal to the limit of liability in United\u2019s policy. With these expressed limitations on its liability United\u2019s policy does not constitute other \u201cvalid and collectible insurance available to the insured\u201d within the meaning of Pacific\u2019s policy. As already observed the applicable limit of Pacific\u2019s policy (i.e., $300,000) exceeds the applicable limit of United\u2019s policy (i.e., $100,000). Accordingly, the \u201cescape\u201d element of the composite \u201cescape and excess\u201d clause becomes effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Pacific\u2019s insurance coverage, on the other hand, is \u201cvalid and collectible\u201d insurance available to United\u2019s insured within the meaning of United\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause. Pacific\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause provides that <em>\u201cThe insurance afforded by this policy is primary insurance, except when stated to apply in excess of </em>or contingent upon the absence of <em>other insurance.\u201d </em>(Par. 6(a); italics added.) Accordingly, the insurance afforded by Pacific to Underground and Butler, as additional insureds, is primary insurance because its \u201cexcess\u201d clause does not become operative. Since United\u2019s policy does not provide other \u201cvalid and collectible insurance available to the insured\u201d within the meaning of Pacific\u2019s policy, there is no other insurance over which Pacific\u2019s insurance is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\u201cexcess\u201d as stated in paragraph 6(c). The insurance afforded by Pacific is therefore primary insurance as provided in paragraph 6(a) of its policy and Pacific is liable to the extent of its policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The interpretation made by us finds support in other jurisdictions. (See <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Weekes, supra, </em>74 So.2d 367, 368-369; <em>McFarland </em>v. <em>Chicago Exp., Inc., </em>200 F.2d 5, 6; <em>Penn </em>v. <em>National Union Indemnity Co., </em>68 F.2d 567, 568.) The rationale of these cases is that the determining factor is the construction of the language employed by the respective insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\"><em>Peerless </em>is distinguishable. In that case one policy (Continental) contained a provision similar to that contained in United\u2019s policy. The policy of the other insurance company (Peerless) provided that \u201c \u2018If the insured has other insurance against a loss covered by this policy, the company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limits of liability stated in the declaration bear to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss; . . .\u2019 \u201d (144 Cal.App.2d at p. 620.) The respective insurance clauses were held to be mutually repugnant because each became operative when there was other \u201cvalid and collectible insurance available to the insured\u201d and, if given effect, neither policy would be liable, thus \u201cleaving the insured unprotected.\u201d (At p. 623.) Accordingly, the reviewing court, upon the application of the principle that where there is a conflict between an \u201cescape\u201d clause and a \u201cpro rata\u201d clause the law favors the \u201cpro rata\u201d clause, disregarded the \u201cescape\u201d clause and held that the loss should be prorated among the insurers. (At p. 623.) The same result was reached in <em>Oregon Auto Ins. Co. </em>where the conflict was between an \u201cescape\u201d clause and an \u201cexcess\u201d clause. (195 F.2d 958, 959-960.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The thrust of <em>Peerless </em>is that the respective other insurance clauses were in conflict and that if both were given effect neither would apply and the insured would be. left unprotected. In the instant case the respective clauses are not in conflict. The giving of effect to United\u2019s \u201cescape\u201d clause does not leave its insured, Underground and Butler, unprotected. There can be no question that United\u2019s policy would have covered these insureds had it not been for the insurance provided by Pacific and it may not be contended that Pacific\u2019s coverage is insufficient to protect Underground and Butler. We apprehend that Underground and Butler got that for which they contracted. United\u2019s composite \u201cescape and excess\u201d clause is not camouflaged nor does it fail to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>clear warning to the insured as was the case in <em>Peerless. </em>(144 Cal.App.2d at p. 623.) More significantly, the crucial language in Pacific\u2019s policy which states that its insurance is primary except when it is stated to apply in excess of other insurance is absent in <em>Peerless.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Adverting to <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund, </em>we observe that one policy (Fireman\u2019s Fund) contained \u201canother insurance\u201d clause similar to that issued by United in the present case and that of the other insurer (State Farm) contained the following provision: \u201c Tf the insured has other insurance against liability or loss covered by this policy, the company . . . shall not be liable for a greater proportion of such liability or loss than the applicable liability bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all collectible insurance against such liability or loss.\u2019 \u201d (273 Cal.App.2d at p. 447.) (We note that this provision is substantially similar to the prorate provision in paragraph 6(b)(2) of Pacific\u2019s policy in the present case.) The limit of liability in the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy was $2,050,000 and that of State Farm was $50,000. In holding that State Farm was solely responsible for the loss because Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s insured was an additional insured under State Farm\u2019s policy and Fireman\u2019s Fund provided only excess insurance, the reviewing court held inasmuch as Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s liability limits were greater than those of State Farm it could not be said that Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s excess provision amounted to an invalid escape clause. (273 Cal.App.2d at pp. 448-449.)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The situation in <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund </em>is the reverse of that applicable here. The composite \u201cescape and excess\u201d clause in Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s policy had limits higher than those of State Farm which had the pro rata clause. Accordingly, Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s excess clause became operative over and above the limits of State Farm\u2019s policy. The reviewing court in <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund </em>expressed misgivings that <em>Peerless </em>\u201cretains vitality in the face of later decisions.\u201d (273 Cal.App.2d at p. 450.) In any event, it is clear that <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund </em>does not deem \u201cescape\u201d clauses to be per se invalid and that it recognizes that the primary insurance afforded by an insurer is not affected by the \u201cescape\u201d clause in the policy of another insurer so long as the primary insurance affords protection to the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">In sum, we conclude that in view of the language employed by the respective insurers in their policies and the fact that the insured are fully protected there is no consideration of public policy involved. The instant litigation is nothing more than a contest between two insurance companies. The trial court was, therefore, correct in adjudging and declaring that Pacific\u2019s insurance policy insures the liability, if any, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Underground and Butler in the action brought by Smith\u2019s heirs for wrongful death and that Pacific is obligated to defend and indemnify Underground and Butler in said action. The declaration in the judgment below that Pacific\u2019s insurance is primary is also correct. We need'not discuss whether the language in the judgment that Pacific\u2019s \u201cinsurance is primary over the policy of cross-defendant United Pacific Insurance Company\u201d is a determination that United\u2019s coverage is also applicable on an \u201cexcess\u201d basis since United has not appealed from that part of the judgment. In its brief respondent concedes that this portion of the judgment is \u201cbeyond its reach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Elkington, J., and Lazarus, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\"Excess clauses\u201d provide for liability up to the limits of the policy covering excess loss only after the exhaustion of other valid insurance. <em>(Peerless Cas.
