Section 800 had then provided that an information charging perjury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 118) shall be filed \u201cwithin three years after its <em>commission.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) In 1972 the statute was amended to provide that the three-year statute of limitations for certain felonies, including perjury, did not start running until <em>discovery </em>of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Trigg\u2019s motion was denied by the trial court whereupon, on Trigg\u2019s application, we issued an alternative writ of prohibition for the purpose of reviewing the legality of the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The People concede, as they must, that the pre-1972 statute\u2019s three-year period having run before filing of the instant information, ordinarily prosecution for the charged offense would be barred. In support of the contention that the statute had nevertheless not run against Trigg, their principal reliance is placed on the recent case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Swinney, </em>46 Cal.App.3d 332 [120 Cal.Rptr. 148]. The reliance is futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Swinney, supra, </em>the defendant had been charged by an indictment filed March 5, 1974, with \u201cconcealment of stolen property [Pen. Code, \u00a7 496] committed continuously between October 1968 and March 1974.\u201d The Court of Appeal found evidence of \u201caffirmative, specific acts of concealment within three years of the March 1974 indictment,\u201d and reversed an order of the superior court dismissing the charge. The rationale of the reviewing court was simply that the indictment alleged, and the evidence tended to establish, acts of felonious concealment of property within the period of the applicable three-year statute of limitations. In the case at bench we observe no corresponding act of perjury within three years of the filing of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">We are unpersuaded that Trigg\u2019s voting within the three-year period constituted a <em>continuation </em>of the 1968 perjury, or that his 1972 voter\u2019s change-of-address card amounted to <em>republication </em>of that perjury. Some other offenses may have there been involved, but there was no false statement under oath or other violation of Penal Code section 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Two other authorities are urged by the People. In <em>Von Eichelberger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>252 F.2d 184, the accused who had been continually in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>possession of an unlawfully transferred firearm, was not aided by a statute of limitations, which would have barred prosecution for possession at the time the weapon was initially obtained; the case is analogous to <em>People </em>v. <em>Swinney, </em>discussed above, and is here inapposite. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>196 F. 874, 878, did not, as contended by the People, allow prosecution for \u201cdevis[ing] a scheme and artifice to defraud\u201d where the statute of limitations had long before run from the date of such \u201cdevising.\u201d Instead, the accused was charged with using the mails (within the statutory period) \u201cin pursuance of such a scheme\u201d devised beyond that period; the case also is obviously of no authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The statute of limitations having run on the subject charge of perjury\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The peremptory writ of prohibition will issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Molinari, P. J., and Sims, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
