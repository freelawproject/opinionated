When he appeared for hearing on his application for probation and for sentencing on December 17, 1974, the trial judge suspended further criminal proceedings and referred him to Department 95<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the superior court pursuant to section 3051 of the Welfare and Institutions Code in order that an examination and hearing could be had to determine whether Ross was addicted to the use of narcotic drugs or by reason of repeated use of narcotics was in imminent danger of becoming so addicted and pending such hearing he was remanded to the custody of the sheriff. On January 10, 1975, the District Attorney of the County of Los Angeles duly filed a petition under section 3051 to determine whether or not Ross was an addict or in danger of becoming an addict. The judge presiding in Department 95 duly made an order on January 15, 1975, appointing Doctors A. E. Davis and Blake Skrdla to examine Ross. They examined Ross on January 16, 1975,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and filed with the court their certificate as medical examiners. After recitation of certain facts regarding the alleged use of narcotics by Ross, both doctors concluded that Ross was \u201cNot now [an] addict or [in] imminent danger [of becoming an addict]\u2014Dismiss\u201d and filed with the court on January 16, 1975,. their certificate accordingly. The minutes of the court on that date read as follows;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">\u201cIn this matter the examining physicians have determined that the Respondent is not presently a narcotic drug addict. However, it is the Respondent\u2019s desire that he be committed to the California Rehabilitation Center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">\u201cThe matter is continued to January 24, 1975, for further argument and disposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">\u201cThe Respondent is remanded to the Sheriff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">When the matter was again before the court on January 24, 1975, the court concluded that Welfare and Institutions Code sections 3103.5 and 3051 \u201cdo not prevent the court from setting a matter for hearing on the issue of narcotic addiction, even though the examining doctors feel the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>respondent is not an addict.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The People filed a petition for writ of mandate/prohibition naming the superior court as the respondent and Ross as the real party in interest. We granted an alternative writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Petitioner contends:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">I. The superior court acted illegally and in excess of jurisdiction when it set the petition for jury trial over the district attorney\u2019s objection and notwithstanding the fact that the court-appointed physicians had certified that Ross was not an addict or in danger of becoming an addict.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">In his opposition to the People\u2019s petition, Ross does not deny any of the material allegations. However, h\u00e9 alleges certain additional facts (which are not denied by the People). Ross alleges that he entered a plea of guilty to the charge of second degree burglary on November 26, 1974, that he was [first] referred to Department 95 on December 17, 1974, under Welfare and Institutions Code section 3051, that on December 24, 1974, the judge in Department 95 appointed Doctors Markman and Skrdla to examine him and after examination said doctors decided and reported on December 26, 1974, that Ross was not an addict or in imminent danger of becoming one and the judge in Department 95 thereupon ordered Ross returned to the referring court; that on January 7, 1975, a judge in the referring court [who was not the judge who made the referral on December 17, 1974] re-referred Ross to Department 95, finding that \u201cthe facts of the case did not warrant the conclusion by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>examining doctors that Ross was not an addict or in danger of becoming one and therefore ordered that Ross be examined again.\u201d It thus appears that the referral to Department 95 referred to by the People was the first referral but the examination which the People refer to was the result of the second referral. In the certificate of medical examiners dated January 16, 1975, Doctors Davis and Skrdla recite the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">\u201cGeneral Physical Condition, Degree and History of Addiction; Present Physical Signs of Addiction or Use: Brian Burgess, pvt. counsel present. Arrest Aug. 13, 1974, sec. degree burglaiy, in custody to date; from Metro S.H. Aug. 11, AWOL, at Metro Aug. 10 &amp; 11; in CYA placement 5 months to 8-9-74; on the street Aug. 21-27, 73. Sniffed heroin in CYA 3 or 4 X. Heroin at age 14; up to 4 spoons in a day in Sept. 1972; longest run 4 or 5 months in \u201972, ended by arrest; &amp; <em>last withdrawals. </em>Fixed 3 X Aug. 12 &amp; 13; &amp; daily Aug. 21-27, \u201973, also alcohol &amp; \u2018reds\u2019 concurrent; fixed \u2018reds\u2019 &amp; LSD in 1971 a few times\u2014very old &amp; faded tracks, L. elbow &amp; wrist\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201cOut of custody 6 or 7 da. in 8/73.

No evidence of tolerance or physical dependence since Oct. 1972.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">\u201cHe denies he would use drugs if released, because of his religious conversion in Aug. 73, and he would go to live with the family which converted him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">\u201cTentative Diagnosis and Recommendation for Disposition or Supervision, Treatment and Care: Not now addict or imminent danger\u2014Dismiss\u2014\u201c</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">When the judge in Department 95 set the matter for jury trial he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">\u201cThe Court: 3103.5 and 3051 do not prevent the Court from setting the matter for a hearing on narcotic addiction and that, in fact, the defendant has the right to demand that hearing even though the two original Doctors or any subsequent Doctors have found that he is not a narcotic addict and, therefore, he is entitled to a hearing on narcotic addiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>\u201cNow, I have one problem. I have come to the conclusion he is manipulative. I have come to the conclusion that being as acquainted as I am with Drs. Markman, Skrdla and Davis\u2014Dr. Davis has been examining narcotic addicts for 16, 17 years. He has probably examined more narcotic addicts than any Doctor in the world bec\u00e1use this as a county-wide jurisdiction, 7 million people as you know\u2014Dr. Markman for many years, Dr. Skrdla for many years, and I have therefore acquired a bias against your defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">\u201cIn other words, I\u2019m satisfied that he is not a\u2014or at least I\u2019m of the general opinion that he really isn\u2019t a narcotic addict. <em>He is just a criminal that would prefer to go to C.R.C. </em>And, therefore, I do admit to a bias against him and I would not want to try the case.\u201d (Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Court and counsel then engaged in a discussion regarding whether Ross should stipulate to a hearing by a commissioner and if he did so and the finding was that Ross was not an addict or in imminent danger of becoming an addict whether or not Ross would thereafter be entitled to a jury trial in view of the statutory provisions (\u00a7 3051) that a jury could be demanded after an <em>affirmative </em>finding. The court expressed the opinion that Ross would not be entitled to demand a jury <em>after </em>a commissioner or judge had made a negative finding that he was <em>not </em>an addict. The court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">\u201cNow, that specifically says there is a right to a jury trial only if there is a commitment. And, therefore, my original thinking is correct that if you have this hearing before a judge or commissioner and there is no commitment to C.R.C., to the Department of Corrections, you will not have the right to a jury trial because that is not a question of judicial power. That is simply a question of procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u201cAmd I doubt very much if there is a right both to a court and a jury trial, particularly since I now offer you a jury trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">\u201cMr. Burgess: We will take the jury trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">\u201cThe Court: You would prefer that. All right, then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-10\">\u201cWe\u2019ll set this, then, for the jury trial.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The sole issue which is involved herein arises from a very limited and narrow factual base. Or perhaps more accurately no factual basis whatsoever. Here the first court-appointed experts concluded, the second court-appointed experts concluded, the district attorney concluded and the trial judge concluded that Ross was not an addict or in danger of becoming an addict. Furthermore, Ross presented no medical evidence of any kind that he was an addict or in danger of becoming an addict. His own declaration to the court-appointed examiners was that if he were released he would not use narcotics because he had undergone a religious conversion. The <em>SOLE </em>basis for the court\u2019s order for a jury trial was that Ross would rather go to the California Rehabilitation Center than to state prison. That is not a sufficient factual or legal basis for a jury trial under section 3051. We conclude that the court abused its discretion and acted in excess of its jurisdiction when it made its order for such jury trial when such order had no other basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>In <em>In re Walker, </em>71 Cal.2d 54, 59 [77 Cal.Rptr. 16, 453 P.2d 456], the Supreme Court speaking of the necessity for a medical examination to <em>verify </em>the person\u2019s addicted condition as outlined in <em>In re Cruz, </em>62 Cal.2d 307 [42 Cal.Rptr. 220, 398 P.2d 412], said: \u201cIn a footnote to our quoted language, however, we admonished that \u2018the protection of both the individual and society would seem to be served by, <em>if not to require, </em>a medical examination in any event to verify the person\u2019s addicted condition. . . . [H] An examination by court-appointed physicians in waiver cases thus serves to protect the volunteer from a commitment entered into as a result of mistake, duress, depression or fear; indeed, <em>it also protects the state, by assuring that all persons committed to its overburdened rehabilitation facilities are genuinely in need of the services there provided,\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Section 3051 of the Welfare and Institutions Code provides that upon a negative certification from the examining doctors, the defendant shall be remanded to the criminal department for further proceedings. The statute reads in part: \u201cA written report of the examination by the physicians shall be delivered to the court, and if the report is to the effect that the person is not addicted nor in imminent danger of addiction, it shall so certify and return the defendant to the department of the superior court which directed the filing of the petition for such further proceedings on the criminal charges as the judge of such department deems warranted.\u201d No provision of the statute authorizes a defendant to demand a jury trial merely because he personally prefers to go to the California Rehabilitation Center rather than to prison. The record here is clear that that was the so/e basis for the court\u2019s order for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In the instant case, the court\u2019s own words indicate that it was not in doubt as to any probable cause for the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u201c3103.5 and 3051 do not prevent the Court from setting the matter for a hearing. . . . Now I have one problem. <em>I have come to the conclusion he </em>[Rom] <em>is manipulative.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The court went on to praise the competence of Doctors Markman, Davis and Skrdla, and expressed confidence in their diagnoses. It then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">\u201c... I have therefore acquired a bias against your defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>\u201cIn other words, I\u2019m satisfied that he [Ross] is not a\u2014or at least <em>I\u2019m of the general opinion that he really isn\u2019t a narcotic addict. </em>He is just a criminal that would prefer to go to C.R.C.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">A second factor<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> indicating error lies in the fact that no affidavits or declarations were presented to support Ross\u2019 claim that he was an addict. Ross presented no medical evidence as to his use of narcotic drugs. He did not even request that the court appoint a new doctor of his choosing to re-examine him. Ross himself did not offer evidence on this (or any other) subject. The court had no evidence upon which to base a judicial discretion in support of an order for jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In <em>Transit Ads, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tanner Motor Livery, Ltd., </em>270 Cal.App.2d 275 [75 Cal.Rptr. 848], this court dealt with a similar problem. That case concerned the setting aside of a default judgment by a trial court, due to excusable neglect on the part of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The court specifically stated that legal discretion on granting relief was not to be bestowed ex gratia: \u201cDiscretion is abused in granting relief from default if the moving party\u2019s supporting affidavit or declaration fails to set forth facts sufficient to constitute grounds for relief.\u201d <em>(Supra, </em>at p. 280.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The court also stated that: \u201cIn a plain case this discretion has no office to perform, and its exercise is limited to doubtful cases . . . .\u201d <em>(Supra, </em>at p. 279.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">In the instant case, the court, acting as the finder of fact, was not in doubt. No supporting evidence (i.e., either medical reports or affidavits or declarations) was presented. There was nothing upon which to even base a finding of a \u201cdoubtful case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">The court went even further by urging Ross to select a jury trial and waive a hearing in front of a commissioner. The court stated as a reason for Ross\u2019 choosing a jury trial: \u201c[I]f he [Rich] finds that he [Ross] is not a narcotic addict, why, I\u2019m inclined to think that is the end of it. .... I doubt very much whether I\u2019m going to find that if he [Ross] is found not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>to be an addict that he [Ross] now has a right to have a jury decide whether he is an addict.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\u201cNow, that specifically says there is a right to a jury trial only if there is commitment. And, therefore, my original thinking is correct that if you have this hearing before a judge or commissioner and there is no commitment to C.R.C., to the Department of Corrections, you will not have the right to a jury trial...</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>13 Cal.3d 95, 103 [118 Cal.Rptr. 1, 529 P.2d 33], speaks to this point when it says: \u201cdiscretion cannot be exercised so as to \u2018enlarge its own boundaries or support acts requiring other legal bases. Even within its legal limits the power is not unbridled.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The record is clear that the court was not in doubt as to the issue of Ross\u2019 addiction to narcotic drugs. The court made no affirmative finding that Ross was an addict or in danger of becoming an addict. In this case we decide <em>only </em>that Ross is not entitled to a jury trial on the issue of narcotic addiction when the sole basis for such jury trial is that Ross would rather go to C.R.C. than state prison. The granting of a juiy trial under such conditions was beyond the power of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Petitioners have sought relief through either a writ of mandate or prohibition requesting the court to choose the more appropriate remedy. The case of <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 260 [105 P.2d 975], provides that a writ of mandate lies in cases involving judicial discretion when that discretion has been abused. <em>(State Farm etc. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>47 Cal.2d 428 [304 P.2d 13], and <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>96 Cal.App.2d 119 [214 P.2d 844, 19 A.L.R.2d 288].)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">We conclude that the People are entitled to a writ of mandate as prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Let a writ of mandate issue directing respondent court to vacate its order in that certain action entitled, The People of the State of California, in the best interest and protection of society and James Ross, No. NDA 18039, setting a jury trial pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code sections 3103.5 and 3051, and directing said court to remand said case to the appropriate criminal department of the superior court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>further proceedings therein and pending such action the respondent court is prohibited from proceeding with said jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Kaus, P.
