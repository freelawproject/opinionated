J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZM\">This is an unemployment insurance case in which petitioner Esther Du Four contends that she has a right to judicial review of an adverse decision of a referee, as distinguished from the appeals board.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">In June 1972, after petitioner either quit or was laid off from her job, she filed a claim for unemployment insurance benefits with the Department of Human Resources Development (HRD). She received benefits for about two months; then, in August 1972 HRD notified her that she was disqualified for unemployment benefits because she had quit her most recent employment without good cause and refused an offer of suitable work without good cause. She was disqualified for future benefits for the statutory period of time and required to repay the benefits already granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">Petitioner filed a timely appeal and a hearing on her appeal was held before a referee, who, in November 1972, affirmed the decision of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>Although not alleged in the petition, the administrative record shows that petitioner filed a late appeal to the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board which decided only that petitioner had not shown good cause for the late filing. Petitioner concededly did not seek judicial review of the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The board\u2019s demurrer to the petition in this action, directed against the referee\u2019s decision, was sustained and the case was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The procedure for review of adverse HRD decisions is straight forward. A dissatisfied applicant can' appeal an adverse decision by a departmental representative to a referee who determines the matter of eligibility <em>de novo. </em>(Unemp. Ins. Code, \u00a7 1328.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner had such a de novo review in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">An applicant may appeal an adverse decision of the referee by requesting board review within 10 days of the referee\u2019s decision. (\u00a7 1334.) The board may decide the case on the record developed at the hearing before the referee or may take additional evidence. (\u00a7 1336.) A decision of the appeals board is final, \u201cexcept for such action as may be taken by a judicial tribunal as permitted or required by law.\u201d The right to petition for judicial review must be exercised within six months. (\u00a7 410.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">The procedure for judicial review of an administrative decision is set forth in Code of Civil Procedure, section 1094.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">In contending that the decision of a referee is reviewable, petitioner relies on section 1334, which provides as relevant that \u201cthe decision [of the referee] shall be final unless, within 10 days after mailing of such decision, further appeal is initiated to the appeals board . . . .\u201d Since Code of Civil Procedure, section 1094.5, provides for review of \u201cany final administrative order or decision made as the result of a proceeding in which by law a hearing is required to be given, . . .\u201d it follows, in petitioner\u2019s view, that a decision of the referee is reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>To reach this result, petitioner must turn the procedures for administrative review of an unemployment insurance claim inside out. Code of Civil Procedure, section 1094.5, does not purport to define a \u201cfinal\u201d administrative order, but, rather, sets forth the method and procedures for judicial review of such an order. A \u201cfinal\u201d department order for purposes of judicial review impliedly assumes compliance with the three-tier system of determination and review, and explicitly requires a board decision under section 410, which provides, as quoted, that \u201c[a] decision of the appeals board is final, except for such action as may be taken by a judicial tribunal....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Petitioner finds authority to appeal from the decision of a referee in section 1336, which states that \u201c[t]he director or any party to a decision by a referee <em>may </em>appeal to the appeals board from the decision.\u201d (Italics added.) The use of \u201cmay\u201d in section 1336 is not intended to confer on an applicant or on the director the right to choose the forum in which the referee\u2019s decision will be reviewed. Rather, as should be obvious, the section merely states that additional review is permissive.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">We note that although petitioner disagreed with the referee\u2019s decision, she offered no particularly compelling reason that she failed to appeal to the board within the 10-day period allowed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, even assuming that petitioner had good cause for the late filing of an appeal with the board, she offered no explanation for failing to seek judicial review of the board\u2019s decision not to allow an appeal on the merits from the referee\u2019s decision, as was successfully done in <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd., 9 </em>Cal.3d 494 [108 Cal.Rptr. 1, 509 P.2d 945]. She discusses at length the need for judicial review of administrative decisions\u2014a matter not at issue in the unemployment insurance scheme\u2014but the only <em>reason </em>that she furnishes for a rule allowing direct review of an adverse referee\u2019s decision is that the board \u201coverturned an adverse Referee\u2019s decision and ruled in favor of the claimant in an average of only 7.1% of the cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">There is predictably no case law to support petitioner\u2019s attempt to short-circuit the system for review of adverse unemployment insurance benefits decisions. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Department of Human Resources Dev., </em>33 Cal.App.3d 314, 317, footnote 1 [109 Cal.Rptr. 35], has nothing to do with this case. In <em>Miranda </em>one of three petitioners had not appealed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>adverse decision of the referee to the board. There, however, the issue was solely a legal question\u2014the interpretation of section 1256 and not a factual determination in an individual case. A requirement that an applicant proceed through the administrative machinery in face of an established board interpretation of a statute would have been an exercise in futility.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Neither does <em>Fermin </em>v. <em>Department of Employment, </em>214 Cal.App.2d 586 [29 Cal.Rptr. 642], apply to this case. There, an applicant filed a late appeal from a departmental decision to the referee who, while finding that the appeal was filed late, nevertheless ruled on the merits of the applicant\u2019s claim. The referee and the board affirmed the department\u2019s decision. (214 Cal.App.2d at p, 588.) Thus, the case was properly before the trial court after an appeal from an adverse decision of the board. Whether the referee, the board, the trial court and the appeals court could have stopped after concluding that the applicant did not show good cause for his late appeal is beside the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In conclusion, petitioner has furnished no facts as applied to her case that would justify judicial review of the referee\u2019s adverse decision, and has furnished no reasons for interpreting the Unemployment Insurance Code to permit judicial review from adverse referee\u2019s decisions at the discretion of the aggrieved applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The judgment (order of dismissal) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Stephens, J., and Ashby, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-11\">All references except as noted are to the Unemployment Insurance Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b682-12\">Petitioner\u2019s attempted procedural end run around the board is clearly an effort to avoid her failure to seek judicial review within six months of the board\u2019s denial of her late appeal to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Petitioner included in her notice of appeal to the board the following explanation of her lateness: \u201cMy husband and I are divorce [j/c] and he put in a change of address, therefore my mail sometimes goes to him. And he keeps it. I did not receive it in time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
