App. \u00a7 462. Appellant\u2019s main contention is that his local board erred in refusing to reopen his I-A classification to consider his conscientious objector claim filed after he received an order to report for induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">Appellant argues that his claim rested on non-religious grounds, and that, therefore, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970), permitting non-religious conscientious objector claims, was a material \u201cchange in status over which he had no control within the meaning of Regulation 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\"><em>Welsh </em>was decided <em>before </em>appellant\u2019s induction notice was sent, however, and, under section 1625.2, a change of status must occur after the notice to warrant reopening a registrant's classification. United States v. Van Becker, 438 F.2d 1224, 1225 (9th Cir. 1971); United States v. Uhl, 436 F.2d 773, 774 (9th Cir. 1970). Moreover, appellant\u2019s letter accompanying his conscientious objector questionnaire reflects a prima facie conscientious objector claim under traditional, religiously based, <em>pre-Welsh </em>standards. <em>Welsh </em>therefore worked no change in appellant\u2019s status.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">We have carefully considered the remaining points raised by appellant and find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
