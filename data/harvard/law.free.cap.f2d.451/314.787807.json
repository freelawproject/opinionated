He alleges that the trial judge committed reversible error by instructing the jury as to the inference it could draw from proof of possession of recently stolen property. Anstead considers the instruction to be an unconstitutional burden on the exercise of his right not to testify. We reject this ground of appeal. The trial judge carefully told the jury that possession may be satisfactorily explained by facts independent of testimony from the accused. The trial judge also reiterated that the accused was not required by law to produce any evidence. United States v. Williams, 405 F.2d 14 (4th Cir. 1968); see also, Wilson v. United States, 162 U.S. 613, 16 S.Ct. 895, 40 L.Ed. 1090 (1896); United States v. Smith, 407 F.2d 35 (4th Cir. 1969); United States v. Smith, 446 F.2d 200 (4th Cir. 1971); United States v.
