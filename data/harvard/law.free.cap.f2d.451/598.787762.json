The district court granted an evidentiary hearing on the petition with particular reference to a contention that an involuntary confession had been introduced at petitioner\u2019s trial. The court found that the statement in question had been made voluntarily and that it had been introduced into evidence with the consent and even at the urging of the accused because of exculpatory matter it contained. On the record these findings were justified. We conclude that no constitutional right was violated by the use of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-22\">We have considered all other points urged on this appeal and find no denial of constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-23\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
