We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">McCrary is serving a 25 year sentence for armed robbery, having been convicted upon trial by jury. No direct appeal was taken. A motion to vacate sentence filed in the state trial court pursuant to Fla.R.Crim.P. 1.850, 33 F.S.A., was denied after an evidentiary hearing and affirmed on appeal. McCrary v. State, Fla.App.1969, 220 So.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The single issue before the court below was whether the prosecution knowingly used perjured testimony to obtain a conviction. McCrary alleged that the state prosecuting attorney promised Mc-Crary\u2019s co-defendant a probated sentence and paid him five dollars to testify that McCrary participated in the crime. This same issue was the subject of the evidentiary hearing in the state court at which the prosecutor testified that he paid no money and made no promises to obtain the co-defendant\u2019s testimony. Mc-Crary offered the testimony of the co-defendant in support of his allegations. The state court found no credible testimony to support McCrary\u2019s allegations. The United States District Court found that McCrary was afforded a full and fair state hearing and adopted the state court\u2019s findings as its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">The District Court is not required to hold a second evidentiary hearing in these circumstances. Ryan v. Wainwright, 5 Cir. 1970, 424 F.2d 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">A review of the record, including the transcript of the state evidentiary hearing, reveals no clear error in the findings of the District Court. 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 2254. The judgment below is</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
