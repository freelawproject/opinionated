Plaintiffs, York residents, allege in their Amended Complaint, that the defendants had violated their rights (1) by conducting illegal searches and seizures in contravention of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments; (2) by illegal police practices, including use of excessive force and imposition of summary punishment contravening the Due Process Clause; and (3) by denying black residents of York their right to the equal protection of the laws secured by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-23\">The District Court premised its denial of injunctive relief and dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 action on its factual determination that evidence adduced at seven days of hearings <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> established that turbulent race riots erupted in York from July 17 to July 28,1969 during which the May- or of York imposed a curfew and the Governor of Pennsylvania declared a state of emergency; Pennsylvania National <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Guardsmen and State Police occupied the city\"; York officials \u201cmade every effort to comply with constitutional requirements under most strenuous conditions\u201d and there was no \u201cofficial policy authorizing unconstitutional searches\u201d; the York police force did not follow a pattern of racism or illegal police actions, nor was such a pattern \u201cofficially espoused or tolerated\u201d; it made a total of 108 arrests during the 12 days of rioting, and of those arrested 59 were black and 49 were white; one of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in fact referred to York\u2019s Police Chief Leonard Landis as \u201ca fair man\u201d; and \u201conly a few of the 94 members of the Police Department\u201d were guilty of \u201cillegal and improper\u201d police action and expression of racism.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In its \u201cDiscussion of Facts,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the District Court graphically described \u201cthe wave of horror and panic that gripped the City of York\u201d during the 12 days of race riots; the \u201cgeneral gunfire\u201d of armed \u201croving gangs\u201d; the \u201cscattered attempts of firebombings\u201d; and the subjecting of police vehicles \u201cto heavy fire while patrolling the troubled areas,\u201d as indicia of \u201cthe enormity of the problems with which law enforcement officials were confronted.\u201d 311 F.Supp. 1142-1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The record establishes that 25 persons were shot during the rioting; two fatally \u2014 a black woman and a white policeman. Extensive property damage was wrought, including police vehicles. The District Court, in its fact-findings, discussed some 120 instances of violence participated in by both black and white citizens, and in a few instances by policemen.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The District Court also considered testimony with respect to several searches of homes for weapons, on July 23 and 24, 1969, conducted by York police, Pennsylvania State Police and National Guardsmen. Only one search was war-rantless. The District Court found that all of the searches were valid.</p>\n<p id=\"AK8Y\">Plaintiffs, on this appeal, contend that the District Court erred in ruling the searches valid because in their view: (1) the affidavits, in support of the search warrants did not afford a sufficient basis for the issuance of the warrants; (2) the searches were conducted in an unreasonable manner; and (3) the warrantless search was unjustified under the prevailing circumstances. The plaintiffs further urge that the District Court erred in these respects: (1) it imposed \u201ca heavier burden of proof than that generally applicable to civil actions in equity\u201d; (2) in denying injunctive relief with respect to the five incidents in which it found action by several policemen was \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cinexcusable\u201d ; (3) in finding that there was not a \u201cpattern\u201d of police misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">We find no merit in the plaintiffs\u2019 contentions with respect to the searches, for the reasons so well-stated by the District Court in its exhaustive discussion as to their validity in its Opinion, 311 F.Supp. at pages 1150-1155.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-14\">We also find without merit the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the District Court imposed a heavier burden of proof than that generally applicable to civil actions in equity. The District Court\u2019s extensive discussion and analysis of the testimony presented by the plaintiffs effectively negates this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">Further, we do not subscribe to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the District Court erroneously denied them the in-junctive relief which they sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">The hard core of that contention is that (1) the District Court was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d in its factual determination that the record failed to establish that there was a pattern of racism or illegal police action during the July 1969 race riots in York, or that such a pattern was \u201cofficially espoused or tolerated,\u201d and (2) the District Court erred in denying plaintiffs\u2019 injunctive relief in the light of its factual finding that sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>eral of York\u2019s policemen had been guilty of improper police action and racism.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">With respect to the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d aspect of the plaintiffs\u2019 contention as to the District Court\u2019s stated fact-findings, we are of the opinion that it is utterly without merit, and that the record in fact amply sustains the challenged fact-findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">As to the second aspect of the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, viz., that the District Court erred in denying them injunctive relief in view of its fact-findings with respect to the condemned conduct of several policemen, this must be said:</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The thrust of that contention is that the District Court abused its legal discretion in its denial of injunctive relief, albeit the plaintiffs have failed to specifically so state.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">It is well-settled that a District Court\u2019s denial of injunctive relief will not be reversed unless such denial constitutes an abuse of legal discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">In light of the totality of the circumstances prevailing in the instant case, we cannot say that the District Court abused its discretion in denying the injunctive relief sought by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">On the score of that denial we note that the District Court in its Opinion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> directed attention to these facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Plaintiffs, in their Complaint, filed July 24, 1969, named as defendants, John L. Snyder as Mayor of York, and Jacob W. Hose, as Director of Public Safety of York. Mayor Snyder died October 8, 1969 and on January 15, 1970, Eli Eichelberger, the newly elected May- or of York, was substituted for him as defendant, and Leslie Jackson, York\u2019s present Director of Public Safety, was then substituted for Jacob W. Hose.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">In considering the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the \u201cclear possibility\u201d of future illegal police action required injunc-tive relief, the District Court could, of course, have given consideration to the changes in York\u2019s municipal administration in January, 1970, as significantly bearing on that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">It may be noted that plaintiffs, on this appeal, agree that they had the burden below of showing a clear possibility that unlawful police activities will recur in the future in their application for in-junctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">On review of the record we cannot say that the District Court abused its discretion in failing to find a clear possibility of recurrence of unlawful police action.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-15\">For all the reasons stated, the Judgment of the District Court, filed March 31, 1970, dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint, will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-15\">. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b364-16\">. Hearings were held by the District Court August 6, 7, 8, 14; September 17; October 8 and 9, 1969. After 1346 pages of testimony were transcribed, oral arguments were heard by the District Court on December 19,1969 and its Opinion was filed March 31,1970.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\">.

Whether the police did so by deliberate design is open to doubt but that a pattern of unlawfulness was demonstrated by them to York Negroes cannot be doubted by me.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-18\">The defendants attempted to demonstrate that because of changes in personnel of the ruling authorities of York the attitude of the police toward York blacks was altered so substantially as to render the case moot and injunctive relief unnecessary. I cannot deem the changes effected to be that significant: nor could the Attorney General of Pennsylvania in office during the actual period of the criticized police activity, as appears from the \u201cBrief of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\u201d filed by him herein as <em>amicus curiae: </em>nor could the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission which suggested vital changes in police procedures as set out in its \u201cInvestigatory Hearing Report\u201d (attached to the brief of the Attorney General): nor could the \u201cBrief for Amici Curiae, N.A.A.C.P.
