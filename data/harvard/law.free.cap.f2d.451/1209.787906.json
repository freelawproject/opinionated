He was arrested in hot pursuit after the robbery, during which pursuit his confederate was killed. These facts were established by appellant\u2019s statement when his guilty plea was taken in full compliance with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. He is now serving a sentence of 15 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-23\">This is an appeal from denial without hearing of a motion to vacate sentence filed before the same Judge who took the plea of guilty and administered appellant\u2019s sentence. Appellant now contends that his guilty plea was involun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>tary because it was compelled by a confession which he alleges to have been coerced by unduly long detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">We find no exceptional circumstances alleged in this \u00a7 2255 motion which would have required the Judge who took this plea to have granted an evidentiary hearing. <em>See </em>McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
