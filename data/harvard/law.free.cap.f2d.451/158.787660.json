On January 20, 1970, Charles Bartlett, a postal employee engaged in delivering parcel post packages, returned to his truck after delivering a package and saw two men approaching. One put one hand on Bartlett\u2019s shoulder and Bartlett testified that he saw a shiny object in this person\u2019s other hand. On cross-examination he said he thought it was a knife. Bartlett\u2019s reaction was to sprajf some dog repellant on the man who touched him. Meanwhile, appellant was taking packages out of the mail truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-19\">Upon Bartlett\u2019s resistance, both men fled. Bartlett picked up a piece of pipe from the truck and pursued appellant who dropped three postal packages in his flight, but still did not get away. Bartlett caught and, in spite of some resistance, subdued appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-20\">Appellant was charged in a two-count indictment, 1) with aiding and abetting an assault on a mailman with intent to rob him, and with putting the life of a mailman in jeopardy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2114 (1964),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 2) with possession of stolen parcel post packages, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708 (1964). After jury trial he was convicted of Count 2 and the assault count stated in the first paragraph of Count 1, and was sentenced to five years on each count, with the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-21\"> We believe there is ample proof that appellant aided and abetted in an assault on a mailman. The fact that appellant\u2019s confederate put his hand on Bart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>lett\u2019s shoulder while having what appeared to Bartlett to be a knife in his other hand, is ample proof of assault. We find no necessary inconsistency between the jury finding of not guilty on the second paragraph of Count 1 concerning putting life in jeopardy and the guilty verdict against appellant on the first paragraph of Count 1. <em>See </em>Wells v. United States, 311 F.2d 409 (10th Cir. 1962). A conviction under Count 1 (second paragraph) would have required a sentence of 25 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-14\">. Count 1 of tlie indictment is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-15\">\u201c1. That on or about December 22, 1969, at Detroit, in the Eastern District of Michigan, Edward Brown, defendant herein, did knowingly and willfully aid and abet another person, unknown by name to the Grand Jury, to make an assault, by use of a dangerous weapon, on Charles Bartlett, a person having lawful charge, control and custody of United States Post Office truck, No. 450073, with intent to rob, steal and purloin mail matter, money and other property, to wit: three parcel post packages which were then part of the United States mail in the charge, control and custody of the said Charles Bartlett; in violation of Sections 2114 and 2(a), Title 18, United States Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-23\">\u201c2. That in attempting such robbery, Edward Brown, defendant herein', did knowingly and willfully aid and abet another person, unknown by name to the Grand Jury, to put the life of the said Charles Bartlett in jeopardy by the use of a dangerous weapon, to-wit, a knife; in violation of Sections 2114 and 2(a), Title 18, United States Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
