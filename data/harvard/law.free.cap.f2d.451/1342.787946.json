We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-15\">The uncontested facts are that appellants, on two occasions, held winning tickets to the \u201ctwin double\u201d at Yonkers Raceway, and procured the services of a third person to complete and sign a verification form required by the track before it would pay the proceeds of such tickets. This form was used by the track in compiling a United States Information Return (Form 1099) for the Internal Revenue Service, which could use the form to check on a taxpayer\u2019s income. Appellants were in essence charged with causing the falsification of this Form 1099. Their principal claims on appeal are that there was insufficient evidence of their intent, since there was no direct evidence that they knew of the use to which the verification forms would be put, and that the Forms 1099 were not false because they reflected the person to whom the track in fact paid the proceeds. As to the appellants\u2019 knowledge and intent, there was evidence that they were sophisticated gamblers, that they paid very large commissions to the \u201ccashers,\u201d and that the practice of hiring others to cash tickets in order to conceal income was widespread and well-known. From this the jury could easily infer that appellants must have known what they were doing and have intended to defraud the government. Our per <em>curiam </em>decisions in United States v. Kessler, 449 F.2d 1315 (2d Cir. 1971) and United States v. Hai-mowitz, 404 F.2d 38 (2d Cir. 1968), which upheld convictions for identical schemes, are helpful in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-21\">The contention that the form was not false because the track in fact paid the proceeds to the \u201ccashers\u201d is frivolous and requires no comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-22\">Appellants also urge reversal because of the excessive delay between the acts charged and the indictment. This contention must be rejected because appellants have not alleged or shown the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>requisite prejudice. See, e. <em>g., </em>United States v. Parrott, 425 F.2d 972 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 824, 91 S.Ct. 47, 27 L.Ed.2d 53 (1970).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1443-16\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(2) (1970) reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-18\">\u201cAny person who\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-19\">Willfully aids or assists in, or procures, counsels, or advises the preparation or presentation under, or in con-neetion with any matter arising under, the internal revenue laws, of a return, affidavit, claim, or other document, which is fraudulent or is false as to any material matter,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-24\">shall be guilty of a felony . . .</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
