The appeal must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">The district court entered a memorandum order denying the appellant\u2019s petition for habeas corpus on October 9, 1970. However, it was not until his motion for certificate of probable cause was received on January 22, 1971 that the court below was given any indication that the appellant desired to appeal that court\u2019s adverse judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">Rule 4(a), F.R.A.P., requires that notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 30 days from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed. This time period may be extended an additional 30 days \u201cupon a showing of excusable neglect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">Since the record in this case clearly shows that the appellant filed no notice of appeal, nor any document which might reasonably be construed as such until some 45 days beyond the maximum extended time period set forth in Rule 4 (a), this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. Dunn v. Henderson, 5th Cir. 1971, 446 F.2d 1398; Gann v. Smith, 5th Cir. 1971, 443 F.2d 352; Bean v. Wainwright, 5th Cir. 1971, 437 F.2d 112. We therefore dismiss this appeal without prejudice to the appellant\u2019s right to refile his habeas petition in the district court to obtain a final order from which he may prosecute a timely appeal. See Sanders v. United States, 1963, 373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148.</p>\n<p id=\"A48\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
