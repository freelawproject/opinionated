Plaintiff\u2019s action seeking Sherman Antitrust Act treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-22\">When rendering his decision the trial judge filed a comprehensive opinion reported at 316 F.Supp. 1321 (E.D.N.Y. 1970) in which he set forth his conclusions that plaintiff had failed to raise genuine issues as to the existence of any material fact entitling plaintiff to a trial. Even though this is an antitrust case we affirm the judgment below and do so substantially for the reasons and upon the reasoning contained in that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-23\">We recognize that a court should be extremely hesitant before it grants antitrust defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions and thereby deprives an antitrust plaintiff of a trial, see Poll-er v. Columbia Broadcasting System, 368 U.S. 464, 82 S.Ct. 486, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962); Radiant Burners, Inc. v. People\u2019s Gas Light &amp; Coke Company, 364 U.S. 656, 660, 81 S.Ct. 365, 5 L.Ed. 2d 358 (1961); and Klor\u2019s Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 79 S.Ct. 705, 3 L.Ed.2d 741 (1959). However, we believe it clear that here the trial judge acted quite properly in ruling against plaintiff inasmuch as the ruling was deferred until plaintiff had been given an opportunity to obtain additional evidence to support his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-24\">We are constrained to note that counsel for defendants-appellees did not file a brief or choose in any way to assist the court in the determination of the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
