He has sought relief from the parole violator\u2019s warrant which the Parole Board intends to execute upon expiration of his present sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">Appellant contended that it is improper for the Parole Board to delay his revocation hearing until expiration of the later sentence. As the district court held, there is clearly no merit to this contention. Cox v. Feld-Kamp, 5th Cir. 1971, 438 F.2d 1, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">In his reply brief, the appellant alleges that the parole violator\u2019s warrant actually was executed on April 1, 1971, without according him the hearing required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4207. We note that this allegation is refuted by an affidavit of a prison official, which is in the record. This affidavit, sworn to on May 14, 1971, states that the appellant \u201cwill be afforded a revocation hearing before the first Parole Board meeting <em>after the warrant has been executed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) We pretermit decision of this point, however, since it never has been presented to the district court for ruling. Hemming v. United States, 5th Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 11, 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-15\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
