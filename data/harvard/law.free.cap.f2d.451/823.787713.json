The Company argues that the Board\u2019s certification of the Union, which underlies the determination that the Company violated Sections 8(a) (1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159, by refusing to bargain, is invalid. The Union also petitions for review of the Board\u2019s order, on the ground that the Board abused its discretion in denying the Union a \u201cmake-whole\u201d remedy. Were it not for the Company\u2019s contention that the Board\u2019s failure to consider the \u201cwhole\u201d record vitiates the certification of the Union, this would be a routine representation election case presenting questions of the Board\u2019s discretion to regulate elections and the right to an administrative hearing. The disposition, nevertheless, is clear \u2014 we reject the positions of both the Company and the Union, deny their petitions and grant the Board\u2019s cross-petition for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-18\">Lipman Motors is a Hartford, Connecticut, automobile dealership. On February 26, 1970, the Board conducted a representation election in a unit comprised of the Company\u2019s mechanics, bodymen and service department., employees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Twenty-eight employees voted in favor of representation by the Union, nine voted against representation and one ballot was challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>The Company promptly filed objections to the election on the grounds that the Union had misrepresented to the employees that they would be eligible for a pension if the Union were elected, even if the Company failed to agree; and that the Union had conducted a poll prior to the election which unduly coerced the employees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After conducting an <em>ex parte </em>investigation of the election, <em>see </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(c), the Acting Regional Director filed his report recommending that the Board overrule the Company\u2019s objections. Thereupon, the Company reiterated its position in exceptions to the report filed with the Board. But the Board, finding that the exceptions \u201cdo not raise any substantial issues of fact or law which would require overruling the Regional Director\u2019s recommendations or the holding of a hearing,\u201d adopted his findings and certified the Union as the statutory bargaining representative of the employees without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Seeking to obtain judicial review of the Board\u2019s certification,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Company refused to bargain with the Union. A complaint issued charging the Company with unfair labor practices in contravention of Section 8(a) (1) and (5), and the Board, invoking its \u201crule against re-litigation\u201d in again refusing to grant a hearing, entered summary judgment against the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">The Company claims that the Board should have invalidated the election because of Union misrepresentations, citing the well-established standard of Hollywood Ceramics Company, 140 NLRB 221, 224 (1962).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree. Hollywood Ceramics, recently approved by us in Bausch &amp; Lomb, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 451 F.2d 873 (2 Cir. 1971), is an outgrowth of the Board\u2019s policy of regulating pre-election campaigns to ensure that representation elections are conducted under \u201claboratory conditions\u201d and that employees exercise a free and informed choice. <em>See </em>General Shoe Corporation, 77 NLRB 124 (1948). The Company, from the time of its initial objections to the election, consistently has maintained that the Union misled the employees into believing that they would be eligible for the Union\u2019s standard pension plan without the Company\u2019s agreement if the Union were elected. Although the Regional Director found on the basis of conflicting evidence that there was no such misrepresentation, he also found, and the Company admits<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that management was aw.are__ojL the Union statements a full week before the election. In the circumstances of this dispute, this finding is -decisive of the Company\u2019^ .claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">One of the important elements of the <em>Hollywood Ceramics </em>test is that the misrepresentation occur \u201cat a time which prevents jhe other party or~parties from making an effective reply.\u201d That one week was sufficient time for the Company to merely inform the employees that any benefits promised by the Union were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>indeed contingent upon the Company\u2019s agreement during collective bargaining seems to us to be self-evident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Accordingly, we need not tarry over whether the Acting Regional Director\u2019s finding, later adopted by the Board, that there was no misrepresentation is supported by substantial evidence or, if there was a misrepresentation, whether it would come within the <em>Hollywood Ceramics\u2019 </em>test of materiality. <em>See </em>Bausch &amp; Lomb, <em>supra, </em>at 146-150.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">The Company\u2019s second challenge to the certification is grounded on events at a Union meeting held on February 24, two nights before the election. These events are best described by the findings of the Acting Regional Director:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-7\">* * * Near the end of the meeting, and prior to Union Agent Harold Big-ing\u2019s calling for nominations for an observor at the Board election, Biging asked if anyone wanted to say anything, express an opinion, or speak for the Company or the Union. There was no reply. He then asked, \u201cIs there anyone now who feels he can\u2019t vote for the Union? If there is let him speak up.\u201d There was a slight pause and someone in the group shouted \u201c* * * Let\u2019s see who\u2019s for it.\u201d At that point just about everyone present raised his hand, and there were a few shouts of enthusiasm. There was no count taken, no tally was drawn and no ballots were used. It is clear that the show of hands was in response to the \u201c * * * Let\u2019s see who\u2019s for it\u201d stimulus from the floor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">The Company argues that this \u201cpoll\u201d requires us to set aside the election, citing Offner Electronics, Inc., 127 NLRB 991, 992 (1960). In <em>Offner </em>the Board set aside an election where the employer had conducted a secret-ballot straw poll prior to the election. The opinion included the following broad language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-14\">* * * after the Board directs a representation election, or the parties agree to a Board-conducted election, the responsibility to conduct a secret ballot election for the resolution of the question concerning representation rests solely with the Board, and any secret balloting or polling of the employees on the representation issue by the parties, or by others on a party\u2019s behalf * * * may be used by an innocent party as a basis for setting aside the Board election.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-15\">We do not agree that <em>Offner </em>is apposite to this case, but in concluding as we do, we neither approve nor disapprove the Board\u2019s current position that the rationale of <em>Offner </em>applies only to employer-conducted polls.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-16\">The spontaneous show of hands \u201cin response to the \u2018 * * * Let\u2019s see who\u2019s for it\u2019 stimulus from the floor,\u201d a bit reminiscent of the college rally on the eve of the big game, is hardly conduct which \u201crendered employee free choice impossible.\u201d <em>See Offner Electronics </em>at 992. The employees here were not confronted with the pressure of a formal straw poll, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>conducted by the Union representative, with the ayes and nays carefully recorded. We cannot say that the Board abused its discretion in determining that the Union meeting did not interfere with \u201claboratory conditions.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Our conclusion, of course, is based upon the assumption that the Acting Regional Director\u2019s description of the events in question is factually correct. Normally we would inquire whether his findings, adopted by the Board, were supported by substantial evidence. But, when none of the parties raises a substantial and material factual issue in its objections to the Regional Director\u2019s report, the Board, without a hearing may adopt those findings, and those findings are then conclusive on the reviewing court. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.62(e).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">The Company claims, however, that there were substantial and material factual issues which entitled it to a hearing, either before the Board certified the Union or before it entered its unfair labor practice order in summary fashion. In its exceptions to the Acting Regional Director\u2019s Report, the Company alleged that both employer and employee affidavits submitted to the Acting Regional Director established that the Union had misrepresented the conditions relating to pension plan coverage. The Company also alleged that the Union solicited the showing of hands and compelled \u201cthe employees present to publicly divulge what their vote would be. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">A hearing is not required, however, \u201cunless by <em>prima facie </em>evidence the moving party presents substantial and material factual issues which, if resolved in its favor, would warrant setting aside the election. * * * \u201d Polymers, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 414 F.2d 999 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1010, 90 S.Ct. 570, 24 L.Ed.2d 502 (1970). Conclusory allegations questioning the ultimate findings of the regional director are not sufficient. <em>See also </em>N. L. R. B. v. Tennessee Packers, Inc., 379 F.2d 172, 178 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 958, 88 S.Ct. 338, 19 L.Ed.2d 364 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">The Company\u2019s claim for a hearing on the misrepresentation issue is clearly ill-founded. This is an instance where the alleged factual dispute, centering as it does on what was said and not on when it was said or when the Company learned of the statements, would not warrant setting the election aside even if the dispute were resolved in the Company\u2019s favor. As we have set forth in our earlier discussion, timing, which here works against the Company, is an essential element of the <em>Hollywood Ceramics </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-16\">Nor is the Company entitled to a hearing on the polling issue. Its bald assertion that the Union conducted the poll is not supported by any specific factual allegations controverting the Acting Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>gional Director\u2019s findings which would lead us to believe the show of hands was not spontaneous. For example, the Company does not charge that the Union, according to a preconceived design, had planted the employee who yelled \u201cLet\u2019s see who\u2019s for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Finally, there is no merit to the Company\u2019s claim that the Board\u2019s \u201crule against relitigation\u201d deprived it of due process. In an unfair labor practice proceeding based upon a refusal to bargain, the Board is required to reopen the question of certification only when the party requesting the hearing presents newly discovered evidence. <em>See, e. g., </em>Polymers, Inc., <em>supra, </em>at 1005; Tennessee Packers, Inc., <em>supra, </em>at 179-180. This rule, which is essential to the orderly settlement of labor disputes and the prevention of costly procedural delays, is not dependent upon a prior hearing, but only on the prior opportunity to present any evidence which might require a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">The Company argues vociferously that the record before the Board and this court is incomplete. The Acting Regional Director in his report relied on several employees\u2019 affidavits. These affidavits were not before the Board when it reviewed the report. Accordingly, the Company argues, the Board could not have reviewed the \u201centire record\u201d as it claimed, and the certification must be vacated. We do not share the Company\u2019s views.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">Section 102.69(f) of the Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-8\">The notice of hearing, motions, rulings, orders, stenographic report of the hearing, stipulations, exceptions, documentary evidence, all of which, together with the objections to the conduct of the election or conduct affeet-ing the results of the election, any report on such objections, any report on challenged ballots, exceptions to any such report, any briefs or other documents submitted by the parties, the decision of the regional director, if any, and the record previously made as described in \u00a7 102.68, shall constitute the record in the case. Immediately upon issuance of a report on \u00a1objections or challenges, or both, upon issuance by the regional director of an order transferring the case to the Board, or upon issuance of an order granting a request for review by the Board, the regional director shall transmit the record to the Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">Although the Board has stated that a rather similar definition of the record in \u00a7 102.68 does not include affidavits such as those in issue here, LTV Electrosys-tems, Inc., 166 NLRB 938 n. 2 (1967), <em>enforced, </em>388 F.2d 683 (4th Cir. 1968), we are not required to consider this interpretation or resolve the procedural question the Company raises. What is decisive here is that the Company\u2019s exceptions, even viewed in the light most favorable to it, do not warrant setting aside the election.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-13\">We are left only with the Union\u2019s claim that the Board abused its discretion in denying a \u201cmake-whole\u201d remedy. When the Union moved for summary judgment upon the complaint charging the Company with unfair labor practices, it requested that the Board in addition to the traditional bargaining order (1) grant the employees compensatory damages for the monetary losses suffered as a result of the Company\u2019s refusal to bargain and (2) require the employees to be assembled to hear an explanation by the General Counsel of the Board and the Union concerning the Company\u2019s violations. The Board denied this request and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>issued its traditional order requiring the Company to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices, to bargain with the Union upon request and to post appropriate notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">It is now axiomatic that the Board has broad discretion in fashioning an affirmative remedy under Section 10 (c) to \u201ceffectuate the policies of the Act.\u201d <em>See, e. g., </em>N. L. R. B. v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 612 n. 32, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969); Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 379 U.S. 203, 216, 85 S.Ct. 398, 13 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964). Recently this Court upheld the Board\u2019s refusal to grant monetary damages, noting that \u201c[t]he award of monetary relief for an employer\u2019s failure to bargain is an unusual remedy which has been used very sparingly by the Board.\u201d Herald Company v. N. L. R. B., 444 F.2d 430, 436-437 (2d Cir. 1971). The Company pursued the only procedural course available to secure judicial review of the Board certification. This commonplace attack on the Board\u2019s decision certainly does not warrant a direction by us to the Board to undertake the speculative adventure of fixing damages by \"\u2018determining\u201d whether the parties would have reached an agreement if they had bargained in good faith and what the terms of that hypothetical agreement would have been.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">The Union in its brief has not asked the Court to require the Board to amend its order to provide for the requested meeting of employees. But we note that in the past this relief also has been limited to undoing the effect of egregious unfair labor practices. <em>See, e. g., </em>J. P. Stevens &amp; Co. v. N. L. R. B., 380 F.2d 292, 305 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 1005, 88 S.Ct. 564, 19 L.Ed.2d 600 (1967). Here too, the Board did not exceed its broad discretion in denying the Union\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Petitions for review denied; order enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-13\">. The Company and the Union, with the approval of the Acting Regional Director, entered into a \u201cStipulation for Certifieation Upon Consent Election.\u201d This stipulation waives all objections to the holding of the election or the composition of the bargaining unit, but does not affect the Board\u2019s post election procedures. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.62(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b925-11\">. Although in form the Company listed three objections, the last objection was merely a conclusory statement based upon factual allegations in the first two.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b925-12\">. The only procedure to obtain judicial review of a Board order certifying a statutory bargaining representative is to invite an unfair labor practice charge by refusing to bargain. The certification and the record of the Regional Director\u2019s investigation are included in the transcript of the entire record reviewed by the court which reviews the unfair labor practice order. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 160(e), 159(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b925-13\">. \u201cWe believe that an election should be set aside only where there has been a misrepresentation or other similar campaign trickery, which involves a substantial departure from the truth, at a time which prevents the other party from making an effective reply, so that the misrepresentation, whether deliberate or not, may reasonably be expected to have a significant impact on the election. (Footnote omitted.)\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b925-16\">. Harvey Lipman, the Company Vice President, admitted in an affidavit filed with the Acting Regional Director that an employee had informed him of the Union statements approximately one week before the election.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b926-10\">. The Company argues in its brief that there was insufficient time to reply because \u201c[t]he pension plan involved the Laundry Workers Union and existed, if at all, in an industry totally unrelated to that of the Employer here.\u201d But it was not \u25a0 necessary for the Company to confirm all the details of the Union\u2019s plan before it replied.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">The Company also argues that the alleged misstatements were repeated at a Union meeting just two days prior to the election. Even if two days were not sufficient time to reply to this latter statement, our conclusion that the Company could and should have replied to the prior Union statements would not be affected. We note, moreover, that the Company, which had ready access to the thirty-eight employees at a moment\u2019s notice and did not have to do any research to refute the alleged position of the Union, easily could have replied within the intervening forty-eight hours. <em>Compare </em>Bausch &amp; Lomb, <em>supra, </em>at 876.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b926-18\">. Because the union ordinarily does not have the power of the sword or purse, there is some merit to the Board\u2019s argument that a union poll may not be as coercive as an employer poll. But it does not necessarily follow that the Board should tolerate any deliberate coercion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b927-8\">. Assuming the existence of substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s factual determinations, abuse of discretion is the proper standard for reviewing a Board decision to validate or set aside an election. <em>See, e. g., </em>Bausch &amp; Lomb, <em>supra, </em>at 877 n. 6; Follett Corp. v. N.L.R.B. 397 F.2d 91, 94-95 (7th Cir. 1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b927-10\">. Section 102.69(e) of the Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(e), in relevant part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-11\">* * * if exceptions are filed, either to the report on challenged ballots or objections, or both if it be a consolidated report, and it appears to the Board that such exceptions do not raise substantial and material issues with respect to the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMP\">conduct or results of the election, the Board may decide the matter forthwith upon the record. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-17\">Section 10(e) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160 (e), in relevant part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-18\">No objection that has not been urged before the Board * * * shall be considered by the court, * * *. The findings of the Board with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"acm-dedup-1\">Whether one characterizes the Company\u2019s conclusory allegations as \u201cno objection\u201d or as raising no material factual issues, the findings adopted by the Board are conclusive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b928-9\">. We note that if the Company had been afforded a hearing, Section 102.118(b) of the Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations requires the written statements of witnesses in a postelection hearing to be produced for the purpose of cross-examination. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.118(b).
