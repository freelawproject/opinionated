We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-5\">The board\u2019s opinion, including reproductions of the marks involved, has been published in its entirety, and we have little to add to it. Appellant concedes appellee\u2019s priority and that the goods of the parties (household bleach, so far as relevant) \u201care in part nearly identical * * Thus the only question is whether, as applied to such goods, the marks so nearly resemble each other as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-7\">Both marks include as prominent parts thereof uplifted left hands and forearms in the identical supporting posture. Obviously, there are differences in the two marks. Appellant\u2019s mark is of a masculine hand and forearm, whereas appellee\u2019s mark is of a feminine hand and forearm, and there is a heavy, allegedly masculine bracelet on the forearm in appellant\u2019s mark but no bracelet on the forearm in appellee\u2019s mark. There is also an octagon imprinted with the word PUREX supported by the hand in appellee\u2019s mark but no such element in appellant\u2019s mark as <em>depicted in its application</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, we agree with the board that \u201can average purchaser [at least of low-cost, shelf goods such as those involved here] is not likely to remember symbol marks in their specific details,\u201d cf. Columbian Steel Tank Co. v. Union Tank and Supply Co., 47 C.C.P.A. 898, 277 F.2d 192 (1960), and we also agree that, in view of the identity of posture of the hands in the parties\u2019 marks and of the absence of reason for the purchasing public to suppose that the parties\u2019 goods actually emanate from different sources, \u201cpurchasers thereof might well assume that the involved products all come from a common source.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-10\">Since we find no error in the board\u2019s reasoning or decision after full consideration of the arguments, the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1502-8\">. The Petition of Appeal states that the preliminaries for this appeal were taken \u201cpursuant to Section 1071, Title 15, United States Code and Section 142, Title 35, United States Code.\u201d The latter section pertains to appeals to this court in patent cases, not trademark cases. The trademark provision corresponding to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 142 is 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(a) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1502-21\">. As indicated in the board\u2019s opinion, appellant\u2019s design mark here involved is apparently actually used on its packages in conjunction with a \u201cburst\u201d containing its wordmark ACTION in a fashion very similar to appellee\u2019s entire mark.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
