The \u201cStatement of Affairs\u201d annexed to appellant\u2019s petition in bankruptcy failed to disclose any interest of his in \u201cD\u201d Concrete Construction Corporation, and appellant\u2019s subsequent affidavit denied any interest in \u201cD\u201d Construction Corporation. In fact, for two years appellant had had a 50 per cent interest in, and had been president of, \u201cD\u201d Concrete Construction Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-22\">The evidence plainly supported the conviction. With respect to the count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>for failure to disclose, appellant claimed a loss of memory because the \u201cD\u201d Concrete Construction Corporation had been out of business for two years before the \u201cStatement of Affairs\u201d was filed. Appellant had, however, listed on his statement the Elite Construction Corporation, another defunct company which had transferred certain assets to \u201cD,\u201d indicating a clear awareness on his part of the necessity of listing defunct corporations in which'he had interests. In respect to the affidavit count appellant claimed that his affidavit was true in that the interest he had had was really in \u201cD\u201d <em>Concrete </em>Construction Corporation, <em>i. e., </em>that there was no \u201cD\u201d <em>Construction </em>Corporation. But in the very affidavit in which he swore that he had had no interest in \u201cD\u201d Construction Corporation (or another corporation, not relevant here) appellant also said, \u201cThe principal officer, stockholder and director of both of the aforesaid corporations is my brother Thomas Diorio. * * * \u201d Since there never was a \u201cD\u201d Construction Corporation, the jury was entitled to believe \u2014 as the Government argued \u2014 that if appellant thought his brother was an officer and stockholder in \u201cD\u201d Construction Corporation, he must also have thought that the name stood for \u201cD\u201d <em>Concrete </em>Construction Corporation (perhaps as a result of a mistake on the part of his attorney, who prepared the affidavit while appellant was in Puerto Rico). Thus, his statement that he had no interest in the corporation was correctly labeled false by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Proof of later similar acts in the nature of falsely denying his interest in other companies was admissible against appellant, in the trial court\u2019s discretion, for the limited purpose of showing his willful intent and motive. Metheany v. United States, 390 F.2d 559, 563 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 824, 89 S.Ct. 81, 21 L.Ed.2d 94 (1968); United States v. Knohl, 379 F.2d 427, 438-439 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 973, 88 S.Ct. 472, 19 L.Ed.2d 465 (1967); United States v. Blount, 229 F.2d 669, 671-672 (2d Cir. 1956); <em>see </em>2 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 302, 340, 371 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The court\u2019s charge regarding appellant\u2019s recantation simply left to the jury the question whether the recantation was \u201cprompted by an honest discovery of an earlier mistake\u201d on the one hand or, on the other hand, \u201cby the realization that the jig was up and that the falsity had already been uncovered or was about to be uncovered by others.\u201d This charge was proper in light of evidence that the Referee had asked appellant\u2019s attorney to submit the affidavit and a year later had asked appellant to appear for further interrogation, at which time disclosure of appellant\u2019s half ownership was made. Because a recantation does not in and of itself cure an original false statement under oath, United States v. Norris, 300 U.S. 564, 573, 57 S.Ct. 535, 81 L.Ed. 808 (1936), the court necessarily had to explain the possible inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The court\u2019s charge, in accordance with defendant\u2019s request to instruct the jury that \u201cfraudulently\u201d means with intent to deceive, was clearly not \u201cplain error\u201d within Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). In re Slocum, 22 F.2d 282, 285 (2d Cir. 1927); <em>cf. </em>Morris Plan Indus. Bank v. Finn, 149 F.2d 591, 592 (2d Cir. 1945). The materiality of a statement concerning the possible assets of a voluntary bankrupt is obvious. Metheany v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Appellant did not maintain on oral argument or incorporate as an argument in his brief the allegation, made in the brief\u2019s \u201cStatement of the Case,\u201d that, because the trial court had upheld a creditor\u2019s objections to appellant\u2019s discharge in the civil bankruptcy proceeding, it had \u201cprejudged\u201d the criminal case. Appellant\u2019s motion to disqualify was made under the gun of immediate trial by counsel who had been in the case for four months. The civil case was In re Diorio, 297 F.Supp. 842 (S.D. N.Y.1968), a decision upheld by this court in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion referring to the trial court\u2019s opinion as \u201ctemper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>ate.\u201d Diorio v. Kreisler-Borg Construction Co., 407 F.2d 1330 (2d Cir. 1969). No affidavit alleging bias or prejudice was filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144, and there is no indication that the issue was seriously pressed below; nevertheless we note that a trial judge is equally obligated <em>not </em>to recuse himself when the facts do not give fair support to a charge of prejudgment, as he is to excuse himself when the facts warrant such action. United States v. Tropiano, 418 F.2d 1069, 1077 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1021, 90 S.Ct. 1258, 25 L.Ed.2d 530 (1970) (trial judge\u2019s presiding at bail hearing where defendants\u2019 criminal records disclosed no grounds for disqualification). A diligent search of the record and transcript fails to reveal any indication of any bias or prejudice demonstrated by the trial judge, which perhaps explains why the issue was to all intents and purposes abandoned in this court, if not below as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
