BRYAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">A warrant directed to an FBI agent for a search of the garage and basement of appellant Eugene H. Roman\u2019s home in Wheeling, West Virginia for a stolen automobile was quashed, and the car seized under the warrant was rejected as proof in the prosecution of Roman for interstate auto theft under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2313. The ruling followed from the conclusion that the FBI agent\u2019s affidavit for the warrant, when judged under the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement of \u201cprobable cause\u201d, was insufficient to support the writ. We see the warrant as adequately grounded and vacate its dismissal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-13\">The affidavit as pertinent reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-14\">\u201cThe undersigned being duly sworn deposes and says:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-15\">\u201cThat he has reason to believe that on the premises known as the garage and basement of a two-story frame house located at 889 Ivy Avenue, Wheeling, Ohio County, West Virginia, in the Northern Judicial District of West Virginia, there is now being concealed a certain property, namely, a 1970 Chevrolet automobile, VIN 1363-70A119308, reportedly stolen from James Bertuca, 4713 Hatfield Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which is property constituting evidence of a federal crime, namely violation of Title 18, Section 2313, United States Code. \u201cAnd that the facts tending to establish the foregoing grounds for issuance of a Search Warrant are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-16\">\u201cThe aforesaid 1970 Chevrolet automobile, VIN 136370A119308, was reported stolen in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on or about March 17 or 18, 1970.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-17\">\u201cIn July, 1970, a responsible citizen reported to an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Cincinnati office, that one Gene Roman endeavored to obtain an Ohio Certificate of Title for the 1970 Chevrolet automobile, VIN 136370A119308, reported stolen as stated aforesaid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-18\">\u201cAn officer of the Police Department of the City of Wheeling, Ohio County, West Virginia, reported that he saw the back end of a 1970 Chevro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>let automobile in the garage of the house located at 889 Ivy Avenue, Wheeling, West Virginia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">\u201cThe Wheeling City Directory lists that Eugene H. Roman is a resident of the premises situated at 889 Ivy Avenue, Wheeling, West Virginia.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The Fourth Amendment\u2019s exactions of the affidavit for a search warrant are set forth precisely in Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed. 2d 723 (1964). Cf. United States v. Ross, 424 F.2d 1016 (4 Cir. 1970). When based solely on the hearsay report of an unidentified informant, the affidavit must under the tenets of <em>Aguilar </em>recite \u201csome of the underlying circumstances from which the officer concluded that the informant * * * was \u2018credible\u2019 or his information \u2018reliable\u2019 \u201d, 378 U.S. at 114, 84 S.Ct. at 1514. See also United States v. Harris, 403 U.S. 573, 91 S.Ct. 2075, 29 L.Ed.2d 723 (1971); Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Presently the United States concedes that the affidavit\u2019s <em>form </em>does not \u201cmeet the <em>Aguilar </em>standard\u201d in that it fails to supply the grounds for the veracity accorded the informer. Nonetheless, it vigorously emphasizes that the very circumstances detailed in the affidavit inherently give credence to belief in Roman\u2019s guilt. See Spinelli v. United States, supra, 393 U.S. at 415, 89 S.Ct. 584. To us this is the inescapable impartation of the affidavit \u2014 its very essence. In sum, the internal content of the affidavit intrinsically proves the truth of the \u201cresponsible\u201d citizen\u2019s word.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Notably, informant\u2019s report to the agent about application for the car\u2019s titling described the vehicle by the precise engine number. He would not have had this information without intimate knowledge of the application document \u2014 a fact which forcefully enhances the probity of the affidavit. Significance of the informer\u2019s knowledge of the car number is questioned by Roman in that the informer could have been the same person who reported the car\u2019s larceny. He would, the argument continues, of course know the number. But this is only the appellee\u2019s guess; the record does not establish the surmised duplication of identity, and nothing in the affidavit warrants an inference of this nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Adding the final imprimatur of believability to the citizen\u2019s disclosure is the affidavit\u2019s advertence to the Wheeling policeman\u2019s report that he saw \u201cthe back end of a 1970 Chevrolet automobile in [Roman\u2019s] garage\u201d. This was the fruit of police vigilance. The trustworthiness of the citizen\u2019s tip is further underwritten by independent official verification of the <em>fact </em>of a crime, the theft of a car explicitly identified. Finally, the agent\u2019s own knowledge and assessment of the reliability of his source of information is not without significance. United States v. Harris, 403 U.S. 573, 91 S.Ct. 2075, 29 L.Ed.2d 723 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">The lesson of United States v. Ven-tresca, 380 U.S. 102, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965) is instructive here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-13\">\u201c[T]he Fourth Amendment\u2019s commands, like all constitutional requirements, are practical and not abstract. If the teachings of the Court\u2019s cases are to be followed and the constitutional policy served, affidavits for search warrants * * * must be tested and interpreted * * * in a commonsense and realistic fashion. They are normally drafted by nonlawyers in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation. Technical requirements of elaborate specificity once exacted under common law pleadings have no proper place in this area. A grudging or negative attitude by reviewing courts towards warrants will tend to discourage police officers from submitting their evidence to a judicial officer before acting.\u201d 380 U.S. at 108, 85 S.Ct. at 746.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-15\">In fine, of course, we recognize that the ipse dixit of the agent as to the informant\u2019s responsibility is not alone sufficient for the issuance of the warrant. But here the information embraced more than the informer\u2019s words denoted. It bears characteristics of its truth. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>proves its own integrity, aside from the agent\u2019s appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">We reverse the order discharging the warrant and discarding the evidence it brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
