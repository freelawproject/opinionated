The commissioner has done so in an opinion and report filed on January 14, 1971, wherein such facts as are necessary to the opinion are set forth. A request for review by the court was filed by defendant and the ease has been submitted to the court on the briefs of the parties and oral argument of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Since the court is in agreement with the opinion and recommendations of the commissioner, with modifications by the court, it hereby adopts the same, as modified, as the basis for its judgment in this case as hereinafter set forth. Therefore, the cross-motions of the parties are allowed in part and denied in part as set forth in the \u201cConclusions of Law\u201d hereto, with judgment entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Commissioner Spector\u2019s opinion, as modified by the court, is as follows: The petition herein sets forth four causes of action based on contract. Each seeks judicial review of adverse decisions (ENGBCA Nos. 2785, 2786, 2787, and 2788, 67-2 BCA ,f[ 6516) of the Department of the Army Corps of Engineers Board of Contract Appeals on contractor\u2019s four separate appeals filed under the standard \u201cDisputes\u201d clause contained in the contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">By contract dated February 23, 1962, Cosmo Construction Company (hereinafter for convenience \u201cplaintiff\u201d or \u201cCosmo\u201d), undertook the construction of \u201cflood protection works\u201d for the United States acting through its Army Corps of Engineers, along the Kansas River and Shunganunga Creek near Topeka, Kansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">A more detailed description of the work reads: \u201cconstruction of channel, pumping plant, drainage structures, relief wells, piezometers, and levee embankment, which includes, clearing and grubbing, stone slope protection, surfacing of levee crown, and seeding * It is a fixed price contract consisting of a unit price schedule of 63 items listing estimated quantities and unit prices. The total estimated contract price at time of award was $2,268,565.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">The contract was to be completed within 700 days of a notice to proceed received on March 23, 1962, and this has been extended by 57 days for changes ordered by defendant, and an additional 144 days for delays acknowledged by defendant to be excusable. The work was completed and accepted by defendant on January 19, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\"><em>First Cause of Action, </em>\u2014 The <em>Changed Conditions Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-17\">In a claim letter of July 29, 1965, setting forth a number of disputed items which arose during prosecution of the work, plaintiff summarized his claim of \u201cChanged Conditions\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> encountered \u201cin the excavation area from station -(1+75) to station 85+00.\u201d The letter stated that the contract plans indicated that substantially all the material excavated from the area in question would be suitable for use in the planned embankments either adjacent to the point of excavation or within a minimum haul distance therefrom. This was the basis for plaintiff\u2019s bid, and was discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>with the Government\u2019s representatives. In contrast \u201call or substantially all of the excavated material was determined to be not satisfactory for embankments by the authorized representative of the Contracting Officer and placement of the material in waste areas was directed. The placement of the excavated material in waste areas resulted in a much longer haul and greatly increased the cost of performing the excavation and disposal over what would have been experienced had the material been satisfactory as indicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Plaintiff also alleged that its inability to use excavated material for embankment required it to obtain new material from borrow pits located some distance away. All of these circumstances greatly increased the cost of this phase of the work, and plaintiff presented an exhibit showing overhaul of 65,483 yard-miles from excavation area to waste area, and overhaul of 336,000 yard-miles in transporting new material from borrow pits to embankment, plus the cost of 250,108 cubic yards of borrow material. The total claim alleged was in the amount of $216,236.07, with the related time adjustment claim to be held in abeyance, pending determination of other time adjustment claims to be later discussed. <em>(See </em>Fourth Cause of Action, <em>infra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">On June 17, 1966, the contracting officer denied the claim on the grounds \u201cthat the Government lacked timely notice, actual or constructive, of the asserted changed conditions except at station 75 + 00, and that the Government has been prejudiced by your failure to give the required timely notice.\u201d He continued: \u201cI have not considered the merits of the claim, except as it pertains to conditions in the vicinity of station 75 + 00. This decision is not to be construed as a denial of the claim on its merits except as to the conditions in the vicinity of station 75 + 00.\u201d His adverse decision was duly appealed to the Chief of Engineers who is represented in these matters by a Board of Contract Appeals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">On appeal, the board observed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">Prior to hearing, the Government moved that we first hear and determine the question of lack of notice before hearing the dispute on its merits. We declined to do so because our review of the file convinced us that we would have to take extensive evidence as to the nature of the claim in order to resolve the notice question and that as a practical matter we should take evidence <em>on the merits of the claim </em>even though we might not reach that issue. The hearing <em>was conducted on that basis. We did not hear the question of quantum, </em>but of course we did receive evidence on quantities of suitable, wasted and wet materials anticipated and encountered since they have a bearing <em>on whether or not there was a changed condition. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">The foregoing is quoted with appropriate emphasis because it illustrates what this dispute is all about. It is, of' course, customary to hear a case such as this on the merits <em>(i. e., </em>the issue of liability), separate and apart from and prior to the issue of quantum, because the latter issue may be rendered academic if liability is not found to exist. If, on the other hand, liability is found, the issue of quantum is thereafter examined by less formal procedures. Our Rule 131(c) \u201cSeparate Determination of Liability,\u201d for example, typifies that customary practice when a trial is conducted in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">Of course, evidence on damages or quantum is not totally excluded, because there must be <em>some </em>evidence of damage to support a finding on liability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But that limited evidence on damages is not of the quantity, quality, or precision necessary to support a judgment in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>precise sum; it is only sufficient to demonstrate that the issue of liability is not purely academic; that some damage has been incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">That customary course of procedure is clearly programmed in the above quoted portion of the board\u2019s opinion. Unfortunately, it was not followed in the remainder of the decision. Plaintiff alleges that it was lulled into presenting only that minimal evidence on quantum sufficient to show that there was in fact a changed condition. But thereafter it received from the board a precise decision on quantum, a decision which is, in plaintiff\u2019s view, woefully insufficient and contrary to the evidence on quantum which it presented, and to the detailed evidence it could have presented, had it been aware that quantum was at issue. Moreover, and alternatively, it alleges that the board\u2019s determination on quantum was therefore based, quite naturally, on insubstantial evidence. It therefore constitutes a determination not entitled to finality, and one which should be overturned on this judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint is valid, and its validity is illustrated by the remainder of the board\u2019s own opinion. In pertinent part, it found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">* * * The contract drawings depict logs of 26 core borings in the claim area. Twelve of these are below Station 35 + 00 and all of these show clearly that this is an area that has been filled in by the dumping of various types of debris. A boring at Station 39 + 84 indicates a layer of asphalt just below the surface. <em>None of the other borings from this through Station 80 </em>+ <em>00 give any indication of debris. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">There follows an extended discussion of where debris could have been anticipated, and where it could not have been foreseen, and a discussion of the extent to which the Government was put on notice or prejudiced by lack of notice of the plaintiff's alleged difficulties, following which the board expressed this ultimate conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">The Government witnesses flatly denied that they had been given oral notice that appellant was contending that there was a changed condition at any place other than the vicinity of Station 75. We believe them. We also believe that appellant exaggerates the quantity of debris encountered between Stations 43 + 40 and 75 + 00 when its witnesses testified that practically all of that material was debris. One of its own officers mentioned a lens of debris. Obviously if all the material were debris, such a description would be inappropriate. Also, Government witnesses were able to ascertain from records made contemporaneously that 108,667 yards of material excavated between Stations 43 + 40 and 85 + 00 was used for embankment and only 72,656 yards wasted. Their <em>recollection </em>was that 13,131 of the latter quantity had to be wasted because it contained debris. The rest was wasted because it was too wet to use. Their testimony is that even some of the material containing debris was too wet for use and would probably have been wasted for that reason even if it did not contain debris. Appellant presents us with absolutely no quantity figures concerning the excavated material. Apparently no records were kept. We find this hard to reconcile with a claim that practically all this material was unsuitable because it contained debris.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-10\">* -X- -X- * -X- -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-11\"><em>We find no merit in the Government\u2019s contention that failure of notice prejudiced it in the sense that it was deprived of the opportunity to take remedial action. </em>None of its witnesses told us and we can not think on our own what remedial action might have been feasible. We do think that failure of notice has somewhat prejudiced the Government\u2019s ability to document conditions and be prepared to defend against the present claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Nevertheless, the Government has been able to establish from its records, <em>and we accept as a fact, that 13,131 yards of material excavated between Stations 43 +40 and 85 </em>+ <em>00 was unsuitable because it contained debris. </em>If we found, <em>as we do, </em>that this constituted a changed condition, <em>appellants should be compensated therefore.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">A study of the subsurface information by a prospective bidder would lead him to believe that the area between Stations \u20141+75 and 43+40 had been filled in with debris and that the material he would excavate from there would have to be wasted. The drawing information was reinforced by the specifications which said as much. <em>But the information is different for the area between 43+40 and 80+00. None of the borings taken in that area indicate that debris had been dumped there. The borings show natural ground. Also, the specifications which made it clear that the materials excavated between 00+00 and 43+40 was to be wasted were silent with respect to the claim area. A bidder would be justified in drawing a negative inference therefrom. </em>Nor do we think that a site investigation would have led a prospective bidder to conclude that he would encounter lenses of debris under ground. A few bottles and cans on the surface would tell nothing as to what would be found when the earth was excavated. Nor do we think it signifcant that only one of the borings was in the actual excavation. <em>The borings, all taken together, draw a picture of the general area and that picture here is one of natural ground, not lenses of debris.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\"><em>The encountering of lenses of debris between Stations 43+40 and 80+00 constituted a changed condition calling for \u25a0 an adjustment of the contract. </em>The Government witnesses testified that some portion <em>of the 13,131 yards of materials containing debris </em>was so wet that it would have been wasted anyway. <em>That material should be deducted </em>in assessing the impact of the changed condition. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">In net effect, the board found for plaintiff on the issue of liability and agreed that \u201cchanged conditions\u201d had been encountered. On the Government\u2019s motion, it followed the usual practice of deferring the issue of quantum, and expressly so stated. But then it nevertheless made a determination on quantum, moreover, offering guidelines for computing deductions from that quantum determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">Let there be no mistake that the finding that \u201c13,131 yards of material * * was unsuitable because it contained debris\u201d did in fact constitute a determination on quantum. The translation of that precise yardage finding into dollars, is relatively mechanical. Additionally, the direction to deduct wet material, deprived plaintiff of the opportunity of proving that it could have utilized wet material had it not been debris laden.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">The decision on quantum was, therefore, a nullity. By reason of the rule in United States v. Carlo Bianchi &amp; Co.,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> plaintiff is not privileged to have that issue tried in this court; but that rule presupposes a hearing by the contracting agency<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> decision based on that hearing, and a review by the court of that decision measured against the hearing record. Here that record, limited to such minimal evidence on quantum as would in the board\u2019s words \u201chave a bearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>whether or not there was a changed condition,\u201d is both defective and inadequate to support any precise finding on quantum <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and we must therefore stay this proceeding to afford the parties an opportunity to supply these defects or inadequacies. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment should be granted; defendant\u2019s cross-motion should be denied. Further proceedings should be stayed pursuant to Rule 167 for a period of ninety (90) days to afford the parties an opportunity to obtain an agency resolution of the equitable adjustment in contract price to which plaintiff is entitled under the First Cause of Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\"><em>Second Cause of Action </em>\u2014 Claim <em>for Proper Classification of Certain Excavation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">This claim grows directly out of a conflict in interpretation of the contract terms. Therefore, the board\u2019s adverse action on the claim essentially involves a decision on a question of law (mixed with some fact), is not entitled to finality,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and is subject to plenary consideration in this court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-15\">As mentioned at the outset, this is a fixed-price type of contract consisting of a unit price schedule of 63 items listing estimated quantities and unit prices.

paid for at $0.39 per cubic yard; or as \u201cunclassified\u201d and paid for at $1.25 per cubic yard. The problem is exacerbated because the words \u201ccommon\u201d and \u201cunclassified\u201d are normally not used to describe contrasting types of excavation, but are rather words of similar meaning.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus in construction work, either \u201ccommon\u201d or \u201cunclassified\u201d might be used to describe ordinary excavation, in contrast to a specific classification like \u201crock,\u201d or \u201cboulders,\u201d or \u201chardpan,\u201d for example. This and other provisions hereinafter quoted, raise the issue of whether or not the defendant, which drafted these provisions, has created an ambiguity; and as a correlary to that, whether or not plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of these provisions is a reasonable one. The parties agree that if the excavation in .question should be categorized as \u201cunclassified,\u201d plaintiff is entitled to recover $128,478.84, plaintiff having been paid for such excavation as \u201ccommon,\u201d under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Other provisions of the specifications are helpful, but also further confusing. Section 2 \u201cExcavation\u201d provides in paragraph 2-01 \u201cScope\u201d that \u201c[t]his section covers excavation <em>except excavation for structures, </em>complete.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Paragraph 2-04 \u201cExcavation <em>b.\u201d </em>reads: <em>\u201cChannels, relief well collector ditch, and drainage ditches, </em>including any excavation necessary for the placement of stone protection, shall be excavated at the locations and to the cross sections and grades shown on the drawings,\u201d and <em>\u201cc\u201d </em>reads: <em>\u201cInlet and outlet ditches </em>to drainage structures shall be excavated at the locations and to the cross sections and grades shown on the drawings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Paragraph 2-06 <em>\u201cRemoved of Objectionable Material a.

[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">And Paragraph 8-08 <em>\u201cPayment\u201d </em>reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-14\">The cost of all plant, labor, and material required to perform the work described in this section shall be included in the <em>applicable </em>contract unit price for the items listed below.

The removal and disposal of the objectionable material and replacement of the backfill shall be accomplished as specified in paragraph 3-05a(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-23\">Referring to paragraph 2-01, quoted above, the five drainage ditches in question may not be \u201cstructures,\u201d in the narrowest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>definition,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but without these five drainage ditches the structures connected thereto are useless. Therefore, excavation for these five drainage ditches would appear to be \u201cexcavation for drainage structures.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Nor does this render meaningless paragraph 2-04c. quoted above dealing with \u201c[I]nlet and outlet ditches to drainage structures\u201d because there are drainage ditches other than the \u201cstructure\u201d ditches in question to which paragraph 2-04c. could be deemed to apply, such as the outlet ditches at stations 507 and 601+75, which were not adjunct to any structure. Thus, since section 2 \u201cExcavation\u201d does not apply to \u201cexcavation for structures,\u201d such as the five drainage ditches in question, it would appear that section 8 \u201cEarthwork for Structures\u201d would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Paragraph 8-08 of that section, quoted above, states that work performed thereunder shall be paid for at the \u201capplicable\u201d unit price, thereafter reciting both the \u201cunclassified\u201d and \u201ccommon\u201d excavation items, without offering any further assistance on which would be \u201capplicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Faced with this \u201ccan of worms,\u201d the hearing before the board resorted also to trade usage for a definition of \u201ccommon excavation.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The board accepted a definition given by plaintiff\u2019s expert witness that \u201ccommon\u201d excavation in the construction industry is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">* * * excavation that can be performed by wheel or other type of excavating equipment or in cases with a dragline, but <em>whenever you get into excessive moisture, shrinkage or sloping banks that cave, </em>that gets out of the realm of common. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">Observe also from paragraph 2-11+, quoted above, that the removal of \u201cobjectionable material\u201d is to be paid for at the unit price for \u201cunclassified excavation.\u201d Since paragraph 8-03/., above, also treats with \u201cobjectionable material\u201d and paragraph 8-08 speaks of payment for excavation under section 8 at the \u201capplicable\u201d unit price, listing \u201cunclassified excavation\u201d as one of these, one should reasonably surmise that \u201cobjectionable material\u201d in section 8, falls under the description of \u201cunclassified\u201d excavation. Although there is some evidence in the administrative record that plaintiff used a dragline in excavating these ditches, and did not do any shoring, sheeting or bracing to prevent possible cave-ins, there is uncontroverted evidence that plaintiff encountered sandy material at each of the locations for these ditches, causing plaintiff to have to excavate twice as much material as it would have to excavate had the material been firm. It was then required to backfill with impervious material to prevent cave-ins.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">Also, although it is disputed as to how much water was encountered in connection with excavation of the ditches in question, it is undisputed that plaintiff encountered water in the ditch at station 220+00, where 83.72 percent of the excavation for these ditches occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">All of the foregoing considered, plaintiff\u2019s argument that these are \u201cstructures\u201d (see par. 2-01, <em>supra); </em>that the material involved would be defined as \u201cobjectionable material\u201d (see par. 2-11 <em>d., </em>supra); and that it was material that was excessively moist and had a tendency to slope and cave (see the \u201ctrade usage\u201d definition quoted above); all support the conclusion that it was to be paid for as \u201cunclassified excavation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Even were this not the preponderant interpretation, the very spelling out of the above conflicts, and vagueness, illustrates an ambiguity, and since defendant drafted the contract and plaintiff\u2019s interpretation is a reasonable one, it is entitled to prevail.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">To the extent that subordinate findings of fact by the board contribute to its contrary interpretation, they are not supported by substantial evidence. Plaintiff is entitled to recover $112,106.-16 <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> by reason of the proper characterization of the excavation for the ditches as \u201cunclassified\u201d excavation.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The excavation for the nine rock dikes in question presents a different picture. The parties and the board\u2019s decision all agree that section 8 alone applies here because the dikes are \u201cstructures.\u201d But this excavation involved neither \u201cobjectionable material,\u201d nor did it correspond in appearance to the trade usage definition of unclassified material above quoted. The only evidence tending to indicate that this excavation was not \u201ccommon,\u201d was that four of the nine dikes were close to the river bank, requiring that equipment be kept back from the edge to prevent cave-ins. While plaintiff had, perhaps, to take somewhat more time and care than normal, this alone is insufficient to suggest that the \u201capplicable\u201d unit price listed in section 8 would be that for \u201cunclassified\u201d excavation.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In contrast, the evidence is undisputed (applying the trade usage definition of \u201ccommon excavation\u201d above), that plaintiff excavated for these nine dikes with a dragline, and performed no shoring, bracing or dewatering with respect thereto. By way of a contemporaneous interpretation, it is also noteworthy that plaintiff accepted without protest, the \u201ccommon\u201d excavation price of $0.39 per cu. yd. for an additional rock dike, not required by the original contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-15\">In summary, the board\u2019s finding that excavation for the nine rock dikes should be paid for at the lesser unit price assigned to \u201ccommon\u201d excavation, is supported by substantial evidence, and is correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-16\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to the five drainage ditches should be granted, and defendant\u2019s cross-motion to that extent should be denied. Judgment should therefore be entered for plaintiff in the sum of $112,106.16. In all other respects, plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment should be denied, defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment should be granted and the petition on this Second Cause of Action dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-17\"><em>Third Cause of Action </em>\u2014 Claim <em>for Removing or Filling Sewers and Waterlines (Constructive Change)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-18\">Fundamentally, this cause of action also grows out of a conflict in interpretation of the contract terms, resulting from a most regrettable lack of clarity and precision in the contract drawings and specifications. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>board\u2019s adverse decision, therefore, is essentially one on a question of law, and subject to plenary consideration on judicial review.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Section 8 of the specifications \u201cEarthwork for Structures\u201d (which was involved in the Second Cause of Action), is also involved here, but in another context.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Paragraph 8-01 <em>\u201cScope\u201d </em>provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">This section covers '* * * filling or removing <em>existing </em>sewers and waterlines <em>under the levee, </em>complete.

Plaintiff\u2019s lump sum bid for \u201c[Removing or filling <em>existing abandoned </em>sewers and waterlines\u201d was $10,700.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-17\">At issue in this Third Cause of Action are 13 sewer or waterlines removed or filled by plaintiff at the direction of defendant, under protest, and without additional compensation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The conflict arises over the question of whether <em>\u201cexisting abandoned </em>sewer and waterlines\u201d (emphasis supplied), means those abandoned at the time plaintiff submitted its bid, or, in addition, those abandoned at any time before the contract was completed. The parties have stipulated that if plaintiff\u2019s interpretation is correct, it is entitled to receive $9,452.13 under the \u201cChanges\u201d clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-18\">Plaintiff contends that his bid on item 14 quoted above, applies only to sewer and waterlines labeled \u201cexisting aban<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>doned\u201d on the contract drawings on which bids were invited; that the portrayal on the drawings of sewer and waterlines other than those designated \u201cexisting and abandoned,\u201d was solely to alert bidders to the need for scheduling operations so as to create the least interference with these facilities. Plaintiff further contends that the sentence on sheet 13 of the drawings to the effect that \u201c[e]xisting utilities within the construction limits will be removed or relocated as required <em>by others\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied), supports this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">In rebuttal, defendant argues that the word \u201cutilities\u201d in this last quoted sentence on sheet 13, does not include sewers and waterlines. There are items on the drawings other than the 13 sewer and waterlines in dispute which bear the specific notation that they will be done by others. There is no such <em>specific </em>notation (other than the general reference to \u201cutilities\u201d on sheet 13) with respect to these 13 lines at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Two waterlines only are described on the drawings as \u201cexisting abandoned,\u201d and therefore plaintiff contends that paragraph 8-06, quoted above, and corresponding item 14, quoted above from the unit price schedule, apply only to the two waterlines. These two waterlines bear the further notation \u201cthat they will be permanently closed by others.\u201d None of the 13 sewer and waterlines in dispute, is described on the drawings as \u201cabandoned.\u201d There are many items on the drawings other than the 13 lines in question which bear solely the notation \u201cexisting.\u201d Notations pertaining to each of the 13 lines in dispute indicate that they are to be removed, plugged or filled. There are sewer and waterlines other than the 13 in dispute, which the drawings indicate are to be removed or filled, and which further specify by whom.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">The 13 sewer and waterlines in controversy are shown on the drawings as located within the levee foundation, whereas the two waterlines plaintiff contends were the only ones \u201cexisting and abandoned\u201d and therefore covered by unit price item 14, are located outside the levee foundation. The board did not resolve a dispute in the testimony as to whether or not plaintiff did actually remove the two waterlines which it contends are the only ones to be removed under pay item 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">In the face of this second \u201ccan of worms,\u201d plaintiff\u2019s argument has initial plausibility. It is that the phrase \u201cRemoving or Filling Existing Abandoned Sewers and Waterlines\u201d would mean sewers and waterlines existing and abandoned when bids were solicited, and not those subsequently to be abandoned in the course of construction. But this is not a reasonable interpretation in the face of all the provisions of the contract, and other existing circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">The scope paragraph of section 8 (8-01), speaks of existing sewers and waterlines <em>under the levee. </em>Paragraph 8-06, on existing abandoned sewers and waterlines, also provides that \u201c [abandoned sewers and waterlines * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">shall be removed or filled and plugged <em>within </em>the limits of the <em>levee foundation </em>as shown on the drawings,\u201d (emphasis supplied), and that \u201c[a]ll known sewers and waterlines to be removed or filled are shown on the drawings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">In summary, paragraphs 8-01 and 8-06 make it reasonably clear that the sewer and waterlines to which they refer are located beneath the levee in question. There are no sewer and waterlines specifically marked \u201cexisting and abandoned\u201d which are within the levee foundation. However, all 13 of the sewer and waterlines in dispute are marked on the drawings as lines to be removed, filled or plugged, which would certainly indicate they are to be abandoned. And while other items on the drawings bear the notation that they will be removed \u201cby others,\u201d the 13 items in question bear no such negative notation, inferring that plaintiff is to effect their removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">Furthermore, plaintiff\u2019s interpretation that only two waterlines fall within paragraphs 8-01 and 8-06 (and unit price item 14), is unreasonable because these waterlines are outside the levee founda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>tion, bear the notation that they \u201cwill be permanently closed by others\u201d (inferring that they are not plaintiff\u2019s responsibility), and do not include sewers which are mentioned along with waterlines in paragraphs 8-01 and 8-06. This last point would render the reference to \u201csewers\u201d in these provisions meaningless, under plaintiff\u2019s interpretation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Nor is plaintiff\u2019s argument based on the note on sheet 13 that \u201c[e]xisting utilities within the construction limits will be removed or relocated as required by others\u201d as plausible as might first appear. Certainly sewer and waterlines are \u201cutilities\u201d in the generic sense. But read in total context, it is apparent that the note was meant to apply to utilities to be continued in service, rather than those to be abandoned. There are sewer and waterlines and manholes within the levee foundation which bear <em>only </em>the notation \u201cexisting\u201d or the notation that the work required would be done by others, confirming that these were the utilities mentioned in the above quoted note on sheet 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Although the conflict involved in this Third Cause of Action might be deemed an ambiguity,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> it was so glaring an ambiguity as to create a duty on the part of plaintiff to seek clarification. Having failed to do so, it must now have the contract construed as it stands, without the benefit of a penalty imposed <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> upon the drafter of the contract. Defendant\u2019s interpretation of the contract is the more plausible one, and it is to be preferred to that offered by plaintiff. Therefore, its claim on this Third Cause of Action should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment should be denied, defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment should be granted, and the petition on this Third Cause of Action dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\"><em>Fourth Cause of Action </em>\u2014 Claim <em>for Time Extensions and Remission of Liquidated Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">General Provision 5 \u201cTermination for Default-Damages for Delay-Time Extensions\u201d provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-14\">(a) If the Contractor refuses or fails to prosecute the work, or any separable part thereof, with such diligence as will insure its completion within the time specified in this contract, or any extension thereof, or fails to complete said work within such time, the Government may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate his right to proceed with the work or such part of the work as to which there has been delay.

[Emphasis supplied in all foregoing quotations.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ao6_\">There are several claims for time extensions involved in this Fourth Cause of Action. Defendant has withheld $300 per day for 95 days, or $28,500. Plaintiff\u2019s claims for various time extensions, and remission of this total sum are taken up in turn. Note that there is also a time extension claim in connection with the First Cause of Action, <em>supra </em>to be resolved in the course of a stay of proceedings on that cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">At issue in the first claim hereunder, is the meaning of Special Condition SC-7 \u201cVariation in Estimated Quantities.\u201d Therefore, this claim also presents an interpretive problem and essentially a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>consideration.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The provision reads in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\"><em>a. </em>Where the' <em>quantity </em>of a pay item in this contract is an <em>.estimated quantity </em>and where the <em>actual quantity </em>of such pay item, other than any item listed in <em>b </em>below is <em>more than 115% or less than 87% of the estimated quantity stated in this contract, </em>as modified, <em>an equitable adjustment </em>in the contract <em>price </em>shall be made upon demand of either party. For <em>overruns </em>the equitable adjustment <em>shall be limited to the number of units by which the actual </em>quantity <em>exceeds 115% of the estimated </em>quantities. Where the actual quantity of any pay item is <em>less than 87% </em>of the estimated quantity stated in this contract, the final payment will be computed by applying <em>the contract unit price to 87% of the estimated quantity </em>shown in the contract <em>and then deducting from the result an amount obtained by applying to the number of units of un-derrun below 87% </em>of the estimated quantity <em>a negotiated price per unit of such underrun. </em>The unit price for <em>deduction shall represent the reasonable cost to the Contractor of performing the units of work exclusive of the mobilization and other fixed costs relating thereto. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">-X- * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-12\"><em>d. </em>If any item within the scope of subparagraph <em>a, </em>above, is <em>more that 105% or less than 96% </em>of the <em>estimated quantity stated in the contract * </em>* * and <em>if such variation causes </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number><em>an increase or a decrease in the time required for performance of this contract the contract completion time will be adjusted as follows:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\">(1) <em>If the quantity variation is such that it will cause an increase </em>in the time necessary for completion, <em>the Contracting Officer shall * </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">ascertain the facts and <em>make such adjustment </em>for extending the completion date <em>as in his judgment the findings justify. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">It will be observed from the above quotation that the provisions for <em>price </em>adjustment (subdivision <em>a.), </em>and those for <em>time </em>adjustment (subdivision <em>d.), </em>in the event of a variation from the estimated quantity, are not the same. Plaintiff urges therefore that they were intended to operate differently. In each case (price or time), an adjustment is to be made if \u201ctriggered\u201d by a variation of a specified degree (115 percent \u2014 87 percent in the case of price adjustment; and 105 percent \u2014 96 percent in the case of a time adjustment). But, if there is an overrun, in excavation, for example, the contractor is not totally uncompensated for the additional excavation above the amount specified in the unit price schedule. He is, of course, paid the contract unit price which he bid until the \u201ctrigger\u201d point of 115 percent of estimated quantity is reached. At that point the unit price is adjusted upward or downward for amounts exceeding 115 percent of the original estimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Similarly a time adjustment is \u201ctriggered\u201d when the estimated quantity in the unit price schedule exceeds 105 percent; but if the contractor is not given a time extension for the additional work performed between 100 percent (as estimated), and 105 percent when the 105 percent point is reached a penalty in the form of liquidated damages is imposed for the late performance of that 5 percent of the work. That is why plaintiff urges that SC-7d., above, dealing with time, in contrast to SC-7a., dealing with price, does <em>not state </em>that \u201cthe equitable adjustment shall be limited to the number of units by which the actual quantity <em>exceeds </em>115% of the estimated quantities.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">The actual quantities of excavation exceeded estimates by 93,146 cubic yards. The total yardage excavated was 105.18 percent of estimates. Similarly, as to other pay items, the actual quantity of bedding and riprap work exceeded the amounts estimated in the payment schedule for this work by 27,526.7 cubic yards. This represented 114.83 percent of estimates.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s average rate of excavation was 1,901.7 cubic yards per day. Its average rate of bedding and riprap production was 296.5 cubic yards per day. Defendant did not allow plaintiff any additional time for contract performance on account of the excavation overrun. It allowed plaintiff a 36-day time extension for performance of bedding and riprap work only in excess of 105 percent of estimated quantities.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">The interpretation of SC-7d. above urged by plaintiff is the more persuasive interpretation, and also the one most consistent with reality. Defendant drafted SC-7. It drafted subdivision <em>a., </em>dealing with <em>price </em>adjustment in the event of variation in quantities, quite differently than it drafted subdivision <em>d., </em>which dealt with <em>time </em>adjustment within the same article. These essential differences in language cannot be ignored. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that they could, plaintiff\u2019s interpretation is a reasonable one (in fact the more reasonable one) and it would be entitled to that interpretation in any event under the rule of <em>contra preferentum.</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">A difference in the treatment of price and time adjustments is also supported by logic and practical considerations, as urged by plaintiff. In both subdivisions <em>a., </em>and <em>d., </em>adjustments of price and time are \u201ctriggered\u201d in effect when overruns or underruns in a specified percentage are encountered. But in the case of price adjustment, the contractor is never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>uncompensated for work performed, in the event of a variation in estimated quantities. It receives the contract unit price which it bid, in this case up to a 115 percent overrun; and then an adjusted unit price (ordinarily a downward adjustment in the case of an overrun) for the quantities in excess of 115 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Time adjustment on the other hand deals with the quite different question of whether defendant may assess liquidated damages, as an incentive for timely performance. The contractor is to be relieved of this penalty if delayed for reasons beyond its control and without its fault or negligence. The need to perform extra work beyond that specified in the contract certainly falls within that definition.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This would explain the difference in language between subdivisions <em>a. </em>and <em>d. </em>of SC-7 which defendant drafted, and would support a time adjustment for the full amount of the overrun beyond 100 percent of the work originally estimated to be performed. Plaintiff is entitled to such an adjustment, and a corresponding remission of liquidated damages withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The second claim for time extension raises the issue of whether plaintiff\u2019s contract performance was delayed by reason of a suspension order issued May 13, 1964, by the contracting officer with regard to work and procurement on certain relief wells. The suspension order was not lifted until July 9, 1964, when modification No. 35 was issued making changes in connection with the wells.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The board found that this suspension order did not cause a delay in overall performance. Plaintiff\u2019s construction supervisor had testified that the equipment employed on the suspended work, was diverted to other contract work; but that plaintiff had to delay certain work until the suspension order was lifted. Defendant\u2019s chief inspector and its project engineer offered the opinion that the suspension order did not delay overall performance, and that plaintiff did not demobilize its equipment by reason of the suspension order.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Although there is some evidence that by reason of the suspension order the work was performed in a somewhat different sequence than originally contemplated, there is substantial evidence for the board\u2019s factual conclusion that overall performance was not thereby affected.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Plaintiff is not entitled to a time extension (and corresponding remission of liquidated damages) by reason of the suspension order.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">The third and last claim for time extension in this Fourth Cause of Action results from the refusal of the defendant to extend the contract completion date by reason of its issuance of three change orders: No. 35 (changes in the relief wells); No. 39 (removal of silt deposited by a heavy rain); and No. 41 (filling of areas eroded by heavy rain). As to this claim, the entire decision of the board reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-11\">* * * Appellant contends that issuance of a modification for extra work automatically serves as a starting point for establishing the contract completion date and extends contract completion time from that point for the period of time required to complete the modification work without regard to the causal effect performance of the modification work has on over-all contract completion. Under this theory a contractor\u2019s unexcused delayed performance would force the Government with choice as between surrender of either of its contract conferred rights of making changes or of being made whole for unexeused late performance. We have considered this theory before and rejected* it. See Independent Contractors and Engineers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Eng BCA No. 1922, Dec., 1 June 1961. We reaffirm the rationale of that decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Its own prior opinion in <em>Independent Contractors, </em>which the board cites in the opinion quoted above, is unpublished. Examination of a copy thereof requested from the agency, illustrates that <em>Independent Contractors </em>involved different facts and that there was essentially no issue of fact in that case, but rather a contract interpretation problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">In any event, the issue in the case before us, is simply this. The standard, Government-wide mandatory \u201cChanges\u201d clause in this contract provides in pertinent part that the contracting officer may issue change orders and: \u201c[i]f such changes <em>cause </em>an increase or decrease in the Contractor\u2019s cost of, <em>or time required for, performance of the contract, </em>an equitable adjustment <em>shall he made </em>and the contract modified in writing accordingly.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.] In the decision quoted above, the board has simply not confronted the issue of fact in the case, namely, whether the three change orders in question \u201ccaused\u201d an \u201cincrease\u201d in the \u201ctime required for performance of the contract\u201d; and the standard \u201cChanges\u201d clause mandates a confrontation of that issue. If the board\u2019s purpose in relying simply on its own prior decision in <em>Independent Contractors </em>was to infer that it can nullify the standard \u201cChanges\u201d clause provisions elsewhere in the specifications, or otherwise, that is an incorrect conclusion of law.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">However, if all that the board meant is that the contractor is not entitled to a time extension on account of these three change orders (Nos. 35, 39, and 41) unless plaintiff shows that these changes caused an actual increase in the overall performance time, then the board was correct as af matter of law, but it failed to determine whether such an actual increase in overall performance time was caused by these particular change orders. The case must go back to the agency for a determination of that precise issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment should be granted with respect to the first and third claims for time extensions and remission of liquidated damages, and defendant\u2019s cross-motion to that extent should be denied. In all other respects, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment should be denied, defendant\u2019s cross-motion should be granted and the petition on this Fourth Cause of Action dismissed.
