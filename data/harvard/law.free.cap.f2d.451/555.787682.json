We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">M\u00e1rchese was convicted of a narcotics violation in 1958 and began serving a 10-year sentence on July 10, 1959. After serving four and one-half years, he was released on bail while rulings in his favor in a habeas corpus proceeding were appealed. He remained free on bail approximately three and one-half years, from October 1, 1963, to June 12, 1967. He was returned to prison on the latter date when his habeas victory was reversed, and remained in prison until his mandatory release date, July 18, 1969, calculated on the basis of a ten year prison term less 1200 days\u2019 good behavior time accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">\u201cGood time\u201d discharges are governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4161-4164. Section 4164 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-14\">\u201cA prisoner having served his term or terms less good-time deductions shall, upon release, be deemed as if released on parole until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced less one hundred and eighty days.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">M\u00e1rchese was released \u201cas if released on parole,\u201d and it is apparently contemplated that he will remain subject to the conditions of parole for 1200 days less the statutory exclusion of 180 days. He contends that he was entitled to unconditional release.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-16\">1. M\u00e1rchese argues that since narcotics offenders are prohibited from obtaining parole, probation, or a suspended sentence (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d)), he cannot be subjected to \u201cquasi parole\u201d under section 4164 when released early due to good behavior. Every court to consider the question has held that section 7237 does not operate to exempt narcotics offenders from section 4161 supervision. Weber v. Willingham, 356 F.2d 933, 934 (10th Cir. 1966); Powell v. D. C. Board of Parole, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 280, 349 F.2d 715, 716 (1965); Fuller v. Weakley, 349 F.2d 90, 93 (4th Cir. 1965); United States v. Figueroa, 325 F.2d 418, 419 (2d Cir. 1963). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-18\"> 2. M\u00e1rchese argues that the three and one-half years he was out on bail between 1963 and 1967 should be credited toward any period of supervision the authorities now seek to impose. However, section 4164 clearly calls for a period of \u201cquasi-parole\u201d <em>after </em>completion of a prison sentence with good behavior. Such post-incarceration supervision serves an obvious rehabilitative pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>pose. There is neither precedent nor reason for treating time spent on bail as equivalent to parole time. We do not, for example, accord such treatment to time spent on bail pending appeal. <em>Cf. </em>Leyvas v. United States, 371 F.2d 714 (9th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
