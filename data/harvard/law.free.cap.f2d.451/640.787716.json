We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">\n<em>The Subject Matter Claimed</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b741-16\">Claim 1, which is appellant\u2019s broadest claim, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-17\">1. An oxidation process which comprises contacting hydrocarbon ole-fins having 2 to 30 carbon atoms with a rhenium compound selected from the group consisting of rhenium oxide, alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonia perrhenates and mixtures thereof in a liquid reaction medium which is inert under the oxidation conditions, said medium being at a temperature of -50 to 300\u00b0C. and at a pressure from 1 to about 250 atmospheres, sufficient to maintain said medium as a liquid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-18\">Independent claims 6, 9, and 12 are similar to claim 1, but claim 6 recites the presence of oxygen in the liquid reaction medium, claim 9 recites the presence of water, and claim 12 recites the presence of both oxygen and water. Claims 2-5, 7-8, 10-11, and 13-14, depending from claims 1, 6, 9, and 12, respectively, place further limitations on the rhenium compound, olefin, and reaction medium used, but neither the recitation of water nor any of the limitations contained in the dependent claims is relied upon for pat-entability.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">Appellant\u2019s specification makes clear that it is the rhenium compounds which function as oxidizers of the olefin in the processes which he regards as his invention and that the oxygen which is specifically recited in claims 6-8 and 12-14 is there to regenerate the rhenium compounds, which become reduced as they oxidize the olefins, and not to oxidize the hydrocarbons directly. The claims which recite the presence of oxygen also recite a temperature range \u201cof 125 to 300 \u00b0C.\u201d which the specification says is necessary to facilitate the in situ oxygen regeneration of the rhenium compounds at a suitable rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">\n<em>The Rejection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b741-15\">The examiner rejected claims 1-14 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 as unpatentable over the following references:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-20\">Gardner 2,366,725</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-21\">Gasson et al. 2,650,927</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-22\">Baldwin 2,776,316</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-23\">Gardner et al. 2,784,202</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-24\">Keith et al. 2,974,161</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-25\">Jan. 9, 1945</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajqi\">Sept. 1, 1953</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"amd-dedup-0\">Jan. 1, 1957</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anh\">Mar. 5. 1957</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7g\">Mar. 7, 1961</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-26\">Of these, Baldwin, which teaches a method of <em>catalyzing the oxygen </em>oxidation of olefins <em>in vapor phase </em>with \u201can organic compound having a large molecular volume and containing a potentially catalytically active metal,\u201d was the principal reference. It states that \u201cthose metals which possess at least one differentiating electron in the second from the outermost shell, or penultimate shell,\u201d are commonly classified as potentially catalytically active and then lists thirty-three metals, including rhenium, which are within this definition. As appellant points out, \u201cThis listing includes approximately one-third of all elements known to mankind * *</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Keith was relied upon for its very-general teaching that unsaturated organic compounds can be oxidized by either catalytic or non-catalytic procedures conducted in either liquid or vapor phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Gardner and Gardner et al. teach liquid-phase, oxygen oxidation of olefins in the presence of catalytic metal salts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Finally, Gasson was relied on as evidence that \u201cmetals known to be active in olefin oxidation reactions are conventionally employed as the salt of their acid form,\u201d a general proposition which appellant does not contest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Appellant describes his invention as \u201cthe use of certain rhenium compounds * * * as oxidants for hydrocarbon olefins,\u201d but all his claims broadly recite \u201ccontacting\u201d olefins with rhenium compounds and thus \u2014 despite the narrower description of his invention in his specification \u2014 they do not exclude processes in which the rhenium compounds function as catalysts rather than as oxidants. Cf. In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404, 1405, 56 CCPA 1381, 1396 (1969). Furthermore, we agree with the solicitor that, because they are \u201ccomprising\u201d claims rather than \u201cconsisting\u201d claims, even those claims which do not recite the presence of oxygen in the reaction medium \u201care open to the interpretation that oxygen supplied by the atmosphere is the oxidant * * In re Cone, 121 F.2d 470, 472, 28 CCPA 1282, 1284 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-15\">As is apparent from the emphasized words in the above synopsis of the principal reference, the method which Baldwin teaches is really not very close to the method described in appellant\u2019s specification. Baldwin teaches oxygen oxidation, catalyzed by rhenium; appellant teaches rhenium oxidation, which may be turned into a continuous process by the addition of oxygen under proper conditions which, he contends, oxidizes the primary oxidizer, not the olefin. Furthermore, Baldwin teaches vapor-phase oxidation while appellant teaches liquid-phase. However, it is not the difference between the methods <em>taught </em>which controls here but the difference between the method taught by Baldwin and the methods <em>claimed </em>by appellant, and that difference is solely the difference between liquid-phase and vapor-phase operation. We agree with the Patent Office that that difference is made prima facie obvious by Keith, Gardner, and Gardner et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-16\">Appellant contends that, contrary to the position taken by the Patent Office, the results obtainable by his process are relevant to the patentability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>of his claims despite the fact that they are not recited therein. We agree. In re Estes, 420 F.2d 1397, 1399, 57 CCPA 896, 898-899 (1970). However, appellant\u2019s evidence has done little to counteract the force of the Patent Office\u2019s pri-ma facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">In the first place, we do not think that appellant has proved that the results of his process are in fact different from the results of the processes taught by Baldwin and Keith. In his specification, appellant first discloses very generally that \u201cThe products from this oxidation reaction are epoxides, acids, esters, ketones, aldehydes and ethers,\u201d then sets forth sixteen examples in which he obtained specific exemplars of such chemicals, including acrolein, using particular reactants and reaction conditions. Baldwin\u2019s specific disclosure uses <em>copper </em>phthalocyanine as a precursor, not a rhenium compound, but he asserts that \u201cthese catalysts [presumably including the rhenium compounds] may be used for synthesizing the production of benzaldehyde from toluene, phenol from benzene, acrolein from propylene, and methacrolein from isobutylene.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similarly, Keith et al. teach that they have obtained \u201csubstantial yields of oxygenated products such as oxides, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ketones and acids with the exact nature of the products depending upon the severity of the reaction conditions and the feedstock employed.\u201d Thus, appellant\u2019s results appear to be no more than expected olefin oxidation products.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">In the second place, even assuming that the results of appellant\u2019s process are specifically different from the results shown by the references, appellant has not shown that any such specific difference is of any practical advantage. The Patent Office has made a strong case based on the breadth of appellant\u2019s claims, and we must balance that case against the strength of appellant\u2019s objective evidence ol non-obviousness. In this case, we are not persuaded of error. Cf. In re D\u2019Ancicco, 439 F.2d 1244, 1248, 58 CCPA 1057 (1971); and In re Lewis, 443 F.2d 389, 392, 58 CCPA 1270 (1971). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-9\">. Gardner et al. teach such oxidation utilizing, inter alia, manganese salts, and the solicitor argues before us, for the first time in this ease, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-10\">* ]* * the choice of rhenium oxides as catalysts for liquid phase oxidation would be obvious to the artisan of ordinary skill from Gardner\u2019s teachings of manganese salts as catalysts taken with the well-known chemical similarity of rhenium and manganese (see definition of rhenium in Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-12\">The solicitor apparently expects us to take judicial notice of this putative similarity and affirm on that basis, but does not say what kind of \u201csimilarity\u201d he is referring to. Similarity in what sense, and for what purpose? We decline to act on this inadequate argument. All Webster says is that rhenium \u201cresembles manganese chemically,\u201d which is altogether too vague.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b742-18\">. Appellant does argue that \u201cThe secondary references * * * fail to suggest the uniqueness of the oxide or amphoteric form of the metal.\u201d However, Baldwin teaches the use of dipyridyl perrlienate as a precursor in his process and states that \u201cThe residue remaining after heating [i. e., his catalyst] is believed to be the metal oxide or the pure metal itself, although it is impossible to determine exactly the chemical composition of the residue.\u201d Moreover, it is our view that appellant has not proved special results coming from his use of \u201cthe oxide or amphoteric form of the metal\u201d sufficient to overcome the Patent Office showing of prima facie obviousness. This conclusion is discussed further in the last portion of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b743-6\">. Appellant has made no attempt to demonstrate just wliat reaction products <em>would </em>be obtained by following Baldwin\u2019s teachings using rhenium compounds as precursors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
