The Board\u2019s Order directed the employer to reinstate Irwin in his former job and to make him whole in accordance with the Trial Examiner\u2019s remedy for any loss of earnings and to cease and desist.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">The Board seeks enforcement of its Order and the employer seeks to set it aside. We deny enforcement. We find that the Order is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">This ease, we believe, fits the rule stated in Interlake Iron Corporation v. National Labor Relations Board, 131 F. 2d 129, 133 (7th Cir. 1942):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-12\">\u201cWe recognize the right, the exclusive right, of the Board to draw reasonable inferences from the facts found. That is the province of the Board, and when inferences are reasonably drawn they constitute evidence and must be accepted by the courts as such; and inferences alone may, if reasonable, provide a link in the chain of evidence and constitute in that regard substantial evidence. <em>But an inference cannot be piled upon an inference, and then (mother inference upon that, </em>as such inferences are unreasonable and cannot be considered as substantial evidence.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">It is incumbent on general counsel of the Board to prove unlawful conduct and unlawful purpose is not lightly to be inferred. National Labor Relations Board v. Federal Pacific Electric Company, 441 F.2d 765 (5th Cir. 1971). And while ascribing proper weight to credibility determinations of the Trial Examiner and the Board, it is the duty of this court to review the record as a whole to determine whether there exists substantial evidence to support the Board. Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). Mere suspicions of unlawful motivation are not sufficient to constitute substantial evidence. Lozano Enterprises v. National Labor Relations Board, 357 F.2d 500 (9th Cir. 1966). Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It means such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Consolidated Edison Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 305 U.S. 197, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-14\">Irwin, a planer operator, was first discharged by Meinholdt, a small plant operation, on April 1, 1968. Irwin had \u201cbugged\u201d his employer for higher wages and better working conditions. He had expressed his complaints to oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>er employees. Meinholdt officials testified that Irwin was discharged because he had often been absent from his planer machine. No union activities were then involved. Irwin, at his own request, was later rehired. When he returned Company officials admonished him to stay at his machine and to keep his \u201cbig mouth\u201d closed and not to bug the Company or other employees about wages- or working conditions. The Board put great weight upon the initial discharge, emphasizing that when Irwin was rehired he was told to keep his mouth shut, thus inferring that these admonishments restrained concerted activities of employees. Company officials testified that while Irwin was first discharged because of his absenteeism, they did acknowledge that Irwin had also \u201cbugged\u201d other employees by expressing his discontent concerning wages and working conditions. An employee who \u201cbugs\u201d management for higher wages and better working conditions and who speaks with fellow employees on the job relative thereto, is not engaged in the \u201cconcerted activity\u201d of employees for mutual aid and protection prescribed by the Act. National Labor Relations Board v. Avondale Mills, 242 F.2d 669 (5th Cir. 1957), aff\u2019d 357 U.S. 357, 78 S.Ct. 1268, 2 L.Ed.2d 1383 (1958); Midland Steel Products Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 113 F.2d 800 (6th Cir. 1940). Irwin\u2019s own testimony was that he had been \u201carbitrating\u201d his wages with Company officials for some time and that \u201cI wanted more than what they offered.\u201d His complaints were directed exclusively to his own wages, hours and working conditions. It is in this context that the Board inferred that when Irwin was rehired, the admonishments given him by Company officials to stay at his machine and not to wander around the plant talking wages and working conditions with other employees, constituted a threat of discharge should Irwin participate in concerted union activities. Company officials Wills and Hays testified that these admonishments applied to working hours only. The Board\u2019s brief states otherwise. This inference is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The Board determined that Irwin\u2019s first discharge was relevant background evidence \u201cagainst which to assess subsequent remarks made by Company officials as well as to determine the Company\u2019s motivation\u201d at the time of Irwin\u2019s second discharge on October 17, 1968. There is no direct evidence that any Company official had knowledge of Irwin\u2019s activities that day relating to distribution of union authorization cards to employees. Although unsupported by direct evidence, the Board nevertheless contends that there was substantial evidence supporting its finding that Irwin was fired that day because of his union activities in that: (a) Irwin\u2019s solicitation of authorization cards on October 17th was \u201cunlikely to have escaped\u201d the Company\u2019s attention notwithstanding un-controverted testimony to the contrary; (b) the Company\u2019s contention that Irwin was discharged because of his absences from his machine \u201cis pretextual in nature\u201d notwithstanding Company officials\u2019 testimony \u2014 corroborated by Irwin himself \u2014 that Irwin had received one written and numerous oral warnings even before October 17th that he would be discharged if he did not remain at his planer machine; and (c) the circumstances surrounding the first discharge \u201cshed light\u201d on the real reason for the second discharge in that the \u201csame thing\u201d relates to Irwin\u2019s \u201cconcerted activity\u201d rather than his absenteeism from his machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The Board dwelt on Irwin\u2019s many absences from his machine prior to his discharge on October 17th. It found that Irwin had good cause to be absent from his machine that day and that plant superintendent Allen was wrong in finding fault with Irwin in this respect. Even so, this record does not reflect bad faith on the part of the Company and absent a showing of anti-union motivation, an employer may discharge an employee for a good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all. Nation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>al Labor Relations Board v. O. A. Fuller Super Markets, Inc., 374 F.2d 197 (5th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">In its brief the Board insists that the Company restricted the union activities of its employees during both working and non-working hours. Without any direct evidence, the Board relies upon the \u201csmall plant\u201d doctrine to raise such an inference, citing American Sanitary Products Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 382 F.2d 53 (10th Cir. 1967) and National Labor Relations Board v. Mid State Sportswear, Inc., 412 F.2d 537 (5th Cir. 1969). Those decisions do not support the application of the \u201csmall plant\u201d doctrine to the facts of this case. In <em>American Sanitary Products, supra, </em>the union organizing activities lasted three full days. During this period the employer interviewed four of its employees about union activities. And in <em>Mid States Sportswear, supra, </em>the solicitation for union authorization cards involved unusual activity between the machine operators both inside and outside of the plant. Furthermore, one of the plant supervisors heard rumors of union activity. In the instant case, the facts and circumstances are at least just as consistent with lack of knowledge as they are with possession of such knowledge. See National Labor Relations Board v. Falls City Creamery Co., 207 F.2d 820 (8th Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Testimony which requires the pyramiding of so many inferences in order to support a finding of discrimination cannot be a substitute for substantial evidence essential to support the Board\u2019s Order. The substantial evidence rule is not satisfied by evidence which merely creates a suspicion or which amounts to no more than a scintilla or which lends equal support to inconsistent inferences. National Labor Relations Board v. Shen-Valley Meat Packers, 211 F.2d 289 (4th Cir. 1954); National Labor Relations Board v. Falls City Creamery Co., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Unlike the logical reasoning set forth in National Labor Relations Board v. Mid State Sportswear, Inc., <em>supra, </em>upholding the reasonable inferences of the Examiner and the Board, here the \u201csmall plant\u201d doctrine is resorted to notwithstanding uncontradicted evidence that: (a) the Company had given Irwin many advanced warnings that he would be discharged if he continued to leave his machine; (b) Irwin left his machine almost a dozen times prior to his discharge on October 17th; and (c) the Company did not in anywise vacillate as to the reason for his discharge \u2014 leaving his machine \u2014 and of the concern relative thereto in view of the fact that the planer machine was the most expensive piece of machinery in the plant, the output of which was critical to the balance of the plant production.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Larry Schliuning, who worked as a machinist and a planer operator, testified that he did not recall ever being criticized by Company officials for leaving his machine. Robert Allen, plant superintendent, testified that Irwin was the only planer operator who created problems by consistent absenteeism from his machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">We deny enforcement of the Board\u2019s Order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
