The Commissioner has taken a cross-appeal \u201csolely to protect the Government\u2019s right to collect additional taxes from the corporation should this Court reverse the Tax Court\u2019s decisions -\u00bb * *\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-17\">Four corporations were limited partners in a partnership of which Lloyd Noonan and Wilfred Winkenbaeh were general partners. Noonan was the sole shareholder in two of the corporations and Winkenbaeh owned all of the shares of the other two.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Tax Court concluded that the partnership income attributed to the four corporations was properly taxable to the individual taxpayers. This conclusion rested upon the determination that the corporations served no real business purpose, earned no income, and, for federal income tax purposes, should be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-18\">Our court has held that the critical issue in a case such as this is a factual issue. Shaw Construction Company v. C. I. R\u201e 323 F.2d 316 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-19\">\u201cThe issues in this case \u2014 whether the multiple corporations were unreal shams, serving no real business purpose and earning no income, and whether the income in question was in reality produced and earned, not by the multiple corporate holders of legal title, but by petitioner, Shaw Construction Company \u2014 are issues of fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1093-20\">323 F.2d at 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-21\">In the case at hand, there was evidence that the four corporations paid no dividends, had no employees, maintained no telephones, telephone listings, or separate business addresses, and engaged in no substantive business activities. In the light of these facts, we cannot say that the critical factual determination of the Tax Court was without substantial evidentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1093-24\">. The wives of Noonan and Winkenbaeh are parties litigant only because of their having joined their respective husbands in the filing of the tax returns in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
