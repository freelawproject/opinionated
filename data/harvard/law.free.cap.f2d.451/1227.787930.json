We dismiss the appeal on grounds of mootness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-22\">On September 30, 1968, the appellant was convicted of burglary in a Louisiana State court. He was sentenced to serve a three-year sentence, but was granted parole in October, 1969. At that time he was released to federal authorities to commence service of an outstanding federal sentence. While serving his federal sentence in the United States Penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, a de-tainer was filed against him by the State of Louisiana charging a parole violation in connection with his alleged misappropriation of some $2700 which had been erroneously credited to his inmate account at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. Thereafter, the appellant instituted this action in the court below, seeking the removal of the detainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-23\">We deem it unnecessary to review the district court\u2019s ruling as to the merits of the petition, since the appellee has filed an affidavit in this Court certifying that the appellant was returned to the Louisiana State Penitentiary on October 5, 1971, and after a revocation hearing before the Louisiana Board of Parole, his parole was revoked on October 26, 1971. Inasmuch as the complained-of detainer has now been removed, the district court\u2019s denial of in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>junctive relief is moot, and the appeal must be dismissed. United States ex rel. Arnold v. Faircloth, 5th Cir. 1971, 441 F.2d 1157; Little v. Georgia, 5th Cir. 1971, 438 F.2d 536; Lackey v. Alabama, 5th Cir. 1970, 434 F.2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1327-15\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this pro se ease summarily, pursuant to this Court\u2019s local Rule 9(c) (2), appellant having failed to file a brief -within the time fixed by Rule 31, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
