Hopp, the University Librarian. In addition to the allegations above, his complaint asserted that he was a homosexual and that the Board\u2019s resolution\u00bb not to approve his employment application was premised on the fact of his homosexuality and upon his desire, as exemplified by the marriage license incident, specifically to publicly profess his \u201cearnest\u201d belief that homosexuals are entitled to privileges equal to those afforded heterosexuals. In further detail he alleged that the Board, acting under color of the statutes, regulations, customs and usages of the State of Minnesota, subjected him to arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory action working a deprivation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection of the laws and due process of law. Federal jurisdiction was claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judge Ne-ville, after conducting an oral hearing at which evidence was taken, entered judgment for McConnell and enjoined the Board from refusing to employ him \u201csolely because, and on the grounds that he is a homosexual and that thereby \u2018his personal conduct, as presented in the public and University news media, is not consistent with the best interest of the University.\u2019 \u201d 316 F.Supp. 809 (D.Minn. 1970). Judge Neville stayed the judgment and suspended the injunction pending disposition of this appeal. We must reverse.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">Much of the factual background is set forth in Judge Neville\u2019s published memorandum opinion and need not be repeated at any length here. It suffices merely to stress, by way of summary, that McConnell apparently is well-educated and otherwise able, possessing both an academic degree and a master\u2019s degree; that he formerly was employed as Acquisitions Librarian at Park College in Missouri; that he is a member of the organization known as FREE (Fight Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>pression of Erotic Expression); that on May 18, 1970, McConnell and a friend referred to in the record as \u201cJack Baker\u201d encountered Dr. Hopp and informed him of their intention to obtain a license to marry; that during this conversation Dr. Hopp expressed concern that such an occurrence might well jeopardize favorable consideration of McConnell\u2019s employment application; that about three hours later on the same day, McConnell and Jack Baker appeared at the Hennepin County Clerk\u2019s office and made formal application for the license; that this event received the attention of the local news and television media;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the Board\u2019s Faculty, Staff and Student Affairs Committee, on June 24, 1970, convened to initially consider the matter of McConnell\u2019s proposed appointment and voted that it be not approved; that McConnell promptly was so advised and given notice that he could request a hearing at the Committee\u2019s next scheduled meeting on July 9; that McConnell requested a hearing; that he and his counsel appeared at the meeting and were furnished copies of the resolution in its proposed form; that McConnell and his counsel took advantage of this opportunity to present information they deemed supportive of his application, and that at the conclusion of the presentation on McConnell\u2019s behalf, the Committee adopted the resolution. It perhaps is well at this point to note that McConnell makes no claim that the Board denied him procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The Board\u2019s primary demand for reversal is based upon a most fundamental contention. It is the Board\u2019s claim that Judge Neville, in issuing the injunction, exceeded his proper function and authority by superimposing his own situational judgment upon legitimate Board action supported by substantial and material factual data. The Board also mounts a due process attack against the timeliness and sufficiency of service of process. It urges, too, that Judge Neville improperly prevented it from cross-examining McConnell at the oral hearing with reference to the nature of his past conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">We focus our initial attention upon our standard of review of the Board\u2019s action. The Minnesota Supreme Court has had no less than five occasions to determine and review the proper role and function of the Board of Regents in the management, control and administration of the University of Minnesota.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> From these decisions we think it can be said generally that, insofar as \u2022 Minnesota\u2019s highest court is concerned, the Board is vested with plenary and .exclusive authority to govern, control and oversee the administration of the University and that the role of Minnesota courts in reviewing Board action is limited to determining whether the Board has kept within the scope of its constitutional powers. We think this is but another manner of saying that, at least with respect to matters purely administrative in nature, viz., the employment of University personnel and the like, the discretion of the Board necessarily is broad and subject only to such judicial review as normally is available to litigants allegedly aggrieved by administrative action generally. We think the attitude and approach to the Board\u2019s role by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Minnesota\u2019s court is sound and instructive and we adopt it as our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Without question, then, the Board is on relevant and sound ground in asserting that the decision embodied in its resolution cannot be overturned in the absence of a clear and affirmative showing that it was premised upon arbitrary or capricious conduct. That a court is, in reviewing a determination of an administrative body, limited to deciding whether the administrative action was arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious long has been settled.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This particularly must be so, it seems to us, where, as here, the determination under challenge is one falling within the considerable discretion entrusted those charged with the heavy responsibility of supervising the administration of this nation\u2019s colleges and universities.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">It is McConnell\u2019s position that the Board\u2019s decision not to approve his employment application reflects \u201ca clear example of the unreasoning prejudice and revulsion some people feel when confronted by a homosexual.\u201d That being so, he argues that the Board\u2019s action was arbitrary and capricious and thus viola-tive of his constitutional rights. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">It is our conclusion that the Board possessed ample specific factual information on the basis of which it reasonably could conclude that the appointment would not be consistent with the best interests of the University. We need only to observe that the Board was given the unenviable task and duty of passing upon and judging McConnell\u2019s application against the background of his actual conduct. So postured, it is at once apparent that this is not a case involving mere homosexual propensities on the part of a prospective employee. Neither is it a case in which an applicant is excluded from employment because of a desire clandestinely to pursue homosexual conduct. It is, instead, a case in which something more than remunerative employment is sought; a case in which the applicant seeks employment on his own terms; a case in which the prospective employee demands, as shown both by the allegations of. the complaint and by the marriage license incident as well, the right to pursue an activist role in <em>Amplementing </em>his unconventional ideas concerning the societal status to be accorded homosexuals and, thereby, to foist tacit' approval of this socially repugnant concept upon his employer, who is, in this instance, an institution of higher learning.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We know of no constitutional fiat or binding principle of decisional law which requires an employer to accede to such extravagant demands.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We are therefore unable fairly to categorize the Board\u2019s action here as arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\"> We turn briefly to the Board\u2019s claim that timely service of process had not been effected on its individual members at the time of the District Court hearing on the motion for preliminary injunctive relief. We regard this contention as legally frivolous. The chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>lenge was first raised during the hearing but pursued no further. In this posture, we feel that we would be justified in holding that the claim was waived. In any event, the crucial question in this regard is whether, on the facts present here, the Board received notice sufficient to afford it the opportunity to appear and to be heard.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We hold that it received such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Finally, without citing us to any de-cisional authority, the Board complains that Judge Neville improperly limited its right to cross-examine McConnell relative to his past conduct. We deem it unnecessary to consider this claim in light of our disposition of the Board\u2019s principal contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Reversed, with directions to dissolve the injunction and to dismiss the action on the merits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\">. McConnell acknowledges that no contract of employment was ever finalized since the Board of Regents refused to approve his application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\">. McConnell also asserted federal court jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1331 and 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1985 and 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343(4). We are satisfied that federal jurisdiction properly was invoked under \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1343(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-11\">. The facts are essentially undisputed, and the issue is whether, as a matter of law, the Board\u2019s action transcends constitutional limits. We therefore are not confined by the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. Rule 52(a), 28 U.S.C.A. United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127, 141-142, n. 16, 86 S.Ct. 1321, 16 L.Ed.2d 415 (1966). See also Sun Insurance Office v.

Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 568-575, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). In the District Court McConnell apparently argued that he has the right to apply for a marriage license and that such is \u201csymbolic speech\u201d within the protection of the Free Speech and Due Process clauses of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. See McConnell v. Anderson, p. 815 of 316 F.Supp. He relies largely on Tinker v. Des Moines Ind. School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969), a case from this circuit. Although this contention is not pressed here, we feel constrained to observe that we do not believe that <em>Tinker, </em>when read in light of its distinctive facts, can afford McConnell any comfort in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b296-17\">. <em>Cf. </em>Pickering v.
