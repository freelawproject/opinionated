One of the things they did on his advice to enhance their exemptions was to refinance their 1966 Chevrolet. The bank loaned them $2,325 on the car. From this amount they paid off the previous car loan and their attorney\u2019s fees, and deposited $800 in the Union F\u00e9deral Savings &amp; Loan Association. They then filed petitions in bankruptcy. They claimed that the $800 account was exempt from execution under California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 690.21 and was therefore exempt under section 6 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 24, though the automobile would not have been. The exemption was allowed by the Referee and upheld by the district court, 305 F.Supp. 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-18\">Wudrick\u2019s case is very similar: On the advice of bankruptcy counsel and in order to maximize his exemptions, he obtained a $2,197 loan from a finance company on two previously unencumbered vehicles about three weeks before filing his petition in bankruptcy. He put $1,-300 in shares of the St. Joseph\u2019s Children Employees\u2019 Federal Credit Union, exempt from execution under California Financial Code \u00a7 15406.1. His subsequent claim of exemption in bankruptcy was denied by the Referee, who found the transfer fraudulent. The district court upheld this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-19\">1. <em>Michelman v. Roon</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-20\">It has long been the rule in this and other jurisdictions that the purposeful conversion of nonexempt assets to exempt assets on the eve of bankruptcy is not fraudulent per se. In re Dudley, 72 F.Supp. 942, 945-947 (D.Cal.1947), aff\u2019d per curiam, Goggin v. Dudley, 166 F.2d 1023 (9th Cir.1948); Love v. Menick, 341 F.2d 680, 682-683 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>1965); <em>see </em>1 Collier on Bankruptcy, 6.11, p. 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">The Trustee argues that conversion of nonexempt assets to exempt assets on the eve of bankruptcy by creation of a secured debt and deposit of the proceeds in an exempt account is fraudulent as a matter of law and therefore a claim of exemption based on such a transfer is invalid. 1 Collier, <em>supra, </em>if 6.11, p. 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">We hold, however, that there is no significant distinction between the previously approved practice of conversion by sale and conversion by pledge as in the present ease. The creditor in a secured loan, like a purchaser, relies on the value of the property encumbered or transferred, and not the debtor\u2019s other assets. Thus he is not prejudiced. General creditors of the debtor may be, but no more so than when nonexempt property is sold outright and the proceeds converted into exempt property. Since no more is shown in either case than the intentional conversion of nonexempt property to exempt property, Love v. Menick, <em>supra, </em>controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">A different case would be presented if on the eve of bankruptcy a debt were created with no intention of repaying the creditor, either by purchasing goods on credit or borrowing money without security. <em>See </em>Love v. Menick, supra, at 682-683 of 341 F.2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-9\">2. <em>Wudrick v. Clements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-10\">The underlying question is the same as in <em>Roon. </em>The finding of fraud was based solely on the fact that nonexempt assets were deliberately converted to exempt assets just prior to filing the bankruptcy petition. Since we see no difference between a conversion of assets into exempt form by sale or by pledge, the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-14\">The Trustee also argues that Wudrick failed to carry his burden of proving entitlement to the exemption under California Financial Code \u00a7 15406 because he did not establish that the institution in which the funds were deposited was a \u201ccredit union\u201d or, if it was, that Wudrick was one of its \u201cmembers,\u201d within the meaning of the section<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-15\">It is not disputed that Wudrick held shares or certificates of deposit in the amount claimed in the \u201cSt. Joseph\u2019s Children Employees\u2019 Federal Credit Union.\u201d This was enough to establish a prima facie case since California statutes limit the issuance of credit union shares to qualified members (Cal.Fin. Code \u00a7 14800(b)), and prohibit use of the words \u201ccredit\u201d and \u201cunion\u201d in the name or title of any but an authorized credit union. Cal.Fin. Code \u00a7 14003.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-16\">The judgment is affirmed in <em>Roon, </em>No. 25,537, and reversed in <em>Wudrick, </em>No. 25,449.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1090-11\"> \u201c\u00a7 15406.
