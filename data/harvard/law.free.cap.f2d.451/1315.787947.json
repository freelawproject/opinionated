Count one charged that it was part of the conspiracy that Hernandez would \u201creceive, conceal, buy, sell and facilitate the transportation, concealment and sale of approximately five (5) kilos of cocaine\u201d after the cocaine would be imported into this country with Hernandez\u2019s knowledge. Count Two is identical, except that it refers to five kilos of heroin. On each count, Hernandez was sentenced to ten years imprisonment. We reverse as to these counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-20\">Hernandez was also convicted on two counts charging sale, dispensing or distributing of three grains of heroin and of ten grains of cocaine in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a). He was sentenced to five years on these counts. He does not assign error as to these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-21\">The conspiracy counts rest entirely on the testimony of one Merkle, a government informer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was instructed by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>customs agent to try to buy narcotics from Hernandez. He went from his home in El Centro, California to No-gales, Arizona, and called on Hernandez. He told Hernandez he wanted heroin and asked the price per ounce. Hernandez said that he dealt only in kilos; that he could get ten kilos; that the price was $35,000 per kilo; that he could also get cocaine, and that \u201cthey charged\u201d $40,000 per kilo. Merkle said he would have to notify his boss, and would return.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\">Next day, Merkle did return, and said he wanted samples. Hernandez said he would get samples from Nogales, Sonora, that night; that he would go there to get them. Later, Merkle returned and was told by Hernandez that he did not have the samples, \u201cas his friend had gone down to Santa Ana, Sonora, and he would be back * * * the following day.\u201d When Merkle again returned, Hernandez gave him the samples. (They are the subjects of counts III and IV). Merkle paid nothing for the samples. Merkle said that he would take them to his bosses \u201cwhere it would be analyzed to see if it was good quality material; \u201d if his bosses gave him the go ahead to buy, and if Hernandez \u201ccould obtain ten kilos [5 heroin, 5 cocaine] for me which he said was fine and dandy,\u201d it would take a couple of days to check it out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-5\">On his next visit, Merkle said that the cocaine had been cut. Hernandez said he was sorry, \u201cthat the sample was obtained from his source\u2019s wife and that is all she would give him, that as of that date his friend had not come back from Santa Ana, Sonora.\u201d They then discussed a rendezvous for delivery of the drugs, and after some exchange of threats, in which Hernandez said that \u201cif anything happened to him, his friends would kill [Merkle],\u201d they parted. There were two subsequent phone conversations. Then Merkle got a threatening phone call from someone he could not identify, and the matter ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-10\">The government has the good grace not to claim that the conspiracy was between Hernandez and Merkle. What it claims is that the jury could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Hernandez was conspiring with someone unknown to obtain the drugs for Merkle. Such a finding would have to rest entirely on Merkle\u2019s statements that Hernandez said that \u201cthey\u201d charged $40,000 for a kilo of cocaine, that he would get samples in Nogales, Sonora, that he failed to get them because his friend had gone to Santa Ana, that the samples had been obtained from his source\u2019s wife, and that his friend had not come back from Santa Ana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-11\">This is just too thin. It amounts to saying that if A asks B to sell contraband, and B says he will get it from C, B can be convicted of conspiring with C to sell to A. That does not follow. C may know that B intends to resell, or he may not. Even if he does, that alone does not make him party to a conspiracy to sell to A. In substance, Hernandez has been convicted for talking bigger than his performance. Over and over we hear cases in which B says he has a \u201csource\u201d from whom he got drugs that he sells to A. If this conviction should stand, it would be precedent for charging B, in each such case, both with the sale and with conspiring with his source to buy and resell. We decline to hand the government such power in cases where the conviction rests on nothing but what the buyer says the seller said. To paraphrase Judge Learned Hand in United States v. Reina, 2 Cir., 1957, 242 F.2d 302, 306:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1416-12\">\u201c[Hernandez\u2019s] own declaration was of course competent against him, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>it was altogether equivocal as to the source of his supply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1417-5\">We think that the most that can be said for the government\u2019s case is that it indicates that Hernandez knew someone from whom he could get narcotics in Mexico. It does not even show that Hernandez ever discussed this transaction with his source, but only that he got samples from the source\u2019s wife. It tells us nothing else about what agreement, if any, Hernandez had, either with the \u201csource\u201d or the wife. That is not enough to prove the conspiracy charge, which we have quoted at the beginning of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-6\">We are cited to no case that goes as far as we would have to go to uphold this conviction. The principles applied in Miller v. United States, 9 Cir., 1967, 382 F.2d 583, 587, and Chavez v. United States, 9 Cir., 1960, 275 F.2d 813, 817, require reversal here. See also United States v. Koch, 2 Cir., 1940, 113 F.2d 982, 983, which is closely in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-7\">The judgment of conviction under counts I and II is reversed, with directions to dismiss those counts. The judgment of conviction under counts III and IV is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1415-13\">. Government informants, according to their testimony, are remarkably public spirited individuals. Thus, Merkle testified that he worked for customs for some seven months, entirely without pay \u201cin order to get a hold of some of these people who are dealing in narcotics.\u201d He had no other reason to work for customs. He got money, for hotel rooms or travelling expenses. There were times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>when he had to get out to work in order to make some money to eat.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-7\">However, he had been indicted for selling narcotics some seven years before. That charge had never been dismissed, and was set for trial 10 days after he testified. He was promised no leniency. But he did \u201ckind of hope\u201d that his assisting the government would assist in the outcome of his case, and \u201cwish they would give [him] a little leniency.\u201d He did not feel, however, that the better job he did, the better chances of leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-14\">The record does not reveal what kind of leniency he got for the job he did.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
