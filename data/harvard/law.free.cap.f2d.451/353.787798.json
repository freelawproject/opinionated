United States, 1950, 340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152. Under the <em>Feres </em>doctrine, the government is not liable under the Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b), \u201cfor injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\u201d 340 U.S. at 146, 71 S.Ct. at 159. Plaintiff seeks to distinguish, or more exactly, asks us not to follow, that case on the ground that the various rationale supporting it have been cut away, if not eliminated. We may assume that to some extent plaintiff is correct, but we think too facile his claim that there can be no valid economic reason for allowing recovery by a discharged soldier for malpractice in a veterans hospital, and denying recovery for such injury while on active duty. Congress may well wish to recognize one standard for veterans\u2019 benefits, and to provide a different package for in-service injury and disability. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Even more basic, we reject plaintiff\u2019s contention that <em>Feres </em>is inapplicable in any case where no military discipline was involved \u2014 \u201cthere must [he says] be a rational connection between the activity which injured plaintiff and the discipline.\u201d Even though there may have been no disciplinary element in this ease, the much abused invocation of Pandora\u2019s Box will surely become appropriate if plaintiff\u2019s principle were to be established. If every injury \u201caris[ing] out of or * * * incident to service,\u201d 340 U.S. at 146, 71 S.Ct. at 159, must invite inquiry, not only would the difficulties of what, legally, would constitute discipline-connected be substantial, but the Armed Services would be faced with maintaining a claims department. Such avenues should be opened \u2014 if they are to be \u2014 by Congress. <em>Feres </em>required no nexus between discipline and injury. We see no occasion to depart therefrom, even if we could. For recent decisions resisting similar importunities, <em>see </em>Buckingham v. United States, 4 Cir., 1968, 394 F.2d 483; Shults v. United States, 5 Cir., 1969, 421 F.2d 170; Lowe v. United States, 5 Cir., 1971, 440 F.2d 452, cert. denied, 1971, 404 U.S. 833, 92 S.Ct. 83, 30 L.Ed.2d 64, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
