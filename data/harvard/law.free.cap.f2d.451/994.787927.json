The parties stipulated to the referee\u2019s summary of the evidence, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-24\">Between October 10, 1968 and May 27,. 1969, on designated dates, Gowen sold to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>Bourbon the staves involved in this litigation. Bourbon took possession of a number of them, but left a large quantity on the bankrupt\u2019s premises. for curing. More than 125,000 staves were on the bankrupt\u2019s premises at the time of bankruptcy, August 4, 1969. Subsequent thereto and prior to the issuance on March 7, 1970, of a restraining order Bourbon caused a number of the staves to be removed from bankrupt\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">This litigation was initiated by the filing by Bourbon of a petition to reclaim property and to dissolve the restraining order. The Trustee filed a counterclaim for an amount equal to the value of the staves removed by Bourbon after bankruptcy and before the restraining order was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">The referee in bankruptcy, on the basis of the evidence and the applicable law, dismissed Bourbon\u2019s petition to reclaim, and found that the trustee was entitled to a judgment against Bourbon in the sum of $23,008.35, that being the value of the staves improperly removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">Upon petition for review the United States District Court, Judge Harper, adopted the referee\u2019s memorandum and decision. The case is here on appeal from the order of the district court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">The question for resolution is whether the referee and the district court correctly decided that bankrupt\u2019s sales of the staves to Bourbon were fraudulent and void as to bankrupt\u2019s creditors within the meaning of the Missouri Statute \u00a7 428.080 V.A.M.S., and by reason of \u00a7 70 of the Bankruptcy Act were void as to the trustee in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-9\">Section 428.080 V.A.M.S. provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-10\">\u201cEvery sale made by a vendor of goods and chattels in his possession or under his control, unless the same be accompanied by delivery in a reasonable time, regard being had to the situation of the property, and be followed by an actual and continued change of the possession of the things sold, shall be held to be fraudulent and void, as against the creditors of the vendor. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-11\">It has been held that \u201cpossession,\u201d actual or constructive, is the key element in determining whether the transaction under scrutiny is void as to the creditors and trustee of the bankrupt. See and compare In re Ozark Cooperage and Lumber Co., 180 F. 105 (8th Cir.1910); 22 A.L.R. 1330n, and State ex rel. E. Sondheimer Co. v. Stone et al., 111 Mo.App. 364, 85 S.W. 950 (1905).</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-12\">Whether Bourbon as claimant of the property was in constructive possession of the staves presented a question of fact. The able and experienced referee, upon a studious evaluation of the evidence, found against Bourbon and concluded that the rationale of the cases above cited dictated the rendition of the judgment under attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-13\">We are convinced that there was substantial evidence to support the referee\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and that the district court properly adopted the same. We are not persuaded that the Uniform Commercial Code, particularly \u00a7 400.2-402(1) V.A. M.S., requires a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
