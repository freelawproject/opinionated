This order was based on the district court\u2019s finding that \u201cto best serve the purposes of \u00a7 431 (c), we think that the plaintiffs\u2019 accountant is entitled to remove the notes, computations, and other work papers which he prepares in the course of a \u00a7 431(c) examination from the defendants\u2019 premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-15\">The testimony supports the district court\u2019s findings and conclusions that plaintiffs\u2019 \u201caccountant must be free to conduct the examination in accordance with * * * unrestricted access to and use of his own work papers.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1288-16\">The following language was inserted by the House in Senate Bill #1555, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>which eventually became P.L. 86-257 (\u00a7 201(c)) and appears in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 431 (c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-4\">\u201cEvery labor organization required to submit a report under this title shall make available the information required to be contained in such report to all of its members, and every such labor organization and its officers shall be under a duty enforceable at the suit of any member of such organization * * 'x' in the district court of the United States for the district in which such labor organization maintains its principal office, to permit such member for just cause to examine any books, records, and accounts necessary to verify such report.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">House Report #741 (86th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, 1959, p. 2424) contains this language, showing that Congress intended by the above-quoted wording of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 431(c) to rely on the voluntary action of union members as a deterrent to the abuse of union funds by union officials:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An7o\">\u201cIt is the purpose of this bill to insure that full information concerning the financial and internal administrative practices and procedures of labor organizations shall be, in the first instance available to the members of such organizations. In addition, this information is to be made available to the Government, and through the Secretary of Labor, is to be open to inspection by the general public. By such disclosure, and by relying on voluntary action by members of labor organizations, it is hoped that a deterrent to abuses will be established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aeo-dedup-0\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmAr\">\u201cThe committee believes that union members armed with adequate information and having the benefit of secret elections, as provided for in title IV of this bill, will be greatly strengthened in their efforts to rid themselves of untrustworthy or corrupt officers. In addition, the exposure to public scrutiny of all vital information concerning the operation of trade unions will help deter repetition of the financial abuses disclosed by the McClellan committee.\u201d (Pp. 2436. 2431).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1289-9\">The above-quoted language requires the rejection of defendants\u2019 contention that Congress was relying solely on action by the Department of Labor to cure the abuses which the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (P. L. 86-257) was designed to correct. Cf. Gartner v. Soloner, 384 F.2d 348, 355 (3d Cir. 1967). The insertion of the above-quoted language in \u00a7 201(c) of that Act by the Conference Committee (see page 2504 of 2 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 1959), demonstrates that that Committee accepted the House\u2019s desire that \u201cfull information\u201d concerning the financial procedures of labor organizations \u201cshall be, <em>in the first instance available to the members of such organizations.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-10\">This case is an appropriate one for summary disposition. See Rule 27 of Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Groendyke Transport, Inc. v. Davis, 406 F.2d 1158, 1162 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 1012, 89 S.Ct. 1628, 23 L.Ed.2d 39 (1969); Page v. United States, 356 F.2d 337, 339 (9th Cir. 1966); United States ex rel. Walker v. Young, 388 F.2d 675, 676 (9th Cir. 1968);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>cf. </em>Local Rule 2(4) of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the motion for summary affirmance will be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1288-11\">. See Antal et al. v. District 5, United Mine Workers of America, et al., 334 F. Supp. 903 (W.D.Pa.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1288-12\">. In the December 1970 election of District 5 officers, plaintiff Louis A. Antal was a candidate for District President, plaintiff Joseph Daniels was a candidate for District Secretary-Treasurer, and plaintiff Nick DeVince was a candidate for International Executive Board Member, all on the MFD slate. The election was bitterly contested and the result extremely close. After the District Tellers declared the incumbents re-elected, plaintiffs complained to the Department of Labor, alleging violations of Title IV of LMRDA; the Department has brought suit to set the election aside, Hodgson v. UMWA, District 5 (W.D.Pa., O.A. No. 71-701).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1288-13\">. The certified copies of the District 5 LM-2 Reports for the years 1968, 1969, and 1970, which were before the district court listed more than $1,236,000. in income and expenditures by District 5 over this three-year period. Verification of these Reports will require analysis of a multitude of individual transactions. For example, many persons have been paid during this three-year period as employees earning less than $10,000. Their names are not listed on the LM-2 Reports, nor are their \u201csalaries\u201d and \u201creimbursed expenses\u201d itemized. Only through unrestricted use of their work papers can plaintiffs\u2019 accountants determine the extent to which unitemized expense categories listed on the LM-2 Reports are verified by records of legitimate expenditures. To refuse plaintiffs\u2019 accountants the free use of their work papers would be \u2014 as the district court held \u2014 equivalent to a refusal of plaintiffs\u2019 right of verification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">. The House inserted this language in its version of this Bill (H.R. 8342) and, as noted below, this language was approved by the Conference Committee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">. Defendants conceded that they had no authorities to present to the court on the issue involved in this case, other than those cited in plaintiffs\u2019 brief and in the opinion of the district court (see note 1 above). This issue was correctly recognized by the district court to be the right of an accountant, retained by union members to carry out a verification of LM-2 Reports of a labor organization, to remove his own work papers from the site of the examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
