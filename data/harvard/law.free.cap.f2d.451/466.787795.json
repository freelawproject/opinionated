Her sole defense <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a claim that the questions are the product of information obtained by the government as the result of an illegal electronic surveillance, hereafter, all-inclusively, tap. She makes no Fifth Amendment claim, having been granted immunity prior to the questioning. The grand jury is, allegedly, investigating matters relating to the wrongful appropriation and distribution of certain classified Defense Department documents, widely known as the Pentagon Papers. One Daniel Ellsberg is said to have had a primary connection therewith. Marx is his mother-in-law. Her defense to the contempt order involves primarily a consideration of the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control &amp; Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510 et seq., which she asserts entitled her to an evidentiary hearing to probe the possible taps leading to her questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Invocations of this act by grand jury witnesses have already led to diverse decisions, and even more diverse opinions, in a number of circuits. <em>See, e. g., </em>Carter v. United States, 9 Cir., 1969, 417 F. 2d 384, 388, cert, denied 399 U.S. 935, 90 S.Ct. 2253, 26 L.Ed.2d 807 (for government) ; In re Egan, 3 Cir., 1971 (5-2, en banc) 450 F.2d 199 (for witness); In re Evans, D.C.Cir., 1971 (2-1) 452 F.2d 1239 (for witness). This case differs in that the government has made a disclaimer. Marx denied its sufficiency both in form and in substance. Because we think the disclaimer sufficient in view of the ground on which we decide the case, we will assume that <em>Egan </em>and <em>Evans </em>were rightly decided against the government. We do not by this accept the reasoning of all of the individual opinions, except to say that none is contrary to the result that we reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">Our first question is the precise extent of the government\u2019s disclaimer, it having been expressed progressively, as the case proceeded, in various forms. In each instance it was made by Mr. Reese, an Assistant U. S. Attorney from Los Angeles, a principal prosecutor of Ellsberg there, and a lead attorney in presenting the government\u2019s witnesses to the grand jury here. We take its final form made in the government brief, and detailed orally before us to elucidate earlier claimed ambiguities, to be that he had a basis for the questioning; that he knew of no tap that entered into that basis, and that, so far as he could ascertain, there had been no tap of Marx or anyone else that led to the questioning. He added that he had been specifically informed by the Department of Justice that no tap of any kind had ever been made on Marx herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">Because we wanted to be certain, if it was possible to be, that no reservations remained with respect to this last circumstance, after argument we asked the government to supply in affidavit form, if it could do so, a definite assertion that there had been no tap invading Marx\u2019s personal rights. It has since so done.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Under these circumstances the posture of the case is that the government has fully disclaimed with respect to personal taps, but could be said not to have sufficiently done so if it is necessary to deny in absoluate terms, <em>cf. </em>Alderman (Kolod) v. United States, 1968, 390 U.S. 136, 88 S.Ct. 752, 19 L.Ed.2d 962; s. c., 1969, 394 U.S. 165, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L. Ed.2d 176, third party taps that may, conceivably, have led to her questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The relevant statutory provisions, U. S.C. Title 18, sections 2515, 2518(10) (a), 2510(11), and 3504(a) (1), are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The government contends that guides to the meaning of these provisions are to be found in the legislative history. Its first point is that the omission of the words \u201cgrand jury\u201d in section 2518(10) (a) can be shown to be deliberate. This argument is set forth, and rebutted, in Judge Adams\u2019 opinion in <em>Egan. </em>We assume, for present purposes, the correctness of the rebuttal, although not without some doubts, particularly if a claim may be made as easily as Marx contends, and a response in the form described in the third paragraph of this opinion, ante, is to be regarded as insufficient. Assuming, however, that the section 2518 (10) (a) procedure is applicable in all grand jury proceedings, Marx still faces the question whether, in view of the sufficient denial that any taps were made affecting her own personal rights, she was an \u201caggrieved person\u201d to press a claim that her questioning was the result of leads obtained by illegal taps on someone else. We hold the answer to that question is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Unless changed by the recent statute, the law on this subject is clear. An illegal seizure cannot be complained of unless some right of the complaining party has been invaded. Jones v. United States, 1960, 362 U.S. 257, 260-261, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697. Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 1920, 251 U.S. 385, 392, 40 S.Ct. 182, 64 L.Ed. 319, principally relied on in <em>Evans, </em>and in a number of the opinions of the majority judges in <em>Egan, </em>involved an unlawful seizure of the defendant\u2019s own books. If a witness who is not yet a defendant is to be given a right not to testify based upon an invasion of the rights of some third party, it should require a strong showing of a legislative purpose to make so substantial a change. In the act\u2019s giving standing to complain to an \u201caggrieved person,\u201d and in defining such as \u201ca party to any intercepted * * * communication or a person against whom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>interception was directed,\u201d section 2510 (11), ante, there is nothing to suggest such a change. In a footnote to an opinion handed down shortly after the act was passed, Mr. Justice White, speaking for the Court, considered the legislative history and expressly rejected the idea that the act expanded traditional concepts of standing developed under F.R. Crim.P. 41(e). Alderman v. United States, 1969, 394 U.S. 165, 175 n. 9, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Since Marx, in effect, asks us to disregard the Court\u2019s footnote as ill-considered dictum, we will briefly review her position. We find the legislative history in accord with the Court\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is nothing to the contrary in <em>Egan </em>or <em>Evans, </em>in spite of Marx\u2019s constant invocation of the opinions in those cases. In In re Egan the court addressed itself exclusively to invasions of the witness\u2019 own rights, made no reference to third party taps, and employed reasoning applicable to personal rights. While the majority opinions in In re Evans contain no such express articulation, Judge Bazelon, in whose opinion Judge Wright concurred except with respect to a matter not here relevant, speaks of <em>Egan </em>as \u201cdirectly in point,\u201d 452 F.2d p. 1242, and relies principally upon Silverthome Lumber Co., also a personal invasion case. We take his statement that the affiants \u201c[stated] their belief that wiretapping and electronic surveillance had been directed against them,\u201d p. 1242, as referring to the direct invasion considered in <em>Egan, </em>and not to third party taps against which Marx would protest here.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Marx\u2019s only answer to counter her own apparent recognition that she is not an \u201caggrieved person\u201d within section 2518 (10), is an assertion that \u201cit hardly seems possible that it is the only remedy.\u201d She adds that she is \u201caware of statements in the legislative history <em>* * </em>[which have been argued to be] inconsistent with [her] position,\u201d but says she believes the majority opinions in <em>Egan </em>and <em>Evans </em>answer it. No note is taken of the fact that the <em>Egan </em>and <em>Evans </em>\u201canswers\u201d have no relation to this question. No vestige of support is offered for Marx\u2019s supposition that when the act defined standing it contemplated that relief would be available as well to those who lacked it.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Since it is arguable that no sufficient disclaimer of personal taps on Marx was made until the case reached this court, we assume and resolve that issue in her favor, and vacate the order of contempt. The substantive questions, however, having been fully argued, the district court is instructed that it may hold the witness in contempt if she fails to appear and refuses to further answer on the ground of electronic surveillance on the present record. Since such refusal would, in our opinion, be frivolous, the court is instructed in such event not to admit the witness to bail until further order of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">Mandate to issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-10\">.
