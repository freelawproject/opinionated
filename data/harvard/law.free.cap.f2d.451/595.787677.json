He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-23\">Smith contends that the admission into evidence of certain extra-judicial statements allegedly made by his co-defendant, which inculpated Smith in the crimes charged, violated Smith\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. The two were jointly tried, but the evidence of the co-defendant\u2019s statements was admitted against him alone. Moreover, the co-defendant testified favorably to Smith concerning the crime and was available for full cross-examination. Under Nelson v. O\u2019Neil, 402 U.S. 622, 91 S.Ct. 1723, 29 L.Ed.2d 222 (1971), Smith was therefore not denied his Sixth Amendment rights. <em>See also </em>California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149, 90 S. Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number> Smith also argues that a jury instruction relative to the existence of a \u201ccommon plan\u201d constituted reversible error. Since he made no objection to the instruction in the District Court, reversal would be appropriate only if we could hold that the instruction was plainly and prejudicially erroneous. Pratti v. United States, 389 F.2d 660, 662 (9th Cir. 1968). While the instruction was somewhat ambiguous, it did not, in light of other instructions given and the evidence that Smith was in possession of the heroin, constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
