It is settled law in this Circuit that the point may be preserved for appeal provided the reservation is \u201caccepted by the court with the Government\u2019s consent.\u201d United States v. Doyle, 348 F.2d 715, 719 (2d Cir. 1965). See also United States v. D\u2019Amato, 436 F.2d 52, 53 (3d Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-16\">Here neither the trial judge nor the prosecutor gave any consent whatever. All Judge Cannella said was, \u201cI make no judgment at this time whether there is an appealable motion or whether any relief can be granted.\u201d The prosecutor said nothing. The consents referred to in Judge Friendly\u2019s opinion in Doyle must be clearly stated in writing or on the trial record and not left to equivocal inference. Accordingly, the guilty plea waived the claim of violation of rights under the Sixth Amendment as well as all other non-jurisdictional defects. United States v. Doyle, <em>supra, </em>348 F.2d 715 (2d Cir. 1965); United States v. Spada, 331 F.2d 995 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 865, 85 S.Ct. 130, 13 L. Ed.2d 67 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-17\">The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
