We affirm on the basis of the first stated ground, and therefore need not and do not express any opinion on the soundness of the district court\u2019s other bases for its decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-14\">\n<em>History of the Penn Central Tariff</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A8o\">This case had its inception when Penn Central filed with the Commission tariff schedules setting forth additional charges for lighterage service at New York Harbor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The additional charges were published to become effective on May 29, 1971. Following protests by appellants and others to the increased rates, the Board of Suspension, an employee board created by the Commission, suspended the effective date of the tariffs for the statutory period of seven months and instituted an investigation into the lawfulness of the proposed rates.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-15\">Penn Central then filed a petition for reconsideration and vacation of the suspension order with an appellate division of the Commission.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On June 28, 1971, this division denied the petition, but authorized Penn Central to publish tariffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>containing additional lighterage charges not to exceed 50% of those initially proposed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, this order directed Penn Central to maintain an account from which payments could be refunded to the extent that the proposed tariffs were not justified before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Appellants then filed with the Commission a petition to reconsider the June 28th order.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Pending consideration of this petition, the Commission stayed the June 28th order.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On July 28, 1971, the Commission denied the petition for reconsideration.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">\n<em>Jurisdiction Over Suspension Orders</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Appellants concede that the initial decision of whether to suspend the effective date of proposed tariffs is within the sole discretion of the Commission.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, they contend that once the Suspension Board decides to suspend the effective date of proposed tariffs, the Commission in its appellate capacity cannot arbitrarily reverse this decision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The apparent theory underlying this contention is that it is a violation of due process for the Commission to reverse without deliberation a decision of its Suspension Board that is reached after careful deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-18\">We reject appellants\u2019 contention. First, appellants exaggerate the care with which the Suspension Board approaches its task and the carelessness with which the appellate division approaches its task. The purpose of suspension proceedings is to determine whether it would be in the interests of the public to suspend the effective date of proposed rates pending an investigation into the lawfulness of such rates.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The proceedings are informal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> No \u201cfindings\u201d of fact in the judicial sense of the term are made. A transcript of the proceedings is not taken. Subpoenas cannot be issued. The petitions and replies are generally not verified under oath. That suspension orders through time contain the same wording further belies the validity of the contention that these proceedings are deliberate.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Finally, the appellate division, contrary to appellants\u2019 contention, did in the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>case give a reason for its modification of the original suspension order.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>,</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">More importantly, appellants\u2019 contention must fail on logical and legal grounds. First, it makes little sense to argue that the decisions of the Commission in its appellate capacity should be subject to judicial review after conceding that the decisions of the Commission\u2019s Suspension Board are not subject to judicial review.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The reasons for insulating the decision to suspend the effective date of proposed tariffs from judicial scrutiny in the first instance apply with equal force to the appellate decision. First, to permit judicial review of appellate decisions would invite the competitive inequities and the diversity among court decisions that initially prompted Congress to insulate the suspension decision from judicial review.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Second, permitting the courts to review appellate decisions would encourage that very interference with the orderly review of tariff proposals that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is intended to preclude.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Arrow Transportation Co. v. Southern Railway Co., there was a conflict among three-judge district courts on the question of whether Commission orders vacating suspension orders are judicially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>reviewable.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We believe that <em>Arrow </em>has resolved this conflict in favor of those courts holding no review.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> While it is true that the holding of <em>Arrow </em>does not directly control the issue here,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the opinion in the case clearly indicates that courts are not-to interfere with suspension proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-4\">We cannot believe that Congress would have given such detailed consideration to the period of suspension [the consideration manifested in the legislative history of the Commission\u2019s suspension powers] unless it meant thereby to vest in the Commission the sole and exclusive power to suspend and to withdraw from the judiciary any pre-existing power to grant in-junctive relief. This Court has previously indicated its view that the present section had that effect. In Board of Railroad Comm\u2019rs of State of North Dakota v. Great Northern R. Co., 281 U.S. 412, 429, 50 S.Ct. 391, 74 L.Ed. 936, Chief Justice Hughes said for the Court: \u201cThis power of suspension was entrusted to the Commission only.\u201d The lower federal courts have said as much. And the commentators on the matter have consistently supported the soundness of that view <footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">The basis of the decision in Arrow\u2014 that to permit judicial interference with the Commission\u2019s suspension procedures would invite the very disruption in the orderly review of the lawfulness of proposed tariffs that Congress meant to preclude \u2014 applies with equal force to the issue now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">Thei <em>June 28th Order and NEPA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">The City argues that the failure of the Commission to accompany its June 28th order with an environmental impact statement violates section 102(2) (C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The City contends that the increased lighterage tariffs will cause the diversion of a substantial amount of traffic from barges and scows to trucks, and that the is-creased use of trucks will substantially worsen the already poor quality of New York\u2019s air. The City thus asks for a stay of the order permitting Penn Central to effect interim increases in lighterage tariffs until an environmental impact statement is prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">We disagree with the City. To grant its request would defeat the very purpose of NEPA. The Act itself, the legislative history of the Act, the President\u2019s Executive Order implementing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>Act, the guidelines for federal agencies issued by the Council on Environmental Quality, the courts that have interpreted the Act, and commentators clearly establish that NEPA requires a careful evaluation by federal agencies of the nonenvironmental benefits and environmental costs of their actions.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As the court said in the recent <em>Calvert </em>Cliffs\u2019<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-ZH\">NEPA mandates a case-by-ease balancing judgment on the part of federal agencies. In each individual case, the particular economic and technical benefits of planned action must be assessed and then weighed against the environmental costs; alternatives must be considered which would affect the balance of values. * * * The magnitude of possible benefits and possible costs may lie anywhere on a broad spectrum. Much will depend on the particular magnitudes involved in particular cases. In some cases, the benefits will be great enough to justify a certain quantum of environmental costs; in other cases, they will not be so great and the proposed action may have to be abandoned or significantly altered so as to bring the benefits and costs into a proper balance. The point of the individualized balancing analysis is to ensure that, with possible alterations, the optimally beneficial action is finally taken.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">The detailed evaluation of benefits and costs required by NEPA is not possible at the stage of the review of the lawfulness of proposed tariffs under focus here. As described above, suspension proceedings are informal, intended to determine only whether the effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>date of proposed tariffs should be suspended pending a full investigation of the lawfulness of the proposals. They are simply not amenable to the careful balancing analysis mandated by NEPA. It would, therefore, frustrate the purpose of the Act to require the Commission at this stage in its review processes to determine the environmental impact of the proposed tariffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">One might argue that a simple solution to the problem caused by the constraint of time is to require the Commission to preserve the <em>status quo </em>pending the preparation of an environmental impact statement. In the instant case this would mean staying Penn Central\u2019s proposed tariffs. But such a solution is too simple. It overlooks the fact that preserving the <em>status quo </em>can be as detrimental to the environment as permitting changes in the <em>status quo. </em>Just as cities can argue that increases in tariffs cause the diversion of traffic to trucks, thereby increasing air pollution, so railroads can argue that losses incurred on one line must be made up on another either in the form of increased tariffs or decreased quality of service, which in turn discourage the use of this other line, thereby diverting traffic to trucks (or, in the case of passenger lines, to automobiles), which diversion in turn causes an increase in air pollution.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The proper forum for the City to present its contentions on the envi-ronmentab impact of the increased light-erage tariffs is the commission in the investigation now being conducted into the lawfulness of these tariffs.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> There the Commission can hear evidence on the environmental costs of the proposed tariffs, and make the careful balancing analysis that NEPA requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-6\">.
