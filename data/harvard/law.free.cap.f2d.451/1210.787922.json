We find both these contentions without merit, and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-25\">The trial judge charged that the defense would have adequately raised the entrapment issue if the jury found \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that government agents had induced Groob to commit a crime. Appellant claims that the word \u201ccredible\u201d did not adequately define the burden of proof, and that the jury might even have assumed that the defense had to prove inducement beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree. \u201cCredible evidence\u201d is virtually identical to \u201csome evidence,\u201d which we have frequently upheld as the proper burden on the defense to raise the entrapment issue. United States v. Braver, 450 F.2d 799 (2d Cir. 1971) (if the jury \u201cfinds some evidence of government initiation of the illegal conduct, the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was ready and willing to commit the crime\u201d); United States v. Berger, 433 F.2d 680, 684 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 962, 91 S.Ct. 970, 28 L.Ed.2d 246 (1971) and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-4\">Appellant claims that the conduct of the government agent constituted entrapment as a matter of law. This court has only recently reaffirmed the well-settled rule that, since the entrapment defense is directed to avoiding guilt and not the propriety of governmental conduct, the issue is one for the jury. United States v. Mascia, 447 F.2d 111 (2d Cir. 1971) and eases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
