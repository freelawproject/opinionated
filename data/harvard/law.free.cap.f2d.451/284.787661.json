BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b385-21\">When this case was first before this Court and we reversed the preceding dismissal for failure to state a claim,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> our opinion cautioned \u201cthis [remand] may turn out to have been a sterile exercise.\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Now, two years later and more than six years after Appellant Webbs\u2019 fateful fall from a ladder ascending a Standard Oil Company gas storage tank, we find that that prediction was painfully accurate. It is, unfortunately, double proof that the shortest way around is often the longest way through. Accordingly, we affirm the Trial Court\u2019s judgment n. o. v. (F.R.Civ.P. 50(b)) after a jury verdict for the Plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-22\">Having declined to speculate as to the truth or falsity of the allegations contained in the petition, we remanded this case at its earlier appearance before this Court for a full development of the facts, not merely what the lawyers said the facts would be.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Indeed, it was worse than that, since what the lawyers said the facts would be was shrouded in the mystery of conclusory pleading jargon.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>The wisdom of that course \u2014 though admittedly it resulted in a delay in concluding the case and an extra burden on this and the Trial Court \u2014 is borne out by the fact that the evidence presented at trial portrays a substantially different picture \u2014 or more accurately, discloses a more full, factual picture \u2014 than that depicted by the allegations of the complaint, necessarily assumed to be true before.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Now that all the facts are in, including revealing, indisputable photographs, we find that that description, based on the assumption that all allegations of the complaint are true, omits or distorts certain important aspects of the overall factual setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">(i) The stay posts were not too large to be grasped by a man\u2019s hand, but rather the <em>side rail </em>was \u201calmost too big to grasp that side with the hands.\u201d This is material because Plaintiff\u2019s customary procedure for ascending the ladder was \u201cfireman style,\u201d that is, by holding onto the rungs, not the side rail.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">(ii) Unmentioned in the complaint is the fact that Plaintiff was carrying a tape measure in one hand as he climbed the ladder on the occasion of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">(iii) Standard Oil\u2019s \u201cassurances\u201d that the ladder would be repaired, allegedly given some 30 to 45 days before the accident, turns out to have been merely the casual remark of one of Standard Oil\u2019s auditors that \u201cI\u2019ll see if I live long enough that we get this corrected for you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">(iv) Even if that statement could somehow be construed as a promise, there was no reasonable basis for reliance, because \u2014 the fully developed facts indicate \u2014 Plaintiff had been requesting and (on his own story) Standard Oil had been \u201cpromising\u201d alteration of the ladder since 1949 \u2014 some 16 years before the asserted \u201cassurance\u201d on which detrimental reliance is claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">(v) A vitally important link in the chain of evidence, but understandably missing from Plaintiff\u2019s complaint is the fact that the length of time Plaintiff had been using the ladder in question was 24% years \u2014 and for 20 years he had been climbing it at least once a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">When all these embellishments are added to the scene, we obtain an entirely different view \u2014 one with which we, as did the Trial Judge, are compelled to conclude, reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment could not fail to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">Only the \u201csuccessive contentions and counter contentions of the parties\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on theories advanced, resisted by exceptions to the general rule, and re-resisted by exceptions to the exceptions,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> obscure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the simplicity of this case in its now fully revealed substance. Quite naturally, the parties devote much attention in their briefs to characterizing the relationship between Plaintiff and Standard Oil in familiar legal jargon. Standard Oil urges that its duty was that of a principal to his agent or a landowner to his invitee. Plaintiff, in his attempt to describe the relationship, suggests some <em>quasi </em>master-servant theory to control.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\"> We are of the opinion that it is not necessary to light upon any specific characterization,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for no matter what label we attach to the relationship, there was no breach of Georgia duty<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to one who weekly, for 20 years, voluntarily undertook what he described as a very dangerous activity, continually averting to the hazards of his adventure, knowing directly of the risks and the decades of unfilled promises of correction. When one day \u2014 predictably and predicted \u2014 he is felled by the peril he knowingly flouted and tempted so long, he must bear the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">Even if we characterize the relationship in the light most favorable to Plaintiff and heed his urging that some <em>quasi </em>master-servant theory controls this case,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> his actions with full knowledge of the dangers and after realizing that Standard Oil\u2019s assurances of correction could not be relied on, constituted a bar to recovery, for they made out a case of Georgia assumption of the risk, exceptions to the general rule and exceptions to the exceptions notwithstanding. In a sort of \u201cjuridical <em>vingtet-un\" </em><footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiff opened with Georgia Code Section 66-301,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to establish a duty on Standard Oil to provide equipment reasonably safe for all persons who operate it with diligence. Standard Oil countered with Georgia Code Section 66-303 <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u2014assumption of risk by servants \u2014 which exculpates the master from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u00a7 66-301 liability where the servant has knowledge of the defect or danger. Plaintiff responded with an exception to that exception \u2014 if the servant points out the danger to the master and the master orders the servant to pursue the dangerous activity anyway, the master is liable for any injury which results. Bush v. West Yellow Pine Co., 1907, 2 Ga.App. 295, 58 S.E. 529. But Standard Oil still had its turn to draw, and did so by invoking an exception to the exception to the exception \u2014 if the facts are such that the servant cannot reasonably rely on the \u201cassurances\u201d of the master, the servant must bear the loss from injury resulting from obvious dangers, despite the fact that his actions were sanctioned by the master. Elliott v. Tifton Mill &amp; Gin Co., 1913, 12 Ga. App. 498, 77 S.E. 667; Borochoff v. Fowler, 1958, 98 Ga.App. 411, 105 S.E. 2d 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">So even if we adopt the standard most favorable to Plaintiff and press it to the greatest extreme, Plaintiff cannot prevail, for Standard Oil fulfilled its duty under Georgia law. If \u2014 as sought by the Plaintiff \u2014 he had the benefits of a <em>quasi </em>master-servant status, he has to take the burden with the benefit in the form of assumption of the risk or some theory analogous to it. And that result, though established some 60 years ago, would still obtain in Georgia courts, as the recent Georgia Court of Appeals case of Yankey v. Battle, 1970, 122 Ga. App. 275, 176 S.E.2d 714 demonstrates. In that case, a domestic servant fell down a darkened flight of stairs in her employer\u2019s home. Although the Plain-v tiff had informed the employer of the defective lighting and had received assurances that corrective action would be taken and despite the fact that use of the unsafe stairway was necessary to reach the restroom which Plaintiff was required to use, the Georgia Court refused to hold the employer liable and reversed the Trial Court\u2019s failure to grant summary judgment for Defendant, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">\u201cOne who voluntarily takes a risk of physical injury, the danger of which is so obvious that the act of taking the risk, in and of itself, amounts to a failure to exercise ordinary care and diligence for his own safety, cannot hold another liable. Southland Butane Gas Co. v. Blackwell, [1955] 211 Ga. 665, 88 S.E.2d 6. It is not in dispute that plaintiff knowingly entered the stairway while it was in a darkened condition. This is a clear and undisputable case of voluntary assumption of the risk which precludes any recovery by plaintiff. See Mattox v. Atlanta Enterprises, Inc., [1955], 91 Ga.App. 847, 87 S.E.2d 432.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">176 S.E.2d at 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">With Georgia Courts denying recovery in that unquestionably master-servant context, despite the \u201cheavy Georgia duty to provide safe working conditions,\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> there is no basis for distinction and thus no justification for a different result under Georgia law in this less sharply defined relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Having reached that substantive conclusion, there can be no question of the propriety or rendering a judgment notwithstanding the verdict after the jury verdict for Plaintiff. That we had reversed the dismissal for failure to state a claim or that the Trial Court, out of an abundance of caution, perhaps in response to our earlier mandate that a full factual development was necessary, had allowed the case to go to the jury, cannot preclude testing the adequacy of the evidence under <em>Boeing </em><footnotemark>14</footnotemark> either on motion for judgment n. o. v. or reversal and rendition on appeal. Judge Ainsworth has fully developed this approach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>for us in Gross v. Southern Railway Co., 5 Cir., 1971, 446 F.2d 1057. Indeed, we predicted just such a possibility in remanding the case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\"> We therefore apply the <em>Boeing </em>test to determine whether or not the motion for judgment n. o. v. should have been granted. \u201cIf the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the Court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict, granting of the motions is proper. On the other hand, if there is substantial evidence opposed to the motions, that is, evidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions, the motions should, be denied, and the case submitted to the jury. * * * There must be a conflict in substantial evidence to create a jury question.\u201d 411 F.2d at 374-375.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Once the facts were in, there was no more conflict. It was undisputed that Plaintiff had been climbing the ladder in question regularly and been receiving half-hearted indications that its improvement was under consideration for some 20 years. The conclusion was inescapable that Plaintiff was fully aware\u2014 equally as much if not more so than Standard Oil \u2014 of the dangers he was voluntarily undertaking, the perils he was knowingly risking, the possible tragic consequences he was inviting and the two decades of unfilled assurances of correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Under Georgia substantive principles, even in the legal light most favorable to Plaintiff, there was nothing to present to the jury. So now, six years and too many agonizing court battles later, this case can finally be laid to rest.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak0S\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-15\">. Webb v.

The tank was approximately 30 feet tall, and in order to make the required measurement, Webb had to climb a steel ladder constructed of metal rungs welded to pieces of angle iron. The angle iron forming the stay posts of the ladder was too large to be grasped by a man\u2019s hand, and there were no handrails, guardrails, landing or other protective devices attached to the ladder. In June 1965, while performing his duty to measure the amount of product in the tank, Webb was climbing the ladder at a point 20 to 30 feet above the ground when he fell and sustained severe physical injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-17\">Webb had from time to time complained to Standard\u2019s agents that the ladder was unsafe. In response, these agents had assured Webb that the company had under study and consideration changes that would lessen the dangers attendant to the use of said ladder and had instructed him to continue to use it until the changes and safety devices could be installed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-18\">414 F.2d at 321.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b386-19\">.
