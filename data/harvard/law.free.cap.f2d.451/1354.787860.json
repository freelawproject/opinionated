He appeals from an adverse judgment; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-20\">Plaintiff\u2019s enterprise, licensed by the State of Nevada, took bets on horse races and sporting events. It collected from each bettor an additional 10% of his bet. It called this amount a \u201cservice charge,\u201d but plaintiff testified that the 10% would be \u201cThe tax.\u201d The trial court found that plaintiff collected 10% from bettors and applied it to payment of the tax, and that neither consents were filed by the bettors nor were tax refunds made or received by the bettors. This brings the case squarely within 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6419, which prohibits a refund under such circumstances. The finding is supported by the evidence. Therefore, plaintiff cannot recover. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Spokane Rodeo, 9 Cir., 1958, 254 F.2d 377; Gray Line Co. v. Gran-quist, 9 Cir., 1956, 237 F.2d 390; Royce v. Squire, 9 Cir., 1948, 168 F.2d 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
