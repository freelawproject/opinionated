Appellee Birdsong is the Commanding General at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where McAliley was stationed when he petitioned the District Court. In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus before the District Court, McAliley challenged the validity of his local draft board\u2019s denial of his preinduction application for a consci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>entious objector classification, and he thus asserted that he was unlawfully inducted into the Army. The District Court denied McAliley\u2019s petition without issuing an order to show cause and without conducting an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we reverse and remand the case to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-7\">On September 21, 1971, after the District Court\u2019s final order denying McAliley\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus, but fifteen days before oral arguments on this appeal were set to be heard by this Court, McAliley received an \u201cundesirable discharge\u201d. We therefore face the initial question of whether the fact that McAliley is no longer in the Army\u2019s custody renders the present appeal moot and unreviewable by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-8\">Although the federal habeas corpus statute expressly requires that the petitioner be in custody, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c), in Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968), the United States Supreme Court has ruled that \u201conce the federal jurisdiction has attached in the District Court, it is not defeated by the release of the petitioner prior to completion of proceedings on such application.\u201d 391 U.S. 238, 88 S.Ct. 1560. <em>In Carafas, </em>the petitioner\u2019s sentence under a state court conviction expired after the District Court had denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus and after the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had affirmed that denial but before the petitioner sought a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court. Despite the fact that the petitioner was no longer under any form of state custody, the Supreme Court held that his cause was not moot:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a-b-dedup-0\">\u201cIn consequence of his conviction, he cannot engage in certain businesses ; he cannot serve as an official of a labor union for a specified period of time; he cannot vote in any election held in New York State; he cannot serve as a juror. Because of these \u2018disabilities or burdens [which] may flow from\u2019 petitioner\u2019s conviction, he has \u2018a substantial stake in the judgment of conviction which survives the satisfaction of the sentence imposed on him.\u2019 Fiswick v. United States, 329 U.S. 211, 222 [67 S.Ct. 224, 230, 91 L.Ed. 196] (1946). On account of these \u2018collateral consequences,\u2019 the case is not moot. Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 633-34, n. 2 [88 S.Ct. 1274, 1277-1278, 20 L.Ed.2d 195] (1968); Fiswick v. United States, supra, at 222, n. 10 [67 S.Ct. at 230]; United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502, 512-13 [74 S.Ct. 247, 253, 98 L.Ed. 248] (1954).\u201d 391 U.S. at 237-38, 88 S.Ct. at 1559 (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1345-11\">The <em>Carafas </em>Court further observed that release from custody is not the sole remedy available through a writ of habeas corpus; rather, the federal habeas corpus statute provides that the court shall \u201cdispose of the matter as law and justice require.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243; <em>see </em>391 U.S. at 239, 88 S.Ct. at 1560.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-12\">That such \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d may accompany and persist after a dishonorable discharge from the Armed Forces following court-martial convictions was clearly suggested by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Resor, 393 U. S. 10, 89 S.Ct. 51, 21 L.Ed.2d 23 (1968). There the petitioners had refused to participate in combat training after their requests for conscientious objector discharges were denied by Army officials. Both men were serving at hard labor when they petitioned the District Court for writs of habeas corpus. The petitions were denied, and the petitioners appealed. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit dismissed their appeals as moot because the men had by then been released from the Army under dishonorable discharges. Brown v. Reaves, 388 F.2d 682 (5th Cir. 1968). The Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remanded for further consideration in light of Carafas v. LaVallee, <em>supra. </em>Brown v. Resor, <em>su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number><em>pra, </em>393 U.S. at 10, 89 S.Ct. 51. On remand, the Court of Appeals found that the ease was not moot:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1346-4\">\u201cWe entertain no doubt that the \u2018collateral consequences\u2019 which may flow from appellants\u2019 convictions and to which we alluded in our original opinion, i. e., that \u2018in many states they will not be able to vote, sit on juries or run for public office,\u2019 bring this case squarely within the principles enunciated in <em>Carafas.\u201d </em>Brown v. Re-sor, 407 F.2d 281, 283 (5th Cir. 1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1346-5\">We believe that the rule set forth in <em>Carafas </em>and applied in <em>Brown </em>is fully applicable to the present case, notwithstanding the fact that those cases involved the \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d flowing from actual convictions whereas McAliley simply received an undesirable discharge without any conviction. Although the disabilities which result from an actual conviction in a civilian or military court may be more pronounced than those accruing with an undesirable discharge from the Army, it is common knowledge that a discharge which is \u201cother than honorable,\u201d as expressly stated on McAliley\u2019s discharge certificate, can seriously jeopardize an individual\u2019s prospects for future employment as well as his general reputation. This is especially true in the instant case, where McAliley\u2019s discharge certificate reveals none of the circumstances surrounding his undesirable discharge, but merely states that he was discharged \u201cfor the good of the service.\u201d We therefore find that MeAliley\u2019s undesirable discharge carries with it serious \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d which, under the <em>Carafas </em>case, require us to hold that his cause is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-7\">Turning to the merits of the appeal, in his petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court McAliley reviewed his local draft board\u2019s denial of his request for conscientious objector status, the Alabama State Appeals Board\u2019s affirmance of that denial, and his subsequent induction into the Army. His petition alleged in part</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1346-9\">. . that there was no basis in fact for the Selective Service officials to refuse to classify him a conscientious objector, that the local board applied an erroneous standard of law in determining whether petitioner was a conscientious objector. The local board gave no reasons for denying petitioner the requested classification and did not inform him of any reasons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1346-11\">These allegations were accompanied by letters from McAliley\u2019s mother and adult friends which had been sent to his local board in support of the sincerity of his beliefs, his conscientious objector application form which he had submitted to his local board, and the statement by the local board denying McAliley\u2019s application for conscientious objector status. Significantly, the statement by the local board set forth the following as the only apparent basis for the board\u2019s denial of McAliley\u2019s application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1346-12\">\u201cIt is the opinion of the board that the above-named registrant working as a Merchant Seaman and carrying supplies overseas he has no grounds for a 1-0 classification as a conscientious objector.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1346-13\">With the above allegations and exhibits before it in support of McAliley\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the District Court denied the petition without issuing an order directing the respondent-appellee to show cause why the writ should not be granted and without conducting an evidentiary hearing on McAliley\u2019s claim for relief. The District Court based its summary denial of the petition on its finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1346-14\">\u201c . . . the petitioner repeatedly states conclusions of law without supporting these conclusions with the facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1346-16\">The District Court thus found that McAliley was entitled to neither the requested writ nor an evidentiary hearing due to the deficiency in factual allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>tions in his petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree with that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-4\">In its order denying MeAliley\u2019s petition, the District Court relied on this Court\u2019s decisions in Loum v. Underwood, 262 F.2d 866 (6th Cir. 1959), and Reams v. Davis, 333 F.2d 430 (6th Cir. 1964). In <em>Loum, </em>this Court upheld the District Court\u2019s denial of the petitioner\u2019s application to proceed in forma pauperis where the petition for a writ of habeas corpus was without legal merit. There the petitioner had merely asserted that he was being illegally held in the Ohio State Penitentiary in violation of his constitutional rights, and he had supported this statement in his petition with allegations in his brief to the effect that since he was originally sentenced to the Ohio Reformatory, his subsequent transfer to the Penitentiary because he had a previous felony conviction was illegal. In <em>Reams, </em>this Court affirmed the District Court\u2019s denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus without an evidentiary hearing where the petitioner merely claimed that his arrest had been illegal and that he had been forced to enter a plea of guilty to avoid the death sentence, without alleging facts in support of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-5\"> In contrast to the deficiencies in the <em>Loum </em>and <em>Reams </em>petitions, we believe that MeAliley\u2019s petition before the District Court alleged facts sufficient to warrant the issuance of an order to show cause and an evidentiary hearing. We refer specifically to MeAliley\u2019s allegation in his petition that \u201c[t]he local board gave no reason for denying [him] the requested classification and did not inform him of any reasons.\u201d In United States v. O\u2019Bryan, 450 F.2d 365 (6th Cir. 1971), this Court recently reviewed the requirement that a local draft board articulate its reasons for a denial of conscientious objector status:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-8\">\u201c[The] statement [of the local board] must set forth a \u2018rational basis\u2019 for its determination. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-9\">Although not accepted unanimously by the circuits, the requirement that a local board articulate its reasons for denial of conscientious objector status has been accepted with reasoned accord. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-10\">We are convinced that, absent a statement of reasons from the local board in the registrant\u2019s selective service file, a court cannot properly perform the function of review set forth in [Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1946)]. ... By the same token, a reviewing court faced with a silent file may only speculate as to what factors motivated a given determination. . . . Unless it is known which ground among the many upon which the board may have relied, it is often impossible to perform the function of review even within the narrow scope of the selective service context.\u201d 450 F.2d at 370-371 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1347-13\">In United States v. Washington, 392 F. 2d 37 (6th Cir. 1968), this Court similarly stated that in conscientious objector cases, where the sincerity of the applicant\u2019s beliefs is at issue, \u201cthe record must contain some statement of [the board\u2019s] disbelief if the classification is to be upheld upon judicial review.\u201d 392 F.2d at 39. And the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Haughton, 413 F.2d 736 (1969), stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-14\">\u201c[t]he local board . . . must state the reasons for its denial of a requested classification when a regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>trant has \u2018met the statutory criteria\u2019 for that classification or has placed himself \u2018prima facie within the statutory exemption.\u2019 \u201d 413 F.2d at 739 (cites omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">The requirement that a local board state the reasons for its denial of conscientious objector status is a necessary element of the \u201cbasis in fact\u201d test for judicial review, under which federal courts are empowered to review selective service classifications to insure that determinations by local boards are supported by some basis in fact. <em>See </em>Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1946); Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 75 S.Ct. 392, 99 L.Ed. 428 (1955); Bohnert v. Faulkner, 438 F.2d 747 (6th Cir. 1971). Absent a statement of the local board\u2019s reasons for a given classification, the courts are left to merely speculate as to what basis the local board may have had for its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">In the present case we find that Me-Aliley has presented a prima facie case for conscientious objector status.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See Dickinson v. United States, 346 U.S. 389, 397, 74 S.Ct. 152, 98 L.Ed. 132 (1953); United States v. O\u2019Bryan, 450 F.2d 365 (6th Cir. 1971). In denying his application, however, the local board simply stated that McAliley, \u201cworking as a Merchant Seaman and carrying supplies overseas . . . has no grounds for a 1-0 classification as a conscientious objector.\u201d From the limited record before us, we are unable to determine what reason, if any, the local board intended to convey by this statement in denying McAliley\u2019s application. We find nothing in the fact that McAliley was working as a merchant seaman which in itself would discredit his claim for conscientious objector status under section 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j). It is conceivable, however, that some fact respecting his work as a merchant seaman may appear in McAliley\u2019s selective service file which would support a finding by the local board that his alleged beliefs were not sincere. We therefore believe that an evidentiary hearing before the District Court is required to clarify the board\u2019s statement and to review McAliley\u2019s selective service file for any facts respecting his work as a merchant seaman which may have supported the board\u2019s denial of his application. If after an ev-identiary hearing, the District Court finds that the board\u2019s statement does not present a valid reason for the denial of McAliley\u2019s application, we believe that the determination of the board must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-10\">The District Court\u2019s dismissal of McAliley\u2019s petition is therefore reversed and the case is remanded for an eviden-tiary hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1347-16\">. The federal habeas corpus statute requires that an application for a writ of habeas corpus \u201cshall allege the facts concerning the applicant\u2019s commitment or detention * * 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242. And 28 TJ.S.C. \u00a7 2243 provides that in entertaining an application for a writ of habeas corpus, the District Court \u201cshall forthwith award the writ or issue an order directing the respondent to show cause why the writ should not be granted, unless it appears from the application that the applicant or person detained is not entitled thereto.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1348-6\">. In his application for exemption as a conscientious objector, McAliley reviewed the history of his beliefs and noted that he \u201cbecame dissatisfied with the church and began to question the value of organized religious instructions.\u201d He gave the following account of his beliefs: \u201cDefining religion as a life plan which includes one\u2019s relations to others, I believe life is more valuable than any political, social or nationalistic theory.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1348-7\">My belief restricts me from serving in any Armed Forces because Armed Forces are organized for the destruction of human life and I could in no way aid any such organization.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1348-8\">The sincerity of McAliley\u2019s opposition to the destruction of life was supported by letters sent to the local board by two of his teachers, his sister, and his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-11\">We believe that McAliley has thus presented a prima facie case for exemption under section 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j), as that section was construed by the Supreme Court in United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965). In <em>Seeger, </em>the Supreme Court rejected any requirement that an applicant\u2019s beliefs have their basis in an orthodox religious doctrine and held that it is sufficient under section 6(j) that one\u2019s beliefs \u201coccupy the same place in the life of the objector as an orthodox belief in God holds in the life of one clearly qualified for exemption.\u201d 380 U.S. at 184, 85 S.Ct. at 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-12\">See generally Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970) ; United States v. Coffey, 429 F.2d 401 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
