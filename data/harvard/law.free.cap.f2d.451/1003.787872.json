There was testimony that, in a transaction occurring in a house occupied by appellant and codefendant Cannon, appellant assisted Cannon in counting out more than 300 tablets containing LSD; that, in appellant\u2019s presence, the tablets and marijuana were placed in one package and delivered to the purchaser ; that Cannon received and counted the proceeds of the sale and then handed the money to appellant who counted it again; and that, in the presence of the purchaser, appellant and Cannon engaged in discussion concerning the use to be made of the money. This evidence was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-17\">The evidence was in conflict as to the giving to appellant of a <em>Miranda, </em>warning by an agent reading from a card. The credibility choices were for the trial judge, and we cannot say that he erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-18\">The conviction must be, and is, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
