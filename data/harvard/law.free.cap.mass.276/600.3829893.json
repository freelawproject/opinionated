G. L. c. 152. The employee for some time was employed as a \u201ctreer\u201d by the United Novelty Shoe Co., Inc. \u2014 Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Casualty Company, insurer \u2014 but left such employment about July 29, 1929. He was out of work two weeks, then worked for the Merrimack Shoe Manufacturing Company two weeks, was again out of work until January 20, 1930, then worked for the Model Shoe Company, Inc. two weeks, and afterward for the Jackson Shoe Company until the latter part of February, 1930. He claims compensation for \u201cincapacity for work\u201d after February 20, 1930, resulting, as he contends, from a \u201cpersonal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment\u201d by the United Novelty Shoe Company. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 26, 34, 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">After hearings on February 17, and March 3, 1930, a single member of the Industrial Accident Board found \u201cthat this employee received a personal injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment with the United Novelty Shoe Company, due to the irritation and breaking of his skin in the performance of his work as a treer, and inflammation and poisoning caused by the employee\u2019s use of ammonia and liquid dye polish . . . that the employee\u2019s injury was received on or about July 25, 1929, . . .\u2022 that this condition became disabling on August 6, 1929, about one week after the employee had left his employment with the United Novelty Shoe Company,\u201d \u201cthat the condition which incapacitated the employee was not materially affected by his subsequent employment elsewhere, and that all of his incapacity for work subsequent to August 6, 1929, is due to the injury received while in the employment of the said Shoe Company,\u201d awarded compensation against the Maryland Casualty Company, for total incapacity for two weeks beginning August 6, 1929, partial incapacity thereafter until August 30, 1929, and total incapacity from August 30, 1929, to January 20, 1930, and reserved the employee\u2019s further rights. The reviewing board adopted the findings and decision of the single member. This decision was not presented to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">After a hearing on November 6,1930, as to the employee\u2019s further rights, the reviewing board, reversing the decision of the single member, found \u201cthat the condition which incapacitated the employee subsequent to January 20,1930, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>due to the injury of July 25, 1929, from which the employee had not recovered,\u201d that he had been totally incapacitated for work from February 20, 1930, to the date of this hearing, was \u201cincapacitated for return to his former work,\u201d and was entitled to partial compensation from November 6, 1930, based upon the difference between his earning capacity in his former employment and \u201cin the general labor market,\u201d and accordingly awarded compensation against the Maryland Casualty Company. The Superior Court entered a decree in accordance with this decision and the insurer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">1. The award of compensation for total incapacity for work from February 20, 1930, until November 6, 1930, as against this insurer was not justified by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The evidence warranted a finding that from February 20, 1930, to November 6, 1930, the employee suffered from industrial dermatitis in his hands to such an extent that he was totally incapacitated for work during that period. It could have been found that industrial dermatitis, though termed a disease, is traceable to a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d within the meaning of the workmen\u2019s compensation law (\u00a7 26), and is not a \u201csimple disease resulting from [the] employment.\u201d See <em>Sullivan\u2019s Case, </em>265 Mass. 497, 499, and cases cited. Indeed the insurer makes no contention to the contrary. Poisoning induced by the necessary exposure of an employment falls within a recognized class of personal injuries. <em>Maggelet\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 57, 61. <em>Pimental\u2019s Case, </em>235 Mass. 598, 602. See also <em>Hurle\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 223; <em>Bergeron\u2019s Case, </em>243 Mass. 366; and <em>Carmossino\u2019s Case, </em>268 Mass. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The finding of the board in its first decision which was not presented to the Superior Court, that the employee was poisoned by exposure to liquids used by him in his work as a \u201ctreer\u201d when employed by the United Novelty Shoe company, and, consequently, that he received a personal injury arising out of that employment, is binding upon the insurer. <em>Hurley\u2019s Case, </em>235 Mass. 387. <em>Brode\u2019s Case, </em>251 Mass. 414, 417. <em>McCarthy\u2019s Case, </em>253 Mass. 553. <em>O\u2019Neil\u2019s Case, </em>262 Mass. 266. However, the finding in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>decision that \u201call of his incapacity for work subsequent to August 6, 1929, is due to the injury received while in the employment of the said Shoe Company,\u201d did not apply to his incapacity after January 20, 1930 \u2014\u25a0 as to which the employee\u2019s rights were reserved \u2014 and does not preclude us from examining into the cause of. such later incapacity. See <em>Hunnewell\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 351; <em>Weir\u2019s Case, </em>252 Mass. 236; and <em>Hanson\u2019s Case, </em>264 Mass. 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The burden rested upon the employee of showing by a preponderance of evidence that his total incapacity between February 20, 1930, and .November 6, 1930, resulted from his original injury and not from an independent intervening cause. <em>Sponatski\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 526, 528, 531-532. <em>Upham\u2019s Case, </em>245 Mass. 31. This burden has not been sustained. Though the evidence warranted a finding that the employee\u2019s total incapacity after February 20, 1930, resulted from an outbreak or outbreaks of dermatitis after January 20, 1930, it did not warrant a finding that such outbreak or outbreaks resulted from the original injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The employee testified that after January 20, 1930, when employed by the Model Shoe company and later by the Jackson Shoe Company, he was exposed to poisonous liquids' and that, in each instance, his hands broke out again. He stated that the \u201cusing of the liquid at his work in the Model Shoe company started up the condition again,\u201d and that \u201cit was the work he did there which caused his hands to break out again.\u201d In his testimony at the original hearing he stated that he \u201cleft this work on account of a recurrence of the condition of his hands.\u201d He testified that when he first went to work for the Model Shoe company on January 20, 1930, \u201chis hands were in fair condition although not entirely well. The soreness had not entirely gone.\u201d A physician who had treated the employee, called by him as a witness, testified that on January 20, 1930, the condition of the plaintiff\u2019s hands was \u201cfairly clear,\u201d that on that date \u201chis hands were in such a condition that if he kept away from irritants [they] . . . would have come along all right.\u201d He testified, however, that \u201cif the man went back and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>that shoe work it would start the condition again,\u201d and that he advised the employee, \u201cWhen he went back to the Model Shoe company on January 20 . . . not to get into this liquid again.\u201d A physician called by the insurer testified that if the employee\u2019s hands \u201cwere fairly cleared up after January 20, 1930, [the] witness would advise against his going back and using the irritant which was the cause of the condition. If he did use the same irritant [the] witness would expect to have the condition break out again . . . No matter when this man goes back to work and comes in contact with such irritant his hands will break out again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The employee\u2019s description of the first outbreak of dermatitis after January 20,1930, as a \u201crecurrence of the condition of his hands\u201d is not sufficient to warrant a finding of a causal relation between that outbreak and the original injury. This testimony is consistent with an outbreak similar to an earlier one, but caused by a new injury. <em>Willis\u2019s Case, </em>245 Mass. 244, 248, 249-250. So also to \u201cstart the condition again\u201d is consistent with a new injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The evidence warranted findings that the outbreak found by the first decision of the board to have resulted from the original injury was not fully cured on January 20, 1930, and that the employee on that date had such susceptibility to dermatitis that there was a high degree of probability, amounting almost, if not quite, to certainty, that further exposure to poisonous liquids would result in an outbreak of the disease. According to the employee\u2019s uncontradicted testimony, there were such further exposures and outbreaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Even if the employee is not bound by his statement that the first outbreak after January 20, 1930, was caused by his work for the Model Shoe company (see <em>Whiteacre </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>241 Mass. 163, 165-166), the evidence warranted such a finding. So, also, there was evidence that exposure in the course of his employment by the Jackson Shoe Company caused an outbreak of the disease. No question is before us as to the responsibility of the insurers of these subsequent employers for the employee\u2019s incapacity for work, but it is to be noted that each of these employers took the employee at the time it employed him in his \u201cthen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>condition\u201d <em>(Fabrizio\u2019s </em>Case, 274 Mass. 352, 354), even to the extent of responsibility for incapacity resulting from acceleration by injury of a preexisting disease. <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487, 495-496. <em>Colantueno\u2019s Case, </em>275 Mass. 1, 3-4, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\">There is nothing in the case to indicate that the employee would have been totally incapacitated for work between February 20, 1930, and November 6, 1930, or, indeed, that he would not have been fully cured of the original outbreak of the disease before February 20, 1930, if he had not been exposed to poisonous liquids after January 20, 1930. On the other hand, a finding was not warranted that the outbreaks after January 20, 1930, would not have occurred but for the employee\u2019s condition on that date due to his original injury, in which respect the case differs from <em>Gaglione\u2019s Case, </em>241 Mass. 42, and <em>Geary\u2019s Case, </em>253 Mass. 114, relied on by the employee. Neither of these propositions, however, would be conclusive against the employee if it appeared that his total incapacity for work resulted from the combined effect of the original injury and later injury or injuries, (see <em>Rooney </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>173 Mass. 222, 223-224), and that no later injury was an independent intervening cause of such incapacity. Such proof has not been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Even if it is assumed in favor of the employee that the fact that he had an outbreak of dermatitis in the course of his employment by the United Novelty Shoe company, or the fact that this outbreak was not fully cured on January 20, 1930, rendered him more susceptible to an outbreak upon further exposure to poisonous liquids than he otherwise would have been, it does not appear that his further exposure to poisonous liquids was not so distinct from his original injury as to constitute an intervening cause of incapacity. See <em>Willis\u2019s Case, </em>245 Mass. 244. Such further exposure was not an incident of the original injury or of the resulting outbreak. Hence <em>Hartnett </em>v. <em>Tripp, </em>231 Mass. 382, <em>Wilder </em>v. <em>General Motorcycle Sales Co. </em>232 Mass. 305, and <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Holyoke Street Railway, </em>236 Mass. 359, are distinguishable. This is not a case of a return of an em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>ployee to ordinary employment. Compare <em>Gaglione\u2019s Case, </em>241 Mass. 42, and <em>Geary\u2019s Case, </em>253 Mass. 114. The employee\u2019s own medical witness testified without contradiction that there was a high degree of probability that further exposure to poisonous liquids would result in another outbreak and there is no evidence that the employee did not have full knowledge of this fact. On the contrary, this medical witness testified that he advised the employee \u201cnot to get into this liquid again.\u201d In this state of the evidence as to the employee\u2019s knowledge of the probable physical effect of further exposure, despite the pressure upon him of desire or need for the highfest wages which he could earn, it could not be found that his exposing himself to poisonous liquids in the course of his employment after January 20, 1930, was not such a voluntary act on his part as to break the line of causation between his original injury, arising out of and in the course of a previous employment, and his incapacity for work after February 20, 1930. <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Haverhill, </em>168 Mass. 382, 383-384. <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>183 Mass. 393, 399. <em>Snow </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>185 Mass. 321. Cases dealing with the breaking by an intervening agency of the causal connection between negligence and physical harm are in point in workmen\u2019s compensation cases. <em>Sponatski\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 526, 531-532. It is not material that the intervening voluntary act did not amount to \u201cserious and wilful misconduct.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\">2. The award of compensation for partial incapacity for work after November 6,1930, as against this insurer was not justified by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">There was no evidence that the outbreak of dermatitis from which the employee was suffering immediately before November 6, 1930, was fully cured on that date. So far as the employee\u2019s partial incapacity for work thereafter resulted from this outbreak, he is in no better position as against this insurer with respect to compensation for partial incapacity after November 6, 1930, than with respect to compensation for total incapacity for the period between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>February 20, 1930, and November 6, 1930. So far as such partial incapacity resulted from the employee's susceptibility to outbreaks upon further exposure, the evidence did not establish a causal relation between such susceptibility and the original injury. Whether on the evidence the employee\u2019s susceptibility to outbreaks after November 6, 1930, was due to a constitutional predisposition to poisoning by exposure to the liquids in question, to the outbreak of the disease caused by exposure in the course of his employment by the United Novelty Shoe company, or to earlier or later outbreaks, lies in the realm of conjecture. <em>Green\u2019s Case, </em>266 Mass. 355, 357. There was no testimony, medical or other, that the employee's injury in July, 1929, increased his susceptibility to outbreaks upon exposure after November 6, 1930. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>New Brynmally Colliery Co. Ltd. </em>106 L. T. (N. S.) 524; 5 B. W. C. C. 375; <em>Garnant Anthracite Collieries, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Rees, </em>[1912] 3 K. B. 372; 5 B. W. C. C. 694; <em>Starkey </em>v. <em>Clayton &amp; Sons, </em>18 B. W. C. C. 346; <em>Darroll </em>v. <em>Glasgow Iron &amp; Steel Co. Ltd. </em>50 Sc. L. R. 226; 6 B. W. C. C. 354. There was testimony, at the first hearing, that the employee worked for the United Novelty Shoe company from February 18, 1929, to July 29, 1929, but the record does not disclose where he worked previously or whether he had previously suffered from the disease. Evidence that he worked over five months for this \u00e9mployer before his hands broke out and that later outbreaks came after shorter periods of work is not enough to prove that the injury received when working for this employer contributed to his susceptibility to outbreaks after November 6, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\">The decree is to be reversed and a decree entered for the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
