The trial judge filed \u201cFindings, Rulings of the Court and Order for Decree.\u201d A final decree dismissing the bill was entered, and the plaintiff appealed. The evidence is not reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">The bill was dismissed rightly for no contract on the part of either defendant to purchase the real estate in question was proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">On or about October 20, 1928, the plaintiff executed an instrument under seal entitled \u201cReal Estate Option,\u201d whereby, in consideration of $150 paid to her by \u201cthe party of the second part,\u201d the defendant Ryder, she agreed to sell and convey the real estafe to the said defendant or his assigns for $6,000. It was further provided that \u201cThis option may be accepted by the said party of the second part, or his assigns, within sixty (60) days from the date of this instrument, and said conveyance shall be made within five (5) days after such acceptance, by a quitclaim deed . . . conveying a clear title free from all incumbrances . . . .\u201d upon \u201cthree (3) days\u2019 notice in writing\u201d to the plaintiff \u201cof the time and place where said conveyance shall be made and executed,\u201d and that if the defendant Ryder or his assigns \u201cshall fail to accept this option, or shall after the acceptance of this option, fail to pay the said sum of fifty eight hundred and fifty ($5850) dollars the consideration stated above,\u201d according to the terms of the instrument, the defendant Ryder or his assigns shall \u201cforfeit any and all sums\u201d paid to the plaintiff. On or about October 22, 1928, the defendant Ryder wrote after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s signature to this instrument the following: \u201cMrs. Margaret Kelley: It is understood that you are not to pay me any commission if this option is taken up and the purchase made. October 22, 1928. Earl A. Ryder.\u201d On or about December 14, 1928, the plaintiff executed an instrument not under seal, described in the record as a \u201cmemorandum,\u201d which was \u201cannexed\u201d to the instrument executed October 20, 1928, and was in the following terms: \u201cDecember 14, 1928. The within option is hereby renewed for a period up to and including February 1, 1929, under the same terms and conditions as stated therein and on the further condition that said Margaret Kelley will cause the tenant Donald J. Ferguson to vacate the within premises on or before February 1, 1929. If tenant is out as stated, the said Earl A. Ryder will take conveyance of the property on February 1, 1929, provided title is satisfactory. If tenant does not vacate by February 1, 1929, the $150. referred to herein will be returned to Earl A. Ryder and the option cancelled. Margaret Kelley. Henry D. Kelley Witness.\u201d Neither of the defendants signed the instrument of October 20 or that of December 14. The defendant Ryder acted as agent for the defendant Boston Ice Company in his dealings with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The trial judge ruled as matter of law that'neither the instrument of October 20, 1928, nor that of December 14, 1928, was \u201can agreement to purchase and sell real estate,\u201d but that the former was \u201can option given by the plaintiff to the defendant Ryder, giving Ryder the right to elect to purchase the real estate described therein upon the terms and conditions therein stated,\u201d and the latter, \u201ca renewal or extension of the option given by the plaintiff to the defendant Ryder.\u201d The judge found that the defendant Ryder did not in his own behalf or in behalf of the other defendant exercise his option under the instrument of October 20 or \u201cthe renewal or extension\u201d thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The instrument of October 20 was not a contract on the part of either defendant to purchase the real estate and was not transformed into such a contract by the writing of October 22. It was an option to purchase, that is, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>irrevocable offer by the plaintiff to the defendant Ryder to sell to him on the terms stated, conditional on acceptance within sixty days. See <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Boland, </em>166 Mass. 481, 483; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>236 Mass. 480, 483. It would have expired December 19, 1928, if not accepted by that time or extended or renewed, and it was not accepted within that time unless by virtue of the memorandum of December 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u2022 The memorandum of December 14 must be interpreted as a whole and in connection with the instrument of October 20, to which it is annexed and refers. In terms that \u201coption is . . . renewed for a period up to and including February 1, 1929, under the same terms and conditions as stated therein,\u201d with what is described as a \u201cfurther condition\u201d that the plaintiff \u201cwill cause the tenant ... to vacate the . . . premises on or before February 1, 1929.\u201d These words of renewal are not ambiguous. They are wholly inapt if the memorandum was intended to embody an acceptance of the option, or an independent contract for the purchase of the property by the defendant Ryder, conditional upon compliance with conditions as to satisfactory title and the vacating of the premises by the tenant. Renewal \u2014 or extension \u2014 of an option is inconsistent with acceptance thereof or with an independent contract of purchase. The words cannot be disregarded or explained away as amounting merely to an erroneous description of the writing (compare <em>Gompert </em>v. <em>Frost, </em>188 Iowa, 1039, 1042) for they are of the substance of the plaintiff\u2019s promise. They must be given their natural meaning unless the context indicates that they were used in some other sense. We think that it does not. To control the meaning of these words the plaintiff relies upon the provision that \u201cIf tenant is out as stated, the said Earl A. Ryder will take conveyance of the property on February 1, 1929, provided title is satisfactory.\u201d She contends that this provision is a promise by the defendant Ryder to purchase the property \u2014 doubtless implied from his acceptance of the memorandum. But the memorandum is signed only by the plaintiff and purports to contain only her promise and the conditions thereof. The words relied upon may be construed properly as modi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>fying the \u201cterms and conditions\u201d of the option, which are expressly continued in force during the renewal period, rather than as amounting to a promise by the defendant Ryder. It was a term or condition of the instrument of October 20 that if the option was not accepted by December 19, or if the defendant Ryder or his assigns failed to pay the purchase price at the time and place agreed upon, he or his assigns were to forfeit payments already made. A natural construction of the sentence under consideration is that the plaintiff granted the renewal or extension of the option on the condition that if the' tenant vacated the premises on or before February 1, 1929, and title thereto was \u201csatisfactory\u201d the defendant Ryder would either accept the option or forfeit his payment of $150. The sentence so interpreted provides the alternative for the further express provision that \u201cIf tenant does not vacate by February 1, 1929, the $150. referred to herein will be returned to Earl A. Ryder and the option cancelled.\u201d This construction gives to all the words of the memorandum a sense consistent with its obvious purpose and with the \u201cterms and conditions\u201d of the instrument of October 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The conclusions stated are reached without reliance upon the finding of the trial judge that the instrument of October 20 \u201cwas not intended by the parties to be an agreement to purchase and sell real estate,\u201d but was intended to be \u201can option given by the plaintiff to the defendant Ryder, giving Ryder the right to elect to purchase the real estate described therein upon the terms and conditions therein stated,\u201d or the finding that the memorandum of December 14 \u201cwas not intended by the parties to be an agreement to purchase and sell real estate,\u201d but was intended to be \u201ca renewal or extension of the option given by the plaintiff to the defendant Ryder.\u201d These findings, however, are in accord with our conclusions based upon the language of the instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Since the memorandum of December 14, as we construe it, embodied no promise by the defendant Ryder to purchase the real estate in question, and no . such promise by the other defendant who, so far as appears, acted only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>through the defendant Ryder, it is unnecessary to consider whether it was a binding contract or satisfied the statute of frauds, or whether the defendants were estopped by any change of position on the part of the plaintiff to set up that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
