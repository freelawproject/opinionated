Storage Tech. Corp., </em>164 F.3d 887 (4th Cir.1999), and for the district court to consider any substitution of parties pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(a)(1), in light of the death of Plaintiff Richard Chang. The district court addressed those issues, reinstating the denial of the motion for reconsideration and the increased sanctions amount and denying the motion for substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-27\">Consolidated with those two appeals are Appellants\u2019 appeals from the district court\u2019s orders denying the motion for substitution of parties and denying various motions for reconsideration of that order and other orders entered by the district court following our limited remand. We have reviewed the record and the arguments asserted in the parties\u2019 briefs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s disposition of the case and its resolution of the various motions, except that the court modifies the orders entered after our limited remand to remove any reference to the ownership of Giant Steel Enterprise Company, Ltd.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-20\">. Because we have jurisdiction over these appeals, we deny the Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss appeals Nos. 04-2221 and 05-1099.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b212-15\">. The district court\u2019s rationale for dismissing the case was that the issues concerned marital property rights, which belong in the state courts. Following our remand of the case for resolution of the substitution of parties and the Rule 60(b) motion, the district court made references to ownership of the corporation as being resolved. Nothing in the materials before the court suggest that the ownership issue has been resolved. Thus, we strike such references from the district court\u2019s orders. We express no opinion as to the ownership of Giant Steel and the resolution of these appeals is without prejudice to the parties\u2019 ability to resolve that issue in the state court if it has not already been so resolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
