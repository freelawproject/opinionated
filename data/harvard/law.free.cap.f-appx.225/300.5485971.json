He contends that the presumption of reasonableness this court accords sentences imposed within the advisory guideline range erroneously constrains the district court\u2019s discretion. Specifically, Perez argues that the validity of this court\u2019s sentencing framework after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is under consideration by the Supreme Court in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006) and <em>Claiborne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006). Thus, he argues that if the Supreme Court were to find this framework inconsistent with <em>Booker, </em>he would be entitled to resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-27\">Because an intervening Supreme Court case explicitly or implicitly overruling pri- or precedent is required to alter this court\u2019s precedent, the grants of certiorari in <em>Rita </em>and <em>Claiborne </em>have no impact on this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999). In the instant case, the district court considered the Guidelines and determined that a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range was appropriate. Because the court exercised its discretion to impose a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range, this court may infer, in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>reasonableness review, that the court considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). This court has examined the record and concludes that the sentence imposed by the district court is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
