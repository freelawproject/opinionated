Farias, </em>469 F.3d 393, 399 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1502, 167 L.Ed.2d 241 (2007). Mendoza also fails to show that the court abused its discretion and imposed an unreasonable sentence where the court declined to reduce the sentence due to Mendoza\u2019s deportability and where the court did not give a detailed explanation of its consideration of the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v.
