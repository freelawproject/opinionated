Having calculated a Guidelines imprisonment range of 46-57 months, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 46 months. He appeals, contending his sentence is unreasonable. We disagree. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (appellate court reviews sentence to determine whether it is unreasonable in light of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors); <em>United States v. Mathis, </em>451 F.3d 939, 941 (8th Cir.2006) (reasonableness review is akin to abuse-of-discretion review).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">The record does not support Garduno-Gonzalez\u2019s argument that the district court either misapprehended the advisory nature of the Guidelines or applied an excessively stringent standard to his request for a non-Guidelines sentence. At sentencing, the court properly considered the applicable Guidelines range, the nature of the offense, the defendant\u2019s history and his proffered reasons for returning to the United States, as well as sentencing objectives, and determined that a sentence within the Guidelines range was reasonable under the circumstances. <em>See United States v. Hawk Wing, </em>433 F.3d 622, 631 (8th Cir.2006) (sentencing involves three-step process of calculating Guidelines range, determining if Guidelines departure is warranted, and considering \u00a7 3553(a) factors to decide whether to impose Guidelines sentence or non-Guidelines sentence). The Guidelines use of a prior felony conviction to increase both the offense level and the criminal history category was not impermissible double counting, <em>see United States v. Dyck, </em>334 F.3d 736, 740 (8th Cir.2003), and did not warrant special treatment in the court\u2019s section 3553(a) analysis. We also reject Garduno-Gonza-lez\u2019s sentence-disparity argument. <em>See United States v. Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 123-24, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979) (government is free to exercise nondiscriminatory prosecutorial discretion to select statute under which to charge defendant); <em>United States v. Sebastian, </em>436 F.3d 913, 916 (8th Cir.2006) (recognizing both Congress\u2019s policymaking power and Attorney General\u2019s prosecutorial discretion, and stating it is within province of \u201cpolicymaking branches of government to determine that certain disparities are warranted, and thus need not be avoided\u201d). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-11\">. The Honorable Carol E.
