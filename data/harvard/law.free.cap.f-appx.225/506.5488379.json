We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and we review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-22\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zamora Martinez\u2019s motion to reopen, which was based on his prior counsel\u2019s failure to file a brief before the BIA. The Immigration Judge found petitioner ineligible for cancellation of removal on three grounds, and petitioner effectively challenged only one of those grounds in his motion to reopen. Because the motion is not supported by any evidence to support a claim that a brief might have made a difference, petitioner has failed to demonstrate prejudice. <em>See id. </em>at 889-900 (to establish a valid due process claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must show that he was prejudiced by the attorney\u2019s deficient performance).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b534-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
