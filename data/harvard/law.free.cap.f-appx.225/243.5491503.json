The district court construed Lopez\u2019s petition as raising only a claim relating to the denial of parole and held that Lopez had no liberty interest in being released on parole. Lopez was convicted following a guilty plea to driving while intoxicated and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of fifteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-20\">A COA may be issued only if the prisoner has made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Such a showing requires that a petitioner \u201cdemonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-21\">Lopez argues that the district court erred in summarily dismissing his \u00a7 2254 petition because he had alleged the denial of a protected liberty interest. He contends that he was deprived of a liberty interest when he was denied \u201csupervised release\u201d once he was \u201cdeclared eligible for parole.\u201d He states that he was twice \u201cdeclared eligible for mandatory supervision\u201d and that both times he was denied \u201cparole.\u201d He argues that the denial resulted in a violation of his right to equal protection and due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-22\">Lopez\u2019s habeas petition did not raise a claim that he was denied equal protection. A petitioner cannot pursue claims raised for the first time in a COA motion. <em>Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 387-88 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-23\">It is unclear from Lopez\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition whether he was alleging that he was entitled to release on mandatory supervision or on parole as he identified both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>kinds of release in his petition. Lopez has no liberty interest in being released on parole, but he may have a liberty interest in being released on mandatory supervision under current Texas law. <em>See </em>Tex. Govt.Code \u00a7\u00a7 508.147, 508.149; <em>Madison v. Parker, </em>104 F.3d 765, 768 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Malchi v. Thaler, 211 </em>F.3d 953, 957-58 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Ex parte Geiken, </em>28 S.W.3d 553, 558 (Tex.Crim.App.2000) (en banc). Reasonable jurists would therefore find debatable the correctness of the district court\u2019s summary dismissal of the petition as frivolous and for failure to state a claim absent any clarification of the nature of Lopez\u2019s complaint. Therefore, the motion for COA is granted, the judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">COA GRANTED; JUDGMENT VACATED AND CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b271-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
