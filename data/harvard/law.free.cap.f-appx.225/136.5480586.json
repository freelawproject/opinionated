The district court sentenced him to ninety-two months in prison. McMillan timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">McMillan\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that in his opinion there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether McMillan\u2019s trial counsel coerced McMillan into pleading guilty and whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to McMillan\u2019s detention and arrest and statements he made to police officers. McMillan was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he did not file one. For the reasons stated below, we affirm McMillan\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">We first turn to McMillan\u2019s cl\u00e1im that his trial attorney coerced him into pleading guilty. A guilty plea must be \u201ca voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant,\u201d <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970), and may be invalid if it was induced by threats or misrepresentations, <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 755, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970). A defendant\u2019s statements at the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing are presumed to be true. <em>Black-ledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 73-74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977). Unsupported allegations on appeal are insufficient to overcome representations at the Rule 11 hearing. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119 (4th Cir.1991) (stating that defendant\u2019s statement at Rule 11 hearing that he was neither coerced nor threatened was \u201cstrong evidence of the voluntariness of his plea\u201d); <em>Via v. Superintendent, Powhatan Corr. Ctr., </em>643 F.2d 167, 171 (4th Cir.1981) (holding that statements at plea hearing that facially demonstrate plea\u2019s validity are conclusive absent compelling reason why they should not be).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Here, McMillan indicated at the Rule 11 hearing that he was satisfied with counsel\u2019s services, he was pleading guilty voluntarily, and no one attempted to force him to plead guilty against his will. Furthermore, the record is devoid of any evidence supporting McMillan\u2019s bald claim that trial counsel coerced him into pleading guilty. We therefore find that McMillan is not entitled to relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Additionally, we find that the ineffective assistance of counsel claims that McMillan seeks to raise are not cognizable on direct appeal. To allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant must bring such claims in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion unless the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192,198 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. King, 119 </em>F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Here, the record does not conclusively establish that McMillan\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm McMillan\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. This court requires that counsel inform McMillan, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If McMillan requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may renew his motion at that time. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on McMillan. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
