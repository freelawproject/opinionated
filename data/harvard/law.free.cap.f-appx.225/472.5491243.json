R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b501-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">Jose Roberto Rodriguez appeals his sentence after pleading guilty without a plea agreement to a charge of importation of almost 100 kilograms of marijuana. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">The district court did not err in refusing to grant Rodriguez a decrease in his offense level based on a minor role under USSG \u00a7 3B1.2. We review a district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Rojas-Millan, </em>234 F.3d 464, 472 (9th Cir.2000). \u201cThe defendant has the burden of proving that he is entitled to a downward adjustment based on his role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Rosales-Rodriguez, </em>289 F.3d 1106, 1112 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Davis, </em>36 F.3d 1424, 1436 (9th Cir.1994)). Here, the district court applied the proper legal standard, and correctly noted that \u201cthe fact that a defendant acted as a drug courier does not necessarily mean that his role was minimal or minor.\u201d (citing <em>Davis, </em>36 F.3d at 1436). Significant evidence weighed against finding that Rodriguez played a minor role. He admitted driving two different load vehicles across the border and was paid large sums of money. Rodriguez knowingly transported a large volume of narcotics in the load vehicles. He also participated in filling out DMV documents for one of the two load vehicles. The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that this evidence outweighed any evidence suggesting that Rodriguez played a minor role.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">Even assuming that the footnote in Rodriguez\u2019s Sentencing Memorandum was sufficient to preserve the vindictive prosecution claim, no such claim is established here. Unlike the situation where the government files additional charges or seeks a sentencing enhancement by filing an information alleging prior convictions, <em>cf. United States v. Gamez-Ordu\u00f1o, </em>235 F.3d 453, 462 (9th Cir.2000), the decision whether or not to make a role adjustment is entirely within the court\u2019s, and not the government prosecutor\u2019s, discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Accordingly, the sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b501-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
