Jan. 24, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-22\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Zhong Guang Sun v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 105, 107 (2d Cir.2005). The BIA stated that reconsideration was inappropriate because petitioner failed to \u201callege any factual or legal error in the Board\u2019s [earlier] decision.\u201d Petitioner contends primarily that the BIA abused its discretion because this statement was a \u201cflat falsehood.\u201d We disagree. The BIA accurately described petitioner\u2019s motion, which merely reiterated facts allegedly showing that her former counsel \u201cdid not act properly.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s motion did not specify any factual or legal error underlying the BIA\u2019s conclusion that she had not proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>that her failure to appear at her removal proceedings was caused by ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See In re Cerna, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 399, 402 n. 2 (BIA 1991) (\u201cA motion to reconsider is a request that the Board reexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked .... \u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">For the reasons stated above, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-14\">. Nazma Akter has filed petitions for review on behalf of her minor daughters, Nargis Khandar Akter and Nahid Khander Akter. All three petitions are disposed of in this Order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
