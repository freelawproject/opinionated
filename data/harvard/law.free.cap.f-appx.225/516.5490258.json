We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The IJ did not abuse his discretion or violate due process by failing to indefinitely suspend proceedings to await Elazari\u2019s possible future eligibility for adjustment of status. <em>See Biwot v. Gonzales, </em>403 F.3d 1094, 1099 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cTo prevail on a due process challenge ... [a petitioner] must show error and substantial prejudice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">Elazari\u2019s contention that he qualifies as a grandfathered alien under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.10 does not change his ineligibility for adjustment of status because he lacks an immediately available immigrant visa. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 245.10(b)(2) (permitting grandfathered alien to adjust status if, <em>inter alia, </em>he has an immediately available immigrant visa).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">Finally, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in declining to remand because the evidence regarding Elazari\u2019s wife\u2019s labor certification did not establish prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 994 (9th Cir.2003). The record does not indicate that Elazari\u2019s wife is the beneficiary of an approved, or even pending, visa petition. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b545-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
