We review dismissal of an appeal for failure to prosecute for abuse of discretion, <em>Dunmore v. United States, </em>358 F.3d 1107, 1111 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-26\">Under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a), filing for bankruptcy effects an automatic stay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>against all proceedings originally brought against the debtor in bankruptcy. However, the automatic stay in Wernerdal\u2019s personal bankruptcy does not apply to this appeal, because an examination under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 2004 pursuant to the Adbox bankruptcy is not a \u201cproceeding\u201d within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362. <em>See Parker v. Bain, </em>68 F.3d 1131, 1135-36 (9th Cir.1995); <em>see also In re Carlson, </em>265 B.R. 346, 348 (Bankr. D.R.I.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The appeal not being stayed, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing it for failure to prosecute. The Metcalfs admittedly took no action to prosecute the appeal before the district court issued its order to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed and also failed to give a timely and adequate response to that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b497-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
