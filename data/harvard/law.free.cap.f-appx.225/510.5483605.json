To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 782 (9th Cir.2003), we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen as to Lopez Ortiz because it considered the evidence presented regarding his child\u2019s new medical condition and acted within its broad discretion in determining that it did not indicate her condition was severe enough to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational or contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen with regard to Cantu de Lopez and the three children because the new medical evidence is not relevant to the BIA\u2019s earlier determination that they failed to establish ten years of continuous physical presence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">We do not consider petitioners\u2019 remaining contentions regarding the BIA\u2019s underlying decision of December 7, 2004, because the instant petition for review is not timely as to that decision. <em>See Membreno v. Gonzales, </em>425 F.3d 1227, 1229 (9th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b539-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
