His conviction was affirmed on appeal. He obtained partial relief via a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion with respect to his firearms conviction. He was denied leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, and the district court later denied a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 motion as an attempt to circumvent the requirements for a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Jefferson then filed a motion for writ of mandamus, asserting that Count One of the indictment was constructively amended by an erroneous jury instruction. This motion was rejected by the district court and by this court as again attempting to circumvent the filing requirements for a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Undaunted, Jefferson filed another motion, this time pursuant to the All Writs Act, raising the same constructive amendment argument. The district court denied this latest motion. Jefferson appeals and seeks bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-22\">Jefferson\u2019s motion is properly construed as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Orozco-Ramirez, </em>211 F.3d 862, 867 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Rich, </em>141 F.3d 550, 551-52 (5th Cir.1998). Thus, Jefferson was required to obtain leave of this court to file it, and the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain the motion. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000). Jefferson\u2019s reliance on the All Writs Act is misplaced, as the relief he seeks falls within the scope of relief available under \u00a7 2255. <em>See, e.g., Carlisle v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 416, 429, 116 S.Ct. 1460, 134 L.Ed.2d 613 (1996). Finally, Jefferson\u2019s contention that his argument is jurisdictional and may be raised at any time is without merit. <em>See United States v. Bieganowski, </em>313 F.3d 264, 286-87 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-23\">As Jefferson\u2019s brief fails to raise any issues of arguable merit, we dismiss it as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Jefferson is warned that any further repetitious or frivolous filings, including those attempting to circumvent statutory restrictions on filing second or successive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u00a7 2255 motions, may result in the imposition of sanctions against him. These sanctions may include dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction. Jefferson\u2019s motion for bail pending appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION FOR BAIL DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
