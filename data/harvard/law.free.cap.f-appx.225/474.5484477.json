We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">Encinas would not have been entitled to an adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) for the time he spent in state custody had that term of imprisonment been undischarged, because the district court found that this custody was due to parole revocation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, Application Note 3(C). Accordingly, Enci-nas was not entitled to a downward departure under the Guidelines for his discharged term of state imprisonment. <em>See id., </em>Application Note 4; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.23. Although Encinas asserts on appeal that he was held in state custody for reasons other than a parole violation, he did not argue this to the district court and nothing in the record supports his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">The district court correctly counted both of Encinas\u2019s unlicensed driver convictions under the Guidelines. Because the two offenses were separated by an intervening arrest, they cannot be considered related under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 &amp; Application Note 3. <em>See United States v. Asberry, </em>394 F.3d 712, 718-19 (9th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Gallegos-Gonzalez, </em>3 F.3d 325, 326-28 (9th Cir.1993). To the extent the authorities Encinas relies on are to the contrary, they were superceded by the 1991 amendments to \u00a7 4A1.2, as we expressly noted in <em>Gallegos-Gonzalez, </em>3 F.3d at 327-28. Moreover, both offenses occurred within ten years of Encinas\u2019s \u201ccommencement of the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2). Encinas\u2019s contention that after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court was free to disregard these requirements in its threshold Guidelines calculation is directly contrary to our precedent. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269, 1279-80 (9th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">Nor was Encinas entitled to a downward departure under the Guidelines because of his family circumstances, as he was not an \u201cirreplaceable caretaker\u201d of his children. <em>See United States v. Leon, </em>341 F.3d 928, 931-32 (9th Cir.2003). The dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>trict court\u2019s finding that it is \u201chighly unlikely that [Encinas] was supporting his children\u201d is amply supported by the record, which documents how several members of Encinas\u2019s \u201cextremely close\u201d family and other relatives of the children have raised and will continue to raise them.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The district court\u2019s ultimate decision to sentence Encinas at the bottom of the Guidelines range was not unreasonable for any of the reasons he identifies. The district court explained how any mitigation from the circumstances upon which Encinas relies was more than offset by other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors pointing the other direction. Nor was it unreasonable for the district court to conclude that the Guidelines appropriately captured the seriousness of Encinas\u2019s criminal history, for the reasons it gave.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b503-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
