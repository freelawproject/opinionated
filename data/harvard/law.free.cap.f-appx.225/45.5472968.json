For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-27\">Inasmuch as we write primarily for the parties who are familiar with this case, we need not set forth the factual or historical background except insofar as may be helpful to our brief discussion. Oliver argues that the district court erred in determining his criminal history without submitting that issue to the jury, that the sentence that was imposed was unreasonable, and that the court erred in not submitting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>question of drug quantity to the jury pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>580 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The arguments require only the briefest discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), it is clear that the sentencing guidelines are advisory. Moreover, given our <em>post-Booker </em>jurisprudence, it is equally clear that the sentencing court may make factual determinations in applying the guidelines so long as the resulting sentence is reasonable and the sentencing factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) are given proper consideration. See <em>United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556 (3d. Cir.2006) <em>(en </em>banc), and <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 329-30 (3d. Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In <em>United States v. Ordaz, </em>398 F.3d 236, 238-40 (3d. Cir.2005), we rejected the precise Sixth Amendment claims based upon a trial court determining drug weight and criminal history that Oliver makes here. We again reject those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Defense counsel also claims that the sentence that was imposed was unreasonable. The argument which counsel makes is as forceful as it is eloquent. Counsel notes the actuarial impact of a sentence of 210 months on someone Oliver\u2019s age, and he suggests that the sentence is \u201ca virtual death sentence.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 15. Counsel also paints a portrait of someone who has been enslaved by drug usage throughout his entire life and suggests, no doubt with no small amount of justification, that \u201cit is a miracle ... that his addiction hasn\u2019t killed him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. It is perhaps with only a slight bit of hyperbole that counsel claims that Oliver \u201chas never met a controlled substance he didn\u2019t like.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. Counsel then summarizes the tragedy of Oliver\u2019s life as follows: \u201c[h]e is Now battered, bruised and bowed, having lost the sight in one eye while engaged in a drunken argument over a check which ended with acid being thrown in his face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. Although we neither minimize nor ignore the force of counsel\u2019s arguments or the human tragedy they portray, we must nevertheless limit our inquiry to determining if the sentencing court properly considered the sentencing factors under \u00a7 3553(a); and if so, whether the resulting sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">The question is not how we ourselves would have resolved the factors identified as relevant by \u00a7 3553(a) ... nor what sentence we ourselves ultimately might have decided to impose on the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-9\"><em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 330. Rather, we must decide whether the district court imposed the sentence it did for reasons that are logical and consistent with the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">Here, the district court explained its concern for the protection of society, as well as the need to deter others from \u201cpeddling drugs.\u201d App. 175. The court considered the guidelines, but clearly did not treat them as mandatory. The resulting sentence of 210 months, although lengthy (perhaps even severe given the defendant\u2019s age) was certainly not unreasonable. It is clear from the transcript of the sentencing proceeding that the sentencing court properly applied \u00a7 3553(a), and considered each of the factors the court deemed relevant to Oliver\u2019s circumstances and background, as well as the characteristics of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">Accordingly for the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the judgment of sentence. In doing so, we pause to note that defense counsel, Barnaby C. Wittels, of the firm of LaCheen, Dixon, Wittels &amp; Green-berg, is representing Mr. Oliver <em>pro bono. </em>We express our gratitude to Mr. Wittels and his firm for agreeing to represent Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Oliver without compensation, and for the forceful and eloquent brief which was submitted on Mr. Oliver\u2019s behalf.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
