To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review in part and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-23\">Reviewing de novo, <em>Altamirano v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 586, 591 (9th Cir.2005), we conclude that the government met its burden of demonstrating that Maravilla-Alva-rez is inadmissible pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I), for falsely representing himself to be an American citizen in order to gain admission. In light of this determination, we need not reach Maravil-la-Alvarez\u2019s contentions regarding the other grounds of inadmissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-24\">The IJ denied Maravilla-Alvarez\u2019s cancellation of removal application in the exercise of his discretion. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), we lack jurisdiction to review this determination. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir.2003) (\u2018We [have] interpreted (B)(i) to encompass all discretionary decisions involved in the cancellation of removal context, including the ultimate discretionary decision to deny relief.\u201d); <em>see also Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-25\">Maravilla-Alvarez\u2019s due process challenge to the BIA\u2019s use of its streamlining procedure is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Car-riche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 852 (9th Cir.2003), and his remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-26\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b533-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
