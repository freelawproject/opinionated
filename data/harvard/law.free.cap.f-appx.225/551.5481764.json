We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-22\">We lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary determination that the adult petitioners failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative, <em>see Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir.2003), and petitioners do not raise a colorable due process claim, <em>see Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201ctraditional abuse <em>of </em>discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-23\">We lack jurisdiction to review petitioners\u2019 contention that the IJ denied them a full and fair hearing because they failed to raise it before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (noting that due process challenges that are \u201cprocedural in nature\u201d must be exhausted).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-24\">Petitioners do not challenge the IJ\u2019s determination that Fredy, Jazmin and Hector Cruz Mendez did not establish ten years continuous physical presence and lack a qualifying relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-25\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that placing them in removal proceedings rather than deportation proceedings violated equal protection is unavailing. <em>See Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1108 (9th Cir. 2003); <em>Hernandez-Mezquita v.
