We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We review de novo a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) judgment on the pleadings. <em>Smith v. Nat\u2019l Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., </em>125 F.3d 751, 753 (9th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">For purposes of a motion for judgment on the pleadings, all allegations of fact of the opposing party are accepted as true. The allegations of the moving party which have been denied are taken as false. Only if it appears that, on the facts so admitted, the moving party is clearly entitled to prevail can the motion be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-7\"><em>Austad v. United States, </em>386 F.2d 147, 149 (9th Cir.1967) (internal citation omitted). We also review de novo a district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>See In re Broderbund/Learning Co. Sec. Litig., </em>294 F.3d 1201, 1203 (9th Cir.2002). \u201cIn so doing, we accept as true all material allegations of the complaint and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Tamarack asserts that the district court erred by determining that the allegations in the complaint, even if true, failed to show that JPMorgan wrongfully dishonored the letter of credit (LOC). Ordinarily, a letter of credit is governed by state law. <em>See, e.g., W. Sur. Co. v. Bank of S. Or., </em>257 F.3d 933, 936 (9th Cir.2001). JPMorgan contends that Florida law applies, while Tamarack asserts that Arizona law applies. We need not resolve this dispute, because under either State\u2019s laws Tamarack has not alleged facts indicating that JPMorgan breached its obligations under the LOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">Both Florida and Arizona letter-of-credit law track Article 5 of the Uniform Commercial Code (Article 5). <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 675.101; <em>Jim Macon Bldg. Contractors, Inc. v. Lake County, </em>763 So.2d 1223, 1226 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2000); <em>see also </em>Ariz.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 47-5108. Although neither the parties nor we have uncovered a Florida or Arizona case that is directly on point, other courts interpreting Article 5 have recognized that an injunction \u201csuspend[sj\u201d the issuer\u2019s \u201cobligation to honor or dishonor the drafts during the pendency of the legal restraint.\u201d <em>Kelley v. First Westroads Bank, </em>840 F.2d 554, 558 (8th Cir.1988); <em>see also Fanslow v. N. Trust Co., </em>299 Ill. App.3d 21, 233 Ill.Dec. 164, 700 N.E.2d 692, 699 (1998) (\u201cThus, Northern Trust, which abided by the injunction, cannot be held liable for \u2018wrongful\u2019 dishonor of Fan-slow\u2019s draw documents\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">Tamarack\u2019s argument that the Arizona Superior Court Order \u201cvoided\u201d the Second Turnover Order in all states, thus obviating JPMorgan\u2019s duty to comply with the injunction, is mistaken. The Arizona Superior Court Order purported to void for purposes of enforcement in Arizona only the default judgment, not the Second Turnover Order. The Arizona Superior Court did not thereby render the default judgment, let alone the Second Turnover Order, invalid in all states. Indeed, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>court, which is one of limited jurisdiction, had no authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">We disagree with Tamarack\u2019s argument that JPMorgan should have recognized that the Second Turnover Order was entered in violation of Tamarack\u2019s due process rights, thus obviating JPMorgan\u2019s duty to comply with the order. The argument contravenes the \u201csettled principles of the law of civil contempt\u201d which requires a party \u201cto comply with a court order that is both specific and definite.\u201d <em>Balla v. Idaho State Bd. of Corrs., </em>869 F.2d 461, 465 (9th Cir.1989). Because JPMorgan had a duty to abide by the Texas county court\u2019s then-valid Second Turnover Order, JPMorgan did not wrongfully dishonor the LOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b692-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
