We dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review Guzman-Castaneda\u2019s petition because the claims raised regarding the effect of his 2002 conviction on his eligibility for cancellation of removal, as well as the IJ\u2019s responsibility to inform him of available relief, were not exhausted before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that exhaustion is mandatory and jurisdictional under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1)). We note also our recent holding in <em>Garcia-Jimenez v. Gonzales, </em>472 F.3d 679 (9th Cir.2007), that \u201can alien who has received \u00a7 212(c) relief \u2014 at any time \u2014 cannot also receive \u00a7 1229b relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">We grant Guzman-Castaneda\u2019s motion to file a late reply brief.
