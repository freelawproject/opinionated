Robinson, Smyrna, DE, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-20\">BEFORE: BARRY, AMBRO and FISHER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b109-21\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b109-22\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b109-23\">Charles Robinson appeals from the District Court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Because we determine that the appeal is lacking in arguable legal merit, we will dismiss it under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-24\">According to Robinson\u2019s complaint, in 2001 the Honorable Henry Graves, the defendant in this suit, presided over criminal proceedings involving Robinson. In September 2003, Robinson threatened to kill Judge Graves as well as his family. Despite the threat, Judge Graves continued to preside over the case and render decisions affecting Robinson\u2019s sentence, rejecting a motion to correct his sentence. Robinson appealed the denial of his motion arguing that Judge Graves was biased and that he was acting as a judge in a case that he had a personal interest in and should, therefore, be recused. The Delaware Supreme Court found no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-25\">Robinson then filed a pro se action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware seeking to remove Judge Graves from his case. The District Court, after granting Robinson\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>dismissed his complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) based on judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-26\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Having granted Rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>inson leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal, we now determine whether his appeal should be dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). An appeal must be dismissed if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B); <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In 1996, Congress amended 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 to provide that \u201cinjunctive relief shall not be granted\u201d in an action brought against \u201ca judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer\u2019s judicial capacity ... unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.\u201d <em>Bolin v. Story, </em>225 F.3d 1234, 1242 (11th Cir.2000) Robinson complains of actions taken by Judge Graves in his official capacity, no declaratory decree was involved, and he cannot demonstrate that declaratory relief is unavailable. Because his appeal lacks merit, we will dismiss it under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
