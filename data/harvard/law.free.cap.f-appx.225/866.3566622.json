Bakeman and eleven other federal civilian employees (\u201cappellants\u201d) appeal the final decision of the United States Court of Federal Claims. The Court of Federal Claims entered summary judgment in favor of the United States, ruling that appellants\u2019 backpay claims were barred by accord and satisfaction. <em>Ahrens v. United States, </em>62 Fed.Cl. 664 (2004). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b862-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-17\">Prior to July of 1995, a large number of civilian employees at six Naval shipyards, including the twelve appellants, filed individual employee grievances and two lawsuits. In December of 1995, the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (\u201cIFPTE\u201d) and the government resolved the employees\u2019 grievances and lawsuits through a Global Memorandum of Understanding (\u201c1995 MOU\u201d). Relevant to the present appeal, the 1995 MOU specified in paragraph 12 and Attachment D that \u201cthe persons who occupy the [GS-12 Technician] positions or who have occupied the positions identified in Attachment D\u201d thereafter would be considered exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d) for overtime purposes, but would be eligible to participate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>in an incentive award program, to receive performance awards, and to accumulate compensatory time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Paragraph 13 of the 1995 MOU contained an exception to paragraph 12 for long-term employees (\u201cgrandfathered employees\u201d), giving to those employees the option of keeping their FLSA non-exempt status or becoming FLSA exempt in exchange for eligibility for the incentive award program, performance awards, and compensatory time. Paragraph 16 provided for the employees to receive backpay and interest through March 1996. Additionally, paragraph 27 stated that grievances filed after the date of the agreement would not be pursued to arbitration by the IFPTE.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, paragraph 28 provided that each party to the agreement had full authority to enter into the agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">In 2000, the IFPTE again addressed the issue of GS-12 Technician FLSA exemption because of indications that the government was classifying a number of new GS-12 Technician employees as FLSA exempt for overtime purposes. On June 29, 2001, the IFPTE and the government executed a Second Supplemental Agreement (\u201cSSA\u201d) to the 1995 MOU, which specified that the government would re-elassify all GS-12 Technician positions in the GS-802 and GS-856 job series as FLSA non-exempt by October 7, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">On February 8, 2002, ninety-five GS-12 Technician employees, including the twelve appellants, filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims under the FLSA for overtime compensation, liquidated damages, and interest from the period after the 1995 MOU was executed until the reclassification of October 7, 2001. <em>Ahrens, </em>62 Fed.Cl. at 667. Twenty of these ninety-five plaintiffs (\u201cgrievant plaintiffs\u201d) filed grievances as GS-12 Technician employees prior to 1995; the twelve appellants are included in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>group of grievant plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>at 668. The other seventy-five plaintiffs (\u201cnon-grievant plaintiffs\u201d) were either not GS-12 Technician employees at the time of the 1995 MOU or had not filed grievances as of the date of the 1995 MOU. <em>Id. </em>The government asserted as an affirmative defense that the claims of all the employees were barred by accord and satisfaction based on the 1995 MOU. <em>Id. </em>at 667. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the accord and satisfaction issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">With regard to the non-grievant plaintiffs, the Court of Federal Claims denied the government\u2019s summary judgment motion and granted the plaintiffs\u2019 summary judgment motion. <em>Id. </em>at 670, 673. The parties then settled the backpay claims of these non-grievant plaintiffs. As to the grievant plaintiffs, including the twelve appellants, the Court of Federal Claims denied the plaintiffs\u2019 summary judgment motion and granted the government\u2019s summary judgment motion, ruling that these plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the government\u2019s defense of accord and satisfaction. <em>Id. </em>at 671, 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">On August 24, 2005, the Court of Federal Claims entered judgment in favor of the non-grievant plaintiffs for whom settlement was reached and for the government with respect to the remaining twenty grievant plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">After judgment was entered, the appellants filed a timely notice of appeal. We have jurisdiction over a final decision of the Court of Federal Claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">We review the grant of summary judgment by the Court of Federal Claims de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>See Teleflex, Inc. v. Ficosa N. Am. Corp., </em>299 F.3d 1313, 1323 (Fed.Cir.2002). Summary judgment is only appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>SRI Int\u2019l v. Matsushita Elec. Corp., </em>775 F.2d 1107, 1116 (Fed.Cir.1985) (en banc). We review the interpretation by the Court of Federal Claims of the 1995 MOU de novo. <em>See Coast Fed. Bank, FSB v. United States, </em>323 F.3d 1035, 1037-38 (Fed.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">There are no pertinent facts in dispute. The question in the case is whether the Court of Federal Claims correctly held that the requirements for the accord and satisfaction defense were met. \u201cA claim is discharged by the doctrine of accord and satisfaction when \u2018some performance different from that which was claimed as due is rendered and such substituted performance is accepted by the claimant as full satisfaction of his claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Case, Inc. v. United States, </em>88 F.3d 1004, 1011 n. 7 (Fed.Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Cmty. Heating &amp; Plumbing Co. v. Kelso, </em>987 F.2d 1575, 1581 (Fed.Cir.1993)). A valid accord and satisfaction requires four elements: (1) proper subject matter, (2) competent parties, (3) a meeting of the minds,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (4) consideration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>O\u2019Connor v. United States, </em>308 F.3d 1233, 1240 (Fed.Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>The parties do not dispute that the first two elements of the accord and satisfaction defense\u2014proper subject matter and competent parties\u2014have been satisfied. Instead, appellants argue that the Court of Federal Claims erred in ruling that their claims were barred by accord and satisfaction because the government did not establish the consideration element and the meeting of the minds element. Specifically, appellants contend that because the government did not perform its obligations under the 1995 MOU, it did not satisfy the consideration element. Appellants urge that the government agreed to treat all GS-12 Technician employees as FLSA exempt from the date of the 1995 MOU forward and that the government violated the terms of the 1995 MOU by classifying some new GS-12 Technician employees as FLSA non-exempt. Additionally, according to appellants, the lack of a stated agreement waiving employees\u2019 rights to bring future FLSA overtime suits in the 1995 MOU and the circumstances surrounding the execution of the 1995 MOU demonstrate that the government failed to prove that there was a meeting of the minds.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">In response, the government argues that the Court of Federal Claims correctly ruled that the government established the consideration element and the meeting of the minds element. The government contends that appellants\u2019 assertion that the government agreed to provide the consideration of treating all GS-12 Technician employees as FLSA exempt is incorrect based on the plain language of the 1995 MOU, given that the government agreed to provide consideration in the form of an incentive award program, performance awards, and compensatory time and that the government indeed provided such consideration in exchange for the appellants\u2019 acceptance of FLSA exempt status. With respect to the meeting of the minds element, the government argues that the 1995 MOU reflected a meeting of the minds because the IFPTE acted upon appellants\u2019 behalf to settle their FLSA grievances through the 1995 MOU and also because the explicit language of the 1995 MOU indicates that appellants\u2019 positions would be classified as FLSA exempt and thus waives the appellants\u2019 FLSA rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">We conclude that the Court of Federal Claims correctly ruled that the government established the consideration element and the meeting of the minds element of the accord and satisfaction defense. We thus affirm the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 grant of summary judgment in favor of the government based on the finding that appellants\u2019 backpay claims were barred by accord and satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">As to the consideration element, we agree with the government that the plain language of the 1995 MOU, specifically paragraph 12, clearly states that the government agreed to provide as consideration an incentive award program, performance awards, and compensatory time to the appellants, who agreed to be classified as FLSA exempt. Appellants do not contend that the government failed to provide consideration in the form of an incentive award program, performance awards, and compensatory time. We find appellants\u2019 argument that the government failed to provide the consideration of treating all GS-12 Technician employees as FLSA exempt unconvincing given that the government never agreed to provide such consideration. Moreover, paragraph 12 states that \u201cthe persons who occupy the positions or who have occupied the positions identified in Attachment D shall by FLSA exempt.\u201d This language clearly indicates that the agreement applies to past and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>present employees only and not to future employees. Given that this language does not encompass future employees, the fact that the government incorrectly classified certain new GS-12 Technician employees after the date of the agreement is irrelevant to the 1995 MOU and the consideration element.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Turning to the meeting of the minds element, we agree with the government\u2019s contention that because the IFPTE agreed in the 1995 MOU that appellants would thereafter be classified as FLSA exempt, appellants are deemed to have understood that they no longer had rights to sue under the FLSA. Appellants nevertheless argue that the lack of an explicit agreement regarding employees\u2019 rights to bring litigation claims demonstrates a lack of a meeting of the minds. However, we reject this argument, given that the employees themselves gave IFPTE authority to represent them in the 1995 MOU negotiations, <em>see </em>paragraph 28, and that the IFPTE then agreed to the FLSA exempt classification for these employees, <em>see </em>paragraph 12. Finally, appellants\u2019 argument that the circumstances surrounding the execution of the 1995 MOU indicate that the government failed to prove a meeting of the minds fails because this evidence regarding the 1995 MOU negotiations contradicts the unambiguous language of the 1995 MOU that appellants would thereafter be classified as FLSA exempt. <em>See Hunt Constr. Group, Inc. v. United States, </em>281 F.3d 1369, 1373 (Fed.Cir.2002) (\u201cWhen the contract language is unambiguous on its face, our inquiry ends, and the plain language of the contract controls.\u201d). As a consequence of agreeing to be classified as FLSA exempt, appellants waived any rights to sue under the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">In sum, we reject the appellants\u2019 arguments regarding the consideration element and the meeting of the minds element of the accord and satisfaction defense as contrary to the plain language of the 1995 MOU.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Court of Federal Claims granting summary judgment in favor of the United States is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-5\">. Paragraph 12 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The parties agree that the persons who occupy the positions or who have occupied the positions identified in Attachment D shall be FLSA exempt. In addition, employees who occupy these positions shall be the beneficiaries of the following program, effective March 31, 1996. There shall be an incentive award program for FLSA exempt engineers and GS-12 technicians (excluding nuclear STEs and nuclear SREs who are directly involved in pre-overhaul testing, post-overhaul testing and/or sea trials). For each time the number of overtime hours worked during these activities exceeds a unit of 300 hours within one rating period, the employee shall receive an incentive award of $500. For example, 300 hours = $500; next 300 hours = $500, etc. In addition, FLSA exempt engineers and FLSA exempt GS-12 technicians shall receive a $500 performance award upon the successful completion of the Engineer in Training (EIT) or Professional Engineer (PE) examination. Further, the FLSA exempt engineers and FLSA exempt GS-12 technicians shall be allowed to accumulate up to 160 hours of compensatory time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b863-11\">.
