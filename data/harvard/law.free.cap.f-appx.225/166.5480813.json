Reynoso\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising two issues but stating that, in his view, there are no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>meritorious issues for appeal. Reynoso has filed a pro se supplemental brief raising additional issues. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">At sentencing, the district court adopted the presentence report without objection. Both the government and Reynoso\u2019s attorney asked the court to impose sentence at the low end of the advisory guideline range of 262-327 months, and the court complied. In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel suggests that the sentence was unreasonable and that the court should have departed below the guideline range pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5H1.6, p.s. (2005), due to Reynoso\u2019s extensive family ties and responsibilities. We discern no error. Reynoso did not request a departure, and a sentence within a properly calculated advisory guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In his pro se brief, Reynoso claims that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments were violated when the district court found that he was responsible for a quantity of crack in excess of the amount charged in the indictment. Because Reynoso was sentenced under an advisory guideline scheme, no constitutional error occurred. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). He also argues that the court plainly erred in awarding him a four-level leadership role adjustment, USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(a); however, the presentence report contained uncontested information that supported the adjustment. Finally, Reynoso claims that his sentence was unreasonable because a co-defendant\u2019s sentence of 360 months was later reduced on the government\u2019s motion. \u201c[A] defendant can only rebut the presumption of reasonableness by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. \u2014 (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439). Reynoso has not met that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client in writing of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that such a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-13\">.
