R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b566-20\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-21\">Jaswinder Singh, a native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order affirming an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of his application for political asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-22\">We review for substantial evidence the decisions of the IJ and the BIA and will reverse only if the record compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147,1149-50 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-23\">Singh challenges the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. In light of the record as a whole, including Singh\u2019s inconsistent testimony to the asylum officer and to the IJ about material portions of his claim of persecution, we conclude that Singh\u2019s testimony lacked the requisite \u201cring of truth.\u201d <em>See Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1067 (9th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we conclude the evidence in this case does not compel a finding that the petitioner was credible, or that the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was based on impermissible grounds. <em>See id. </em>at 1064.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-24\">Because the asylum claim fails, Singh\u2019s claim for withholding of removal, which requires a higher standard of proof, fails as well. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). Finally, Singh\u2019s petition for protection under CAT fails because Singh relied upon the same statements which the IJ determined not to be credible. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b566-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
