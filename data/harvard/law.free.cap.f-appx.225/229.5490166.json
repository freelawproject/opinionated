Oro\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Oro contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Oro properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Oro next argues that the district court erred by ordering him to cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample as a condition of supervised release. This claim is not ripe for review on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Carmichael, </em>343 F.3d 756, 761-62 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, this portion of the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>at 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-15\">Oro additionally argues that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines by characterizing his state felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Given the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), Oro is correct. <em>See United States v. Estrada-Mendoza, </em>475 F.3d 258, 259-61 (5th Cir.2007). His conviction is affirmed. His sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for re-sentencing. Oro\u2019s motion to summarily affirm in part and to vacate in part is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-18\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART; SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RE-SENTENCING; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
