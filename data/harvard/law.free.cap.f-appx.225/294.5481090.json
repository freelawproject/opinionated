Salaverria contends that the district court reversibly erred by imposing a guidelines sentence without considering his reasons for coming to this country in light of the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record reflects that the district court considered the statutory sentencing factors; Salaverria has not shown that the sentence was unreasonable or that this court should not defer to the district court\u2019s determinations at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-23\">Salaverria contends that the enhancement provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 are unconstitutional on their face and as applied in this case. He argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348,147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that his 50-month term of imprisonment exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Salaverria\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Salaverria properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

There is no dispute that the 50-month sentence imposed is within a properly calculated guideline range.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
