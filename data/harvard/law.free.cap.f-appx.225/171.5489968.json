The district court sentenced Renteria to 120 months of imprisonment. Renteria\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal but requests this Court to review whether the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence. Renteria was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-24\">Here, the statutory mandatory minimum set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(B)(i) (2000) became the applicable guidelines range. In sentencing Renteria, the district court considered the properly calculated advisory sentencing guidelines range and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006). The sentence imposed is the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. Under these circumstances, absent a Government substantial assistance motion, the district court lacked discretion to impose a lesser sentence. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Renteria\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-25\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>torious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
