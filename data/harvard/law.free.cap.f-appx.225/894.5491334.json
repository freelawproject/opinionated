Cir. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>27(f) and to dismiss Raymond H. Wilkes\u2019 petition for review of the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board in <em>Wilkes v. </em>Treasury, No. CH-0432-04-0774-I-1 (Apr. 20, 2006). Wilkes opposes and submits an amended opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Treasury removed Wilkes from his position as a revenue agent and Wilkes appealed to the Board alleging, inter aha, discrimination based on race. The Administrative Judge (AJ) determined that Wilkes had not proven his discrimination claim and affirmed the removal action. The Board denied Wilkes\u2019 petition for review of the AJ\u2019s decision. Wilkes sought review of the Board\u2019s decision both in this court and with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). EEOC determined that Wilkes\u2019 petition was untimely and issued a notice of denial of consideration on June 22, 2006. On August 15, 2006, Wilkes filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. <em>Wilkes v. Paulson, </em>No. 06-CV-04411. The district court entered judgment dismissing Wilkes\u2019 action on January 24, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Treasury argues that because Wilkes pursued judicial review in district court of both discrimination and non-discrimination issues decided by the Board, this court lacks jurisdiction over his petition for review. Treasury asserts that Wilkes\u2019 brief reflects that he seeks review of discrimination issues in this court and that pursuant to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Williams v. Dept. of the Army, </em>715 F.2d 1485 (Fed.Cir.1983) (en banc), this court lacks jurisdiction to review discrimination issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Wilkes contends that pursuant to <em>Chap-pell v. Chao, </em>388 F.3d 1373 (11th Cir.2004), if a petitioner seeks review of a Board decision in both a district court and this court, the district court case would be \u201coverruled\u201d by the filing in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Chap-pell </em>is not on point. In that case, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked jurisdiction because this court had already decided the petitioner\u2019s case. In contrast, in the present case the district court has already dismissed Wilkes\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">Pursuant to this court\u2019s en banc decision in <em>Williams, </em>a petitioner seeking review of a Board decision involving discrimination issues may either waive the discrimination issues and seek review of non-discrimination issues in this court or seek review of both discrimination and non-discrimination issues in a district court. Bifurcation of the discrimination and non-discrimination issues between a district court and this court is impermissible. <em>Williams </em>at 1491. Thus, we dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"ahn-dedup-0\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"ajd-dedup-0\">(1) Treasury\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac3v\">(2) Treasury\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"AYg\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
