The district court sentenced Gra-nado to 120 months in prison, which was well above the 46-to-57-month advisory guidelines imprisonment range calculated by the Probation Office in Granado\u2019s Pre-sentence Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Granado contends that the district court (1) violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h) and <em>Burns v. United States, </em>501 U.S. 129, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991), by failing to notify the parties that it was considering a sua sponte upward \u201cdeparture\u201d from the guidelines range and (2) failed to adhere to the methodology prescribed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 for calculating the extent of such a \u201cdeparture.\u201d Granado\u2019s sentence was imposed after the issuance of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and the district court deemed the above-the-guidelines-range sentence a \u201cvariance\u201d rather than a \u201cdeparture.\u201d Granado\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 721-24 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
