California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel for Campos has filed a brief stating that there are no grounds for relief, and a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. No pro se supplemental brief was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-25\">Our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), discloses no grounds for relief on direct appeal. We affirm the conviction. Because Campos knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence and was sentenced within the terms of the plea agreement, we dismiss the appeal of his sentence. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that an appeal waiver is valid when it is entered into knowingly and voluntarily).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-26\">Accordingly, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>We AFFIRM the conviction and DISMISS the appeal of the sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b632-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
