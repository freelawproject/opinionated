California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Bennett has filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Bennett\u2019s response shows that there is no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration of Bennett\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and this APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Bennett\u2019s motions for appointment of new counsel, for substitution of counsel, for an extension of time to file his appellate brief, and to strike counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
