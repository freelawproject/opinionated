We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1193 (9th Cir. 2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-27\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Chong was not credible because Chong failed to mention in his written application his fear of torture by the South Korean president due to a speech he delivered on the risk of nuclear war with North Korea. This omission goes to the heart of Chong\u2019s claim, <em>Li v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number><em>Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and accordingly, Chong has failed to establish eligibility for deferral of removal under CAT, <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1157 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Chong\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The court\u2019s order of November 23, 2005, denying Chong\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, states that no motions for reconsideration of that order will be entertained. Consequently, we do not entertain Chong\u2019s renewed motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b543-28\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
