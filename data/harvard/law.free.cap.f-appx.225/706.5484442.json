The facts and proceedings are known to the parties and are only repeated here as necessary. The panel reviews for substantial evidence the factual findings underlying the BIA\u2019s determination that Petitioner did not qualify for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>Ze-hatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>(9th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). This standard is highly deferential. <em>Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1018 (9th Cir.2006). Under the substantial evidence standard, \u201c \u2018administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1185 (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)). The court determines its own jurisdiction de novo. <em>Rosales-Rosales v. Ashcroft, </em>347 F.3d 714, 716 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">This court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that Singh is ineligible for asylum because he provided material support to terrorists. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(v); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(i)(I); <em>see also Bellout v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 975, 977 (9th Cir.2004). Although we do have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision in the context of Singh\u2019s request for withholding of removal, we find that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Singh is ineligible for relief because he materially supported terrorists. By Singh\u2019s own admission, he provided assistance to known terrorists by providing shelter and food and by transporting funds to members of the Khalistan Commando Force. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(iv)(VI) (including providing a \u201csafe house,\u201d \u201ccommunications,\u201d and \u201cfunds\u201d or a \u201ctransfer of funds\u201d among the activities that constitute \u201cmaterial support\u201d). The BIA properly held that Singh\u2019s material support of terrorists in his native India rendered him ineligible for statutory withholding of removal. <em>See Bellout, </em>363 F.3d at 978-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">KLEINFELD, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">I concur. However, were Jagdeep Singh not seventeen at the time he last provided aid and comfort to terrorists, I am not so sure I would. As the asylum statute is currently enforced, age is immaterial. While the language of the statute contains no reference to age, suppose a nine year old brought water to a guest at the behest of his parents. Would he be a proper target of the statute\u2019s jurisdiction stripping proviso? Compliance by young children with parental commands probably should not impose a permanent ban on asylum upon the children.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b735-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
