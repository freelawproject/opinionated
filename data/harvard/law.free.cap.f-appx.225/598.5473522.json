Weaver argues that his petition was timely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D), which provides that the one-year statute of limitation begins to run from \u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d According to Weaver, that date was February 14, 2001, when an alleged key witness signed a declaration. The district court, however, correctly concluded that the factual predicate of Weaver\u2019s claim was discovered on July 25, 2000, at the time his counsel first interviewed the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Weaver is not entitled to equitable tolling. Although his attorney was mistaken about the law, her delay was not sufficiently egregious to constitute an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d warranting equitable tolling of the AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitation. <em>Cf. Spitsyn v. Moore, </em>345 F.3d 796, 800-02 (9th Cir.2003). His attorney\u2019s delay did not prevent him from timely filing his federal petition; he had twenty-three days to file a timely federal habeas petition after the California Supreme Court\u2019s denial of his petition was final. Nor is Weaver\u2019s late-filed petition excused under the doctrine of actual innocence. Weaver does not show that, in light of all the evidence, it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; nor does he show that a court cannot have confidence in the outcome of his trial. <em>See Smith v. Baldwin, </em>466 F.3d 805, 812-13 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Therefore, the district court correctly ruled that Weaver\u2019s habeas petition was time-barred under AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b626-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
