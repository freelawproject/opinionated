We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we need not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">I. Effect of the Settlement Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Plan. <em>Botosan v. Paul McNally Realty, </em>216 F.3d 827, 830 (9th Cir.2000). The issue before us is whether the settlement agreement entered into between Austin and her employer bars Austin\u2019s ERISA action against the Plan. The settlement agreement releases Austin\u2019s employer, its agents, and \u201call persons acting under, by, through or in concert with\u201d them from a variety of potential claims by Austin, including claims for ERISA benefits. Because the Plan is an entity created and administered by Austin\u2019s former employer, we conclude that the agreement\u2019s broad release clause clearly bars Austin\u2019s ERISA action.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">II. Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the Plan. <em>Childress v. Darby Lumber, Inc., </em>357 F.3d 1000, 1011 (9th Cir.2004). Austin covenanted not to file any lawsuit asserting a claim waived under the settlement agreement\u2019s broad release clause. She further agreed to indemnify the released parties for attorneys\u2019 fees if she violated her covenant not to assert waived claims. We therefore conclude that the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees, supported by the express language of the parties\u2019 agreement, was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b699-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
