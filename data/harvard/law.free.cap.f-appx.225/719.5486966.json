Astrue is substituted for his predecessor Jo Anne Barnhart as Commissioner of the Social Security Administration. Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b748-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">The administrative law judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) decision that Ferguson had the residual functional capacity to perform unskilled, medium exertion work was supported by substantial evidence and free from legal error. <em>See Tidwell v. Apfel, </em>161 F.3d 599, 601 (9th Cir.1999). The ALJ gave specific, cogent reasons supported by substantial evidence for disbelieving Ferguson\u2019s testimony regarding her symptoms and disability. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1996). Among other reasons, the ALJ identified inconsistencies in Ferguson\u2019s testimony and the lack of objective backing for her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-14\">The ALJ also gave clear reasons supported by substantial evidence for discounting the checkbox forms of treating physicians Drs. O. Troum and Okpara, including the fact that neither form was supported by objective medical evidence, <em>see Batson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1195 (9th Cir.2004), and that Dr. Okpara\u2019s form was completed more than four years after the expiration of Ferguson\u2019s insured status, <em>see Tidwell, </em>161 F.3d at 602. The ALJ properly discounted Dr. Schatz\u2019s report, because Ferguson made a poor effort during her examination and because the report relied on Ferguson\u2019s subjective complaints. <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 605 (9th Cir.1989). Further, the ALJ\u2019s finding that Claimant\u2019s mental condition would not preclude her from engaging in unskilled work was consistent with the opinion of Dr. Ravin, who recommended her for vocational rehabilitation training.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-15\">The ALJ did not fail to develop the record fully, <em>Brown v. Heckler, </em>713 F.2d 441, 443 (9th Cir.1983) (per curiam), as there was ample physician evidence and no direct conflict in the testimony of Drs. Weingarten and MondryBurke regarding the meaning of the term \u201cfunctional overlay.\u201d Further, the ALJ properly consulted the grids for her assessment of available jobs, because Ferguson had both exertional and nonexertional limitations, <em>see Polny v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 661, 663 (9th Cir.1988), and because the vocational expert\u2019s testimony regarding available jobs was in response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>to a hypothetical that was not based on the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding Ferguson\u2019s limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Finally, Ferguson is not entitled to remand to the Appeals Council for reconsideration of Drs. Cox and Cohen\u2019s reports because Ferguson failed to show good cause for not submitting the reports sooner. <em>See Mayes v. Massanari, </em>276 F.3d 453, 462 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b748-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
