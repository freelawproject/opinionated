Wheeler argues that his sentence is unreasonable because it is based on judge-found facts rather than facts that he admitted or that were found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The district court is allowed to find facts and is required to determine a defendant\u2019s proper guideline range of imprisonment before sentencing him. <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746-47 (5th Cir. 2005). Wheeler\u2019s sentence was within a properly calculated advisory guideline range and is entitled to great deference. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). Giving such deference to Wheeler\u2019s sentence, and recognizing that the sentencing court considered all the factors for a fair sentence under \u00a7 3553(a), we conclude that Wheeler has failed to demonstrate that his sentence was unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 519-20. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
