To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005), we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The BIA acted within its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider because petitioners did not identify an error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s June 1, 2005 order concluding petitioners failed to show how their new evidence established their eligibility for relief, given the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C) (requiring a motion to reconsider to specify errors of fact or law in the previous order).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">To the extent petitioners seek review of the BIA\u2019s June 1, 2005 order denying their motion to reopen, we lack jurisdiction because the petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Singh v.
