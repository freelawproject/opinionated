In a brief filed under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel argues that the 120-month prison sentence is excessive and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-20\">We disagree. In sentencing Lovejoy to the statutory maximum (which was also the undisputed advisory Guidelines sentence), the district court properly considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and nothing in the record indicates that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (sentences are reviewed for unreasonableness; \u00a7 3553(a) factors will guide appellate courts in determining whether sentence is unreasonable); <em>United States v. Mathis, </em>451 F.3d 939, 941 (8th Cir.2006) (reasonableness review is akin to review for abuse of discretion); <em>United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1004 (8th Cir.2005) (abuse of discretion may occur if court failed to consider relevant factor that should have received significant weight, gave significant weight to improper or irrelevant factor, or considered only appropriate factors but committed clear error of judgment in weighing them). Further, the sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the crime. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>340 F.3d 672, 679 (8th Cir.2003) (Eighth Amendment forbids only extreme sentences that are grossly disproportionate to crime); <em>United States v. No Neck, </em>472 F.3d 1048, 1055 (8th Cir.2007) (affirming sentence of 292 months in prison and lifetime of supervised release for defendant convicted of abusive sexual contact and aggravated sexual abuse).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-23\">As for Lovejoy\u2019s pro se assertion that trial counsel\u2019s representation was lacking, ineffective-assistance claims are more properly raised in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings, where the record can be developed. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>330 F.3d 1068,1069 (8th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-24\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-21\">. The Honorable Charles B. Kornmann, United States District Judge for the District of South Dakota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
