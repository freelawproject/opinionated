Desta challenges the immigration judge\u2019s findings that his asylum application was untimely and that he did not establish eligibility for withholding of removal or protection under CAT. Desta also questions whether the Board erred in adopting and affirming the immigration judge\u2019s order without specifying the reasons for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">The timeliness of an alien\u2019s asylum application is usually a question of fact. <em>See Mehilli v. Gonzales, </em>433 F.3d 86, 93 (1st Cir.2005). On May 11, 2005, Congress enacted the Real ID Act, which added a new subsection to the judicial review provisions. This subsection stated that discretionary and factual determinations are outside the jurisdiction of the court of appeals. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (West 2005); <em>see also Vasile v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 766, 768 (7th Cir.2005). The exception to this provision is for constitutional claims or questions of law raised by aliens seeking discretionary relief. <em>Higuit v. Gonzales, </em>433 F.3d 417, 419 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2973, 165 L.Ed.2d 955 (2006). Because Desta has not raised a constitutional or legal claim as to the immigration judge\u2019s decision that his asylum application was untimely, we do not have jurisdiction to review Desta\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-14\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Desta\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Ca-mara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because we find Desta would not be able to show that he is eligible for asylum based on the record presented, we find he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">We also hold that Desta fails to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or he would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004). We find that Desta fails to make the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-16\">Finally, Desta asserts the BIA erred in adopting and affirming the immigration judge\u2019s decision without stating what factual and legal assessments were relied on. We find no indication that Desta did not receive a full and fair review by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-17\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
