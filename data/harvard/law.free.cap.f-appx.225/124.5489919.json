He now appeals, claiming that the district court should have allowed him to withdraw his guilty plea because he allegedly did not understand the plea agreement. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-20\">Our review is for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000). Withdrawal of a guilty plea is not a matter of right. <em>Id. </em>The defendant bears the burden of showing a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for the withdrawal of his plea. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). \u201c[A] \u2018fair and just\u2019 reason ... is one that essentially challenges ... the fairness of the Rule 11 proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Lambey, </em>974 F.2d 1389, 1394 (4th Cir.1992) (en banc). An appropriately conducted Rule 11 proceeding, however, raises a strong presumption that the guilty plea is final and binding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-21\">Courts consider six factors in determining whether withdrawal of a guilty plea is proper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-22\">(1) whether the defendant has offered credible evidence that his plea was not knowing or otherwise involuntary; (2) whether the defendant has credibly asserted his legal innocence; (3) whether there has been a delay between entry of the plea and filing of the motion; (4) whether the defendant has had close assistance of counsel; (5) whether withdrawal will cause prejudice to the government; and (6) whether withdrawal will inconvenience the court and waste judicial resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-23\"><em>Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d at 424 (quoting <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991) (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-24\">With these factors in mind, we have reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs on appeal. We conclude that Garcia did not demonstrate a \u201cfair and just\u201d reason for withdrawing his guilty plea, and that there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-25\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-26\">Accordingly, we affirm Garcia\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>cause the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
