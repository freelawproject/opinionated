Piper, Texas prisoner #913394, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit as frivolous and for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. A dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted is reviewed de novo. <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 734 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-21\">Piper alleges that conditions in the East-ham Unit are interrupting his sleep. \u201c[T]he treatment a prisoner receives in prison and the conditions under which he is confined are subject to scrutiny under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Woods v. Edwards, </em>51 F.3d 577, 581 (5th Cir.1995) (internal quotations and citation omitted). To establish an Eighth Amendment violation, the prisoner must show that \u201cthe risk that [he] complains of [is] so grave that it violates contemporary standards of decency to expose <em>anyone </em>unwillingly to such a risk.\u201d <em>Helling v. McKinney, </em>509 U.S. 25, 36, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993). Piper has made no showing that the complained conditions violate contemporary standards of decency. The district court did not err in finding that Pipers\u2019s claims were insufficient to establish an Eighth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-22\">Piper is warned that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 suit counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) and that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed in forma <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Ade-pegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996); \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b263-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
