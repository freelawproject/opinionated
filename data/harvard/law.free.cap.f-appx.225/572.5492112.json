Walters, Esq., Melissa Neiman-Kelting, U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Div./Office of Immigration Lit., Washington, DC, for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b600-13\">Before: CANBY, TROTT and FISHER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b600-16\"> This panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See Fed. </em>R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b600-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-15\">Martha Reyes petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) decision finding her ineligible for a waiver under either 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(ll) or 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) to the charge of inadmissibility for alien smuggling in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-19\">We agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusion that petitioner is not eligible for a waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(ll) because the individual involved in the smuggling attempt is not a recognized family member under the waiver. <em>See Moran v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1089, 1094 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that the waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(ll) applies to an alien who \u201chas encouraged induced, assisted, abetted, or aided only an individual who at the time of such action was the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, son or daughter (and no other individual) to enter the United States in violation of law.\u201d). Moreover, the BIA correctly concluded the waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) does not apply to a charge under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-20\">The petition for review and motion for stay of removal fail to raise any legal arguments regarding the BIA\u2019s decision. The respondent filed a motion for summary disposition which petitioner has not opposed. Because petitioner has failed to raise a challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition is granted. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). The petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-21\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-22\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b600-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
