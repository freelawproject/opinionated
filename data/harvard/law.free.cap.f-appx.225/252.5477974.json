Rojas-Martinez argues that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to extend the time for filing his notice of appeal. Having been given no reason at all for the delay, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rojas-Martinez\u2019s motion. <em>United States v. Clark, </em>51 F.3d 42, 43 n. 5 (5th Cir.1995). The district court\u2019s denial of his motion for extension of time to appeal is AFFIRMED. <em>See United States v. Leijano-Cruz, </em>473 F.3d 571, 573 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
