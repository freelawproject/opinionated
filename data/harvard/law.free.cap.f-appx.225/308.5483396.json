Segoviano contends, and the Government concedes, that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines by increasing his sentence based on a prior Texas conviction that was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines and <em>United States v. Fierro-Reyna </em>466 F.3d 324, 327-29 (5th Cir.2006). The Government argues that the error was harmless but fails to show that the error did not affect the selection of the sentence. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992), <em>cited in United States v. Davis, </em>478 F.3d 266, 272-73 (5th Cir.2007). The Government failed to bear its burden of showing that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the error. <em>See Williams, </em>503 U.S. at 203,112 S.Ct. 1112. We vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Fierro-Reyna.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-25\">Segoviano argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that any term of imprisonment of more than two years exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Segoviano\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Segoviano properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Segoviano\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
