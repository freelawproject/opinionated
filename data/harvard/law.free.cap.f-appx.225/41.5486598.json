The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Swain, J.) sentenced Reyes principally to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment, within the 37-46 month range set forth in the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reyes argues that his sentence is unreasonable \u201c[bjecause a shorter term of imprisonment would have more than fulfilled the aims of retribution, deterrence, protection of the public and rehabilitation, as well as the other aims of [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a).\u201d We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u201cThe weight to be afforded any given argument made pursuant to one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is a matter firmly committed to the discretion of the sentencing judge and is beyond our review, as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 32 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The record confirms that the district court understood its <em>post-Booker </em>authority under the Guidelines. After reviewing the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, the district court explained that the Guidelines are \u201cadvisory,\u201d and concluded that on the facts presented, \u201cthe [GJuideline range includes a sentence that is reasonable, sufficient, and no greater than necessary to address the Section 3553(a) sentencing goals and factors.\u201d Sent\u2019g Tr. at 17 (Aug. 1, 2006). And we conclude that the sentence was well within the broad range of reasonable sentences that the district court could have imposed. <em>See Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-12\">. This range included a three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, and a two-point reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 (b)(7).
