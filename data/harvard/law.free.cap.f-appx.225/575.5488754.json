We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the grant of summary judgment, <em>Yakutat, Inc. v. Gutierrez, </em>407 F.3d 1054, 1066 (9th Cir. 2005), and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In 2001, the Hawaii Department of Corrections (\u201cHDC\u201d) ordered that all Hawaiian inmates be prohibited from participating in Pascua Yaqui Native American sweat lodge ceremonies because an investigation revealed that Hawaiian prison gangs were using these services as a forum to organize disruption at FCC. The district court concluded there were triable issues of fact regarding whether defendants placed a substantial burden on Coro-nel\u2019s free exercise of religion, and whether the prison\u2019s refusal to allow Coronel to practice with the Pascua Yaquis was the least restrictive means to further a compelling government interest. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-l (the government shall not substantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of religion unless it is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The district court erred in determining that prison chaplain Paul and prison Warden Luna did not personally participate in the policy that prohibited Coronel from attending Pascua Yaqui ceremonies. Although the policy was already in place at the time Paul and Luna arrived at FCC, Paul and Luna oversaw and carried out the prohibition. <em>See Jeffers v. Gomez, </em>267 F.3d 895, 915 (9th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (section 1983 supervisory liability arises upon a showing of personal participation by defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The district court also erred in concluding that Coronel presented no evidence that Corrections Corporation of America (\u201cCCA\u201d) had a policy or custom that was the moving force behind the alleged violations. The FCC was operated by CCA, and the record shows that the FCC and its officers adopted and promulgated HDC\u2019s order prohibiting Hawaiian inmates from participating in the Pascua Yaqui ceremonies. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Social Sews., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (a government entity may be sued only where \u201cthe action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body\u2019s officers\u201d or if the deprivations are \u201cpursuant to governmental \u2018custom\u2019 even though such a custom has not received formal approval through the body\u2019s official decision making channels\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">We reverse the district court\u2019s summary judgment for defendants, and remand for further proceedings on the triable issues of fact that remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b604-25\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
