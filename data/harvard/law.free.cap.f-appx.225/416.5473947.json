We grant Hill leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Hill alleged that he had been exposed to a number of dangerous environmental conditions at MSP which had caused skin problems, stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. Having carefully reviewed the record, we agree with the district court that Hill offered no evidence that any medical problem he suffered was attributable to the alleged conditions and no evidence that Dormir\u00e9 was deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of serious harm to him or other inmates. <em>See Choate v. Lockhart, </em>7 F.3d 1370, 1373-74 (8th Cir.1993) (to establish Eighth Amendment violation, prisoner must show that alleged condition was objectively sufficiently serious and that prison officials\u2019 actions subjectively demonstrated deliberate indifference to prisoner\u2019s health or safety). Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-34\">. The Honorable Nanette K.
