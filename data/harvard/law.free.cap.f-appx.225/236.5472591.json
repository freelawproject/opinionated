He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than as elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-21\">Gutierrez-Ramirez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Gutierrez-Ramirez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Gutierrez-Ramirez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-24\">Gutierrez-Ramirez also contends that the district court erred when it characterized his prior state felony conviction for simple possession of marijuana as an aggravated felony for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). We review Gutierrez-Ramirez\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), Gutierrez-Ramirez\u2019s argument has merit. <em>See United States v. Estrada-Mendoza, </em>475 F.3d 258, 259-61 (5th Cir. 2007). Accordingly, Gutierrez-Ramirez\u2019s sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Lopez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b264-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
