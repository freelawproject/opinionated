In No. 06-1138, Soldatov challenges the Board\u2019s order affirming the immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Because the Board affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s order without opinion, we treat the immigration judge\u2019s reasoning as that of the Board\u2019s in our review. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2006); <em>Haoua v. Gonzales, </em>472 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-20\">To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Sol-datov fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-21\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Soldatov\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Sol-datov fails to show that he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-22\">Soldatov did not present an argument concerning the denial of protection under the Convention Against Torture to the Board. (JA 11-60). This court lacks jurisdiction over any claim that was not administratively exhausted. 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000); <em>Gandziami-Mickhou v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 351, 359 n. 2 (4th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Finally, in No. 06-1885, Soldatov petitions for review of a decision of the Board denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings. We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Soldatov\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2006); <em>Barry v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 741, 744 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1147, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Accordingly, we deny the petitions for review for the reasons stated by the Board. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
