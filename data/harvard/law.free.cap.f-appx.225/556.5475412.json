We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s determination regarding continuous physical presence in the United States, <em>Lopez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 847, 850-51 (9th Cir. 2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Velazquez failed to establish his continuous physical presence in the United States during the 10 years prior to service of the notice to appear on November 26, 1997. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A), (d)(1). Velazquez offered no documentary evidence of his entry or presence in 1987, and neither he nor his uncle were able to explain why they recalled that Velazquez arrived in 1987 rather than 1988. Further, on his asylum application Velazquez gave 1988 as his first entry date.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">We decline to consider Velazquez\u2019s due process contentions regarding the IJ\u2019s hardship finding because the BIA\u2019s physical presence finding is dispositive and the BIA did not make a ruling on the IJ\u2019s hardship finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b584-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
