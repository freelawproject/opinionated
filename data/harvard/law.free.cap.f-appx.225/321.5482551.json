Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 828, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005), and its progeny, which have outlined this court\u2019s methodology for reviewing sentences for reasonableness. Romero also preserves for further review his contention that his sentence is unreasonable because of the court\u2019s refusal to consider his postsentencing rehabilitation. Romero concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 527 (5th Cir.2006), which held that <em>\u201cBooker </em>does not give sentencing courts the discretion to impose a non-Guideline sentence based on the courts\u2019 disagreement with Congressional and Sentencing Commission policy.\u201d The Government\u2019s motion for summary affir-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>manee is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
