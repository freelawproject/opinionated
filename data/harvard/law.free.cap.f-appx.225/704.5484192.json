We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law. <em>Cabrera-Alvarez v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1006, 1009 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Romero-Mora was convicted of an aggravated felony, rendering him removable and barring him from cancellation of removal relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) (defining a theft offense, including receipt of stolen property, as an aggravated felony). Romero-Mora\u2019s claim fails because he has not shown that additional time would have changed the outcome of his proceedings and thus that he was prejudiced by the IJ\u2019s refusal to continue his case. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring an alien to demonstrate prejudice to prevail on a due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Romero-Mora\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b733-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
