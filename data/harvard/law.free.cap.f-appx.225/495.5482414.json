August 30, 2002 Order of Removal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-26\">The time limit of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)\u2014 that a petition for review must be filed within 30 days after the final order of removal \u2014 is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003). The BIA affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s order of removal on August 30, 2002. Cetinkaya did not petition for review until March 19, 2004. Cetinkaya\u2019s subsequent motions to reopen before the BIA do not extend the deadline in \u00a7 1252(b). <em>See Membreno v. Gonzales, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>425 F.3d 1227, 1229 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Cetinkaya\u2019s untimely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s August 30, 2002 order is not excused by his purported reliance on a BIA website. He does not argue that the website was itself misleading; his opening brief recognizes that his interpretation of the BIA website was a \u201cmistake.\u201d <em>Gf Singh, </em>315 F.3d at 1188. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\n<em>II. February 18, 2001 Order Denying Motion to Reopen</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Although we do not have jurisdiction to review the order of removal, we may review the BIA\u2019s February 18, 2004 order denying Cetinkaya\u2019s motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Membreno, </em>425 F.3d at 1229. We will not disturb the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen unless the BIA acted \u201carbitrarily, irrationally, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Eide-Kahayon v. INS, </em>86 F.3d 147, 149 (9th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1), an alien must provide new and material evidence to warrant reopening his case. Cetinkaya\u2019s evidence of a new regime in Turkey is \u201ctoo general to demonstrate a well-founded fear that [the alien] would personally be persecuted.\u201d <em>Konstantinova v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 528, 530 (9th Cir.1999). His argument that he failed to serve in the Turkish army is similarly immaterial. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1187 (9th Cir. 2006) (recognizing that \u201cforced conscription or punishment for evasion of military duty generally does not constitute persecution\u201d). We therefore conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in declining to reopen the August 30, 2002 order in its February 18, 2004 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b523-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-19\">. On appeal, Cetinkaya also argues that the BIA erred in denying his March 18, 2004 motion in which he raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim for the first time. We may not consider this argument because it was not included in his petition for review. <em>See Zayas-Marini v. INS, </em>785 F.2d 801, 805 (9th Cir. 1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
