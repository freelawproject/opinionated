We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u201cThis Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), construing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Under the \u201cfavorable termination rule\u201d of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), if a determination favorable to the plaintiff in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence,\u201d a plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal or declared invalid in order to recover damages for an allegedly unlawful conviction under \u00a7 1983. In <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997), the Supreme Court \u201cmade clear that <em>Heck\u2019s </em>favorable termination rule applies to challenges made under \u00a7 1983 to procedures used in disciplinary proceedings that deprived a prisoner of good-time credits.\u201d <em>Peralta v. Vasquez, </em>467 F.3d 98, 103 (2d Cir.2006) (citing and discussing <em>Edwards, </em>520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584). <em>Heck\u2019s </em>rule, however, does not preclude a \u00a7 1983 claim aimed at sanctions that do not affect the overall length of confinement. <em>See Muhammad v. Close, </em>540 U.S. 749, 754, 124 S.Ct. 1303, 158 L.Ed.2d 32 (2004); <em>Jenkins v. Hau-bert, </em>179 F.3d 19, 21 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">In <em>Peralta, </em>decided after the district court\u2019s judgment in this case, this Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">a prisoner subject to such mixed sanctions can proceed separately, under \u00a7 1983, with a challenge to the sanctions affecting his conditions of confinement without satisfying the favorable termination rule, <em>but that he can only do so if he is willing to forgo once and for all any challenge to any sanctions that affect the duration of his confinement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-10\"><em>Peralta, </em>467 F.3d at 104 (emphasis in original). The Court therefore remanded the case to the district court to ascertain whether Peralta had \u201cformally agreed, or [was] then willing, to waive all his potential claims with respect to the sanctions affecting the duration of his imprisonment arising out of the proceeding he [was] currently challenging,\u201d and, if such a waiver resulted, to allow him \u201cto proceed separately'with his challenge under \u00a7 1983 to the sanctions affecting the conditions of his confinement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">In this case, McEaehin raises \u201cmixed sanctions\u201d claims, and, therefore, the portion of the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing McEachin\u2019s claims under <em>Heck </em>and <em>Edwards </em>is vacated and remanded. On remand, pursuant to <em>Peralta, </em>the district court must provide McEaehin with the waiver option, and ascertain whether McEaehin is willing to waive all claims relating to,sanctions affecting the duration of his imprisonment in order to proceed with claims challenging the sanctions affecting the conditions of his confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">Since McEaehin has not challenged any of the other findings in the district court\u2019s judgment, those portions are affirmed. <em>See United States v. Joyner, </em>313 F.3d 40, 44 (2d Cir.2002) (\u201cIt is well established that an argument not raised on appeal is deemed abandoned and lost, and that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>court of appeals will not consider the argument unless it has reason to believe that manifest injustice would result otherwise.\u201d (internal citations and quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court in part, VACATE in part, and REMAND the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
