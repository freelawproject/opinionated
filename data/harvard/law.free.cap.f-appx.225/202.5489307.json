He was sentenced to forty-one months of imprisonment within his calculated advisory sentencing range under the federal Sentencing Guidelines. On appeal, Ladson argues: (1) that the district court erroneously allowed testimony from his co-Defendants regarding statements made by an unindicted co-conspirator <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and (2) that his sentence is unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-20\">First, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to admit the statements at issue into evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). <em>United States v. Blevins, </em>960 F.2d 1252, 1255-56 (4th Cir.1992) (stating standard). Second, we find that the district court\u2019s sentence, imposed within the advisory sentencing range and after considering the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006), was reasonable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006) (stating that a sentence within proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable); <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.) (noting a court must calculate the advisory Guidelines range and then consider whether that range serves the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309,164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-23\">Accordingly, we affirm Ladson\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b230-17\"> Upon the record before us it is not entirely clear as to whether the statements at issue were made by the same or two different co-conspirators.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
