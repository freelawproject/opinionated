R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b490-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">Defendant-Appellant Arturo Carlos Figueroa-Ocampo appeals his sentence for being a deported alien found in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We vacate Figueroa-Ocampo\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">The district court sentenced Figueroa-Ocampo to thirty-seven months imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release. In imposing Figueroa-Ocampo\u2019s sentence, the district court applied an eight-point sentence enhancement based on Figueroa-Ocampo\u2019s prior conviction for possession of cocaine base in violation of California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11350(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">The district court determined that Figueroa-Ocampo\u2019s prior simple possession conviction, a felony under California law but a misdemeanor under the Controlled Substances Act, is a \u201cfelony punishable by the Controlled Substances Act.\u201d Accordingly, the district court determined that Figueroa-Ocampo\u2019s prior conviction is an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) meriting an eight-point sentence enhancement. On appeal, Figueroa-Ocampo challenges the district court\u2019s classification of his prior conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-16\">\u201c[A] state offense constitutes a \u2018felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\u2019 only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law.\u201d <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 625, 633, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). Thus, under <em>Lopez, </em>the district court erred in categorizing FigueroaOcampo\u2019s simple possession conviction as a \u201cfelony punishable by the Controlled Substances Act,\u201d and an aggravated felony for sentence enhancement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Moreover, the district court erroneously determined that Figueroa-Ocampo faced a twenty-year statutory maximum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) instead of a ten-year maximum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1)-(2). His three-year term of supervised release was also calculated based on the wrong statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u201c[W]here a defendant has received a sentence that includes a period of supervised release, a challenge to the length of his sentence of imprisonment is not moot because the district court has discretion regarding the length of supervised release, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(a)-(b), and can change the supervised release period, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3583(e)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>434 F.3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir.2006) (noting that \u201cthe district court could resentence [the defendant] to a shorter term of supervised release in light of a shorter appropriate term of imprisonment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide different terms of supervised release for crimes under \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Compare U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(a)(l) (\u201c[a]t least three years but not more than five years\u201d of supervised release), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(a)(2) (\u201c[a]t least two years but not more than three years\u201d of supervised release). Accordingly, it is possible that the district court would have imposed a shorter term of supervised release if it had sentenced Figueroa-Ocampo under \u00a7 1326(b)(1) instead of \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>See Gunderson v. Hood, </em>268 F.3d 1149, 1153 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that the possibility of relief is sufficient to prevent mootness).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">We therefore VACATE FigueroaOcampo\u2019s sentence, and REMAND to the district court for resentencing FigueroaOcampo in light of this decision and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b490-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate- for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
