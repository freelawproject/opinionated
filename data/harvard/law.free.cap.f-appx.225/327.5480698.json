Young, </em>981 F.2d 180, 187 (5th Cir.1992), which held that hearsay is admissible for sentencing purposes, including corroborated out-of-court statements by unidentified confidential informants, and thus that its admission does not violate due process or the right to confrontation. Araugo-Gutierrez also raises arguments that are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>546 U.S. 828, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005), which held that, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the sentencing court may still find all facts relevant to sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
