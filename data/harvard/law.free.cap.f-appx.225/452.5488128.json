Scribner, </em>121 Fed.Appx. 225 (9th Cir. 2005). A copy of that disposition is attached hereto and incorporated herein. On February 23, 2005, however, we recalled the mandate, and on August 26, 2005, we granted Jefferson\u2019s motion to expand the certificate of appealability and requested supplemental briefing on the following question: \u201cWhether the introduction of the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements as evidence against Petitioner violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation?\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">In his supplemental brief, Jefferson argues that the admission of out-of-court testimonial statements violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause, as interpreted by <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and that, based on our holding in <em>Bockting v. Bayer, </em>399 F.3d 1010, as <em>amended, </em>408 F.3d 1127 (9th Cir.2005), the new rule adopted in <em>Crawford </em>applies retroactively to Jefferson\u2019s collateral proceeding. He also argues that the victims\u2019 statements were not admissible based on <em>pre-Crawford </em>Confrontation Clause principles because the statements lacked reliability. Subsequent to our receipt of the supplemental briefing, the Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari in <em>Bockting, </em>and we deferred submission of the ease pending the Supreme Court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">On February 28, 2007, the Supreme Court reversed our decision in <em>Bockting, </em>and held that <em>Crawford </em>is not \u201cretroactive to cases already final on direct review.\u201d <em>Whorton v. Bockting, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 1177, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007). Because direct review of Jefferson\u2019s conviction became final prior to <em>Crawford, </em>we cannot retroactively apply <em>Crawford </em>to Jefferson\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">Applying the rules set forth by the Court prior to <em>Crawford, </em>we hold that the state court\u2019s conclusion that Newell\u2019s statements \u2014 uttered after he was shot by Jefferson and while he was still badly bleeding \u2014 qualified as spontaneous statements that are reliable and satisfy the Confrontation Clause, was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see also White v. Illinois, </em>502 U.S. 346, 355-56 n. 8, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992) (stating that the spontaneous statement hearsay exception is \u201cfirmly rooted,\u201d and, therefore, testimony admitted under this exemption satisfies the Confrontation Clause\u2019s reliability requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of the petition is</p>\n<p id=\"b481-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\">. On November 17, 2005, Judge Gould was drawn as a replacement on the panel for Hon. Charles R.
