We conclude, however, that this issue is not properly before us because it was not raised either before the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) or with the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) on appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Rivas-Gomez </em>raised this issue for the first time in a motion to reconsider filed with the BIA, a motion that was denied on the correct ground that it was \u201cinappropriate to make such an argument for the first time in a motion to reconsider.\u201d Petitioner did not challenge this ruling in a petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">\u201cAs a general rule, issues not raised before an administrative tribunal cannot be raised on appeal from that tribunal.\u201d <em>Bagues-Valles v. INS, </em>779 F.2d 483, 484 (9th Cir.1985); see INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (providing that a \u201ccourt may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right....\u201d); <em>Ochave v. INS, </em>254 F.3d 859, 867 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cFailure to raise an issue on appeal to the BIA constitutes a failure to exhaust remedies with respect to the question and deprives this court of jurisdiction to hear the matter.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). None of the exceptions \u2014 including the futility exception \u2014 applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-17\">Consequently, we are without jurisdiction to consider <em>Rivas-Gomez\u2019s </em>summary allegations, and that part of his petition is ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-18\">However, because the IJ erroneously applied a heightened standard when deciding whether to grant a waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1159(c), we grant the petition in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Carlos Rene Rivas-Gomez <em>(\u201cRivas\u201d), </em>a native and citizen of Guatemala, entered the United States in 1997 as an asylee. In 2001, Rivas pleaded guilty to felony rape in the third degree pursuant to ORS \u00a7 163.355. He was placed on three years\u2019 formal probation under Oregon\u2019s \u201cSex Offender Provisions.\u201d These provisions made Rivas eligible under Oregon law for registration and supervision as a \u201cpredatory sex offender.\u201d ORS \u00a7 181.585-181.592. The charge arose out of a sexual relationship between Rivas, who was nineteen years old at the time, and a fourteen-year-old girl. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> initiated removal proceedings against Rivas pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), which renders deportable \u201cany alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The IJ terminated Rivas\u2019s asylee status and ordered Rivas removed to Guatemala, finding that Rivas\u2019s conviction for rape in the third degree constituted an aggravated felony, and denying Rivas\u2019s application for a waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1159(c). The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, rendering the IJ\u2019s decision the final agency determination. <em>Thomas v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 1177, 1182 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In supplemental briefing in our court, Rivas argues that the IJ erred when he applied a heightened standard to Rivas\u2019s waiver application. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Despite his aggravated felony conviction, Rivas remained eligible to apply for adjustment of status. However, because his conviction was for a \u201ccrime involving moral turpitude,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), Rivas was not admissible unless he obtained a waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1159(c), which provides that the Attorney General \u201cmay waive\u201d application of \u00a7 1182 \u201cfor humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest.\u201d Rivas asserts that the IJ erred when he applied the heightened, \u201cextreme hardship\u201d standard when he denied Rivas\u2019s waiver application, raising two legal arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">First, he asserts that in <em>Matter of Jean, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 373, 2002 WL 968631 (A.G.2002), the Attorney General exceeded his statutory authority by imposing a heightened waiver standard for aliens convicted of violent or dangerous crimes. Second, he argues that the IJ erred in applying the heightened standard in his case without first determining that Rivas\u2019s aggravated felony conviction was for a violent or dangerous crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\"><em>Jean </em>concerned a \u00a7 1182 waiver for a female alien who had been convicted of second-degree manslaughter in connection with the death of a nineteen-month-old child that had been left in her care. Reversing the BIA\u2019s grant of the waiver, the Attorney General determined that \u201cevaluations of requests for waivers of inadmissibility ... cannot ... focus solely on family hardships, but must consider the nature of the criminal offense that rendered an alien inadmissible in the first place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383. The Attorney General stated that \u201cviolent or dangerous individuals\u201d would not be granted a waiver \u201cexcept in extraordinary circumstances, such as those involving national security or foreign policy considerations, or cases in which an alien clearly demonstrates that the denial of status adjustment would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Rivas\u2019s first argument that the Attorney General exceeded his statutory authority in <em>Jean </em>by adopting a heightened standard is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Ayala-Chavez v. INS, </em>944 F.2d 638, 641 (9th Cir.1991). <em>Ayala-Chavez </em>upheld the Attorney General\u2019s requirement that waiver applicants under former \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c), with serious drug offense convictions demonstrate \u201coutstanding equities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under <em>Ayala-Chavez </em>the Attorney General has broad discretion to grant or deny waivers and may establish general standards governing the exercise of such discretion \u201cas long as these standards are rationally related to the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the Attorney General\u2019s heightened waiver standard for aliens convicted of violent or dangerous crimes is rationally related to the national immigration policy of not admitting aliens who would be a danger to society.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The second argument raised by Rivas, that the IJ erred when he applied the <em>Jean </em>\u201cextreme hardship requirement\u201d without first determining that Rivas\u2019s conviction was for a \u201cviolent or dangerous\u201d crime has merit. While the government argues that the IJ merely balanced the equities when he denied the waiver, the IJ assumed from the beginning of the proceeding that Rivas\u2019s conviction triggered the <em>Jean </em>analysis, and concluded by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">So the Court wishes to make its analysis plain. I believe that [the <em>Jean </em>] standard applies to him and the primary basis for my decision, which I cannot grant it, is because I do not believe that he had met that burden. I am not denying [the waiver] because of his either lack of accounting for the crime and the other things the Court is commenting on those. But the Court is denying it because it does not meet the hardship standard indicated by the Attorney General.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">In <em>Jean, </em>the Attorney General did not impose the heightened \u201cextreme hardship\u201d standard on all aliens with aggravated felony convictions, only on those who \u201cengage in violent criminal acts.\u201d Jean, 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 384. The determination in <em>Jean </em>was fact-based, not categorical. Moreover, in a subsequent decision the BIA specifically limited Jean\u2019s heightened waiver requirement to \u201cdangerous or violent crimes.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>In re K-A-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 661, 666, 2004 WL 1941261 (BIA 2004). Therefore, the IJ erred when he applied the \u201cextreme hardship\u201d standard without first making a determination based on the facts underlying Rivas\u2019s conviction that Rivas\u2019s crime was violent or dangerous. Thus, we grant the petition in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND GRANTED IN PART.
