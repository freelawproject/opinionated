Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>No. AT-0752-06-0585-I-1, 104 M.S.P.R. 266 (M.S.P.B. Nov. 17, 2006). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Neither statute cited by Stewart gives the board jurisdiction over voluntary downgradings. An employee\u2019s acceptance of a lower-graded position is generally presumed voluntary absent duress, coercion, or a showing that a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency\u2019s actions. Stewart has made no such showing here; the record lacks any evidence of duress, coercion, or misleading actions by the agency.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
