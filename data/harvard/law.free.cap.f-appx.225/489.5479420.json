Li claims he suffered persecution for violating China\u2019s coercive population control policies by having a child with his common-law wife, whom Li was unable to legally marry because she was only eighteen years old. Because the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence, we grant the petition and remand to the BIA for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-15\">The BIA summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision without opinion. \u201cWhen the BIA streamlines, we review the substance of the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 975 (9th Cir.2006). We review adverse credibility findings for substantial evidence. <em>Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002). \u201cThe IJ must have a legitimate articulable basis to question the petitioner\u2019s credibility, and must offer a specific, cogent reason for any stated disbelief. Any such reason must be substantial and bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-16\">The IJ based her adverse credibility determination on several grounds, all of which we find to be impermissible or unsupported by the record. First, the IJ found that Li\u2019s asylum application was \u201cvery simple\u201d and noted that, \u201c[cjertainly a statement this simple is very easy to memorize, remember and regurgitate when asked questions.\u201d Li\u2019s statement described all of the relevant details of his persecution and was entirely consistent with his testimony. The brevity of Li\u2019s statement is not an acceptable basis for an adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>The IJ found it \u201csuspicious\u201d that Li brought his wife and child home from the hospital instead of immediately going back into hiding after his son was born. \u201cSpeculation and conjecture cannot form the basis of an adverse credibility finding, which must instead be based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1071 (9th Cir.2000). Once Li\u2019s wife gave birth, there was no longer a threat that she would be forced to have an abortion, and the hospital had already alerted the authorities of the illegal child. The IJ\u2019s speculation about what Li should have done under the circumstances is an impermissible ground for an adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The IJ further asserted that there were several inconsistencies in Li\u2019s testimony. First, she found that Li was inconsistent because he did not explain that his wife was also being threatened by the fine until the end of his redirect examination. However, Li never once stated that he was the <em>only </em>one being threatened with the fine. The IJ also accused Li of \u201chiding something\u201d when he gave more than one reason as to why he dropped out of technical school. We find nothing inconsistent about Li\u2019s response that he dropped out of school because he no longer wanted to attend and because his family could no longer afford the tuition.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The IJ also found it \u201cinconceivable that even in China the police would ask for such a large amount of money\u201d for having a child in violation of China\u2019s population control policies. The IJ\u2019s finding is contrary to the 2001 State Department Country Report for China contained in the record, but not cited by the IJ. The country report specifically states that the fines imposed by the Chinese government on its citizens who violate population control policies \u201ccan be extremely high, equaling several years\u2019 wages for an average worker.\u201d Thus, the country report compels the finding that Li\u2019s testimony is truthful and consistent with the birth control policy officials\u2019s enforcement mechanisms.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The IJ also impermissibly based her adverse credibility determination on the statements Li made to immigration officials immediately after being discovered inside the cargo container of a ship when it arrived in the United States. During this brief interrogation, Li told officials that he came to the United States because he needed a job and he feared returning to China because he had \u201cno money to pay the fine.\u201d \u201cWe hesitate to view statements given during airport interviews as valuable impeachment sources because of the conditions under which they are taken and because a newly-arriving alien cannot be expected to divulge every detail of the persecution he or she sustained.\u201d <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962-63 (9th Cir.2004). \u201cRequiring evidentiary detail from an airport interview not only ignores the reality of the interview process, but would, in effect, create an unprecedented preasylum application process.\u201d <em>Singh v. INS, </em>292 F.3d 1017, 1021 (9th Cir.2002). Here, Li\u2019s answers were handwritten onto the form by an immigration official, both the interpreter\u2019s name and his agency\u2019s identification number were left blank, and there is no additional information in the record about how the interview was conducted. The same concerns and hesitations we have over the reliability of airport interviews apply here, to a brief dockside interrogation conducted immediately after Li\u2019s fifteen-day journey inside a shipping container. We therefore find that the statements made during the dockside interview cannot, on their own, serve as a basis for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Moreover, the IJ\u2019s claim that Li was \u201cunresponsive\u201d throughout the hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>ing is unsupported by the record. The instances she points to in support of her finding are merely temporary misunderstandings as to the nature of the questions being asked. When the questions were rephrased or clarified, Li\u2019s answers contained useful information and were not inconsistent with the rest of his testimony. \u201cThey cannot, therefore, be fairly characterized as evasive or unresponsive on the basis of the transcript.\u201d <em>Jibril v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1129, 1137 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The evidentiary record, juxtaposed with the IJ\u2019s repeated speculation, compels us to find Li credible. Thus, we remand to the BIA to consider whether, taking his testimony as true, Li is eligible for relief. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">PETITION GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b518-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Cir.
