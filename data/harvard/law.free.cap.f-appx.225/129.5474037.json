We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error, as Brown failed to adequately allege that his injuries were the result of an intentional exercise of force by police officers in violation of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Vathekan v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>154 F.3d 173, 178 (4th Cir.1998). Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling and deny Brown\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b158-17\"> Brown has failed to clearly address the district court\u2019s dismissal of any of his other claims; therefore, review of those claims on appeal has been waived. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir. 1999); 4th Cir. R. 34(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
