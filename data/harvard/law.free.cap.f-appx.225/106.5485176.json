Kerkero, a native and citizen of Ethiopia, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals affirming without opinion the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-17\">To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Kerkero fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to establish eligibility for asylum, Kerkero cannot meet the higher standard to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardozar-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Finally, our review discloses that Kerkero did not show eligibility for CAT relief because she did not demonstrate that it is more likely than not that she will be tortured if removed to Ethiopia. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-19\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
