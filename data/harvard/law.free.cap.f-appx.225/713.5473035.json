We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Fowles contends that the district court improperly considered a 1999 conviction for violating California Penal Code \u00a7 69 as a crime of violence in determining that he was eligible for sentencing as a career offender pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1. Fowles concedes that he meets all of the requirements for the increased sentencing under the career offender provision, except for the requirement that he have \u201cat least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-15\">California Penal Code \u00a7 69 creates criminal liability for \u201c[ejvery person who attempts, by means of any threat or violence, to deter or prevent an executive officer from performing any duty imposed upon such officer by law, or who knowingly resists, by the use of force or violence, such officer, in the performance of his duty.\u201d The Sentencing Guideline defines crime of violence in relevant part as \u201cany offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-16\">The government concedes that a conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 69 does not categorically qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Therefore, the Court follows the modified categorical approach and looks to \u201cthe terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information\u201d to determine whether the guilty plea necessarily establishes the elements of the enhancement statute. <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-17\">In <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004), the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>preme Court held that the <em>term \u201cuse\u201d </em>in the definition of crime of violence \u201crequires active employment\u201d and \u201csuggests a category of violent, active crimes.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 11, 125 S.Ct. 377. Therefore, the Court held that the definition of crime of violence does not encompass \u201caccidental or negligent conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 125 S.Ct. 377. Further, in <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>466 F.3d 1121 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc), this Court held that \u201cto constitute a federal crime of violence an offense must involve the intentional use of force against the person ... of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1132.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Here, the factual basis for Fowles\u2019 guilty plea to the California Penal Code \u00a7 69 offense enunciated by the prosecutor and confirmed by Fowles\u2019 attorney establishes only that Fowles \u201cthreatened to jump off [a] railing and had to be physically restrained,\u201d that he \u201cforcibly resisted the officers in pulling him off the area he was trying to jump from\u201d and \u201c[i]n that process [an] officer was injured.\u201d Neither the fact that Fowles forcibly resisted the officers or the fact that an officer was injured \u201cunequivocally\u201d establishes that Fowles actively and intentionally directed physical force against the officers. <em>See United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d 1201, 1211 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), <em>superceded on other grounds </em>by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 4 (2002). Therefore, the \u00a7 69 offense cannot be considered a conviction of a crime of violence that would make Fowles eligible for sentencing under the career offender provision. We remand for a new sentencing hearing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b742-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-6\">. In <em>Leocal, </em>the Court was analyzing the definition of crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, not under the Sentencing Guidelines career offender provision. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 defines a crime of violence, in relevant part, as \"an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,\u201d while the definition under the career offender provision limits crimes of violence to felony offenses that involve force against the person of another. However, these differences are not relevant to the present analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b743-15\">. Because we hold that the district court erred in sentencing Fowles as a career offender, we need not reach Fowles\u2019 argument that the district court erred in calculating his base offense level under the career offender provision by using a statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment rather than twenty years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b743-10\">TALLMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ARCy\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">I respectfully dissent. Under the modified categorical approach, a common sense reading of the relevant judicially noticeable documents of Fowles\u2019s conviction \u2014 the charging document and the transcript of the plea proceeding \u2014 establish the requisite degree of intent to support sentencing Fowles under the career offender provision. Fowles pled guilty to a criminal complaint charging that he:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0t\">willfully and unlawfully attempt[ed] by means of threat or violence to deter or prevent Lt. Cheney, CO Bell, CO Patton, CO Brown, when they were then and there executive officers from performing a duty imposed on these officers by law or [ ] knowingly resisted] by <em>use of force or violence </em>the executive offi-eer[s] in the performance of their duty in violation of Penal Code section 69, a felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">(emphasis added). Fowles conceded he \u201cforcibly resisted the officers in pulling him off the area he was trying to jump from.\u201d In doing so, he injured an officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-13\">The relevant documents thus show that Fowles actively and intentionally used physical force against the correctional officers while resisting their efforts to restore order to the disturbance he had begun in the cellblock. Nothing in the documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>suggests anything but intentional misbehavior. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l). Unlike the majority, I refuse to parse \u201cwillfully,\u201d \u201cknowingly,\u201d and \u201cforcibly\u201d out of Fowles\u2019s guilty plea. The district court correctly found that Fowles\u2019s violation of Penal Code section 69 is a crime of violence under the modified categorical approach enunciated in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), and would support enhanced sentencing as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
