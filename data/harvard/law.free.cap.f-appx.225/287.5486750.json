Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100 (5th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded the case for reconsideration in the light of <em>Lopez v. </em>Gonzales,\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). <em>Riascos-Cuenu v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 827, 166 L.Ed.2d 661 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-26\">In the light of <em>Lopez, </em>the district court erred by enhancing Riascos\u2019s sentence based on a Texas conviction for possession of cocaine. Because R\u00edaseos has completed service of his term of imprisonment and was released by the Bureau of Prisons on January 12, 2007, any argument that the sentence of imprisonment should be reduced is moot and the only portion of the sentence remaining for consideration is Ri-ascos\u2019s term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-27\">However, as both parties noted in supplemental letter briefs filed with this court, R\u00edaseos presumably has been deported. In order to resentence him and reduce his term of supervised release, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43 requires the defendant to be present and have the opportunity to allocute. Because R\u00edaseos has been deported and is legally unable, without permission of the Attorney General, to reenter the United States to be present for a resentencing proceeding, there is no relief we are able to grant Riascos and his appeal is moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381 (5th Cir. 2007). The appeal is therefore DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b315-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
