He argues for suppression on three grounds: (1) that the search warrants were issued without probable cause; (2) that the state court failed to make an explicit probable cause determination; and (3) that the warrants did not adequately specify the items to be seized. We reject these arguments and affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-15\">1. A \u201cpractical, common-sense\u201d reading of the affidavit presented to the issuing court indicates that the court \u201chad a \u2018substantial basis for ... concluding]\u2019 that probable cause existed.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238-39, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (alterations in original). The affidavit reports that a confidential informant made a controlled purchase of methamphetamine from Kemfort and that the same informant subsequently observed a large quantity of methamphetamine in Kemfort\u2019s residence. Although the authorities did not actually witness the informant\u2019s drug purchase, the affiant, Officer Perkett, took reasonable steps to monitor the purchase and ensure that the informant\u2019s account of events was accurate. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Artez, </em>389 F.3d 1106, 1111-12 (10th Cir.2004) (noting that \u201cthe absence of constant visual contact with the informant conducting the transaction does not render a controlled purchase insufficient\u201d). It is also significant that the informant had previously made more than 20 controlled purchases, \u201cresulting in the obtainment of over (15) search warrants resulting in the recovery of Crystal Methamphetamine, Marijuana, and other drugs.\u201d According to the affidavit, the informant \u201cnever provided information which was found to be false or unreliable.\u201d That track record provides strong evidence of the informant\u2019s reliability. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Elliott, </em>322 F.3d 710, 716 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that the informant\u2019s \u201crecord of providing six reliable drug-related tips in the preceding three months was sufficient to overcome any doubts raised by his motives and prior criminal and personal behavior\u201d); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number><em>States v. Reeves, </em>210 F .3d 1041, 1046 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that an informant who had previously provided information \u201cthat led to three other search warrants, narcotics arrests and convictions\u201d was sufficiently rehable); <em>United States v. Angulo-Lo-pez, </em>791 F.2d 1394, 1397 (9th Cir.1986) (\u201cIf an informant has provided accurate information on past occasions, he may be presumed trustworthy on subsequent oeca-sions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">2. It was unnecessary for the warrants to state expressly that the issuing court made a probable cause determination. The issuing court\u2019s decision to issue the warrants indicates that the court did, in fact, find probable cause. The warrants refer to Hawaii Rule of Penal Procedure 41, which states that a judge may issue a warrant only \u201c[i]f the judge is satisfied that the grounds for the application exist or that there is probable cause to believe that they exist.\u201d Haw. R. Penal P. 41(c). The fact that the warrants noted that Officer Perkett \u201chas reason to believe that there is sufficient probable cause\u201d does not mean that the warrants were issued based solely on the bare assertion of Officer Perkett\u2019s beliefs. To the contrary, Officer Perkett presented the court with a detailed affidavit, and the warrants stated that \u201c[pjroof by Affidavit ha[d] been made.\u201d <em>Cf. Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 239, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (\u201cSufficient information must be presented to the magistrate to allow that official to determine probable cause; his action cannot be a mere ratification of the bare conclusions of others.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">3. The warrants in this case satisfied the Fourth Amendment\u2019s particularity requirement, despite the use of catchall phrases to describe the \u201carticles of identification\u201d and methamphetamine \u201cparaphernalia\u201d to be seized. The language used in the warrants did not permit \u201ca general, exploratory rummaging in a person\u2019s belongings.\u201d <em>United States v. Sears, </em>411 F.3d 1124, 1127 (9th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have previously upheld warrants authorizing the seizure of \u201cany dangerous drugs and drug paraphernalia,\u201d despite the failure to offer any guidance as to what constitutes paraphernalia. <em>United States v. Mann, </em>389 F.3d 869, 872 (9th Cir.2004); see <em>also United States v. Reeves, </em>210 F.3d 1041, 1043 (9th Cir.2000) (approving a warrant that authorized seizure of \u201cevidence of possession, manufacture, and delivery of the controlled substance methamphetamine,\u201d which \u201cmay include, but is not limited to\u201d certain enumerated items). Similarly, we have upheld warrants authorizing the seizure of \u201carticles of identification,\u201d including fingerprints, in fairly broad terms. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Alexander, </em>761 F.2d 1294, 1301 (9th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Whitten, </em>706 F.2d 1000, 1008-09 (9th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Honore, </em>450 F.2d 31, 32-33 (9th Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">We do not consider Kemfort\u2019s additional argument that the warrants faded to describe the \u201cUnited States Currency\u201d to be seized with sufficient particularity. Kem-fort did not raise this issue before the district court in his motion to suppress. Accordingly, it was not preserved for appeal in his conditional plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Bynum, </em>362 F.3d 574, 583 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b612-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
