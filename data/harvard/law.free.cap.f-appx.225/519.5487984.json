We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in construing the motion as a motion to reconsider where Urbina-Rodriguez alleged that the BIA overlooked her briefs in dismissing her appeal but did not introduce any new evidence or argue a change in factual circumstances. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 895-96 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that a motion to reconsider is a request that the BIA \u201creexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of a case which was overlooked, while [a] motion to reopen is usually based upon new evidence or a change in factual circumstances.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted); <em>compare </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1) <em>with </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion as untimely because it was filed more than 30 days after the BIA\u2019s March 14, 2005 order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
