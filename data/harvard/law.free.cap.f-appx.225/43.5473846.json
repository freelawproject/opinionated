Pauley, Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b72-5\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Defendants-Appellants William Saenz Duque (\u201cDuque\u201d) and Hector Ruiz (\u201cRuiz\u201d) appeal from a final order of the District Court declining to resentence them after a remand from this Court pursuant to <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir. 2005). <em>See United States v. Duque, </em>123 Fed.Appx. 447 (2d Cir.2005). Duque was convicted after a jury trial of conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and conspiracy to import heroin into the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963. Ruiz was convicted during the same trial of conspiracy to distribute and possess heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Duque and Ruiz were sentenced to terms of imprisonment of 168 months and 121 months, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">We conclude on the basis of on Judge Berman\u2019s explicit, even if not lengthy, reference to the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), that the District Court\u2019s decision not to resentence defendants was procedurally reasonable. <em>See United States v. Fleming, </em>397 F.3d 95 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201c[N]o specific verbal formulations should be prescribed to demonstrate the adequate discharge of the duty to \u2018consider\u2019 matters relevant to sentencing\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>475 F.3d 468, 474 (2d Cir.2007) (holding that \u201cwe review a sentence for reasonableness even after a District Court declines to resentence pursuant to <em>Crosby.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">We also find no merit in defendants\u2019 arguments that their sentences were substantively unreasonable. Duque\u2019s sentence was reasonable because of his considerable criminal history and because, as we explained in deciding defendants\u2019 first appeal, <em>see Duque, </em>123 Fed.Appx. 447, 449 (2d Cir.2005), the District Court properly applied a two-point enhancement for Du-que\u2019s perjurious testimony at trial. Furthermore, we reject Ruiz\u2019s argument that the District Court erred in finding him ineligible for \u201csafety valve\u201d relief from a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because district courts must make their \u201cthreshold determination\u201d of whether to resentence a defendant \u201cbased on the circumstances at the <em>time of the original sentence,\u201d Crosby, </em>397 F.3d at 120 (emphasis added), the District Court properly denied such relief to defendant based on his earlier failure to satisfy the requirements for \u201csafety valve\u201d eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">We have considered all of defendants\u2019 arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-13\">. The requirements for eligibility for \u201csafety valve\u201d relief are set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
