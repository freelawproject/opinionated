We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-14\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s opinion, this court reviews the IJ\u2019s opinion as the final agency decision. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). This court will affirm the IJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable evidence on the record considered as a whole, and may reverse only if the applicant shows that the evidence <em>compels </em>the conclusion that the decision was incorrect. <em>INS v. Elias-Za-carias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-15\">The record as a whole indicates that Gamez-Ventura\u2019s attackers were motivated entirely by pecuniary interests and we therefore conclude that the evidence does not compel the conclusion that Gamez-Ventura was persecuted on account of a protected ground. <em>See id. </em>at 481-84, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>see also Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1489-91 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-16\">Because Gamez-Ventura failed to satisfy the lower standard of proof for asylum, he necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Mansour v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 667, 673 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b658-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
