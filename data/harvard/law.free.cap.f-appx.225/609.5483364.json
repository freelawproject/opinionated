We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-22\">The district court properly dismissed Gallardo\u2019s access to courts claim alleging defendants failed to provide him with copies of the prison\u2019s incoming mail logs to support his state habeas corpus petition. However, that proceeding, which was dismissed for failure to state a claim, did not challenge Gallardo\u2019s conviction, sentence, or conditions of confinement, but rather, was an attempt to obtain a case file from his state court trial counsel which Gallardo labeled \u201cClient-Lawyer work product.\u201d <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 355, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (the impairment of prisoners\u2019 capacities to litigate, other than to attack their sentences or challenge the conditions of their confinement, are \u201csimply one of the incidental (and perfectly constitutional) consequences of conviction and incarceration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-23\">Gallardo\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b637-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
