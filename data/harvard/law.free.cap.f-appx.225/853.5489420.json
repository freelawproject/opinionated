In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Jean argued that his attorney was ineffective because, <em>inter alia, </em>counsel failed to advise him of his right to testify, or to call him to testify on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-24\">At the hearing on whether counsel was ineffective, trial counsel, David Joffe, testified that he: (1) had 16 years experience; (2) met with Jean at least 8 times before the start of the trial; (3) advised Jean that a negotiated plea would be in his best interest; (4) would have advised Jean, while discussing the possibility of entering a plea, of all of his constitutional rights, including the right to testify; (5) thought that Jean would make a good witness; (6) gave Jean a pad of paper during trial to take notes or ask questions; and (7) had never, and could not, prevent a client from testifying. Joffe stated that Jean advised him that he did not want to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-25\">Rodrigue Jean contradicted his attorney\u2019s version, testifying that: Joffe never explained to him that he had the choice to testify at trial, and Joffe never told him that he would make a good witness or judged his credibility. Jean asserted that he did not know that he was the one who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>ultimately decided whether he would testify, as Joffe had made all of the decisions in the trial, and Joffe disregarded his request to testify. He conceded that it had been his decision to go to trial, rather than take a plea. The magistrate judge issued a report, which credited trial counsel\u2019s assertion that he informed Jean of his right to testify and that it was Jean\u2019s decision to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">\u201cCredibility determinations are typically the province of the fact finder because the fact finder personally observes the testimony and is thus in a better position than a reviewing court to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002). In a case where the witnesses\u2019 versions of events are in direct conflict with one another, we will affirm the fact finder unless \u201cthe judge credits exceedingly improbable testimony,\u201d or the \u201cfacts are unbelievable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, we find no reversible error in the fact finder\u2019s determination of credibility in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
