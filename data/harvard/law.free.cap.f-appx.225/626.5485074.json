He appeals his sentence of fifteen years\u2019 incarceration following his guilty plea on four counts of drug trafficking under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 846, 952(a), 960 <em>&amp; </em>963.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that the district court did not consider all of the factors required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), that the court erred in failing to treat him as a minor participant in the crime, and that his overall sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-15\">We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-16\">Gastelum-Velasquez\u2019s main contention is that the district court did not consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Although the district court did not explicitly cite or quote \u00a7 3553(a), the record indicates that it considered all of the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In <em>United States v. Knows His Gun, </em>438 F.3d 913, 919 (9th Cir.2006), we held that articulation of some \u00a7 3553(a) factors was sufficient, so long as the record indicates that all of the relevant factors were considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-17\">Moreover, even if the district court\u2019s failure to explicitly discuss \u00a7 3553(a) was <em>error, </em>because GastelumVelasquez did not object to the district court\u2019s explanation of the sentence, this issue is reviewed for plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 918. \u201cPlain error is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court listened patiently to the arguments with respect to job training and drug rehabilitation raised by Gastelum-Velasquez <em>prior to </em>sentencing him. If there was any error at all it was nothing more than an oversight in failing to explicitly mention \u00a7 3553(a) factors. This did not affect substantial rights nor affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings, and so it was not plain error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-18\">Gastelum-Velasquez also argues that he was entitled to a minor participant reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. He ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>gues that the district court\u2019s findings about his role in the crime were not supported by evidence. \u201cWhether a defendant is a minor or minimal participant is a factual determination subject to the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Lui, </em>941 F.2d 844, 848 (9th Cir.1991). Here, at least two of the reasons mentioned for rejecting the \u00a7 3B1.2 reduction \u2014 there was a large amount of drugs involved and Gastelum-Velasquez recruited another person to help \u2014 were supported by evidence and are sufficient in themselves to support denial of the minor participant reduction. <em>See id. </em>at 849 (upholding denial of reduction when defendant had twenty-five pounds of heroin).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Finally Gastelum-Velasquez argues that his 180-month sentence was unreasonable, primarily because \u201chis criminal history was due to a traumatic childhood.\u201d Given the amount of drugs involved, the fact that Gastelum-Velasquez recruited another person into the conspiracy, and the fact that he had several prior convictions, a fifteen-year sentence was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b655-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
