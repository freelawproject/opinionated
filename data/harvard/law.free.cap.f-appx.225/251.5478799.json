He argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his prior robbery conviction under Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 29.02(a)(1) (Vernon 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-24\">Robbery is expressly listed as a crime of violence in the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, commentjn. l(b)(iii)). We re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>cently held in <em>United States v. Santiesteban-Hernandez, </em>469 F.3d 376, 378-82 (5th Cir.2006), that the Texas offense of robbery under \u00a7 29.02 qualifies as the enumerated offense of robbery for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2. Gonzalez\u2019s arguments are almost identical to the arguments made in <em>Santiesteban-Hemandez </em>and therefore provide no basis for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Gonzalez also argues in light of <em>Appren-di v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 96-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Gonzalez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Gonzalez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b279-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under tire limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
