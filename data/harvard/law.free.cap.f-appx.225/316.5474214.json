Rounds now appeals his sentence, arguing that, because he was merely a co-driver, the district court erred in finding that he did not qualify for a downward adjustment for being a minimal or minor participant in the offense. A defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a factual determination that this court reviews for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-21\">The advisory Sentencing Guidelines provide for a reduction in the base offense level of a \u201cminor\u201d or a \u201cminimal\u201d participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. A defendant who is \u201ca courier without being substantially less culpable than the average participant\u201d does not qualify for this adjustment. <em>United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n. 3(A)). In light of the testimony at his sentencing hearing, Rounds has not shown that the district court clearly erred in finding that he did not qualify for a downward adjustment based on his role in the offense. <em>See Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
