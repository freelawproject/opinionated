California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Anoman has filed a response. Although Anoman asserts that his counsel provided ineffective assistance, the record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration of this issue on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987). Our independent review of the brief, Anoman\u2019s response, and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Anoman\u2019s request for the appointment of a new attorney is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
