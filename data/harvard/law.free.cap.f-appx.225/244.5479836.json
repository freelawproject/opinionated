He asserts that the district court erred in failing to give him a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, in light of his timely admission of the elements of the offense and his apologies for his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-21\">We have reviewed the record and the briefs of the parties and conclude that the district court did not clearly err in denying the reduction. <em>See United States v. Ange-les-Mendoza, </em>407 F.3d 742, 753 (5th Cir. 2005). \u201cThe entry of a guilty plea does not entitle a defendant to a reduction as a matter of right.\u201d <em>United States v. Flucas, </em>99 F.3d 177, 180 (5th Cir.1996). Guzman\u2019s statements at sentencing did not show \u201csincere contrition on [his] behalf\u2019 for the wrongness of his conduct. <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>190 F.3d 656, 658 (5th Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Guzman has not shown clear error, we need not address the Government\u2019s contention that our review should be limited to the plain error standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
