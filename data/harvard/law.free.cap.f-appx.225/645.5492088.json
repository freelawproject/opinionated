We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Ruiz-Estrada challenges the district court\u2019s application of a two-level upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4 for the use or attempted use of a minor to commit the crime of alien smuggling. We cannot say that the district court clearly erred in finding the enhancement. The district court found that Ruiz-Estrada, who falsely claimed U.S. citizenship at the primary inspection, was attempting to use his U.S. citizen children to avoid detection. The court noted that Ruiz-Estrada had twice previously been arrested for alien smuggling with some of his children in the car. <em>See United States v. Castro-Hernandez, </em>258 F.3d 1057, 1059-60 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Ruiz-Estrada also contends that he is entitled to resentencing because the district court gave the sentencing guidelines presumptive weight in violation of <em>United States v. Zavala, </em>443 F.3d 1165, 1170-71 (9th Cir.2006), <em>en banc reh\u2019g granted, </em>462 F.3d 1066 (2006). Even if we assume that it is improper for a district court to treat the guidelines sentencing range as the presumptive sentence, Ruiz-Estrada is not entitled to any relief. The record in this case shows that the district court did not treat the guidelines range as the presumptive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">Ruiz-Estrada\u2019s second motion to file a late reply brief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b674-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
