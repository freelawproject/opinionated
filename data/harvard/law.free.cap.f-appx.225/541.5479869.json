We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of motions to reopen for abuse of discretion, and we review de novo due process claims. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-21\">The BIA acted within its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed more than three years after the BIA\u2019s final removal order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (motions to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative removal order).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-22\">The BIA acted within its discretion by not applying equitable tolling because Singh admitted to actively participating with his former counsel in presenting a fabricated asylum claim to the immigration court. See <em>Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 899 (filing deadline may be tolled until the petitioner, exercising due diligence, becomes aware of counsel\u2019s alleged fraud).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-23\">Singh\u2019s due process claim is unavailing. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (petitioner must show error and substantial prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b569-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
