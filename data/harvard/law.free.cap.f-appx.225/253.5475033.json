For the first time on appeal, Burks contends that the district court should have decreased his offense level by two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) based on his minor role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-22\">The district court\u2019s determination that a defendant did not play a minor or minimal role in the offense is a finding of fact. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005). Because the claim was not raised below, it is reviewable for plain error only. <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-25\">Although Burks\u2019s codefendant, Elzie Roberts, may have had a more active role than Burks in using the firearm to commit robbery, the evidence did not establish that Burks was so uninvolved as to be \u201c \u2018peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 204 (quoting <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 446-47 (5th Cir.2001)). Burks has thus not shown plain error. <em>See Calverley, </em>37 F.3d at 163; <em>see also United States v. Lopez, </em>923 F.2d 47, 50 (5th Cir. 1991) (fact questions that can be resolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>upon objection at sentencing cannot constitute plain error).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b281-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
