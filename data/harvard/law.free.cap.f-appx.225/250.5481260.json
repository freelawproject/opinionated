He argues that the district court erred in imposing a federal sentence to run consecutively to a not-yet-imposed state sentence. We have held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>that such a sentence is <em>proper </em>under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8584(a) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, (p.s.). <em>United States v. Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1217 (5th Cir.1991). Therefore, King\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Brown.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">King argues that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable. The sentence imposed by the district court is accorded \u201cgreat deference\u201d because it was the Guidelines sentence imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a). <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). King does not argue that the district court misapplied the Guidelines or miscalculated the applicable Guideline range. King\u2019s argument that the consecutive sentence could result in a sentencing disparity is based on speculation as King has not shown that his sentence was more severe than similarly-situated defendants nationwide. <em>See United States v. Duhon, 440 </em>F.3d 711, 721 (5th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. May 18, 2006) (No. 05-11144). King has not shown that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b278-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
