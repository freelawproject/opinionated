On de novo review, <em>United States v. Meek, </em>366 F.3d 705, 711 (9th Cir.2004), we conclude that the district court did not err by refusing to suppress the evidence retrieved after the traffic stop. The police officer had probable cause to stop Defendant\u2019s truck because he had reasonable suspicion that Defendant\u2019s passenger was not wearing a seatbelt, which is a crime in Oregon. <em>See </em>Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 811.210(l)(d); <em>United States v. Lopez-Soto, </em>205 F.3d 1101, 1104-05 (9th Cir. 2000) (describing criteria for reasonable suspicion). The officer testified that he saw that the passenger was not wearing a seat belt before he pulled over Defendant\u2019s truck. The Affidavit for Probable Cause Determination does not contradict that testimony because it says that the passenger \u201csat up and put her seatbelt on as the vehicle was coming to a stop,\u201d which can suggest that first she sat up, the police officer started to pull Defendant over, and then the passenger put on her seatbelt as the truck pulled off the road. Additionally, the officer reasonably suspected that Defendant was driving under the influence of intoxicants. <em>See </em>Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 813.010 (defining crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">2. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>88 F.3d 812, 818 (9th Cir.1996), a district court\u2019s decision to bifurcate a trial, and we conclude that it did not err. The district court\u2019s decision to bifurcate the trial so that the Armed Career Criminal Act charge \u2014 being a felon in possession of a handgun and having previously committed three \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d \u2014 was heard after Defendant\u2019s other two charges was in accordance with our case law. <em>Id. </em>at 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">3. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Ramirez-Robles, </em>386 F.3d 1234, 1240 (9th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2251, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005), a district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence of prior bad acts, and we conclude that there was no error. Evidence of Defendant\u2019s two prior convictions for delivery of methamphetamine were admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b): (1) They proved a material element of the offense for which Defendant was charged \u2014 possessing methamphetamine with intent to distribute\u2014 because Defendant claimed that he had nothing to do with the drugs, but his prior convictions were for similar conduct, suggesting that he had knowledge and intent, <em>Ramirez-Robles, </em>386 F.3d at 1242; (2) the current conviction is similar to his prior convictions, especially because in all cases Defendant used a very unusual method of transporting methamphetamine, in vials instead of baggies, <em>id. </em>at 1243; (3) there was sufficient evidence that Defendant committed the prior crimes because he pleaded guilty to them, <em>id.; </em>(4) Defendant\u2019s prior convictions were not too remote in time, because they occurred between three and four years before the current conviction, <em>id.; </em>and (5) the district court did not abuse its discretion by determining that their probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect under Federal Rule of Evidence 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">4. On de novo review, <em>United States v. Piccolo, </em>441 F.3d 1084, 1086 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Cir.2006), we hold that the district court did not err in concluding that Defendant was a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. The question whether Defendant\u2019s prior convictions qualify as predicate offenses under \u00a7 4B1.1 is a legal one and, therefore, the elements of that guideline did not have to be pleaded or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>417 F.3d 1077, 1079-80 (9th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b509-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-6\">. One of Defendant\u2019s challenges to his sentence has been dealt with in an opinion published this date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b511-6\">REINHARDT, Circuit Judge, dissenting:</author>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that evidence of Parry\u2019s prior convictions for delivery of methamphetamine was admissible under Rule 404(b) to show \u201cknowledge and intent.\u201d <em>See </em>mem. dispo. at 482. Critical to the majority\u2019s resolution of this issue is the fact that, in both Parry\u2019s prior convictions and the instant case, the methamphetamine at issue was packaged in glass vials, a storage method the majority calls \u201cvery unusual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At the time the district court denied Parry\u2019s motion in limine to exclude evidence of the prior convictions, the government did not mention the vials, let alone offer any evidence that the use of vials to package methamphetamine is unusual; nor did it argue that the use of vials, if indeed unusual, would render the evidence of the prior convictions admissible under 404(b). In denying Parry\u2019s motion, the district court did not mention the vials, explaining only that admission of the prior convictions does \u201cseem appropriate under [the standard of <em>United States v. Ramirez-Robles, </em>386 F.3d 1234 (9th Cir.2004) ], the ones for delivery of methamphetamine, to prove knowledge of methamphetamine traffic, and the nexus between methamphetamine trafficking and guns\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">On the basis of the evidence and arguments before it at the time it ruled on Parry\u2019s motion in limine, the district court\u2019s ruling was an abuse of discretion. Parry\u2019s prior convictions do not help prove knowledge (or intent) within the meaning of our precedents. Indeed, knowledge\u2014 especially \u201cknowledge of methamphetamine trade\u201d \u2014 was not even at issue in Parry\u2019s case. Parry\u2019s is not a case like <em>Ramirez-Robles </em>or <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>182 F.3d 1107 (9th Cir.1999), in which a defendant, caught in the middle of a drug transaction, claims ignorance of the criminal nature of the activities in which he was engaged. Parry never argued that he was unfamiliar with methamphetamine or that he would not recognize the drug if he saw it. Instead, Parry testified insistently that the bag containing the drugs was not his but belonged to his passenger, Carrie Peel. Thus, the issue on which this case turns is not really an issue of Parry\u2019s \u201cknowledge\u201d or \u201cintent\u201d at all, but one of simple possession. Did the bag belong to Parry or to Carrie Peel, an acknowledged methamphetamine user? Parry\u2019s prior convictions are not relevant as to that question except through the impermissible inference that, because he possessed and distributed methamphetamine before, he must have been plotting to do it again.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">The majority seeks to rescue the district court\u2019s erroneous ruling by relying on the most tenuous of evidence subsequently adduced at the trial suggesting that glass vials are very rarely used to package methamphetamine (and therefore that they are something of a \u201csignature\u201d attributable to Parry). The only evidence to that effect, however, came from Peel, Parry\u2019s passenger on the night of his arrest, the other person to whom the bag may have belonged. Peel was asked on direct examination to consider, based on her experiences as a drug user, how often she encounters vials instead of baggies when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>buying methamphetamine. Peel responded cooperatively that she \u201c[njever\u201d buys methamphetamine in vials and that vials are \u201c[p]retty unusual.\u201d But Peel had every reason to help the government establish that the bag containing the drugs belonged to Parry. If it didn\u2019t, she would be the proper defendant and would face a maximum 20-year sentence. Her testimony can hardly be considered credible enough, without any corroboration, to support the conclusion that Parry\u2019s prior convictions were admissible under 404(b). Moreover, no foundation was laid to show that Peel was qualified to testify as an expert witness on methods of distribution of methamphetamine. At most she could testify to her experience with her supplier. With so shaky a basis for affording relevance to the vials, the evidence of Parry\u2019s prior convictions has a sharply limited probative value that is substantially outweighed by its highly prejudicial potential. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403. Nor was the district court\u2019s error harmless, as, absent Peel\u2019s self-interested testimony, there was no other evidence of who possessed the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Even if Peel\u2019s testimony were deemed to be credible and sufficient to establish that vials are only rarely employed in methamphetamine transactions, the majority is incorrect in concluding that the presence of vials in the instant case would tend to show Parry\u2019s \u201cknowledge and intent.\u201d Mem. dispo. at 482. Instead, the 404(b) rationale that the majority seeks is \u201cidentity\u201d \u2014 the theory that because the methamphetamine seized in the instant case was contained in vials, and because the use of vials is unusual, the fact that Parry has two prior convictions involving vials tends to make it more likely that the bag in this case belonged to him. But despite the fact that \u201cidentity\u201d \u2014 that is, the identity of the bag\u2019s possessor \u2014 was the sole issue in the case, neither the majority nor the government ever makes the identity argument. Thus I strongly doubt that we should consider it. <em>See United States v. Kama, </em>394 F.3d 1236,1238 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Had the rarity of vials in the methamphetamine trade been a matter of which the district court took notice based on its experience, I might feel differently about the result. The fact is, however, that there is nothing in the record or the briefs, apart from the testimony of a highly interested but far from knowledgeable, let alone expert, witness \u2014 testimony offered at trial well after the district court\u2019s evi-dentiary ruling \u2014 that hints or suggests that the use of vials is rare or that the trial judge may have had some knowledge of that fact as a result of his experience. We should not assume this questionable, though critical, fact on our own, particularly where our own experience does not permit us to do so. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
