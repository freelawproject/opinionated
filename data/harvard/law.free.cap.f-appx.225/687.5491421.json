California\u2019s governmental interest in preventing abuse of the corporate form to accomplish fraud exceeds any interest to the contrary in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-19\">The district court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> MPO Canada did indeed place all of its assets beyond Softbank\u2019s reach, as the district court recognized, partly by sale of shares in Americ Disc, and partly by encumbering the remaining shares with a lien. Transcontinental\u2019s remaining rights in the shares enabled it to preserve its investment interest unburdened by the Softbank liability, by evading the Softbank judgment. Especially persuasive is the fact that MPO Canada had no directors of its own and was run entirely by Transcontinental and MPO SA at the time of the reorganization, and that the reorganization was accomplished just in time to evade Softbank\u2019s judgment \u2014 the timing of which Transcontinental also controlled. A member of the new board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Americ Disc stated that the transaction was structured to avoid involvement in MPO\u2019s dispute with Softbank.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in admitting the testimony of Softbank\u2019s financial expert. There was nothing so esoteric about Canadian accounting principles as to make him incompetent to apply his experience and judgment to the value of a Canadian company. Although book value may have exceeded fair market value, that bore on the persuasiveness rather than the admissibility of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">With regards to Transcontinental\u2019s motion to strike, we grant it with regard to materials not before the district court below, but deny it in all other respects. We note, however, that the presence or absence of the material that was the subject of the motion would make no difference to the disposition of this case. We deny the Transcontinental motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">As for attorney\u2019s fees, they were made recoverable by the guarantee. The district court was correct in applying California law \u201cin determining not only the right to fees, but also in the method of calculating the fees.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> California law does not require the use of the lodestar figure in a case where fees are awarded by contractual obligation,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> so the district court was not required to do so here. California law provides considerable discretion to trial courts in the awarding of fees, and appellate review is for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Evidence in the record supports the district court\u2019s exercise of its discretion. To begin with, the fees awarded ($1,286,750) are only about 24% of the $5,235,885.31 judgment (approved costs and expenses raised the total award to $1,585,704.77). The transactions involved were of tremendous complexity, the record is voluminous, and the litigation was long and heated. The district court observed firsthand Transcontinental\u2019s litigation tactics, which contributed greatly to Soft-bank\u2019s litigation costs. Preparing Soft-bank\u2019s case involved hiring outside experts and foreign attorneys, and required the translation of numerous critical documents from French on extremely short notice. As for the $364,260, the prevailing party\u2019s lawyer may have been willing to give his own clients a break on the fee, but this does not show that the fee was illegitimate or that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-14\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order amending the order of judgment and its order granting Softbank\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Costs are awarded in favor of Softbank and against Transcontinental.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b717-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
