He contends that the conditions of his confinement violated the Eighth Amendment; that the conditions of his confinement violated the Due Process Clause; and that the dismissal of his action before discovery and service of the defendants violated the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-22\">Alex\u2019s appellate allegations regarding the taking of his mattress from his cell during the daytime do not give rise to any Eighth Amendment violation. <em>See Novak v. Beto, </em>453 F.2d 661, 665-66 (5th Cir. 1971). Alex does not allege on appeal that he was deprived of his mattress during sleeping hours; he thus has abandoned any such claim. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Moreover, the serving of food loaf, without more, does not give rise to an Eighth Amendment violation. <em>See Green v. Ferrell, </em>801 F.2d 765, 770 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-23\">Alex\u2019s allegations regarding the cold temperatures in his cell, however, do give rise to a nonfrivolous Eighth Amendment contention. He alleges that he was held in very cold conditions, for an extended period in November and December, wearing nothing but a paper gown during the daytime, and that he was ordered to remain on the cold concrete whenever he attempted to sleep on the warmer, metal bunk. Alex has a right to protection from extreme cold. <em>See Palmer v. Johnson, </em>193 F.3d 346, 353 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Beck v. Ly-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>naugh, </em>842 F.2d 759, 760 (5th Cir.1988). Alex may not recover compensatory damages absent a showing of a physical injury, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e); <em>Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir.1999). However, he may be entitled to injunctive relief, <em>see Harper, </em>174 F.3d at 719, and nominal or punitive damages. <em>See Williams v. Kaufman County, </em>352 F.3d 994, 1014-15 (5th Cir.2003). The dismissal of Alex\u2019s claim regarding the cold temperatures in his cell was erroneous. <em>See Harper, </em>174 F.3d at 718 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Finally, the district court did not err by dismissing Alex\u2019s action before discovery or service of the defendants. <em>See Ali v. Higgs, </em>892 F.2d 438, 440 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
