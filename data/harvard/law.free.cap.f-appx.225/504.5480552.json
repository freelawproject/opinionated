We dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-24\">We lack jurisdiction to review Mesic\u2019s petition because he did not exhaust before the BIA either of his current contentions: that the IJ erred in determining that Mesic\u2019s conviction was for a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and that the agency violated his due process rights. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that exhaustion is mandatory and jurisdictional under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b532-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
