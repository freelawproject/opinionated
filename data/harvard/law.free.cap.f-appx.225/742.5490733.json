Annis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>alleged that Mary Ann Collins (Collins), county clerk in Natrona County, Wyoming, unlawfully filed tax liens against Annis\u2019 property and that Ross Lay (Lay) wrongfully aided Collins in this regard. In response to Annis\u2019 appeal, Collins filed a motion for sanctions, requesting attorney fees and costs incurred in defending the appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and because Annis advances no non-frivolous grounds on appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal and grant Collins\u2019 motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Annis filed a complaint, entitled \u201cClaim of Fraudulent Conveyance and Trespass of Land Title,\u201d asserting that Collins, as Na-trona County Clerk, improperly filed various federal tax liens against his property which were allegedly \u201cdeceptive, fictitious, fraudulent, noncompliant instruments presented by the Internal Revenue Service.\u201d Appx., Doc. 1, p. 1. As for Lay, Annis asserted that he \u201csecured a \u2018Quitclaim Deed\u2019 ... which has been manufactured through [a] chain of actions which are non-compliant and unlawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. Annis sought a declaration that his land patent was the superior title to a certain tract of land and further sought monetary damages from the defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Collins filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Annis filed a response and a one page \u201cNotice to Recuse Judge William Downs [sic],\u201d wherein Annis essentially argued that the district court judge exhibited prejudice against him by considering Collins\u2019 motion to dismiss without oral argument and by allowing Collins to file a reply brief. Thereafter, the district court entered an order granting Collins\u2019 motion to dismiss and denying Annis\u2019 motion for re-cusal. Specifically, the district court concluded that Annis\u2019 assertion that it could assume jurisdiction over the case based upon Collins\u2019 oath of office, whereby she swore to support, obey, and defend the Constitution of the United States, lacked merit, as did Annis\u2019 assertion that the court had jurisdiction over cases arising from \u201cthe dignity of Land Patents issuing from the United States.\u201d Appx., Doc. 15, p. 2. Absent any other possible basis for federal jurisdiction, the district court dismissed Annis\u2019 action. Alternatively, the district court found that Annis failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal of an action under Rule 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Tsosie v. United States, </em>452 F.3d 1161, 1163 (10th Cir.2006). Annis contends that the district court erred in two regards. First, he argues that the district court should have taken up his motion for recusal before ruling on Collins\u2019 motion to dismiss. Second, Annis argues that the district court erred in dismissing his action without acknowledging that Lay was in default for refusing to accept service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">We conclude that neither of these arguments has any merit, but, more importantly, Annis fails to challenge the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his action. A controversy involving land has never been regarded as presenting a federal question merely because one of the parties to it has derived his title from a patent or under an act of Congress. <em>See, e.g., Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, </em>414 U.S. 661, 676, 94 S.Ct. 772, 39 L.Ed.2d 73 (1974); <em>Virgin v. County of San Luis Obispo, </em>201 F.3d 1141, 1143 (9th Cir.2000). Moreover, we are unaware of any legal support for the proposition that a federal court may assume subject matter jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>tion over an action if a named defendant once swore an oath to defend the Constitution. <em>See Nicodemus v. Union Pacific </em>Corp., 440 F.3d 1227, 1232 (10th Cir.2006) (\u201cA case arises under federal law if its \u2018well-pleaded complaint establishes either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiffs right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted). Because Annis\u2019 complaint asserts no other intelligible basis for federal jurisdiction, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his claims and properly dismissed his complaint under Rule 12(b)(1). Accordingly, we need not address its alternative basis for dismissal under 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Collins has also filed a motion for sanctions pursuant to Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Collins seeks a sanction against Annis in the amount of $1,454.55, which is the total of the attorney fees and costs expended by Collins in the defense of this appeal. Under Rule 38, \u201c[i]f a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion ... and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\u201d Annis\u2019 pro se status is not a bar to such sanctions. <em>Haworth v. Royal, </em>347 F.3d 1189,1192 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Because Annis\u2019 appeal is frivolous, sanctions are appropriate. Collins states she refrained from seeking sanctions at the district court level due to Annis\u2019 pro se status. However, Collins now argues that after the district court\u2019s clear explanation of the law, a reasonable person would have recognized the infirmities of his position. Instead, Annis pursued his claims by filing this appeal. We note that Annis\u2019 appellate briefing presents arguments which are lacking in any factual or legal support, and which again force Collins to needlessly respond. Further, Annis\u2019 response to Collins\u2019 motion for sanctions merely lists a series of Collins\u2019 alleged wrongdoings without addressing the request for sanctions on its merits. We grant Collins\u2019 motion and, having received no objection to the reasonableness of the amount requested, order Annis to pay the sanctions sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal, GRANT Collins\u2019 motion for sanctions, and award Collins $1,454.55 in sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b770-22\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
