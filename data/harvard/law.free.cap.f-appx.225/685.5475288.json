We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines, its application of the Guidelines to the facts for abuse of discretion, and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269, 1279 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">Ample evidence supports enhancing Ly\u2019s sentence for his co-conspirators\u2019 use of firearms and restraints during the Multi-Industry Technology, Inc. and Cent\u00f3n Electronics, Inc. (\u201cCenton\u201d) robberies. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) (1998) (directing court to increase offense level by six \u201cif a firearm was otherwise used\u201d); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(B) (1998) (direefing court to increase offense level by two \u201cif any person was physically restrained to facilitate the commission of the offense or to facilitate escape\u201d). The evidence shows that Ly participated in carefully planned takeover robberies and was present in a hotel room before each robbery where the leaders of the enterprise openly handled guns and robbery paraphernalia, including cable tie restraints. Thus, it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to conclude Ly\u2019s co-conspirators used the firearms and restraints in furtherance of jointly undertaken criminal activity, and the use of both was reasonably foreseeable in connection with the criminal activity. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) (1998); <em>see also United States v. Hoskins, </em>282 F.3d 772, 777-78 (9th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Lavender, </em>224 F.3d 939, 942 (9th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s conclusion that Ly actually knew his co-conspirators would employ firearms and restraints is supported by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-15\">Nor did the district court clearly err by attributing a loss exceeding $2.5 million \u2014 the loss Cent\u00f3n suffered \u2014 to Ly. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7)(G) (providing for six-level increase in offense level for losses exceeding $2,500,000). The district court accepted a stipulation between the parties \u201cthat the government has proven by clear and convincing evidence loss in the amount of at least $2.5 million, which would result in [a] six-level increase\u201d to Ly\u2019s offense level. We find the stipulation reasonable because it avoided the seven-level increase that would have attached had the higher amount approaching $10 million been found. By so stipulating, Ly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>waived the objection he now presses that the amount of this stipulated loss was not foreseeable. We thus conclude that the district court properly enhanced Ly\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Finally, the district court\u2019s one hundred eighty month sentence is reasonable. <em>See Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d at 1280. After carefully considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and reducing Ly\u2019s criminal history category, the district court imposed a sentence below the Guidelines range, which the district court reduced from the original calculation challenged in the first appeal. One hundred eighty months is reasonable given Ly\u2019s lengthy criminal history and his active participation in a serious offense involving weapons and restraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b714-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
