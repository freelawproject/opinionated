Hladylowycz denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Xiao Chin Lin, </em>No. A79 641 616 (B.I.A. Oct. 6, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A79 641 616 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 14, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-17\">When the BIA adopts and affirms, then supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-18\">We conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. At the hearing before the IJ, Lin admitted that he intentionally lied at his airport and credible fear interviews, and that his prior claim based on membership in the Falun Gong movement was false. There is no indication from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>record that the interviews were coercive or threatening, or that Lin did not understand the interviewers\u2019 questions. Under these circumstances, the IJ was permitted to draw a negative inference from Lin\u2019s previous instances of false testimony in assessing the validity of his new claims. <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 170-71 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 396-97 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). Although Lin did explain that he only lied to the interviewers because his smugglers had instructed him to do so, the IJ and BIA did not err in rejecting this explanation. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cA petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be <em>compelled </em>to credit his testimony.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted, emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In addition to Lin\u2019s initial fraudulent statements, the IJ also properly considered the documentary evidence, specifically the letter sent by Lin\u2019s wife. The IJ found that because the letter was nearly identical to Lin\u2019s statement in his asylum application, and because Lin was unable to offer a cogent explanation for this striking similarity, it raised serious questions as to the validity of his claims. <em>See Singh v. BIA </em>438 F.3d 145, 148 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam). Given the cumulative impact of these findings, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Siewe, </em>480 F.3d at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Because the only evidence of a future threat of persecution or torture depended upon Lin\u2019s credibility, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding necessarily precludes success on Lin\u2019s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
