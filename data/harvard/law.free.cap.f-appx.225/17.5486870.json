Pender, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>initiated this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Bianco, <em>J.), </em>alleging employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq. </em>Pen-der alleges that Defendants-Appellees-\u2014 State of New York Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities and its Brooklyn Developmental Disabilities Services Office \u2014 failed to promote him, illegally terminated him, and otherwise discriminated against him based on his race and national origin, gender, age, religion, and disability. On July 18, 2006, in a careful, thorough memorandum and order, Judge Bianco granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <em>Pender v. State of N.Y. Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, </em>No. 02-CV-2438, 2006 WL 2013863 (E.D.N.Y. July 18, 2006); <em>see also Pender v. State of N.Y. Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, </em>No. 02-CV-2438, 2006 WL 2620631 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 12, 2006) (denying Pender\u2019s motion for reconsideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-17\">Pender now appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims. In considering his arguments, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Jenkins v. City of New York, </em>478 F.3d 76, 85 n. 4 (2d Cir.2007). And for purposes of the present order, we assume the reader\u2019s familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case, as well as with the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-18\">For substantially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s July 18, 2006 memorandum and order, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Pender\u2019s Title VII claim based on race discrimination and Pender\u2019s ADA claim. With respect to Pender\u2019s allegations of discrimination based upon his gender, national origin, and religion, we note that Pender has seemingly abandoned those claims on appeal and we do not consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>We have carefully reviewed Pender\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
