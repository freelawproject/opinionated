Cobia pled guilty to one count of a three-count indictment charging credit card fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2) (2000) (Count 1). The district court sentenced Cobia to fifty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and ordered payment of restitution in the amount of $101,251.83 and a $100 statutory assessment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Cobia\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the district court complied with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Cobia\u2019s plea. Cobia was given an opportunity to file a <em>pro se </em>brief, but has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-21\">Cobia did not move in the district court to withdraw her guilty plea, therefore her challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). We have carefully re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>viewed the transcript of the Rule 11 hearing and find no plain error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of Cobia\u2019s guilty plea. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Cobia\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b200-13\"> The probation officer calculated an advisory sentencing guideline range for Cobia of fifty-seven to seventy-one months\u2019 imprisonment founded on a total offense level of nineteen and a criminal history category of V. After careful consideration of the facts and evidence, the district court made all the factual findings appropriate for that determination, and considered the advisory sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), prior to imposing sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
