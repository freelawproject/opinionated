BERMAN <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>, District Judge.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b54-11\"><em> </em>The Honorable Richard M. Berman, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b54-8\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Appellants appeal from a June 1, 2006 judgment of the District Court insofar as it granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed appellants\u2019 claim that appellee is hable for delinquent contributions required by Section 515 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1145. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>Guilbert v. Gardner, </em>480 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir.2007), and we construe all evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in appellants\u2019 favor, <em>see Quinn v. Green Tree Credit Corp., </em>159 F.3d 759, 764 (2d Cir.1998). Upon careful review of the record, we conclude that the evidence adduced by appellants is insufficient as a matter of law to establish that Okland Holdings is a \u201cmarginal corporation,\u201d such that appellee should be held liable for the delinquent contributions as its alter ego. <em>Lowen v. Tower Asset Mgmt., Inc., </em>829 F.2d 1209, 1220-21 (2d Cir.1987) (quoting <em>Alman v. Danin, </em>801 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1986)). Moreover, this case does not present us with \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d such as those we have previously found sufficient to impose personal liability for ERISA obligations. <em>Sasso v. Cervoni, </em>985 F.2d 49, 50 (2d Cir.1993); <em>see also Leddy v. Standard Drywall, Inc., </em>875 F.2d 383, 388 (2d Cir.1989) (\u201cWe therefore hold that at least to the extent that a controlling corporate official defrauds or conspires to defraud a benefit fund of required contributions, the official is individually liable under Section 502 of ERISA ... even if the traditional conditions for piercing the corporate veil are not met.\u201d). Appellants have not alleged that appellee \u201cacted in concert with fiduciaries in breaching fiduciary obligations,\u201d <em>Sasso </em>985 F.2d at 50; nor have appellants, in the course of describing purported \u201cfrauds\u201d committed by appellee, presented evidence to show that they ever detrimentally relied upon misrepresentations made by appellee which deprived them of the delinquent contributions, <em>see Cement &amp; Concrete Workers Dist. Council Welfare Fund v. Lotto, </em>148 F.3d 194, 196 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201cWe hold that a plaintiff does not establish the reliance element of fraud for purposes of ERISA or New York law by showing only that a third party relied on a defendant\u2019s false statements.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-14\">We have considered all of appellants\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. The judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
