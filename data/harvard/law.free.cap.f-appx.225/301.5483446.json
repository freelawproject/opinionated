Cantu argues that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for his obstructive behavior. He contends further that his waiver of his right to appeal his sentence is not enforceable in light of the Government\u2019s breach of an oral plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-22\">We first address Cantu\u2019s breach argument, which we review de novo. <em>See United States v. Price, </em>95 F.3d 364, 367 (5th Cir.1996). Cantu has not carried his burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the Government breached the plea agreement. <em>United States v. Laday, </em>56 F.3d 24, 26 (5th Cir.1995). The terms of Cantu\u2019s plea agreement were explicit and clear. The plea agreement did not obligate the Government to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion or to recommend any particular sentence. Despite Cantu\u2019s self-serving allegations, there is nothing in the record to support his assertion that the Government made oral promises outside of the plea agreement and later breached those promises. <em>See United States v. Bal-lis, </em>28 F.3d 1399, 1410 (5th Cir.1994) (although circumstances surrounding the agreement\u2019s negotiations might indicate the parties\u2019 intent, \u201cparol evidence is inadmissible to prove the meaning of an unambiguous plea agreement.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-23\">Cantu\u2019s plea agreement contained an appeal waiver, which the Government seeks to enforce and which the record establishes was entered into knowingly and vol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>untarily. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517 (5th Cir.1999). Therefore, Cantu\u2019s appeal of the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement is barred by his waiver and is dismissed. <em>See United States v. Melan-con, </em>972 F.2d 566, 568 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
