Oct. 7, 2005) . We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-25\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>Jin Ming Liu v.Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir. 2006) . An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conelusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-27\">In this case, while we find several aspects of this case troubling, we ultimately conclude that to vacate the BIA\u2019s denial of the instant motion and remand would be futile. <em>See Alam v. Gonzales, </em>438 F.3d 184, 187 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338-40 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-28\">As an initial matter, Zheng correctly contends that while his motion was explicitly captioned as one to reconsider, and met the substantive requirements of a motion to reconsider, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u00a7 1003.2(b)(1), the BIA inexplicably construed it as one to reopen. <em>See Jie Chen v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 76, 78-79 (2d Cir. 2006) (discussing the differences between the two kinds of motions). Even assuming the basis for Zheng\u2019s motion was ambiguous, the BIA erred in failing to provide any analysis to explain the categorization it chose. <em>Id. </em>Because Zheng\u2019s motion was, by all indications, one to reconsider, the BIA\u2019s stated reason for denying it \u2014 that is was numerically barred as a motion to reopen \u2014 was inapplicable and arbitrary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Nevertheless, we are \u201c \u2018not required to remand where there is no realistic possibility that, absent the errors, the[agency] would have reached a different conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alam, </em>438 F.3d at 187 (quoting <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 401 (2d Cir.2005)); <em>see also Iavorski v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir.2000). Here, Zheng\u2019s motion to reconsider was not only untimely, but also could be considered, at most, a request that the BIA reconsider its September 2002 denial of his second motion to reopen. <em>See Jin Ming Liu, </em>439 F.3d at 111. As that motion was not only untimely, but also completely duplicative of his first motion to reopen, it is clear that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Finally, to the extent the BIA addressed the merits of Zheng\u2019s underlying ineffective assistance of counsel claim in its most recent decision, we note that, in order to prevail on such a claim, an alien must demonstrate that he was prejudiced by former counsel\u2019s actions or inactions. <em>See Esposito v. INS, </em>987 F.2d 108, 111 (2d Cir.1993). We find no error in the BIA\u2019s prior determination that Zheng failed to demonstrate prejudice from former counsel\u2019s failure to file an appeal brief, when he failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. While we note that he challenged this finding for the first time in the instant motion to reconsider, we may not reach that finding now. <em>See Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Accordingly, Zheng has not demonstrated any prejudice resulting from former counsel\u2019s failure to file a brief, nor any error in the BIA\u2019s denial of his second motion to reopen. Having reviewed the entire record, we conclude that remand for additional consideration is not warranted. <em>See Alam, </em>438 F.3d at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-6\">. Moreover, we find the BIA\u2019s decision to treat the motion as numerically-barred puzzling when the motion was filed two years after the BIA\u2019s most recent decision in Zheng\u2019s case, and accordingly, was time-barred as either a motion to reopen or to reconsider. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.(b)(2) (a motion to reconsider must be filed within 30 days of the final administrative decision), (c)(2) (providing 90 days to file a motion to reopen).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
