We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, <em>Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">Five months after being ordered removed <em>in absentia, </em>petitioners filed a motion to reopen claiming that they failed to receive notice of their hearing. The IJ denied the motion, following an evidentiary hearing, on the grounds that the notice was sent to lead petitioner\u2019s last known address, but she failed to receive it because she did not keep the court and her counsel apprised of her address changes. Because the IJ\u2019s determination is supported by the evidence, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b657-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
