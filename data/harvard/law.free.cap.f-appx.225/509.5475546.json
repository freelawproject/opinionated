We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review summary dismissals to determine whether they are appropriate, <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1152,1157 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-24\">The BIA\u2019s summary dismissal of Roberto\u2019s appeal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(A) was appropriate because Roberto failed to state specific grounds for appeal in the Notice of Appeal and did not file a separate brief. <em>See id. </em>at 1157 (upholding summary dismissal where Notice of Appeal lacked requisite specificity); Gar<em>cia-Cortez v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 749, 752 (9th Cir.2004) (it is well established that the BIA may summarily dismiss an appeal if an alien submits no separate written brief or statement to the BIA and inadequately informs the BIA of what aspects of the decision were allegedly incorrect and why).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-25\">We lack jurisdiction to review the underlying merits of Roberto\u2019s appeal because the BIA dismissed on procedural grounds only and did not reach the merits. <em>See Singh, </em>361 F.3d at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b537-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
