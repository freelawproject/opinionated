He appeals the sentence, arguing that the district court erred by declining to grant a downward departure under USSG \u00a7 5H1.4, or a variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), based on his medical conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Even after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u201c[a] district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure is generally unreviewable on appeal, unless the district court had an unconstitutional motive or erroneously believed that it was without authority to grant the departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Frokjer, </em>415 F.3d 865, 874-75 (8th Cir.2005) (internal quotation omitted). The district court here expressly recognized its authority to depart downward in determining the advisory guideline range, (S. Tr. 10), and its decision not to depart is thus unreviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">We do review, however, whether the ultimate sentence was unreasonable with regard to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>United States v. Mickelson, </em>433 F.3d 1050, 1052-55 (8th Cir.2006). Here, the sentence imposed was within the advisory guideline range, but Sjolie argues that his serious medical conditions made it unreasonable for the district court to impose such a lengthy sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">The Sentencing Commission recommends that a sentence be reduced below the otherwise applicable advisory range based on physical condition only when a defendant suffers from an \u201cextraordinary physical impairment.\u201d USSG \u00a7 5H1.4. In considering whether that circumstance is present, \u201ca defendant\u2019s physical condition must be assessed in the light of the situation the defendant would encounter while imprisoned.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>318 F.3d 821, 826 (8th Cir.2003). We reversed, for example, a downward departure based on a serious heart condition, where \u201cimprisonment would not constitute more than normal hardship\u201d for the defendant, \u201csubject him to more than normal inconvenience or danger,\u201d or have a substantial present effect on his ability to function in the prison environment, as opposed to the outside world. <em>Id. </em>After <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court may consider characteristics of the defendant beyond those identified by the Sentencing Commission as grounds for departure, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), but the court must still consider the Commission\u2019s policy statements as advice, \u00a7 3553(a)(5), and also heed the congressional direction to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">Explaining its decision in this case, the district court found that Sjolie\u2019s \u201cmedical needs will be well taken care of\u2019 by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), noting that \u201c[w]e have extraordinarily fine medical facilities, including access to the Mayo Clinic.\u201d (S. Tr. at 16-17). Sjolie contends on appeal that the BOP will not accommodate a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>fitting of his prosthetic leg, but he has not shown that a re-fitting is medically necessary, or that the BOP cannot arrange for this procedure if it becomes medically necessary. Sjolie offered no persuasive evidence that he will face unusual hardship or danger in prison. Under those circumstances, we do not think it was unreasonable for the district court to impose a sentence comparable to that recommended for other similarly-situated defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Other sentencing factors also support the district court\u2019s decision. An appropriate sentence should afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct and protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a)(2)(B), (C). The record shows that Sjolie continued to distribute drugs despite his medical problems, even trafficking nine pounds of methamphetamine several months <em>after </em>he pled guilty to the original indictment while awaiting sentencing. (S. Tr. 4, 5). The evident need to deter this conduct and to protect the public from additional crimes undermines Sjolie\u2019s suggestion that little or no prison term is appropriate in his case. These considerations support the reasonableness of the district court\u2019s decision to sentence within the advisory guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-10\">.
