An arbitrator reversed the decision of the Department, but ordered that she not receive back pay for the period of time she was out of work. Because the arbitrator did not err in denying back pay, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-25\">Ms. Stilley is employed as a licensed practical nurse at the VA Medical Center in Denver, Colorado. After an investigation by the Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d), she was removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>from her position based on charges of \u201cauthorizing the use of government resources under false pretenses\u201d by ordering laboratory tests for herself and \u201cproviding improper and fraudulent documentation to excuse personal absences from duty.\u201d She filed a grievance, and her case proceeded to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The arbitrator concluded that any information obtained from Ms. Stilley during the investigation could not be used to support Ms. Stilley\u2019s removal because the OIG investigators did not permit her to have a union representative present when they questioned her, as provided in the applicable union agreement. Ms. Stilley, however, conceded at the hearing before the arbitrator that she had ordered personal medical tests at government expense. On the basis of the record, the arbitrator determined that Ms. Stilley\u2019s removal could not be sustained and ordered that she be restored to duty, but without back pay during the period she was not working. She was deemed to have been on a \u201cdisciplinary suspension\u201d for that period of time, which was just over a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">On appeal, Ms. Stilley argues that a \u201ctime-served\u201d suspension is an inappropriate penalty. Under this court\u2019s precedents, however, an arbitrator may mitigate a removal penalty to a time-served disciplinary suspension without pay if the petitioner was \u201cat least in part responsible for the removal action\u201d and \u201csome personnel action was justified.\u201d <em>Ollett v. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, </em>253 F.3d 692, 694 (Fed.Cir.2001); <em>see also Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, Local 2718 v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, INS, </em>768 F.2d 348, 351 (Fed.Cir.1985). Because Ms. Stilley admitted at least some of the misconduct on which the initial removal action was based, the arbitrator acted within his discretion when he imposed the suspension as a mitigated penalty. Furthermore, while the arbitrator did not</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">identify specific mitigating factors under <em>Douglas v. Veterans Administration, </em>5 MSPB 313, 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981), he did consider in determining the appropriate sanction factors such as her twenty-four years of exemplary and discipline-free service and her willingness to admit her actions were wrong. Finally, to the extent decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board cited by Ms. Stilley, <em>see, e.g., Fulks v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>100 M.S.P.R. 228 (2005), may be seen as inconsistent with the governing law of this circuit, they of course do not affect the outcome of the case. Under the circumstances presented by this ease, we cannot say that the arbitrator\u2019s decision was unsupported by substantial evidence or was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c); <em>Ollett, </em>253 F.3d at 693.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
