We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">We lack jurisdiction to review Muniz-Tijero\u2019s contentions that the IJ\u2019s factfind-ing was not supported by substantial evidence and the IJ employed an incorrect legal standard because Muniz-Tijero did not raise those issues before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining that this court lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not raised before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">We also lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary determination that an applicant has failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir.2003). Muniz-Tijero\u2019s contentions regarding the IJ\u2019s alleged failure to consider conditions in Mexico does not raise a colorable constitutional claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201ctraditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Finally, we reject Muniz-Tijero\u2019s challenges to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the hardship standard. <em>See Ramirez-Perez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1001, 1004-1006 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b597-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
