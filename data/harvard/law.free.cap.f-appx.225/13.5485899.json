Greiner, </em>No. 00 Civ. 8927, 2001 WL 775962 (S.D.N.Y. July 9, 2001). The petition challenged a July 14, 1997 judgment of the New York Supreme Court that convicted Cordon, after a jury trial, of two counts of first degree burglary, first degree robbery, first degree reckless endangerment, and second degree burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the procedural history, and the issue presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">This Court has granted a certificate of appealability solely as to Cordon\u2019s contention that the trial court denied his right to a fair trial by erroneously permitting the prosecution to present expert medical testimony from Dr. Joyce Pastore, who treated victim Richard Trudeau several months after he was robbed in his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">Although defense counsel was aware that Trudeau\u2019s medical records would be introduced, the prosecution had not listed a medical expert in its pre-trial witness list. Making an assumption based on the witness list, defense counsel told the jury in his opening statement that they would hear no testimony besides Trudeau\u2019s own \u201cthat the medications that he was under did not affect him.\u201d When Dr. Pastore was called to interpret Trudeau\u2019s medical records, the defense objected. In response, the trial court warned the prosecution that Pastore was not permitted to put forth any expert opinion on Trudeau\u2019s condition, and instructed the jury that Pastore was not qualified as an expert and that the sole purpose of her testimony was to interpret Trudeau\u2019s medical records for them. Cordon argues that Pastore did testify as an expert and that the admission of her testimony undermined his counsel\u2019s opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-13\">The Appellate Division rejected Cordon\u2019s direct appeal on the merits of his fair trial claim. <em>See People v.Cordon, </em>261 A.D.2d 278, 691 N.Y.S.2d 390 (N.Y.App. Div. 1st Dep\u2019t 1999), <em>leave denied, </em>93 N.Y.2d 1016, 697 N.Y.S.2d 575, 719 N.E.2d 936 (1999). Under the deferential standard of review established by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), a petition for habeas corpus may not be granted on the basis of a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in a state court proceeding unless the adjudication of the claim \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The Appellate Division\u2019s affirmance of Cordon\u2019s conviction was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law. \u201cThe introduction of improper evidence against a defendant does not amount to a violation of due process unless the evidence\u2019 is so extremely unfair that its admission violates fundamental conceptions of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dun-nigan v. Keane, </em>137 F.3d 117, 125 (2d Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Dowling v. United States, </em>493 U.S. 342, 352, 110 S.Ct. 668, 107 L.Ed.2d 708 (1990)). Such unfairness will only result where \u201cthe erroneously admitted evidence, viewed objectively in light of the entire record before the jury, was sufficiently material to provide the basis for conviction or to remove a reasonable doubt that would have existed on the record without it. In short it must have been crucial, critical, [and] highly significant.\u201d <em>Collins v. Scully, </em>755 F.2d 16, 19 (2d Cir.1985) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cited in Dunnigan, </em>137 F.3d at 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Portions of Pastore\u2019s testimony veered into expert testimony; but assuming it was error for the trial court to permit this, any such error was not so extreme as to warrant federal habeas relief. Most of Pas-tore\u2019s testimony was an interpretation of Trudeau\u2019s medical records based on her personal knowledge of the terminology; defense counsel never disputed that the jury was entitled to have the medical records explained to them; and the contents of the medical records themselves tended to corroborate that Trudeau suffered from no cognitive impairments. Viewing the record as a whole, we do not think that the exclusion of the objectionable testimony would have raised a reasonable doubt; nor do we think the interpretation of the medical records through a doctor\u2019s testimony (rather than through some other means) gave the medical records undue weight as evidence of Trudeau\u2019s cognitive and mental capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">As to any prejudice that might have resulted from defense counsel\u2019s loss of credibility, we agree with the state trial court that because defense counsel knew that the jury would be shown Trudeau\u2019s medical records, and knew that it was generally appropriate to have medical records interpreted for a jury, it was incautious to draw attention to the anticipated absence of any testimony about Trudeau\u2019s condition. Moreover, defense counsel\u2019s opening only predicted that the jury would hear no expert testimony on the side-effects of Trudeau\u2019s medications; Pastore\u2019s testimony on direct in fact did not address this subject, and it was defense counsel who chose to ask Pastore on cross-examination about the medications\u2019 side-effects. Whether counsel\u2019s strategy was so unwise as to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel is not before the Court, and we express no opinion on it. There is no merit to Cordon\u2019s claim of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">We have reviewed Cordon\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
