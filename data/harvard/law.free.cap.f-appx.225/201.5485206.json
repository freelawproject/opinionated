Paulings acknowledges that the Sentencing Guidelines range of 95-115 months was properly calculated, but asserts that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court gave excessive weight to the Sentencing Guidelines range. Paulings further argues that this court\u2019s presumptively reasonable standard for sentences imposed within a properly calculated Guidelines range conflicts with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Johnson, 445 </em>F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201csentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d). We have carefully reviewed the record and Paulings\u2019 contentions and find that the sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005) (noting that sentencing courts should determine the sentence range under the Guidelines, consider other statutory factors, and impose a reasonable sentence within the statutory maximum). Further, it is unnecessary to rely on presumptive reasonableness because the district court sufficiently articulated its reasons for imposing the sentence. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we affirm Paulings\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
