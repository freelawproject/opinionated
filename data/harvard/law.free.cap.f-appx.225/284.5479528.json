Prisoners convicted of \u201cnonviolent\u201d offenses who complete a 500-hour DAP may apply for sentence reductions of up to one year at the discretion of the BOP director. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e); <em>Warren v. Miles, </em>230 F.3d 688, 690 (5th Cir.2000). The BOP enjoys \u201cbroad discretion to deny sentence reductions\u201d even to inmates who successfully complete the DAP. <em>Rublee v. Fleming, </em>160 F.3d 213, 216 (5th Cir.1998); \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B). Castillo was nonetheless entitled to judicial review of whether the BOP\u2019s regulations or application thereof were arbitrary and capricious or otherwise an abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 215-16; <em>see also Lopez v. Davis, </em>531 U.S. 230, 240, 121 S.Ct. 714, 148 L.Ed.2d 635 (2001); <em>Wottlin v. Fleming, </em>136 F.3d 1032, 1035 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-21\">The district court correctly noted that certain BOP criteria for denying DAP eligibility and early release are not arbitrary and capricious. However, the district court made an error of law by stating that early release is not available to \u201cinmates whose current offense is a felony.\u201d Ineligible felons are those whose felonies involved physical force, firearms or other dangerous weapons, sexual abuse of children, or other factors set forth in 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58(a)(vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-22\">Moreover, the scant record before the district court provided no basis for the court to conclude that Castillo was ineligible for the DAP. Castillo\u2019s complaint did not specifically allege the reasons for the BOP\u2019s denial, nor did he submit copies of the BOP\u2019s decisions. The respondent did not answer the petition or offer any summary judgment evidence. There was no evidence of record indicating the BOP\u2019s grounds for excluding Castillo.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-23\">The district court\u2019s holding that there was \u201cno support\u201d for Castillo\u2019s allegation that he was eligible for readmission required too much from Castillo\u2019s petition. The petition satisfied federal pleading rules. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242; Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). Castillo was not given the opportunity to amend his complaint in accord with <em>Jacquez v. Procunier, </em>801 F.2d 789, 792 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The judgment of the district court is vacated, and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
