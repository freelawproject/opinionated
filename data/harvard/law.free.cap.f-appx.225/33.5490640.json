Goldberg, of the United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b62-6\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Defendant-Appellant Alex Rodin appeals from a judgment of conviction entered in the District Court on September 3, 2004. Rodin pleaded guilty to making false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, and was found guilty by a jury of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, respectively. Rodin\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to the counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">We have carefully reviewed the evidence presented at trial and the submissions to this Court on appeal. For substantially the reasons stated by the District Court in its July 13, 2004 Memorandum Order denying Rodin\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(c) or for a new trial under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33, we conclude that, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, the evidence \u2014 which includes e-mails containing Rodin\u2019s first name and bank account information, testimony regarding the manner in which Rodin transferred money overseas, and multiple contradictory exculpatory statements made by Rodin \u2014 would permit a rational jury to find the essential elements of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. LaSpina, </em>299 F.3d 165, 180 (2d Cir.2002). The District Court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
