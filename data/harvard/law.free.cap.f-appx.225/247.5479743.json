He argues that the district court plainly erred in denying him a minor-role adjustment to his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. The district court\u2019s determination that a defendant did not play a minor or minimal role in the offense is a finding of fact. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005). \u201cQuestions of fact capable of resolution upon proper objection at sentencing can never constitute plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>923 F.2d 47, 50 (5th Cir.1991). Whether O\u2019Neal was a minor participant in the conspiracy could have been resolved upon proper objection at sentencing. Thus, O\u2019Neal cannot demonstrate plain error as to that factual question. We further note O\u2019Neal cannot possibly demonstrate any effect upon his substantial rights from failure to grant a reduction because his status as a career offender determined his offense level. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. O\u2019Neal\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
