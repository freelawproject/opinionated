We lack jurisdiction to review any claim that the Board abused its discretion in affirming the denial of adjustment of status. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae (West 2005). Under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (West 2005), we do have \u201ca narrowly circumscribed jurisdiction to resolve constitutional claims or questions of law raised by aliens seeking discretionary relief.\u201d <em>Higuit v. Gonzales, </em>433 F.3d 417, 419 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2973, 165 L.Ed.2d 955 (2006). However, we find no merit in Monzon Lopez\u2019s alleged deprivations of his constitutional rights. Accordingly, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-23\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
