Wilkinson argues on appeal that the district court erred in denying his motion for a downward departure under the Sentencing Guidelines, based on his post-offense rehabilitation efforts, and that his sentence is unreasonable because the court did not afford sufficient weight to this rehabilitation, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-24\">The district court\u2019s discretionary decision not to depart under the Guidelines is unreviewable, because the court clearly understood its authority to depart but chose not to do so, finding Wilkinson\u2019s efforts not extraordinary. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>451 F.3d 914, 918 (8th Cir.2006) (discretionary decision not to depart under Guidelines continues to be unreviewable on appeal), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Oct. 30, 2006) (No. 06-7591); <em>United States v. Chapman, </em>356 F.3d 843, 847-48 (8th Cir. 2004) (because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 already takes into account post-offense rehabilitation, departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 is warranted only if defendant\u2019s efforts are exceptional or fall \u201coutside the heartland\u201d of the Guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-25\">Prior to pronouncing its sentence, the district court expressly stated that it was considering all the section 3553(a) factors and specifically considered Wilkinson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>post-offense rehabilitation efforts. The district court gave proper weight to Wilkinson\u2019s rehabilitation efforts and sentenced him at the bottom of the advisory Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1003-04 (8th Cir. 2005) (standard of review). The district court\u2019s sentencing decision was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-19\">. The Honorable Linda R. Reade, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
