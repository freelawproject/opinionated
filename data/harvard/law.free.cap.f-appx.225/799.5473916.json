(\u201cSt. Joseph/Candler\u201d) and The Matthew Reardon Center, Inc. (\u201cMRC\u201d) on Clark\u2019s sexual and racial harassment and retaliation claims, brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e~2(a)(l) and 2000e-3(a) (\u201cTitle VII\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Clark was employed by MRC, which operates a non-profit school for neurologically impaired children. Throughout Clark\u2019s employment, St. Joseph/Candler provided MRC with space on one of its hospital campuses to operate the school. St. Joseph/Candler also provided payroll services to MRC and permitted MRC employees to participate in St. Joseph/Candler\u2019s employee benefits plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">The district court granted summary judgment after it determined that MRC was not an \u201cemployer\u201d as defined by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b), because it did not employ fifteen or more employees for twenty or more weeks in any year. Additionally, the district court ruled that MRC and St. Joseph/Candler could not be considered either a single, integrated employer or joint employers to satisfy the employee-numerosity requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">After review, we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment to MRC and St. Joseph\u2019s/Candler. The undisputed evidence establishes that MRC did not employ fifteen or more employees for twenty or more weeks in a given year. <em>See Llampallas v. Mini-Circuits, Lab, Inc., </em>163 F.3d 1236, 1243 (11th Cir.1998) (defining \u201cemployee\u201d under Title VII as one who receives compensation from an employer). Furthermore, even construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Clark, a jury could not reasonably conclude that MRC and St. Joseph/Candler were \u201chighly integrated with respect to ownership and operations\u201d such that they could be counted as one employer. <em>See Lyes v. City of Riviera Beach, </em>166 F.3d 1332, 1341 (11th Cir.1999). Nor could a jury reasonably conclude that St. Joseph\u2019s/Candler retained sufficient control over the terms and conditions of Clark\u2019s employment such that MRC and St. Joseph\u2019s/Candler were Clark\u2019s joint employer. <em>See Virgo v. Riviera Beach </em>Assocs., <em>Ltd., </em>30 F.3d 1350, 1359-60 (11th Cir.1994). Because Clark failed to establish that his employer employed the threshold number of fifteen employees, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-9\">. We also reject as meritless Clark\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion by consolidating Clark\u2019s Title VII harassment action with his Title VII retaliation action. <em>See Wright v. Dougherty County, </em>358 F.3d 1352, 1354 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
