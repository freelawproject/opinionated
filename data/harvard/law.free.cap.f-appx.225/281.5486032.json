By failing to brief the issue, Hashem has abandoned his claims under the CAT. <em>Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-22\">Although our review is normally limited to decisions of the BIA, in this case we have reviewed the findings and conclusions of the immigration judge (IJ) because the BIA denied relief based on the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-23\">Our review of the BIA\u2019s decision is governed by the substantial evidence standard, which requires that the BIA\u2019s decision be upheld unless the \u201cevidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Carba-jal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996); <em>see also INS v. Elias-Za-carias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-24\">Hashem argues that the IJ erred in finding that he was not a credible witness and in holding that Hashem had failed to show that he was likely to face persecution in Jordan due to his membership in a particular social group and his religious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>beliefs. Hashem does not challenge the IJ\u2019s determination that Hashem failed to show that there he could not live safely anywhere in Jordan.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">We are not convinced that we should substitute our judgment for the IJ\u2019s determination that Hashem\u2019s testimony as to past events in Jordan and the likelihood that he would face future persecution was not credible. <em>Garcia-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 662 (5th Cir.2003). Hashem does not allege that he would be subject to persecution due to any protected ground. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2); <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 352 (5th Cir.2002). Hashem has waived any challenge to the IJ\u2019s finding that he failed to show that there is no place in Jordan where he could safely live. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(3)(i); <em>Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b309-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
