Relief under the waiver provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(c)(4) is discretionary. This court lacks jurisdiction to review the denial of discretionary decisions of the Attorney General. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); <em>see also Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-24\">Jundi also argues that he was denied due process because the immigration judge announced his conclusion on the waiver issue before Jundi\u2019s counsel was allowed to conduct a direct examination of Jundi. This court does have jurisdiction to review constitutional claims. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). However, as the waiver Jundi sought was purely discretionary, he was not deprived of any liberty interest and thus no due process right attached. <em>See Assaad, </em>378 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>F.3d at 475; <em>Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, </em>461 F.3d 605, 609 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Jundi also challenges the denial of his request for cancellation of removal. The finding that Jundi had not established that his U.S. citizen children would face hardship if he were removed involved the exercise of discretion; therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the determination. <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b340-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
