He seeks to challenge his death sentence pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Atkins v. Virginia,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which prohibits execution of mentally retarded criminals.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">Sometime between the evening of March 15, 1987 and the morning of March 16, 1987, Thomas murdered Mildred Finch in the course of burglarizing her home in Dallas, Texas. Thomas was convicted on September 2, 1987 and received a death sentence. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cTCCA\u201d) affirmed his conviction and sentence on June 8, 1994. In 1997, he filed an application for state habeas relief, which the TCCA denied in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">In July of 2000, Thomas filed his first federal habeas petition which was denied in October 2001. We denied a Certificate of Appealability in November 2002. On April 14, 2003, Thomas\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari was denied by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-18\">On June 20, 2002, after Thomas filed his first federal habeas petition, the Supreme Court decided <em>Atkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-19\">On May 23, 2003, Thomas filed a successive state habeas application, challenging his sentence on the basis of his alleged mental retardation. Following an eviden-tiary hearing, the trial court recommended that Thomas\u2019s claim be denied and, on December 13, 2006, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals adopted the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, denied relief, and vacated the stay of execution that it had entered in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-20\">On December 19, 2006, Thomas filed this motion for authorization to file a successive federal habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-22\">Under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), we may authorize the filing of a successive petition only if we determine that \u201cthe application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, because Thomas bases his application on <em>Atkins, </em>he must make a prima facie showing that: (1) his claim has not previously been presented in a prior application to this court; (2) his claim relies on a decision that stated a new, retroactively applicable rule of constitutional law that was previously unavailable to him; and (3) he is mentally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>retarded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he state court findings concerning the <em>Atkins </em>claim are wholly irrelevant to our inquiry as to whether [Thomas] has made a prima facie showing of entitlement to <em>proceed </em>with his federal habeas application, which is an inquiry distinct from the burden that [Thomas] must bear in proving his claim in the district court.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The State concedes that Thomas satisfies the first two requirements, that is, his <em>Atkins </em>claim was not previously presented in any prior application to this court, and <em>Atkins </em>represents a new, retroactively applicable rule of constitutional law that was previously unavailable. Therefore, the issue before this court is whether Thomas has made a prima facie showing that he is mentally retarded. A prima facie showing is \u201csimply a sufficient showing of possible merit to warrant a fuller exploration by the district court.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If we determine that it appears \u201creasonably likely\u201d that the motion and supporting documents indicate that the application meets the \u201cstringent requirement\u201d for the filing of a successive petition, then we must grant authority to file it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Mental retardation is a disability characterized by three criteria: (1) significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning, usually defined as an IQ of about 70 or below; (2) accompanied by related limitations in adaptive functioning; (3) the onset of which occurs prior to the age of 18.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">We are persuaded that Thomas\u2019s <em>Atkins </em>claim has sufficient possible merit to warrant further exploration by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-14\">In his application, in addition to affidavits from friends and family, Thomas relies on the testimony of Dr. Gilda Kessner and Dr. Richard Garnett who both concluded that Thomas is mentally retarded. Dr. Kessner administered an IQ test to Thomas in 2003 in which Thomas scored a 67. Based on this score, Dr. Kessner concluded that Thomas meets the standard for significant limitations in intellectual functioning, the first mental retardation criteria cited above. Dr. Kessner further testified that score inflation explains why Thomas achieved higher scores on two previously administered IQ test (a 75 and a 77 respectively).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-15\">Dr. Garnett provided testimony regarding the two remaining mental retardation criteria. He concluded that Thomas has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>significant limitations in adaptive behavior which had occurred before age 18 as demonstrated by his limitations in the areas of functional academics and social skills. Dr. Garnett based his conclusions on a review of Thomas\u2019s various test scores, school records, TDCJ records, and the affidavits of relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Because Thomas has made a prima facie showing of mental retardation, we grant his motion for authorization to file a successive habeas petition. This grant is, however, \u201ctentative in the following sense: the district court must dismiss the motion that we have allowed the applicant to file, without reaching the merits of the motion, if the court finds that the movant has not satisfied the requirements for the filing of such a motion.... The district court must conduct a thorough review to determine if the motion conclusively demonstrates that it does not meet AEDPA\u2019s second or successive motion requirements.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We express no opinion on the merits of Thomas\u2019s substantive claim that he is mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Accordingly, Thomas\u2019s motion for authorization to file a successive federal ha-beas petition is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b251-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

The defendant cites the work of James R. Flynn, Ph.D. which concludes that the rise in general IQ scores of a population are attributable to the use of testing procedures outdated by societal changes and advances. Flynn\u2019s theory advocates for the periodic re-normalization of IQ test standard deviations to compensate for inflation and that .3 IQ points is deducted from IQ test scores for every year that has passed since a test was last normed. Applying Flynn\u2019s theory to the two previous IQ tests administered to Thomas would reduce the 75 IQ score by two points, to a full scale score of 73, and would reduce the 77 score to by 10 points, resulting in a full scale score of 67.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b253-10\">. <em>See In re Morris, </em>328 F.3d at 741 (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
