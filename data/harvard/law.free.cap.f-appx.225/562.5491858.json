We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Konstanti-nova v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 528, 529 (9th Cir. 1999). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying as untimely Robles-Diaz\u2019s motion to reopen, filed more than nine years after a final order of deportation was entered <em>in absentia. See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2)-(3) (a motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later); <em>In re M-S-, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 349, 357 (BIA 1998) (en banc) (concluding that a motion to reopen to apply for a new form of relief must comply with the regular requirements for motions to reopen, including timeliness).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">To the extent Robles-Diaz claims he received ineffective assistance of counsel, we do not consider the claim because he failed to raise it before the BIA. <em>Ontiveros-Lopez v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2000) (petitioner must exhaust administrative remedies by presenting ineffective assistance of counsel claim to the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b590-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
