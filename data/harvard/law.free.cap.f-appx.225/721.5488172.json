Hubbard appeals the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s denial of her benefits claims. The court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s decision de novo. <em>Gillett-Netting v. Barnhart, </em>371 F.3d 593, 595 (9th Cir.2004). We must affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence and the Commissioner applied the correct legal standards. <em>Holohan v. Massanari, </em>246 F.3d 1195, 1201 (9th Cir.2001). The facts and procedural history are familiar to the parties, and we do not repeat them here. Hubbard asserts three primary reasons for reversing the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-18\">First, Hubbard asserts that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) violated due process by admitting a surveillance video into evidence, that no foundation was laid for the video, and that the ALJ gave the video undue weight. Hubbard\u2019s assertions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-19\">Prior to the hearing, the Commissioner provided Hubbard with a list of witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>and documents intended for use at the hearing. The list included an exhibit entitled \u201cReport of Investigation dated 10/16/00.\u201d That report was co-authored by Detective Curt McBride and it listed the video as an exhibit to the report. The video showed Hubbard doing many things she claimed she could not do, such as walking without apparent difficulty, ambulating without the aid of a walker or motorized scooter, carrying packages, and lifting her arms above her shoulders. Contrary to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.950(d)(2), Hubbard never filed a written request to subpoena Detective McBride or the video. Having failed to avail herself of this opportunity, Hubbard cannot assert that Detective McBride\u2019s absence from the hearing violated due process. In any event, Hubbard had the opportunity to view the video prior to the hearing and contest its content at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the Commissioner did not lay a proper foundation, the ALJ properly admitted the video into evidence pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.950(c). Hubbard also disapproves of the weight the ALJ gave to the surveillance video. Given that so many of Hubbard\u2019s alleged physical and mental limitations were based on her self-reporting, a video of her unrehearsed, normal activities was highly probative and worthy of substantial emphasis. The ALJ gave the video its due accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Second, although the video constituted substantial evidence of \u201cmedical improvement\u201d under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1594(b)(1), Hubbard argues that the ALJ erred by not comparing her new residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) with the RFC she had prior to her medical improvements. The record does not bear her out. The Commissioner deemed Hubbard disabled since September 1, 1989. After evidence of fraud emerged, the ALJ reviewed Hubbard\u2019s file. Relying on the September 2000 video and a November 2000 report by Michael Wilson, D.O., which stated that Hubbard could perform \u201cat least\u201d sedentary work, the ALJ determined that Hubbard\u2019s condition improved and her disability ended on September 1, 2000. The ALJ, as required by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1594(b)(7), compared Hubbard\u2019s new RFC with the RFC she had prior to her medical improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Third, Hubbard contends that the ALJ wrongly rejected the opinions of her treating physicians in favor of the contrary opinions of non-treating physicians and psychologists. The ALJ is responsible for determining credibility and resolving conflicts in medical testimony. <em>Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 750 (9th Cir.1989). If a claimant is able to \u201cproduce objective medical evidence of an underlying impairment which could reasonably be expected to produce the pain or other symptoms alleged,\u201d and there is no evidence of malingering, the ALJ may only reject the claimant\u2019s symptom testimony by providing \u201cspecific, clear and convincing reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Smolen v. Chafer, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1281 (9th Cir.1996). The ALJ properly rejected Hubbard\u2019s testimony because the video and the reports from David Gotsnell, Ph.D. and Dr. Wilson provided substantial evidence of Hubbard\u2019s malingering.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">Hubbard\u2019s malingering and lack of credibility is a considerable taint that affects most of the evidence she marshals. Hubbard\u2019s treating physicians all relied on her subjective complaints about pain, discomfort and lack of energy when making their diagnoses. The ALJ properly discounted the treating physicians\u2019 opinions after considering the video and the non-treating physician\u2019s opinions about Hubbard\u2019s malingering. <em>See Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 605 (9th Cir.1989) (finding that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>opinion of disability \u201cpremised to a large extent upon the claimant\u2019s own accounts of his symptoms and limitations\u201d may be disregarded where those complaints have been \u201cproperly discounted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The opinions of Hubbard\u2019s treating physicians were, predictably, at odds with the opinions of Drs. Gotsnell and Wilson \u2014 the physicians who examined Hubbard on the CSS\u2019s behalf. Although a treating physician\u2019s opinion is usually given greatest weight in disability cases, it does not bind an ALJ with respect to the \u201cexistence of an impairment or the ultimate determination of disability.\u201d <em>Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1149 (9th Cir.2001). If a conflict exists between a treating physician\u2019s opinion and an examining physician\u2019s, the treating physician\u2019s may be disregarded by the ALJ only if he sets forth \u201cspecific and legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record for so doing.\u201d <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">In this case, the ALJ specifically rejected the treating physicians\u2019 opinions because those opinions were contradicted by the video and the opinions of examining Drs. Gotsnell and Wilson. It was proper for the ALJ to do this. <em>Id.; see also, Tonapetyan, </em>242 F.3d at 1149 (\u201cAlthough the contrary opinion of a non-examining medical expert does not alone constitute a specific, legitimate reason for rejecting a treating or examining physician\u2019s opinion, it may constitute substantial evidence when it is consistent with other independent evidence in the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">For the above stated reasons, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and free of legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b750-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
