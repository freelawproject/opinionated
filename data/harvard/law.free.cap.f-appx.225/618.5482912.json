We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">The record of the sentencing hearing plainly demonstrates that the district court did not treat the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory and understood that sentences can deviate \u2014 either upward or downward \u2014 from those calculated by the Guidelines. Although the district court ultimately imposed a sentence within the range recommended by the Guidelines, the court explicitly recognized that the Guidelines were \u201cadvisory\u201d and that the \u201creal issue\u201d was whether \u201cto sentence [Stange] to seven years\u201d \u2014 the statutory minimum for the firearm conviction \u2014 \u201cas opposed to something higher\u201d as recommended by the Guidelines. The district court, therefore, complied with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">In exercising this discretion, the district court imposed a reasonable sentence. In accord with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court conducted a thoughtful and thorough examination of the relevant sentencing factors. Although Stange\u2019s documented struggle with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder after his Marine Corps service could support a shorter sentence, the district court reasonably considered that condition in light of the psychological report\u2019s indication that Stange was prone to violence. Because the district court imposed a reasonable sentence, \u201cwe will not disturb the discretion of the sentencing court.\u201d <em>United States v. Plouffe, </em>445 F.3d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-15\">Moreover, the district court reasonably relied on Stange\u2019s admission that he had committed a 1997 bank robbery, because Stange did not dispute its inclusion in the Presentencing Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). <em>See United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073, 1085 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc) (\u201c[T]he district court may rely on undisputed statements in the PSR at sentencing.\u201d); <em>United States v. Romero-Rendon, </em>220 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.2000) (holding a PSR provided \u201cclear and convincing evidence of [the defendant\u2019s] previous conviction\u201d when the defendant \u201cnever questioned the factual accuracy of the PSR\u201d). To allow the statement to the FBI to remain unchallenged in any way allows the court to infer that it is accurate. Even though Stange did not deny that he made such a statement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>FBI agents, an objection would have required the district court to inquire into the confession\u2019s accuracy. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3) (\u201cAt sentencing, the court ... must \u2014 for any disputed portion of the pre-sentence report or <em>other controverted matter </em>\u2014 rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing ....\u201d (emphasis added)). It was perfectly appropriate for the district court to treat the confession as true when Stange failed to object to the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b647-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
