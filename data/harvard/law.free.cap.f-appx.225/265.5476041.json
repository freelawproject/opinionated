We now address Appellant\u2019s remaining argument that the district court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law at the conclusion of Appellant\u2019s case in chief. Appellant contends that the evidence it introduced was sufficient to demonstrate that Appellee negligently caused the boat collision at issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">We review findings of fact made pursuant to Rule 52(c) for clear error and conclusions of law <em>de novo. Bodin v. Vagshe-nian, </em>462 F.3d 481, 484 (5th Cir.2006). The credibility determination of witnesses is particularly in the province of the district court. <em>Bursztajn v. United States, </em>367 F.3d 485, 489 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">After reviewing the record and the district court\u2019s findings, we find that Appellant failed to introduce evidence sufficient to demonstrate that Appellee acted negligently. Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
