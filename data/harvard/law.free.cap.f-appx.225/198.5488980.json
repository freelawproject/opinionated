See <em>United States v. Burman, </em>151 Fed.Appx. 260 (4th Cir.2005) (unpublished). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-24\">On appeal, Burman initially contends that the presumption of reasonableness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>this court affords post <em>-Booker</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>sentences imposed within a properly calculated Guidelines range is unconstitutional. This court\u2019s precedent, however, forecloses this argument. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. \u2014 (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341-42 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006); <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Because one panel of this court cannot overrule another, we decline Burman\u2019s invitation to ignore established circuit authority. <em>See United States v. Chong, </em>285 F.3d 343, 346-47 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">Burman also contends that the district court erred by sentencing him on facts that were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. However, after <em>Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the Guidelines range prescribed thereby as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir. 2005). This court has previously noted that sentencing factors should continue to be evaluated based on the preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005). Thus, we conclude the district court\u2019s use of a preponderance of the evidence standard was proper in Burman\u2019s post <em>-Booker </em>resen-tencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">Accordingly, we deny Burman\u2019s motion for hearing and affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b227-13\"><em> United States v.
