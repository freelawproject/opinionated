Barragan contends that the district court erred by applying an eight-level increase to his offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), because the conviction that resulted in his deportation, misdemeanor assault in violation of Texas Penal Code Ann. 22.01(a)(1), is not a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, and does not constitute an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). In <em>United States v. Villegas-Hernandez, </em>468 F.3d 874, 878-84 (5th Cir.2006), we considered the same Texas statute and held that it does not meet either definition of a crime of violence under \u00a7 16 and, thus, is not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Accordingly, the district court erred in enhancing Barragan\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Because we cannot conclude, based on the record as a whole, that the error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed, that is, the error was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>harmless, a remand is appropriate. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). Barragan\u2019s sentence is vacated and this matter remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Barragan also challenges the constitutionality of the treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) as sentencing factors rather elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Barragan suggests that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), this court has repeatedly rejected such arguments and found that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Barragan concedes his argument is foreclosed, but raises it preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
