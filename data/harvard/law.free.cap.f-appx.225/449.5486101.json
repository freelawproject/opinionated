We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Li v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>Ashcroft, 378 </em>F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Zheng testified that the Chinese authorities persecuted him in part because they believed he was involved in spying for Taiwan, yet this key fact is omitted from Zheng\u2019s asylum application and written statement. Because this omission is material and goes to the heart of Zheng\u2019s asylum claim, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Li, 378 </em>F.3d at 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Further, because the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by the record, the IJ properly considered Zheng\u2019s lack of supporting evidence, such as letters or witnesses from his U.S. church community, when denying Zheng\u2019s asylum application. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1044-45 (9th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Because Zheng failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal, and because his CAT claim is based on the same statements, he failed to establish eligibility for CAT. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153,1156-1157 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Zheng\u2019s request for oral argument is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b478-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
