No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Serrano-Arauz first argues that the district court erred in denying him a minor role reduction, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). He asserts that he was less culpable than other persons found on the boat, which was carrying 1,640 kilograms of cocaine. Serrano-Arauz also contends that he was unable to present evidence demonstrating that he was entitled to a minor role reduction because the district court, which sentenced Serrano-Arauz\u2019s co-defendants before sentencing him, had a \u201cpreconceived idea\u201d of Serrano-Arauz\u2019s sentence and did not make its minor role determination based on the facts of Serrano-Arauz\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s determinations about a defendant\u2019s role in an offense. <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>289 F.3d 1339, 1348 (11th Cir.2002). The burden is on the defendant to establish his role by a preponderance of evidence. <em>Id. </em>Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), \u201c[a] defendant warrants a two-level reduction for playing a minor role in an offense if he is less culpable than most other participants, although his role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Sentencing courts should consider two elements when determining a defendant\u2019s role in an offense: \u201cfirst, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 940 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">As an initial matter, Serrano-Arauz\u2019s argument that he was unable to offer evidence in support of a minor role reduction is without merit. The district court heard Serrano-Arauz\u2019s extended argument about why he should receive a minor role reduction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, Serrano-Arauz has not articulated what evidence or argument about his relevant conduct he was unable to present to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">We also conclude that the district court committed no clear error in determining that Serrano-Arauz\u2019s role in the offense was more than minor. About the first element of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, Serrano-Arauz\u2019s sentence was based only on the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable at sentencing: the 1,640 kilograms of cocaine seized from the boat on which he was traveling. And the district court correctly pointed to the boat\u2019s significant amount of drugs in denying Serrano-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Arauz a minor role reduction. <em>See id. </em>at 943 (noting that, in the drug courier context, the amount of drugs is a \u201cmaterial consideration\u201d in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in his relevant conduct). About the second element, Serrano-Arauz was part of a small group traveling on the boat, which was carrying a substantial amount of cocaine. Serrano-Arauz has failed to show that he was \u201cless culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [his] relevant conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 944; and we see no clear error in the district court\u2019s decision not to apply a minor role reduction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Serrano-Arauz also argues that his sentence was unreasonable. He contends that, in determining his sentence, the district court failed to consider all of the sentencing factors set out at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Serrano-Arauz asserts that the district court relied on the \u201cstatus quo\u201d of sentencing defendants' in similar cases to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment and that the district court\u2019s reference to the section 3553(a) factors at sentencing failed to show that Serrano-Arauz was sentenced pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">We review Serrano-Arauz\u2019s sentence for reasonableness in the light of the section 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Winin-gear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-46 (11th Cir. 2005). Under section 3553(a), a district court should consider, among other things, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence and protection of the public, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">Serrano-Arauz\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The district court correctly calculated his Guidelines imprisonment range as 135 to 168 months; and the court sentenced Serrano-Arauz to the lowest point of that range.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">Before sentencing Serrano-Arauz, the district court noted that it had reviewed the section 3553(a) factors and that a reasonable sentence for Serrano-Arauz was at the bottom of his advisory Guidelines range. The district court also explained that this case involved a large quantity of cocaine; and the district court listened to Serrano-Arauz\u2019s statements about why he continued to work on the boat and about some of his personal characteristics. The district court judge was not required to discuss all of the section 3553(a) factors at the sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir. 2005) (explaining that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the section 3553(a) factors\u201d). We conclude that the district court correctly determined Serrano-Arauz\u2019s Guidelines range and considered the section 3553(a) factors in imposing the sentence in this case. Nothing in the record convinces us that Serrano-Arauz\u2019s sentence was unreasonable in the light of the section 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-10\">. Serrano-Arauz argued that he should receive a role reduction because, among other things, (1) he was traveling on a boat that was designed to move cargo and that was carrying washing machines; (2) the boat\u2019s owner decided to carry drugs without Serrano-Arauz\u2019s knowledge; (3) Serrano-Arauz did not receive a substantial financial benefit for his work on the boat; (4) Serrano-Arauz was a cabinetmaker who was hired to do woodwork on the boat; and (5) he did not have an equity interest in the smuggled drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b834-6\">. Except for disputing the district court\u2019s decision not to apply a minor role reduction to his sentence, Serrano-Arauz does not challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of his Guidelines range.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
