At trial, several witnesses testified that German\u2019s accomplice, James O\u2019Malley (\u201cO\u2019Malley\u201d), told them that German hired him to Mil German\u2019s wife. The state trial court admitted this testimony under the declarations-against-interest exception. Cal. Evid.Code \u00a7 1230. The California Court of Appeal held that the statements were properly admitted, because they contained particularized guarantees of trustworthiness as required by <em>Lilly v. Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 125, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">As the Supreme Court recently made clear, <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), does not apply retroactively on collateral review. <em>Wharton v. Bockting, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 1176-77, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007). German\u2019s Confrontation Clause claims, which originate from his trial in 1993 and direct appeal in 2001, are therefore analyzed pursuant to the applicable case law prior to <em>Crawford. </em>Because <em>Crawford </em>is not applied retroactively on collateral review, a state court\u2019s reliance on <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), and its progeny, is not contrary to nor an unreasonable application of federal law. <em>See, e.g., Mungo v. Duncan, </em>393 F.3d 327, 336 (2d Cir. 2004); <em>Stevens v. Ortiz, </em>465 F.3d 1229, 1235-38 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Admission of a hearsay statement does not violate a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights if (1) the statement falls within a firmly-rooted hearsay exception; or (2) it contains particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. <em>Lilly, </em>527 U.S. at 124-25, 119 S.Ct. 1887 (citing <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531). Because the statements-against-penal-interest exception is not firmly-rooted, <em>Hernandez v. Small, </em>282 F.3d 1132, 1139-40 (9th Cir.2002), O\u2019Mal-ley\u2019s statements were admissible at trial only if they were sufficiently trustworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">O\u2019Malley\u2019s statements were spontaneously made to close friends, without any expectation that they would later be used at trial. His consistent repetition of the statements bolsters them reliability. There was also no indication that O\u2019Mal-ley\u2019s motivation was to shift blame to German or minimize his involvement. <em>Compare Lilly, </em>527 U.S. at 139, 119 S.Ct. 1887. The California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision that the statements had particularized guarantees of trustworthiness was, thus, not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly-established federal law at the time of the appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b603-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
