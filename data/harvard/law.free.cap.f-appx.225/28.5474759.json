Plaintiff, who was employed by defendant City of New York Human Resources Administration, alleged in his complaint that defendants violated his due process rights by failing to send a pre-termination notice to him in prison before terminating his employment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the issues on appeal and the procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Having carefully reviewed all of plaintiff\u2019s arguments, we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision for substantially the same reasons set forth in that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">We have considered all of plaintiff\u2019s arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
