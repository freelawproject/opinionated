Plummer argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he knowingly possessed the firearm. Because Plummer failed to move for a judgment of acquittal at the close of all evidence, review is limited to determining whether there was a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>See United States v. Avants, </em>367 F.3d 433, 449 (5th Cir.2004). A review of the record indicates that there is sufficient evidence of guilt. Therefore, Plum-mer has not shown that his conviction would result in a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Plummer\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
