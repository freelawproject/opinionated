We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo non-discretionary eligibility determinations and due process challenges in immigration proceedings. <em>See Vasquez-Zavalo, v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir.2003) (due process challenge); <em>Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d 1137, 1145 (9th Cir.2002) (non-discretionary eligibility determination). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Li did not appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision denying his request for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Instead, Li claimed ineffective assistance of counsel led him to seek a 212(c) waiver rather than pursue a claim for withholding of removal. Because Li failed to present evidence that he was prima facie eligible for withholding, the BIA did not err in finding Li failed to establish prejudice resulted from the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Lin v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 1014, 1027 (9th Cir.2004) (to demonstrate prejudice, a petitioner must demonstrate \u201cplausible grounds for relief.\u201d). Li\u2019s claim that the BIA violated his due process rights by not remanding his case to the IJ is also unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b530-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>ed by 9 th Cir.
