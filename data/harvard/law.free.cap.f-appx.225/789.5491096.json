In removal proceedings, Mira conceded that he was subject to removal for remaining in the United States past that date, but claimed that he and his family were eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">In his asylum application and in testimony before the IJ, Mira asserted that he started assisting the Colombian government while working as a pilot for an aviation company in Cali, Colombia from August 1996 through December 1997. In particular, Mira flew government soldiers and politicians as well as supplies and political pamphlets into various combat zones for free or for reduced rates. He also flew wounded soldiers out of these combat zones to receive medical attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Mira\u2019s troubles with the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia (FARC) apparently began in September 1996, when Mira\u2019s wife received a threatening call from someone claiming to be a member of that organization. The caller warned that the Mira family would \u201cnever again be able to sleep in peace\u201d unless Mira ceased collaborating with the army.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">Five months later, in February 1997, Mira received a letter from FARC labeling him a \u201cmilitary target\u201d and exhorting him to leave the country. This was the first of about ten letters and ten phone calls Mira would receive from FARC over the next year, all communicating basically the same threatening message. Still, Mira and his family remained in Colombia, with Mira taking an airplane maintenance job in the north of Colombia while his wife and son stayed at Mira\u2019s sister\u2019s home back in Cali.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">Finally, on December 10, 1998, someone riding in a blue jeep shot at Mira\u2019s car as he drove to his sister\u2019s home from the Cali airport to spend Christmas with his wife and son. Athough Mira was able to evade his aggressor unscathed, he received a letter two days later in which FARC claimed responsibility for the shooting incident and warned him that he was \u201clucky this time\u201d but that \u201cnext time will be at another price.\u201d Ater this incident, Mira moved his family to the town in northern Colombia where he had been working, and eventually, on March 23, 1999, the family relocated to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">In considering Mira\u2019s asylum application, the IJ first found, in conclusory fashion, that Mira had \u201cfailed to show that he is the victim of past persecution.\u201d The IJ then found that Mira had no \u201cobjectively well-founded fear\u201d of future persecution, relying on two facts in particular: (1) Mira or his family members returned to Colombia after traveling to the United States on two separate occasions after being harassed by FARC; and (2) Mira did not ultimately move his family to the United States until four months after the December 10, 1998 shooting incident near the Cali airport. These actions, in other words, were not the response \u201cof an individual who is genuinely and credibly fearful of their life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">Since Mira was ineligible for asylum, the IJ found that he was necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal, which required him to meet the higher burden of showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>that he would more likely than not face persecution if he was returned to Colombia. Likewise, the IJ found that Mira had not shown that he would face torture at the hands of the Colombian government upon his return to that country as required for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The BIA affirmed and adopted the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, and Mira now seeks review of that affirmance with respect to his asylum and withholding-of-removal claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, that is the decision we review here. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the IJ\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test, under which we will affirm the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283-84 (citation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum to an alien who is a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aub-dedup-0\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-9\"><em>8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). As the asylum applicant, Mira bore the burden of proving refugee' status, <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284, and thus had to show, with specific and credible evidence, either: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor; or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that he will be persecuted in the future based on a statutorily listed if he is returned to Colombia. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Silva v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006). In his petition, Mira does not challenge the IJ\u2019s finding on the second prong of the analysis, that he did not have an \u201cobjectively well-founded fear\u201d of persecution should he be returned to Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">With respect to Mira\u2019s claim that the IJ erred on the \u201cpast persecution\u201d prong, we note that \u201c \u2018persecution\u2019 requires more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, unaccompanied by any physical punishment, infliction of harm, or significant deprivation of liberty.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Mikhailevitch v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 384, 390 (6th Cir.1998)). This means in particular that the threatening phone calls and letters Mira and his wife began receiving in September 1996 are insufficient to establish Mira\u2019s eligibility for asylum on the basis of past persecution. <em>See Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1237-38 (finding a written death threat and numerous threatening phone calls to be \u201charassment and intimidation, but not persecution\u201d); <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (\u201c[T]he menacing telephone calls and threats to [the petitioner] ... do not rise to the level of past persecution that would compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>The only other FARC encounter Mira argues amounts to past persecution is the December 10, 1998 shooting incident. As evidence of FARC\u2019s involvement in that episode, Mira attached to his asylum application a letter purportedly from FARC suggesting that, although he had escaped his assailants once, he would not be so lucky the next time. But, after considering the evidence of the shooting, the IJ deemed it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-4\">somewhat unlikely that the FARC guerillas considered [Mira] to be such a threat to them that they would continue to come after him despite the fact that he had apparently complied with their demands by stopping his work on behalf of the army and for not being involved with [the army] in any way for approximately 18 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">In other words, the IJ determined that FARC could no longer be targeting Mira on account of his collaboration with the army.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">We have never held that an attempted shooting like the one Mira described in his asylum application and testimony before the IJ qualifies as persecution. <em>Cf. Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1238 (assuming, \u201cfor the sake of argument,\u201d that a similar shooting amounted to persecution). But even assuming that such a shooting would amount to persecution, there is no evidence in the record compelling us to conclude that FARC orchestrated the attack on the basis of Mira\u2019s political opinion. In this regard, Mira\u2019s case is similar to <em>Silva, </em>where the petitioner was shot at while driving home from a restaurant she owned. 448 F.3d at 1234. In that case, we affirmed the IJ\u2019s finding that the petitioner had not suffered past persecution on account of her political activity in light of the petitioner\u2019s admission \u201cthat she did not know who shot at her car or why.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1238. Here, the letter Mira proffered is evidence of <em>who </em>shot at Mira\u2019s car (FARC), but leaves us with no indication as to <em>why </em>he was shot at. Additionally, Mira\u2019s own testimony that he ceased working with the army well over a year prior to the December 10, 1998 shooting supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that FARC did not target Mira because of his political opinion. Nothing in the record compels a conclusion to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">Because no record evidence compels a finding contrary to that of the IJ on the \u201cpast persecution\u201d inquiry, Mira\u2019s petition is due to be denied with respect to his asylum claim. And because Mira has failed to meet his burden under the standard for asylum, it follows that he likewise cannot show that he will more likely than not face persecution upon return to Colombia, as required for withholding of removal. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93 (\u201c[w]here an applicant is unable to meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u2019 standard for asylum, he is generally precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of [removal]\u201d). Accordingly, Mira\u2019s petition must also be denied with respect to his claim for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-8\">. Mira has not sought review of the IJ\u2019s decision to deny him relief under CAT. He has therefore abandoned that issue here. <em>See Se-pulveda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
