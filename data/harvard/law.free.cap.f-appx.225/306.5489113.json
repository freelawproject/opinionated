We review the sentence imposed for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). As Carlos was sentenced at the low end of the applicable guidelines range, and he identifies no error in the guidelines calculations, we give great deference to the sentence imposed. <em>See United, States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 828, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Contrary to Carlos\u2019s arguments, we find that the district court did not improperly balance the sentencing factors and the sentence imposed was not greater than necessary to satisfy the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Therefore, we conclude that the 46-month sentence imposed was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-22\">Carlos\u2019s constitutional challenge to the provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court now would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Carlos properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
