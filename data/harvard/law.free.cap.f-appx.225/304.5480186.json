Homan, </em>461 F.3d 605, 609 (5th Cir.2006). However, none of these provisions \u201cshall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review. ...\u201d \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Vargas argues that the BIA erred when it affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief. He claims that the IJ\u2019s improper bias against him violated due process. However, Vargas\u2019s claim is unavailing. Section 212(c) relief is available only within the broad discretion of the Attorney General and is not \u201ca right that is protected by due process.\u201d <em>See United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 231 (5th Cir.2002). Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to review Vargas\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Accordingly, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
