She contends that her conviction for Count Two should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>be vacated and the case remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss that count. The Government concedes the error and agrees that the conviction on Count Two should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Simultaneous convictions and sentences for the same criminal act involving possession of a firearm and possession of ammunition violate double jeopardy. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>977 F.2d 915, 919 (5th Cir.1992). Accordingly, we vacate Fields\u2019s conviction on Count Two and remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss that count. <em>See Ball v. United States, </em>470 U.S. 856, 864-65, 105 S.Ct. 1668, 84 L.Ed.2d 740 (1985). Fields\u2019s conviction on Count One is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Fields argues that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is facially unconstitutional because it does not require a substantial affect on interstate commerce. She also contends that the mere fact that a firearm or ammunition traveled across state lines in the past is legally insufficient to satisfy \u00a7 922(g)(l)\u2019s interstate commerce requirement. Fields acknowledges that these arguments are foreclosed by circuit precedent, but she raises them to preserve them for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">This court has repeatedly held that \u201c \u2018the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) is not open to question.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir. 2001) (quoting <em>United States v. DeLeon, </em>170 F.3d 494, 499 (5th Cir.1999)). This court has also held that evidence that a <em>weapon was </em>manufactured in one state and possessed in another is sufficient to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 922(g). <em>United States v. Pierson, </em>139 F.3d 501, 504 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Rawls, </em>85 F.3d 240, 242-43 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, Fields\u2019s arguments are foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
