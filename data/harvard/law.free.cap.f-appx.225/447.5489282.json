This court previously affirmed the BIA\u2019s decision that Veksler failed to establish past persecution, and remanded for a determination of whether he had established a well-founded fear of future persecution. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Veksler failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his Jewish heritage. In order to establish a well-founded fear, a petitioner cannot simply show that there exists a generalized possibility of persecution; he must show that he is at particular risk. <em>Compare Mgoian v. INS, </em>184 F.3d 1029, 1035 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that well-founded fear was established where all of petitioner\u2019s similarly situated family members were persecuted) <em>with Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 970 (9th Cir.1998) (holding that no well-founded fear was established where the attacks on family members failed to show a pattern of persecution tied to the petitioners). The deaths of Veksler\u2019s father and friend under unknown circumstances do not demonstrate a pattern of persecution closely tied to Vek-sler. The evidence does not compel a finding Veksler has shown himself to be at particular risk for future persecution. <em>See Mgoian, </em>184 F.3d at 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\"> This disposition, is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
