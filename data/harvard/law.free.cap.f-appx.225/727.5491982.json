HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b755-26\">Anthony C. Kenney appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his pro se complaint because it is frivolous and fails to state a claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9 and (ii). Because Mr. Kenney brought his action in the wrong venue, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>We construe pro se pleadings liberally. <em>See French v. Adams Cty. Detention Ctr., </em>379 F.3d 1158, 1159 (10th Cir. 2004). Mr. Kenney, proceeding <em>in forma pauperis, </em>brought suit against NKC of America, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma. (The address for NKC stated in the complaint is in Memphis, Tennessee.) He alleged that NKC denied him a position as a combination welder and that this denial constituted racial discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e through 2000e-17. (In his appeal brief Mr. Kenney also seems to assert claims under the \u2018Wagner Act\u201d and the \u201cFair Labor Standards Act.\u201d We assume that he is referring to the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-169, (sometimes called the Wagner Act,\u201d <em>see Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. BF Goodrich, </em>387 F.3d 1046, 1048 n. 4 (9th Cir.2004)), and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-219. Neither claim was raised below, so we decline to consider them for the first time on appeal. <em>See Utah Shared Access Alliance v. Carpenter, </em>463 F.3d 1125, 1134 n. 3 (10th Cir.2006).)</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">According to his complaint, Mr. Kenney had apparently taken a \u201cClass A\u201d welder test in an attempt to obtain the welding position, and was falsely told that he did not pass. He allegedly had already been a \u201cClass A\u201d certified welder for many years. After NKC denied him employment, Mr. Kenney filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). On the EEOC complaint he indicated that Memphis, Tennessee, was his home and the location of NKC. The record contains no right-to-sue notice from the EEOC or any other information regarding the status of its investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\"><em>The </em>venue provision of Title VII states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">Such an action may be brought in any judicial district in the State in which the unlawful employment practice is alleged to have been committed, in the judicial district in which the employment records relevant to such practice are maintained and administered, or in the judicial district in which the aggrieved person would have worked but for the alleged unlawful employment practice, but if the respondent is not found within any such district, such an action may be brought within the judicial district in which the respondent has his principal office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(3). This specific venue provision, and not general venue provisions, applies to Title VII claims. <em>See Pierce v. Shorty Small\u2019s of Branson, Inc., </em>137 F.3d 1190, 1191 (10th Cir.1998). Sua sponte dismissal for improper venue is appropriate \u201cwhen the defense is obvious from the face of the complaint and no further factual record is required to be developed.\u201d <em>Trujillo v. Williams, </em>465 F.3d 1210, 1217 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">The allegations of the complaint suggest that Tennessee is the sole proper venue, and no allegation in the complaint would support venue in Oklahoma. Moreover, although the district court stated that \u201c[t]he events giving rise to Plaintiffs claim occurred in Tennessee, and the Court doubts whether it could properly exercise jurisdiction over [NKC],\u201d Mr. . Kenney makes no effort on appeal to suggest that he could establish proper venue in Oklahoma. Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b755-17\"> After examining the brief and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
