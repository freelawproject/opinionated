Three years later, after an unsuccessful direct appeal, Pastor-Alvarez filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 which the sentencing court denied. In 2003 he filed a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. It too was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>In 2005 Pastor-Alvarez filed another \u00a7 2241 petition, this time arguing that his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). According to Pastor-Alvarez, this is a structural error which he may raise under \u00a7 2241 because AEDPA\u2019s restrictions on the filing of second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions render \u00a7 2255 \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 1\u00cd5. The District Court disagreed, dismissing the motion for lack of jurisdiction as an unauthorized \u00a7 2255 motion. The court also declined to transfer it to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to be treated as an application to file a second \u00a7 2255 motion. Nevertheless, the court\u2019s dismissal of the petition was without prejudice to Pastor-Alvarez\u2019s filing his own application. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">As the District Court correctly explained, Pastor-Alvarez\u2019s claim falls squarely within \u00a7 2255. Although we have held that in certain limited circumstances \u00a7 2255 may be considered \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245 (3d Cir.1997), we have emphasized that this exception is very narrow. A petitioner may not resort to \u00a7 2241 instead of \u00a7 2255 unless he had no prior opportunity to challenge his conviction for actions which an intervening change in the law potentially decriminalized. <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir. 2002). Like <em>Apprendi </em>(the decision underlying the petitioner\u2019s argument in <em>Oker-eke </em>), <em>Booker </em>has no such effect on Pastor-Alvarez\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Because the appeal presents no substantial question,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-5\">. The District Court did not err in declining to transfer Pastor-Alvarez\u2019s petition to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to be treated as an application for leave to file a second \u00a7 2255 motion. The Supreme Court has not held that <em>Booker </em>applies retroactively to cases on collateral review, and none of its decisions, read together, mandate such a result. <em>See Tyler v. Cain, </em>533 U.S. 656, 121 S.Ct. 2478, 150 L.Ed.2d 632 (2001); <em>In re Olopade, </em>403 F.3d 159 (3d Cir.2005).f</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
