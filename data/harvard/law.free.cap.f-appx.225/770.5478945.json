After exhausting his state remedies on direct appeal and through post-conviction proceedings, he brought this 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court. He now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-17\">In order to proceed on appeal, Mr. Ochoa requires a certificate of appealability (COA). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c). In support of his application for a COA, he raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-18\">(1) the trial court admitted and/or failed to redact a videotaped police interrogation in violation of Petitioner\u2019s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-19\">(2) the trial court admitted prejudicial and inflammatory photographs in violation of Petitioner\u2019s Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-20\">(3) the admission of other crimes evidence violated Petitioner\u2019s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-21\">(4) the admission of improper opinion testimony violated Petitioner\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment rights;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>(5) appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise on direct appeal issues of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and failing to request an evidentiary hearing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\">(6) cumulative error by trial counsel denied him the right to effective assistance of counsel and deprived him of a fundamentally fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Application for Cert, of Appealability, at 1A.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">We may grant Mr. Ochoa a COA only if he \u201chas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). This standard requires \u201ca demonstration that ... includes showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Upon careful consideration of Mr. Ochoa\u2019s application for COA, his brief on appeal, the record, and the applicable law, we conclude, for substantially the same reasons stated in the district court\u2019s order of May 24, 2006, and the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation of March 31, 2006, that Mr. Ochoa has failed to demonstrate his entitlement to a COA under the applicable standards. We therefore DENY his application for a COA and DISMISS this appeal. Mr. Ochoa\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is granted. All other pending motions are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b798-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estop-pel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
