He contends that his sentence, which was already below the statutory minimum, would have been even lower if his trial counsel had adequately explained to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>the necessity for complete truthfulness in his discussions with the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel generally will not be considered for the first time on direct appeal because there has not been an opportunity to develop evidence on the claim. <em>United States v. Lampazianie, </em>251 F.3d 519, 527 (5th Cir. 2001). The record here has not been sufficiently developed to permit consideration of Morales\u2019s claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Accordingly, without prejudice to Morales\u2019s right to file a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
