Many of the issues therein had been raised previously in a 2002 petition and rejected both by the District Court and by this Court on appeal. <em>See </em>M.D.Pa. Civ. No. 02-cv-1903; C.A. No. 04-1097. At the time this earlier petition was filed, Watkins had a full term expiration date of January 24, 2008, and a projected release date, factoring in good time credit, of December 12, 2005. We agree with the District Court\u2019s refusal to revisit petitioner\u2019s old claims and to consider only those alleged miscalculations in petitioner\u2019s sentence which occurred after the period addressed in his prior petition. The instant petition appears to allege a miscalculation of his good time credit during this period, which has led to a projected release date of November 13, 2007. The District Court found no error in the government\u2019s calculations and rejected the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-22\">We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 &amp; 2253 and undertake pie-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>nary review of the judgment of the District Court. <em>See Ruggiano v. Reish, </em>307 F.3d 121, 126 (3d Cir.2002). Like the District Court, we find no error in the government\u2019s calculation of petitioner\u2019s release date.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When we last reviewed petitioner\u2019s sentence, the full term expiration date was January 24, 2008. Factoring in good time credit, his projected release date was December 12, 2005. Since that time, Watkins has been penalized for various infractions by the forfeiture of 688 days of good time credit. He also earned an additional 7 days of good time credit for time spent in a Residential Reentry Center. Finally, the Bureau of Prisons corrected a computation error in his sentence which led to the addition of 27 days to his full term release date and the addition of 7 days projected good time credit. In total, these changes have resulted in the addition of 701 days to his projected release date. Petitioner does not challenge the validity of these adjustments, but rather contends \u201cimproper computation.\u201d The government has made its calculations correctly and set Watkins\u2019s projected release date as November 13, 2007, 701 days after December 12, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the district court. Petitioner\u2019s motion for summary reversal is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-7\">. As the events in this case are familiar to the parties and ably summarized in the District Court's memorandum, we limit ourselves to a short summary of the relevant changes in petitioner\u2019s release date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
