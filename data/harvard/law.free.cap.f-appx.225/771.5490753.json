ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Defendant/appellant Sarah Mercy Oluso-la was found guilty, following a jury trial, of one count of making a false statement on a passport application, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1542, and one count of making a false claim to be a United States citizen, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911. She was sentenced to two years probation, to run concurrently, and was assessed a $100 fine per count, as well as a $100 special monetary assessment per count. Olusola appeals her conviction, which we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">On August 26, 2001, Olusola, a citizen of Nigeria, entered the United States as a non-immigrant M-l student, planning to study at the Rhema Bible Training Center in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Olusola\u2019s visa was valid through June 30, 2005. At some point between her arrival and the expiration of her visa on June 30, 2005, Olusola\u2019s status shifted from M-l to M-2, indicating that she was married to an M-l student.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">On December 22, 2004, Olusola made an 1-360 special immigrant petition to become a religious worker with Air Travel and Tours, an entity which arranged tours to Nigeria. Olusola, an attorney in Nigeria, represented that she was the director and president of Air Travel and Tours. On July 8, 2005, the 1-360 special immigrant petition was denied because Air Travel and Tours was not a religious organization. Olusola applied for and received tax exempt status for Air Travel and Tours as a not-for-profit charitable organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-14\">In June 2005, both Olusola and her husband filed 1-539 forms to become religious workers. Those were approved and Oluso-la became an R-2 non-immigrant, while her husband was an R-l non-immigrant. This extended Olusola\u2019s visa until June 30, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-15\">On September 30, 2005, Olusola applied for a United States passport at the United States Post Office in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. On the application, she indicated that her parents, Dawn Louise Gore and Charles Chester Brooks III, were born in the United States. As proof of her identity, Olusola provided her Oklahoma drivers license. As proof of her citizenship, Oluso-la provided a State of Oklahoma \u201cCertificate of Foreign Birth,\u201d dated July 20, 2005, which indicated that Olusola was born in Lagos, Nigeria, on March 24, 1964.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Certificate clearly states the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>following: \u201cThis Certif\u00edcate is Not Proof of U.S. Citizenship.\u201d Olusola swore the information on the application was correct and recited the oath before United States postal employee Jack Hope. By signing the application, Olusola represented the following: \u201cI declare under penalty of perjury that I am a United States citizen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">On October 24, 2005, the passport application was forwarded first to the Houston Passport Agency Anti-Fraud Office and then to the Diplomatic Security Service for investigation because of Olusola\u2019s use of the Certificate of Foreign Birth as proof of her United States citizenship. The Houston Passport Agency discovered that, on July 12, 2005, Olusola had been adopted in Oklahoma by Dawn Louise Gore and Charles Chester Brooks III, both United States citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">On January 18, 2006, Olusola was interviewed by a special agent with the United States Department of State Diplomatic Security Service. The agent testified at her trial that Olusola was \u201cuncooperative and not forthcoming.\u201d Tr. of Jury Trial at 44, R. Vol. III.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Olusola testified at her trial that she thought her adoption by Gore and Brooks would bestow upon her United States citizenship: \u201cIt meant I was a citizen because I was adopted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57. However, she conceded on cross-examination that the Certificate of Foreign Birth \u201cdoesn\u2019t go to [her] citizenship at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61. She also conceded that there was never any assurance or reference to Olusola becoming a citizen during the adoption proceeding. Olusola admitted she \u201cdid not go through a naturalization process,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 64, and that no representative of the United States government had ever told her she was a citizen. The jury returned guilty verdicts on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Olusola appeals, arguing that it was plain error for the district court to fail to give the jury an instruction on good faith. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">\u201cWhen no objection to a jury instruction was made at trial, the adequacy of the instruction is reviewed de novo for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Visinaiz, </em>428 <em>F.3d </em>1300, 1308 (10th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1101, 163 L.Ed.2d 913 (2006). \u201cPlain error occurs when there is (i) error, (ii) that is plain, which (iii) affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and which (iv) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz-Terrazas, </em>477 F.3d 1196, 1199 (10th Cir.2007). Thus, we must determine if it was plain error for the district court to fail to give a good faith instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\"><em>\u201cA </em>defendant is entitled to a good faith instruction when he has interposed the defense of good faith, has requested the instruction, and when there is sufficient evidence to support it.\u201d <em>United States v. Overholt, </em>307 F.3d 1231, 1247 (10th Cir. 2002). Furthermore, unlike most other circuits, \u201c[w]e have held that when those conditions are met, a good faith instruction is required, even if an instruction on willfulness has been given.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">Olusola argues that she \u201csquarely raised good faith as her sole theory of defense.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8. Olusola did testify at several points that she thought her adoption by two United States citizens made her a citizen. The special agent who interviewed her also testified that she told him she thought the adoption conferred citizenship. However, she also conceded that the adoption decree \u201cdoesn\u2019t go to [her] citizenship at all.\u201d Tr. of Jury Trial at 61, R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Vol. III. Furthermore, she conceded that she did not attach the adoption decree to her passport application, nor did she even bring it with her when she filled out and signed the application, thereby undermining her claim that her belief in her citizenship was based upon the adoption decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Additionally, in closing arguments, Olu-sola\u2019s counsel did not argue good faith. Rather, he argued that Olusola sent her passport application off and expected the government to tell her if she was or was not a citizen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">She fills out a passport application, she says on there she\u2019s a citizen, she sends it off to the United States government. Who better knows if she\u2019s a citizen or not but the United States Government. She expected to hear back from them. No, you\u2019re not a citizen. Yes, you are a citizen. She knew she hadn\u2019t gone through any naturalization process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Tr. of Closing Arguments at 10, R. Supp. Vol. II. That is hardly consistent with the defense that she sent off her passport application in good faith, believing that her adoption had automatically conferred citizenship on her. Additionally, Olusola was hardly a naive or unsophisticated person. Rather, she had been trained as a lawyer in Nigeria; she had filled out paperwork to successfully petition for changes in her legal status in the United States; and she had negotiated the process of having her company, of which she was the director and president, be declared a not-for-profit charitable institution. This all undermines her claim that she thought her adoption decree automatically changed her citizenship status in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Accordingly, even were we to agree that she argued good faith as a defense at trial, the evidence does not support such a defense. Because the evidence did not support such a defense, it was not error, let alone plain error, for the district court to fail to give such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b800-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-16\">.
