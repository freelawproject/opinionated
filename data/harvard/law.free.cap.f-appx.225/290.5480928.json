She argues that the district court erroneously calculated her sentencing guideline range by applying a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9) for the use of sophisticated means. Rubio\u2019s offense included a repetitive scheme, access and use of multiple credit and bank accounts, repetitive misrepresentations in person and telephonically to obtain goods and services, the concealment of criminal activity by accessing bank and credit accounts and misdirecting mail, and the creation, copying, and transmission of false identification. Viewed in its entirety, the scheme involved sophisticated means even if some of aspects of Rubio\u2019s offense were not sophisticated, and the district court did not clearly err. <em>See United States v. Clements, </em>73 F.3d 1330, 1340 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
