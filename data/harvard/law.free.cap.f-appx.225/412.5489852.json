Having calculated a Guidelines imprisonment range of 70-87 months, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 75 months. Lima-Pacheco appeals, arguing that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court did not consider relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors that should have received significant weight. We disagree. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (appellate review for unreasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-21\">The record shows that the district court properly considered the undisputed advisory Guidelines range, the nature of the offense, the defendant\u2019s circumstances and history (including repeated unlawful entries, deportations, and imprisonment), sentencing objectives (especially deterrence), and the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities. We hold that the sentence the district court then imposed is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Davidson, </em>437 F.3d 737, 741 (8th Cir.2006) (addressing consideration of \u00a7 3553(a) factors); <em>United States v. Sebastian, </em>436 F.3d 913, 915-16 (8th Cir.2006) (with regard to determination \u201cthat certain disparities are warranted,\u201d recognizing both Congress\u2019s policymaking power and Attorney General\u2019s prosecutorial discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-13\">.
