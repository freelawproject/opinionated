Harper, Jr., Texas prisoner # 1079380, has appealed the district court\u2019s order dismissing his civil rights complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. Harper alleged in his complaint that he suffered injuries when a prison guard pushed him in the chest following an altercation and that prison officials delayed obtaining him medical treatment for one hour and a half, thereby demonstrating deliberate indifference to his medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-21\">Harper\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-22\">Harper has previously accumulated one strike for 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) purposes. <em>See Harper v. Bell County Texas, </em>No. W-02-CA-161 (S.D.Tex.6/17/2003). The district court\u2019s dismissal of Harper\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal both count as additional strikes. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Harper may no longer proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-23\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) SANCTIONS IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
