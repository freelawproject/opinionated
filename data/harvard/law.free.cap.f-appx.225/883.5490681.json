Coleman, seeks review of a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) that dismissed, for lack of jurisdiction, his appeal regarding his removal as mail handler at the United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d) and denial of his discrimination claim under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (\u201cUSERRA\u201d). <em>Coleman v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>No. DC-3443-04-0656-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Sep. 10, 2004) <em>(\u201cInitial Decision </em>\u201d); <em>Coleman v. U.S. Postal </em>Serv., No. DC-3443-04-0656-I-1, 102 M.S.P.R. 235 (M.S.P.B. Mar. 22, 2006) (\u201cFinal Order\u201d). We have considered Mr. Coleman\u2019s claims and find that the Board lacked jurisdiction over his removal claim, but erred in denying a hearing on his USERRA claim. We therefore affirm the dismissal of the removal claim for lack of jurisdiction. We vacate the Board\u2019s judgment on the USERRA claim and <em>remand </em>for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-20\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b912-21\">In 1996, the petitioner, Michael J. Coleman, applied for employment with the USPS. The application for employment asked Mr. Coleman whether he had \u201cbeen fired from any job for any reason\u201d and whether he had \u201cever quit a job after being notified that [he] would have been fired.\u201d Mr. Coleman answered \u201cno\u201d for both questions and certified that all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>statements in the application were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Mr. Coleman began working at the USPS as a mail handler on May 25, 1996. Several months after Mr. Coleman began work, the USPS discovered that he was fired from his previous job due to \u201ctheft of company funds.\u201d The USPS concluded that Mr. Coleman had provided false answers on his employment application and removed him from service effective February 17, 1997 \u2014 approximately nine months after he started work.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Mr. Coleman grieved the decision under the applicable collective bargaining agreement. The arbitrator who heard Mr. Coleman\u2019s case denied his grievance and found that the USPS had just cause to remove him from employment. Approximately seven years later, Mr. Coleman appealed the removal to the Board. Mr. Coleman argued that the USPS violated USERRA by discriminating against him on the basis of his past military service. In the Initial Decision, the administrative judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) dismissed Mr. Coleman\u2019s removal claim for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Initial Decision </em>at 3. The AJ denied Mr. Coleman\u2019s request for a hearing on his USERRA claim and denied the claim because the \u201cagency would have removed the appellant for valid reasons despite his prior military service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5-6. The Initial Decision became final when the Board declined to review it. <em>Final Order </em>at 1-2. Mr. Coleman now appeals to this court. We have jurisdiction of Mr. Coleman\u2019s removal appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9) and have jurisdiction of Mr. Coleman\u2019s USERRA appeal under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4324(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">On appeal to this court, Mr. Coleman contends that the Board has jurisdiction over his removal and that the Board erred by denying his request for a hearing on his USERRA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">We find that the Board properly dismissed Mr. Coleman\u2019s removal claim for lack of jurisdiction. Whether the Board has jurisdiction to hear a claim is a question of law that this court reviews <em>de novo. Vesser v. Office of Personnel Mgmt., </em>29 F.3d 600, 602 (Fed.Cir.1994). Mr. Coleman must prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Garcia v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>437 F.3d 1322, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2006) (en banc). We have stated that: \u201cThe jurisdiction of the Board is limited to those matters specifically delineated by Congress or granted to it by way of regulatory authority exercised by the OPM.\u201d <em>Saunders v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed.Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">Mr. Coleman alleges that the USPS violated his due process rights by relying on an illegible application form as evidence of his false statement. Also, Mr. Coleman argues that the USPS did not have authority from the OPM to terminate him. None of these allegations establish Board jurisdiction over his removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">USPS employees ordinarily do not fall within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction unless they are \u201cpreference-eligible veterans in the excepted service\u201d and have \u201cone year of continuous service[.]\u201d <em>Zamot v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>332 F.3d 1374, 1375 (Fed.Cir. 2003) (citing 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005(a)(4)(A) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(B)). In this case, there is no dispute that Mr. Coleman is a preference eligible veteran, however, Mr. Coleman lacks one year of continuous service with the USPS. Mr. Coleman worked approximately nine months at the USPS. Therefore, the Board correctly determined that Mr. Coleman did not meet the one year of continuous service requirement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Accordingly, the Board lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Coleman\u2019s removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">We find that the Board erred in denying Mr. Coleman a hearing on his USERRA claim. Our scope of review in an appeal from a Board decision is limited. We must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we determine that it is (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>Yates v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>145 F.3d 1480, 1483 (Fed. Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Mr. Coleman argues the Board\u2019s judgment is not in accordance with the law because veterans who allege a violation of USERRA are entitled to a hearing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a). The USPS argues that a hearing is not required in this case because the AJ gave Mr. Coleman the \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d on any facts he could have established at a hearing. This court has held that a USERRA claim is an appeal for purposes of \u00a7 7701(a) and that the veteran is entitled to a hearing. <em>Kirken-dall v. Dep\u2019t of Army, </em>479 F.3d 830 (Fed. Cir.2007) (en banc). Therefore, the Board\u2019s denial of a hearing was not in accordance with the law. For this reason, we vacate and remand the Board\u2019s judgment on the USERRA claim so that Mr. Coleman can be provided a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the Board properly dismissed Mr. Coleman\u2019s removal claim for lack of jurisdiction. The Board, however, erred by not providing Mr. Coleman a hearing on his USERRA claim. We therefore affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
