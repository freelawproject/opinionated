We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>Arai v. American Bryce Ranches Inc., </em>316 F.3d 1066, 1069-70 (9th Cir.2003), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">DeCaprio claims he did not receive notice of the district court\u2019s entry of judgment because defendants failed to inform the court of DeCaprio\u2019s new address, even though they were aware of it. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reopen on the ground that DeCaprio had an obligation to timely inform the court of his own change of address. <em>See id. </em>at 1070 (noting that \u201cRule 4(a)(6) was adopted to soften the harsh penalty of losing one\u2019s right to an appeal due to the government\u2019s malfeasance in failing to notify a party of a judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">DeCaprio\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b697-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
