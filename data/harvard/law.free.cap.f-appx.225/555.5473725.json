We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Young\u2019s claim that she did not receive notice of her hearing where Young was personally served with a Notice to Appear, advising her of her obligation to file any change of address with the immigration court, she moved to a new address without notifying the immigration court, and the Notice of Hearing was sent to her address of record. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(a) (providing that the applicant is responsible for informing the immigration agency of her current address); <em>see also Farhoud v.
