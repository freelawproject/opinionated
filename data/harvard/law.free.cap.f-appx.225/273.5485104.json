California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Butler has filed a response, in which he raises claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. We conclude that the record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration on direct appeal of Butler\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. Brewster, </em>137 F.3d 853, 859 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-22\">Our independent review of counsel\u2019s brief, Butler\u2019s response, and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
