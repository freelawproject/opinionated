We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-18\">In his tax petition, Metallic claimed he did not have to pay federal income tax because he is a Micmac Indian and a 1776 treaty with his tribe did not require the payment of taxes. In its Memorandum Opinion filed on June 13, 2006, the Tax Court correctly rejected that claim, citing pertinent authorities. It pointed out that Native Americans, like \u201cother U.S. citizens,\u201d are obliged to pay federal income taxes, and that while treaties might exempt them from taxation, the 1776 treaty did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-19\">On appeal, Metallic objects to the Tax Court\u2019s suggestion that he is a United States citizen, alleging that he is a member of a Canadian Micmac tribe. Even if the facts are as he says, no prejudicial error by the Tax Court has been shown. Metallic acknowledges that he resides in this country, and so the tax laws apply to him even if he is not a citizen. <em>See, e.g., </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.1 \u2014 1(a)(1) (noting that the tax code imposes a tax on the income of \u201cevery individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-20\">We have considered Metallic\u2019s remaining claims, but find them meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-21\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
