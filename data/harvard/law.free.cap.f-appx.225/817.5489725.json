Twilley appeals his 30-month sentence for mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, as unreasonable. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-26\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b845-27\">On January 28, 2005, Twilley opened a private mail box in the name of Tri-State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Trucking Services (\u201cTri-State\u201d) at a United Parcel Service (\u201cUPS\u201d) store in Atlanta, Georgia. Approximately three months later, the UPS store contacted the Postal Service and reported that Twilley had sent five mail tubs of letter-size windowed envelopes to businesses throughout the country and had warned that a large number of them would be marked \u201cReturn to Sender.\u201d The UPS store also informed the Postal Service that it had received some telephone calls stating that the letters were a scam.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">On March 18, 2005, a Postal Service inspector arrived at the UPS store and observed approximately 398 pieces of mail addressed to Tri-State, of which at least 79 contained checks made payable to that company. The Postal Service inspector then contacted ten of the companies that had sent checks to Tri-State, and each reported that it had been billed $43.89 for shipping services, despite the fact that it was unable to find any records of service by Tri-State. Significantly, two of the invoices contained the same invoice number.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">On March 21, 2005, the UPS store contacted the Postal Service inspector because approximately thirty checks addressed to Tri-State and fifty pieces of mail marked \u201cReturn to Sender\u201d had arrived. Four days later, March 25, 2005, the Postal Service inspector observed an additional 210 pieces of mail addressed to Tri-State, of which 64 appeared to contain checks, 161 were marked \u201cReturn to Sender,\u201d and the contents of the other 45 could not be determined. The Postal Service inspector spoke to a representative from one of the companies that had written a check to TriState. She advised that the shipping company listed on the invoice admitted having received a number of complaints about Tri-State.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">On March 31, 2005, the Postal Service inspector contacted the shipping company, which stated that it had received approximately fifteen to twenty complaints about Tri-State, and that it had not shipped to the various companies that had been billed in several years. That day, the Postal Service inspector also observed an additional 189 pieces of mail addressed to TriState at the UPS store, of which at least 76 appeared to contain checks. Furthermore, an online search of the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s website revealed that there were no records to establish that Tri-State existed or that Twilley was the registered owner of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Twilley was charged with delivering fraudulently prepared invoices to the Postal Service for mailing. An affidavit from a Postal Service inspector was attached to the criminal complaint. The affidavit stated that Twilley had opened a mail box at a UPS store, sent hundreds of letters to businesses, received checks from some of these businesses, and that the UPS store had received complaints from other businesses that the letters were scams.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">A federal grand jury indicted Twilley on one count of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. Specifically, the indictment charged that Twilley submitted fraudulently prepared invoices for payment from various corporate entities on ten separate occasions in March 2005. Twilley initially pled not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">Subsequently, Twilley unsuccessfully sought to suppress mail seized from a post office box and documents seized from his vehicle, as well as statements that he had made. At the hearing on the motions to suppress, the government presented the testimony of various witnesses whose testimony corroborated the statements made in the postal inspector\u2019s affidavit. After the motions to suppress were denied, Twilley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>pled guilty to the indictment without a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Twilley\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) shows: (1) his base offense level was 7 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 (Nov.2005); (2) an eight-level specific offense characteristic enhancement was warranted under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(E), because the intended loss, calculated at $80,362.59, was more than $70,000 but less than $120,000; and (3) a four-level, specific-offense-characteristic enhancement should be applied pursuant to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B), because the offense involved more than fifty victims. The probation officer additionally recommended another two-level, specific-offense-characteristic enhancement under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8) (C), because a South Dakota Circuit Court had barred Twilley from conducting business in that state for dunning businesses through fraudulent schemes. After recommending a two-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), the probation officer calculated Twilley\u2019s adjusted offense level at 19. The probation officer also recommended ordering restitution in the amount of $6,364.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Regarding Twilley\u2019s criminal history, the PSI shows that he had fourteen prior convictions from 1979 to 1993, including theft by deception, negotiating worthless checks, and attempted failure to redeliver a hired vehicle. Nevertheless, none of these offenses resulted in any criminal history points; consequently, Twilley\u2019s criminal history category was I. With an adjusted offense level of 19 and a criminal history category of I, the Sentencing Guidelines recommend an imprisonment range of 30 to 37 months. The statutory maximum for mail fraud, however, was 20 years of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. The probation officer notes that an upward departure could be warranted under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, on the ground that Twilley\u2019s criminal history category substantially underrepresented the seriousness of his criminal history or the likelihood that he would commit future crimes. The PSI shows that Twilley had had a heart attack and coronary bypass surgery in 1995. Twilley also reported health issues involving diabetes, high blood pressure, and coronary artery disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">Twilley\u2019s counsel objected to his PSI and argued that his Guidelines sentence should be reduced under the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He also maintained that Twil-ley was entitled to a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5H1.4 and 5K2.0(a). Twilley\u2019s counsel, however, did not object to any of the factual findings in the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">At sentencing, defense counsel argued that a reasonable sentence should be below the Guidelines range, given Twilley\u2019s age of 62 and his health issues. Additionally, defense counsel asserted that, while mail fraud was a \u201cserious offense,\u201d Twilley had accepted responsibility for the crime, and the invoices were \u201cof a very small amount, ... $44 on the average.\u201d R3 at 13, 14. Further, defense counsel argued that the expected loss was even less than the intended loss, because \u201cthe return on [a fraudulent collection] attempt ... range[d] anywhere from 5 to 10 percent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. Defense counsel maintained that the nature of the offense, Twilley\u2019s intent in committing the offense, and the amount of loss \u201creally overrepresent[ed]\u201d the seriousness of the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">Twilley also addressed the district judge. He explained that he had \u201cturned [his] life around\u201d over ten years ago and that \u201c95 percent\u201d of the worthless checks that he had written in the past were \u201cfor groceries to feed [his] family.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. Twilley stated that he had \u201clearned [his] lesson from that\u201d and was \u201csorry\u201d for committing the underlying crime. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>The district judge consulted the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before imposing Twilley\u2019s sentence. Noting that \u201cone of the first things [he] need[ed] to do [was] to understand the nature and circumstances of the offense,\u201d the judge explained that the invoices were \u201cphoney,\u201d the invoice numbers were \u201cbogus,\u201d and there was \u201csome evidence of tracking going on to look like it\u2019s a real invoice and real factors were being considered in carefully arriving at this $43.89.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22-23. The judge then stated that, although Twilley\u2019s criminal history went \u201cback in time,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 23, his \u201cextensive criminal record ... got[ ] him absolutely no points,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2. Consequently, the court believed that Twilley\u2019s criminal history score \u201cunderrepresent[ed] his actual criminal history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. Further, the district judge observed that the Guidelines \u201cunderrepresented the seriousness of property crimes and have not adequately protected respect for the law in these kinds of property crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23-24. Moreover, the judge determined that Twilley\u2019s crime was a \u201cpernicious crime that increases the transaction cost to American business[es] ... trying to provide goods and services, to the citizens of this country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24. The judge also noted that the Guidelines ranges \u201cprevented] unwarranted disparity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The district judge then addressed Twil-ley\u2019s arguments for a sentence below the Guidelines range. Noting that age and health were factors that could be considered, the judge nevertheless found that these factors were not sufficient to warrant a variance from the Guidelines range in this case. <em>Id. </em>at 24-25. The judge noted that he had undergone bypass heart surgery within the last two years and that the magistrate judge was able to work every day with diabetes and heart problems. <em>Id. </em>at 24. The judge imposed a 30-month sentence, which was at \u201cthe bottom of the guidelines\u201d range, because Twilley had been \u201cmore or less straightforward ... from the beginning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25. He also ordered restitution in the amount of $6,364.05. Defense counsel objected to the reasonableness of the sentence, and Twil-ley has appealed on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">On appeal, Twilley argues that his 30-month is unreasonable under \u00a7 3553(a), because of his age and serious medical conditions for which he had been prescribed nine different medications, and \u201cin consideration of the nature and circumstances of the offense which involved a substantially] lesser expected loss in contrast to the intended loss determined under the guidelines.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 6. Twilley also contends that, in <em>United States v. Gray, </em>453 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam), we affirmed under \u00a7 3553(a)(1) a downward variance of 72 months as reasonable, because of the defendant\u2019s \u201cage, his prior minimal criminal record, and his medical condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1325. Additionally, Twilley cites <em>United States v. Ryder, </em>414 F.3d 908 (8th Cir. 2005), a <em>pre-Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decision, where the Eighth Circuit recognized that a district judge has statutory authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) and \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D) to consider age and medical condition and to sentence under the Guidelines without considering a downward departure. <em>Id. </em>at 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">We review <em>post-Booker </em>sentences for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). The \u201creasonableness\u201d of a sentence is reviewed under the factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a), which include: \u201c(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">When a district judge considers the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, he or she is not required to discuss each factor on the record. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]here is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d and the burden of demonstrating unreasonableness rests with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 788. \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court[,]\u201d and \u201c[w]e will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.), <em>pet. for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Oct. 19, 2006) (No. 06-7352).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Although a sentence within the Guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, we expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Additionally, in reviewing a sentence, \u201c[w]e do not apply the reasonableness standard to each individual decision made during the sentencing process; rather, we review the final sentence for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">Twilley\u2019s 30-month sentence was reasonable. The district judge stated that he had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in arriving at the sentence; he was not required to discuss each factor on the record. Moreover, the judge entertained Twilley\u2019s argument for a downward departure, but he ultimately concluded that factors other than his age and physical concerns should be afforded greater weight. Specifically, the judge focused on the nature, circumstances, and seriousness of Twilley\u2019s crime; his criminal history and the need for deterrence; the goal of providing a just punishment; and the objective of avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities. The judge additionally explained his reasons for imposing a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range, rather than below that range, notwithstanding Twilley\u2019s age and health issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">The reasonableness of a sentence is dictated by the facts of a particular case, in view of the factors delineated in \u00a7 3553(a). While a variance may have been warranted in <em>Gray </em>and <em>Ryder </em>because of the defendants\u2019 ages and health issues, that does not signify that a refusal to grant a variance in this case based on these same two factors rendered Twilley\u2019s 30-month sentence unreasonable. Importantly, Twilley\u2019s sentence was significantly lower than the 240-month statutory maximum for his crime. Absent any other extenuating circumstances, Twilley\u2019s sentence was reasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">Twilley has appealed his 30-month sentence for mail fraud for being unreasonable, because of his age and medical issues. For the reasons we have explained, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>sentence was not unreasonable. Accordingly, Twilley\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-5\">. <em>United States v.
