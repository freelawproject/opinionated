At sentencing, the district court considered, <em>inter alia, </em>Carson\u2019s criminal history, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the length and nature of the separate state sentence, the goals of federal sentencing, and Carson\u2019s family background. Because the district court referred with case-speeif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>ic detail to several factors listed in the Commentary to \u00a7 5G1.3 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), its explanation was sufficient. <em>See United States v. Fifield, </em>432 F.3d 1056, 1063-66 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">To the extent that Carson argues that the district court departed upward from the Guidelines range, and thus was required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) to explain the reasons for its departure, his argument is meritless. Indeed, Carson\u2019s federal sentence was at the low point of the Guidelines range. The fact that his state and federal sentences, when combined, exceed the Guidelines range does not mean that the district court departed upward.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b669-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
