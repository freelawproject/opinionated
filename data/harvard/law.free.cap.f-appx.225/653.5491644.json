Because it is unclear whether the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) adopted the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision, we \u201clook to the IJ\u2019s oral decision as a guide to what lay behind the BIA\u2019s conclusion,\u201d and review these determinations for substantial evidence. <em>Avetova-Elisseva v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1192, 1197 (9th Cir.2000). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-18\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal. The record contains insufficient evidence to compel the conclusion that the police who detained and beat Singh on two occasions were motivated on account of an imputed political opinion. <em>See Dinu v. Ashcroft, </em>372 F.3d 1041, 1044 (9th Cir. 2004); <em>cf. Singh v. Ilchert, </em>63 F.3d 1501, 1509 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cThe very language of the BIA\u2019s opinion ... concedes that petitioner was \u2018thought\u2019 by the police to be associated with Sikhs seeking a violent overthrow of the government.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-19\">Further, Singh failed to show it was more likely than not that he would be tortured should he return to India, and thus he is not eligible for CAT relief. <em>See Zhang v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 713, 721-22 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-20\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b682-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
