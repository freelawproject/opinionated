On appeal, Alexander alleges that his sentence was erroneous. Because we find that Alexander\u2019s sentence is not plainly unreasonable, <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006) (stating review standard), we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
