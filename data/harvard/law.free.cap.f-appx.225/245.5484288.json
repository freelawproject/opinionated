Torres, </em>202 Fed.Appx. 883 (5th Cir.2006). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded the case for reconsideration in the light of <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 625,166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). <em>Ochoar-Perez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1263, 167 L.Ed.2d 66 (2007). Following the Supreme Court\u2019s remand, we requested and received supplemental letter briefs from both parties with respect to the impact of <em>Lopez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-26\">The Government concedes, and we agree that, in the light of <em>Lopez, </em>the district court erred by enhancing Torres\u2019s sentence on the basis of his Texas convictions for possession of methamphetamine and for possession of heroin. Torres remains in custody in federal prison, with a projected release date of June 4, 2007. Accordingly, the appeal is not moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-27\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Torres\u2019s conviction, VACATE his sentence, and REMAND for resentencing in accordance with <em>Lopez.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
