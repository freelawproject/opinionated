He also appeals from a subsequent district court order that denied relief on various post-judgment motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-18\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S. Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-22\">The order Dunlap seeks to appeal, which dismissed his \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely, was entered on the docket on March 14, 2006. The notice of appeal was filed on November 20, 2006. Because Dunlap failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal of the March 14, 2006 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-23\">With regard to the appeal of an October 13, 2006 order, which denied relief on several post-judgment motions, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm as to that order for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Dunlap, </em>No. 4:06-cv-00112-RBS (E.D.Va. October 13, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-24\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-25\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
