Bush appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Although AEDPA ordinarily requires deference to state court decisions, we review Bush\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claim de novo because the California Court of Appeal applied the more stringent standard of <em>People v. Wheeler, </em>22 Cal.3d 258, 280, 148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748 (1978), rather than the \u201creasonable inference\u201d test of <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 96, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). <em>See Williams v. Runnels, </em>432 F.3d 1102, 1105 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">To support a <em>Batson </em>challenge, the defendant must establish \u201ca prima facie case \u2018by showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. California, </em>545 U.S. 162, 168, 125 S.Ct. 2410, 162 L.Ed.2d 129 (2005) (quoting <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 93-94, 106 S.Ct. 1712). \u201c[A] wide variety of evidence\u201d may support an inference of discrimination, and the court considers all relevant facts and circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 169, 125 S.Ct. 2410. The fact that the excused juror \u201c \u2018was the one Black member of the venire does not, in itself, raise an inference of discrimination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wade v. Terhune, </em>202 F.3d 1190, 1198 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Vasquez-Lopez, </em>22 F.3d 900, 902 (9th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">The state court correctly concluded that Bush failed to make a prima facie showing of purposeful discrimination. The African-American member of the venire who was struck by the prosecution was not similarly situated to non-African-American jurors who remained on the panel. <em>See United States v. Esparza-Gonzalez, </em>422 F.3d 897, 905 (9th Cir.2005) (in prima facie inquiry, it is \u201crelevant for the court to consider the differing treatment of similarly situated potential jurors\u201d); <em>Wade, </em>202 F.3d at 1198 (district court appropriately considered whether evidence supported petitioner\u2019s argument that similarly situated jurors were not stricken). The record does not indicate an inference of bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">As to the uncertified issue, we conclude that Bush has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Cooper-Smith v. Palmateer, </em>397 F.3d 1236, 1245 (9th Cir.2005). We deny Bush\u2019s motion to expand the Certificate of Appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b628-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
