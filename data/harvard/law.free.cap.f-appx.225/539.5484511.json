R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b567-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-22\">Mafua Heuaha Vailolo, a native and citizen of Tonga, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order denying his application for lawful permanent resident cancellation of removal. We dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-23\">The agency denied Vailolo\u2019s cancellation of removal application in the exercise of discretion. We lack jurisdiction to review this determination. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir. 2003) (\u201cWe [have] interpreted [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae] to encompass all discretionary decisions involved in the cancellation of removal context, including the ultimate discretionary decision to deny relief.\u201d); <em>see also Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-24\">We also conclude that Vailolo has failed to \u201callege at least a colorable constitutional violation\u201d over which we could exercise jurisdiction. <em>See Martinez-Rosas, </em>424 F.3d at 930 (\u201cMartinez-Rosas\u2019 claim that the IJ denied her right to due process by misapplying the facts of her case to the applicable law does not meet this requirement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-25\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review Vailolo\u2019s contention that the IJ\u2019s decision was impermissible boilerplate. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 604 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201cAs we have already determined that we are without jurisdiction to review the [agency\u2019s] conclusion on the merits, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>concerns ... about our ability to review inadequately reasoned or cursory [agency] decisions when jurisdiction <em>is </em>present do not apply.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b567-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
