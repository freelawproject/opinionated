McKelver filed neither a direct appeal nor a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion, and he filed his Rule 60(b) motion more than three years after the district court entered judgment on his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Although \u201cthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not specifically provide for motions for reconsideration and prescribe the time in which they must be filed,\u201d <em>Nilson Van &amp; Storage Co. v. Marsh, </em>755 F.2d 362, 364 (4th Cir.1985), a motion for rehearing or reconsideration in a criminal case extends the time for filing a notice of appeal if the motion is filed before the order sought to be reconsidered becomes final. <em>See United, States v. Ibarra, </em>502 U.S. 1, 4 n. 2, 112 S.Ct. 4, 116 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991) (holding would-be appellant who files timely motion for reconsideration from criminal judgment entitled to full time period for noticing appeal after motion for reconsideration has been decided); <em>United States v. Dieter, </em>429 U.S. 6, 7-8, 97 S.Ct. 18, 50 L.Ed.2d 8 (1976) (same); <em>see also United States v. Christy, </em>3 F.3d 765, 767 n. 1 (4th Cir.1993) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">McKelver submitted his Rule 60(b) motion well beyond the applicable period of time provided to notice an appeal of the judgment he sought the district court to reconsider. Accordingly, because McKel-ver\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was untimely, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying the motion. <em>See United States v. McKel-ver, </em>No. 5:03-cr-00262-PMD (D.S.C. Oct. 11, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
