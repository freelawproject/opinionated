We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, <em>Iturri-barria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-24\">The record reflects that the BIA\u2019s decision of December 9, 2002, informed petitioners of their prior counsel\u2019s suspension from the practice of law, yet petitioners did not file their motion to reopen until January 24, 2005. The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen as untimely because petitioners failed to show they were entitled to equitable tolling. <em>See id. </em>at 897 (equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>tolling applies \u201cwhen a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering\u201d the misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b592-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
