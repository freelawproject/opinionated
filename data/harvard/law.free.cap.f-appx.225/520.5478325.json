We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the agency\u2019s physical presence determination for substantial evidence, <em>Lopez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 847, 850-51 (9th Cir.2004), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">To demonstrate physical presence for the statutory period, Tepepa needed to prove his continuous presence beginning in 1990. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(l) (ten years). Tepepa testified that he worked at an auto body shop for approximately one year shortly after his first entry to the United States in 1989, yet the documentation he submitted indicated that he worked there from 1993-1994. Similarly, Tepepa\u2019s presence witness testified that he began residing with Tepepa on Eighth Avenue in Redwood City around 1991 or 1992, yet the declaration of this same witness stated that he and Tepepa began residing together in 1989. Moreover, Tepepa\u2019s written application states that he began residing on Eighth Avenue in 1993. The IJ cogently explained her finding that Tepepa did not meet his burden of establishing the requisite presence based on these and other inconsistencies within the record. Substantial evidence therefore supports the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A); <em>Lopez-Alvarado, </em>381 F.3d at 851-52 (requiring IJ to provide a \u201cspecific, cogent reason\u201d for rejecting testimony and clarifying that \u201cthe issue is not whether the IJ made a proper credibility finding, but rather whether the IJ correctly found the testimony insufficient to establish the prerequisite continuous presence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b549-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
