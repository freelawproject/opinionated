As the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, <em>see Hoque v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1190, 1194 (9th Cir. 2004), we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were that of the BIA, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Miranda-Zapata was not persecuted on account of an imputed political opinion. <em>See Alonzo v. INS, </em>915 F.2d 546, 548 (9th Cir.1990). Likewise, the IJ properly concluded that Miranda-Zapata\u2019s fear of retaliation for quitting his job as a civilian contractor to the Nicaraguan army and because his uncle was a low-ranking military officer under a former regime was not objectively reasonable. <em>See Abedini v. INS, </em>971 F.2d 188, 191-92 (9th Cir.1992); <em>see also Castillo v. INS, </em>951 F.2d 1117, 1122-23 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">We construe Miranda-Zapata\u2019s contentions relating to the BIA\u2019s summary affir-mance of the IJ\u2019s opinion as a due process challenge, and reject them. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 851 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b666-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
