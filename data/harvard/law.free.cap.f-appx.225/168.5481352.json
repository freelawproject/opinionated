Kirkland appeals his sentence, contending that the district court erred when it held that he had two prior convictions for controlled substance offenses and applied a base offense level of 24 under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) (2005). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">The enhanced base offense level applies if the defendant had two prior felony convictions for controlled substance offenses as defined in USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(b), which includes \u201cthe possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d After examining the charging documents and the judgment in each case, the district court determined that Kirkland had two prior convictions for possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine in violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90-95(a) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">Although Kirkland argues on appeal that the convictions were for simple possession, or that the charging documents did not establish the offense of conviction with enough specificity, or that the offenses should have been treated as misdemeanors because the quantity of cocaine was small, the record supports the district court\u2019s determination. Moreover, the court complied with the dictates of <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), in making its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
