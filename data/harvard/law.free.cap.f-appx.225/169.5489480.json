Over Dixon\u2019s objection, the district court applied a cross reference from <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(c) (2005) to USSG \u00a7 2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault). Then, finding that criminal history category III did not adequately represent Dixon\u2019s prior criminal conduct,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> USSG \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s., the district court departed upward to category IV and imposed a sentence of 115 months imprisonment. Dixon contends on appeal that the sentence is unconstitutional because he was sentenced under a de facto mandatory guideline system. In consequence, he contends, the district court\u2019s factual findings concerning the offense level and upward departure rendered the sentence unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Because Dixon did not raise this issue in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). In sentencing a defendant after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court must calculate the advisory guideline range and then consider whether that range \u201cserves the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.A.] \u00a7 3553(a) [West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006] and, if not, select a sentence that does serve those factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). This court reviews a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence \u201cto determine whether the sentence is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-15\">\u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). However, \u201ca defendant can only rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439). A sentence outside the guideline range is not presumptively unreasonable. <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457. However, the further the sentencing court diverges from the guidelines, the more compelling the reasons for the divergence must be. <em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-18\">In light of our precedents, we find no merit in Dixon\u2019s claim that our standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>review renders the guidelines per se mandatory, or that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court made factual findings in determining the advisory guideline range and deciding to depart. We further conclude that the court acted reasonably in departing upward to category IV. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Villanueva, </em>473 F.3d 118, 123 (4th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b198-10\"> Dixon received no criminal history points for a 2003 incident in which he shot at police officers who were called to a party where a friend of his was injured. Although charges were filed, Dixon was released on bond and temporarily left the state. The pending charges were dismissed when Dixon was charged with the instant offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
