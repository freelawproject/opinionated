The district court sentenced him to a mandatory term of life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2006), based upon Mayfield\u2019s two prior South Carolina convictions for possession of cocaine and possession of crack cocaine. Mayfield\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the adequacy of the plea colloquy and the reasonableness of the sentence but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Mayfield has filed a pro se supplemental brief.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Counsel raises as a potential issue the adequacy of the plea colloquy conducted pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, but does not specify any deficiencies in the district court\u2019s Rule 11 inquiries. Because May-field did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, any error in the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (discussing standard of review). Our careful review of the record convinces us that the district court fully complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Mayfield\u2019s guilty plea and ensured that Mayfield entered his plea knowingly and voluntarily and that the plea was supported by an independent factual basis. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Counsel also questions whether the district court erred by imposing a mandatory term of life imprisonment under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Because Mayfield did not object in the district court on this ground, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547-48, 555 (4th Cir.2005) (discussing standard). We find no error in the district court\u2019s imposition of the mandatory life sentence. <em>See United States v. Burgess, </em>478 F.3d 658, 660-62 (4th Cir.2007) (holding that, for purposes of applying enhanced penalty in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), felony drug offense includes any crime punishable by more than one year of imprisonment, regardless of whether it is classified as a felony or a misdemeanor).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Mayfield\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b228-6\"> To the extent Mayfield suggests that counsel provided ineffective assistance, we decline to review that claim on direct appeal. See <em>United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.) (providing standard), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1407, 164 L.Ed.2d 107 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
