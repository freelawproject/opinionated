On appeal, Dixon argues that the defendants violated his Eighth Amendment rights by placing him in a stripped \u201csuicide cell\u201d for two days and requiring him to wear only a paper gown, placing him in an observation cell with inmates infected with both HIV and Hepatitis-C, and keeping him in restraints for 17.5 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-14\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Cash v. Smith, </em>231 F.3d 1301, 1304 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cSummary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1305 (quotations and citation omitted). We must view the facts in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See id. </em>Arguments not raised on appeal are deemed abandoned. <em>See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-15\">The Eighth Amendment, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, forbids cruel and unusual punishments. U.S. CONST, amend. VHI; <em>Chandler v. Crosby, </em>379 F.3d 1278, 1289 n. 20 (11th Cir.2004). The amendment governs \u201cthe treatment a prisoner receives in prison and the conditions under which he is confined.\u201d <em>Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1242 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cHowever, not every governmental action affecting the interests or well-being of a prisoner is subject to Eighth Amendment scrutiny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>tion and citation omitted). \u201c[T]he Eighth Amendment imposes a narrow restriction-\u2018cruel and unusual\u2019-on only a limited sphere of prison administrative eonduct-\u2018punishment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller v. King, </em>384 F.3d 1248, 1274 (11th Cir.2004), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>449 F.3d 1149 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The Prisoner Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-6\">[n]o Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e). Though \u00a7 1997e(e) does not define physical injury, we have held that, in order to satisfy the statute, \u201cthe physical injury must be more than de minimis, but need not be significant.\u201d <em>Harris v. Garner, </em>190 F.3d 1279, 1286 (11th Cir.1999), <em>op. reinstated in part on reh\u2019g, </em>216 F.3d 970 (2000) (finding that a \u201cdry shave\u201d was not the kind of physical injury cognizable under 1997e(e)); <em>see also Nolin v. Isbell, </em>207 F.3d 1253, 1258 n. 4 (11th Cir.2000) (bruises received during an arrest were non-actionable <em>de minimis </em>injury) (Fourth Amendment excessive force claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that Dixon\u2019s claims for compensatory damages did not surmount \u00a7 1997e\u2019s bar because he failed to put forth evidence of physical injury besides discomfort. Dixon asserted that sleeping on a concrete platform aggravated preexisting injuries and exposure to Inmate Jeff Sanders resulted in his contracting Hepatitis-C. However, he did not put forth any evidence that his injuries had worsened or that he contracted Hepatitis-C. Dixon averred that his time in restraints resulted in welts; however, mere bruising from the application of restraints is only a <em>de minimis </em>injury. Thus, Dixon\u2019s claims for compensatory damages fail. The district court found that Dixon\u2019s injunctive relief claims were moot, and Dixon abandoned any challenge to that finding by not arguing the point here. Moreover, our review of the complaint reveals that Dixon sought no other specific forms of injunctive relief. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
