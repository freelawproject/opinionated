Gantt appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing with prejudice his amended complaint filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (2000), for failure to comply with the court\u2019s prior order directing him to file a complaint setting forth his claims in a short and plain statement, as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a), and warning him of the consequences of failing to comply. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Gantt failed to comply with Rule 8. <em>See Ciralsky v. CIA </em>355 F.3d 661, 668-69 (D.C.Cir.2004) (stating standard of review). We find, however, that the district court\u2019s dismissal of Gantt\u2019s complaint with prejudice was a harsh remedy. Such dismissals undermine \u201cthe sound public policy of deciding cases on their merits.\u201d <em>Davis v. Williams, </em>588 F.2d 69, 70 (4th Cir.1978). Thus, we modify the district court\u2019s dismissal to be without prejudice to Gantt\u2019s right to refile a complaint that satisfies Rule 8 and affirm the district court\u2019s order as modified. <em>Gantt v. Sutton, </em>No. 5:06-ct-03039-D (E.D.N.C. Oct. 2, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
