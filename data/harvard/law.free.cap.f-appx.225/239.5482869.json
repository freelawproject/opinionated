Specifically, Guerrero challenges the district court\u2019s order that the sentence be imposed consecutively to an anticipated sentence on a pending drug charge in Hays County, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-22\">Because the argument is raised for the first time on appeal, it is reviewed for plain error only. Guerrero must show that there was a clear or obvious error which affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-23\">The district court had the authority to impose Guerrero\u2019s sentence consecutively to a future state-court sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1217 (5th Cir.1991); <em>see also United States v. Hernandez, </em>234 F.3d 252, 256 (5th Cir.2000). Guerrero\u2019s complaint that he was not given notice of the district court\u2019s intention to impose his sentence consecutively to a future state sentence is unavailing as no such notice was required. <em>See Hernandez, </em>234 F.3d at 256. His assertion that the district court\u2019s imposition of a consecutive sentence violates the principles of comity is similarly unavailing. <em>See Leal v. Tombone, </em>341 F.3d 427, 429 <em>&amp; </em>n. 13 (5th Cir.2003). Although Guerrero argues that the imposition of a consecutive sentence is error because the instant case is factually unrelated to the state-court charge, he provides no authority for his contention that the two charges must be related before a consecutive sentence may be imposed. The statute does not require relatedness. \u00a7 3584(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-24\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
