To the extent we have jurisdiction it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings, <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001), and we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review Gonzalez-Estrada\u2019s contentions regarding the agency\u2019s adverse credibility and continuous physical presence findings because he failed to raise those issues before the BIA and thereby failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining that this court lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not raised before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">We do not consider Gonzalez-Estrada\u2019s contentions regarding hardship and good moral character because the record indicates that the agency did not reach those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Gonzalez-Estrada\u2019s equal protection challenge to the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Jimenez-Angeles v.
