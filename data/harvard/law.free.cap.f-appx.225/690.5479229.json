We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Congress largely eliminated our jurisdiction to review a final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (aggravated felonies). If the petitioner has committed an aggravated felony, we nevertheless retain jurisdiction over \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law\u201d raised in the petition for review. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Scully argues that her conviction did not constitute an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), because that section describes a criminal offense that \u201cinvolves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000\u201d. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i). Scully pleaded guilty to visa fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546 and conspiracy to commit visa fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. She admits the convictions, but argues they nevertheless did not fall under section 1101(a)(43)(M)(i). We review de novo whether a particular conviction constitutes an aggravated felony. <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 892, 895 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">\u201cTo determine whether an offense qualifies as an aggravated felony, we begin by conducting a facial review of the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>Ruiz-Morales v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1219, 1221 (9th Cir.2004). First, we \u201cmake a categorical comparison of the elements of the statute of conviction to the generic definition, and decide whether the conduct proscribed by the statute of conviction is broader than, and so does not categorically fall within, this generic definition.\u201d <em>Lara-Chacon v. Ashcroft, </em>345 F.3d 1148, 1151 (9th Cir.2003). In cases where the state statute is broader than the definition of an aggravated felony, \u201cwe conduct a limited examination of documents in the record to determine if there is sufficient evidence to conclude that a defendant was convicted of the elements of the generieally defined crime even though his or her statute was facially overinclusive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1152 (quotation &amp; citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">Applying this analysis, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1546 and 371 are not categorical matches for the aggravated felony described in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) since they do not contain an element for the minimum amount of loss to the victim or victims. <em>Cf. </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) (\u201cfraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000\u201d). Thus, we examine whether there was sufficient evidence to conclude that Scully committed an offense involving fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000. Scully admitted that her prior visa conviction involved fraud or deceit. The remaining issue is whether the loss to the victim or victims exceeded $10,000. Scully was ordered to pay $271,204 in restitution to her victims. We have stated that \u201c[i]n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>criminal cases, restitution may compensate victims only for actual losses caused by the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. De La Fuente, </em>358 F.3d 766, 771 (9th Cir.2003) (quotation &amp; citation omitted). Further, a \u201cvictim is a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation &amp; citation omitted). Thus, the district court necessarily concluded that Scully\u2019s fraudulent scheme resulted in a loss greater than $10,000 to her victims. We hold against her contention that her conviction does not fall under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Scully also argues that the Board erred in classifying her aggravated felony because the proper category for her aggravated felony was section 1101(a)(43)(P), and not section 1101(a)(43)(M). But Scully cites no authority that required the government to charge her under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(P) rather than \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M). Further, in <em>Larar-Cha-con, </em>we rejected a similar argument. 345 F.3d at 1154 n. 9. The petitioner in that case unsuccessfully argued that his Arizona conviction for money laundering should be construed under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(D), which specifically required that the amount in question exceed $10,000, instead of as another category of aggravated felony that did not contain the $10,000 requirement. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, we reject Scully\u2019s contention that the government was required to charge Scully under the aggravated felony definition under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(P).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Finally, Scully asserts an alleged due process challenge. She argues that her right to a full and fair hearing was violated when the IJ refused to conduct an evidentiary hearing into the circumstances of the underlying criminal conviction. She complains that she was not allowed to present evidence that the attorneys and judge intended to craft a sentence that would avoid exposing her to deportation under INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(P).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Scully has not demonstrated a due process violation. The right to a full and fair hearing does not include the right to present irrelevant evidence. Scully presents no authority or reasoned argument in support of her implicit assumption that the immigration authorities are somehow bound by the intent of a criminal judge and lawyers. Thus, it did not violate due process to prevent Scully from presenting evidence that the actors at her criminal proceeding did not intend for her to be deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">Petition denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b720-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
