We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-22\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Nishan\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because he filed it more than four years after the BIA\u2019s November 8, 2001 order and failed to demonstrate that he qualified for any exception to the ninety-day time limit. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Nishan did not provide sufficient evidence that conditions in Etho-pia have changed so that he now has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004) (stating that the critical question is \u201cwhether circumstances have changed, sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-23\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to invoke its sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153,1159 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b541-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
