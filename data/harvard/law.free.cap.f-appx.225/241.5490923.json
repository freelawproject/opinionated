The court probably erred if it was trying to apply U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b); it overlooked U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c); and we cannot discern the legal basis for its deferring the decision whether to award credit for the ongoing state imprisonment. We need not further analyze these issues, however, because Perez was recently sentenced on a guilty plea to serve a lengthy state imprisonment on the underlying state offenses. We therefore VACATE and REMAND the sentence with instructions to the district court to exercise its discretion, pursuant to the Guidelines and <em>Booker, </em>in light of the foregoing development, and to articulate the reasons for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-22\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
