On appeal, Mitchel claims the district court violated his plea agreement by correcting an error in the calculation of his guidelines range and sentencing him to a sentence higher than the one anticipated by his plea agreement. The Government asserts the appeal should be dismissed because Mitchel knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence. Because we find the appeal waiver is valid and that the issue raised by Mitchel is within the scope of the waiver, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">Mitchel\u2019s plea agreement contained an appellate waiver that stated he knowingly waived the right to appeal \u201cany sentence within the advisory guidelines range of punishment calculated by the district court.\u201d The record reveals, and Mitchel does not contest, that Mitchel agreed to this waiver knowingly and voluntarily. <em>See United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168- 69 (4th Cir.2005). Moreover, Mitchel does not dispute that the sentence he received was within a properly calculated guidelines range, thereby falling within the purview of his appellate waiver. <em>See id. </em>at 169- 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">Accordingly, we dismiss Mitchel\u2019s appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-15\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
