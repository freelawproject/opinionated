He argues that he received two criminal history points based on the district court\u2019s erroneous finding that he was on probation for traffic offenses at the time that he committed the instant offense. He argues that but for those two points, he would have been eligible for a two-level \u201csafety valve\u201d decrease pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(7), which would have resulted in a lesser sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In rejecting Grimsley\u2019s argument, the district court relied on the state court judgment and probation violator\u2019s warrant for three separate case numbers, all of which involved Grimsley\u2019s convictions of violations of various traffic laws. The judgment set forth one sentence for all three case numbers, multiple fines that correlated with the respective case numbers, and one outstanding amount owed on those fines. Although the probation violator\u2019s warrant bore the number of a case that was not scored in the criminal history section of the presentence report, the warrant included a list of the offenses charged in the case that was scored as well as a notation of the outstanding fine owed on all three cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The documents relied on by the district court had sufficient indicia of reliability to support their probable accuracy. <em>See United States v. Angeles-Mendoza, </em>407 F.3d 742, 749-50 (5th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s finding that the warrant related to all three cases was plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>Id. </em>at 750. Grimsley has not shown that the district court\u2019s factual findings and inferences therefrom were clearly erroneous. <em>See Angeles-Mendoza, </em>407 F.3d at 750; <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
