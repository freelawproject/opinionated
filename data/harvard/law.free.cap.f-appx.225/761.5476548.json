Browner\u2019s plea agreement included an appeal waiver, with certain exceptions. Browner has filed a notice of appeal challenging the sentence he received on remand from a prior appeal, and the government has moved to enforce Browner\u2019s appeal waiver under <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315 (10th Cir. 2004) (en banc). We grant the motion and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Browner agreed to waive his right to appeal his guilty plea and any other aspect of his conviction, or to appeal \u201chis sentence as imposed by the Court and the manner in which the sentence is determined, provided the sentence is within or below the applicable guideline range determined by the Court to apply to this case,\u201d except the appeal waiver does \u201cnot apply to appeals or challenges based on changes in the law reflected in Tenth Circuit or Supreme Court cases decided after the date of this agreement that are held by the Tenth Circuit or Supreme Court to have retroactive effect.\u201d Motion to Enforce, Ex. 2 (Plea Agreement) at 7. The district court initially imposed a life sentence, rejecting Browner\u2019s argument that the mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines to impose that sentence was potentially inconsistent with <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Browner appealed, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel and sentencing error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), decided after the date of Browner\u2019s guilty plea and sentencing. <em>Booker </em>held that the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines were unconstitutional, and rendered the Guidelines advisory. <em>Id. </em>at 245-46, 125 S.Ct. 738. The government filed a motion to enforce the appeal waiver, but later withdrew its motion to enforce the appeal waiver with respect to the <em>Booker </em>error. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>413 F.3d 1146, 1151-53 (10th Cir.2005) (holding that a <em>Booker </em>claim does fall within a \u201cchange in law\u201d exception to an appeal waiver). On appeal, this court dismissed Browner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim (because such a claim can only be raised in a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255), and remanded the case to the district court for resentencing because its mandatory application of the Guidelines to impose a life sentence constituted non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error. <em>United States v. Browner, </em>211 Fed.Appx. 781, 784-85 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">On remand, the district court sentenced Browner to thirty-five years\u2019 imprisonment, which is below the statutory maximum and the advisory Sentencing Guideline range of life imprisonment. Browner has now filed a notice of appeal from that sentence, stating in his docketing statement that he was \u201cdenied his rights under the Sixth Amendment at his resentencing.\u201d Docketing Statement at 4. As noted, the government has filed a motion to enforce the appeal waiver. Under <em>Hahn, </em>we will enforce an appeal waiver if (1) \u201cthe disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights\u201d; (2) \u201cthe defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights\u201d; and (3) \u201cenforcing the waiver would [not] result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Browner contends his appeal is not within the scope of the appeal waiver because he was resentenced based on a change in Tenth Circuit and Supreme Court law, namely <em>Booker. </em>He argues that because he did not waive his right to appeal challenges based on changes in Tenth Circuit or Supreme Court law, and because his resentence resulted from a successful challenge based on a change-in-law <em>Booker </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>claim, it follows that his appeal from that resentence must fall within the ehange-in-the-law exception to his appeal waiver. We disagree. The exception to Browner\u2019s appeal waiver applies only to \u201cappeals or challenges based on changes in the law reflected in Tenth Circuit or Supreme Court cases decided after the date of this agreement.\u201d Plea Agreement at 7. The claims that Browner seeks to raise on appeal are that there was a sentencing disparity error and that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated at his resentencing. These claims do not, on their face, fall within this exception because neither are based on any post-plea change in the law. In response to the government\u2019s motion to enforce the appeal waiver, Browner has not articulated any more specific appellate challenge that comes within the change-in-the-law exception. Thus, we conclude that Browner\u2019s proposed appeal falls within the scope of the appeal waiver, not its exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Browner also contends that enforcing the appeal waiver would be a miscarriage of justice, claiming that there is a sentencing error that seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. Browner does not allege that the waiver itself is unlawful, but questions an alleged sentencing disparity between a similarly situated codefendant. This is precisely the type of attack we sought to foreclose in <em>Hahn </em>and, therefore, we find no miscarriage of justice. <em>United States v. Sandoval, </em>477 F.3d 1204, 1208 (10th Cir.2007) (reiterating prior holdings that sentencing objections do not establish that enforcement of the appeal waiver would be unlawful, which is the focus of the miscarriage-of-justice inquiry).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">The government\u2019s motion is GRANTED and the appeal is dismissed. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b789-25\"> This panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
