The fact that confusion or conflicting decisions by fiduciaries <em>might </em>result from the plan\u2019s language under a different set of facts is irrelevant here. No such confusion has resulted under these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-23\">We vacate and remand the remainder of the district court\u2019s decision in light of <em>Aba-tie v. Alta Health &amp; Life Insurance Com</em>pany.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the district court issued its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>decision, this Circuit fundamentally changed the manner in which courts review a decision by a fiduciary with a conflict of interest. <em>Abatie </em>held that a district court, even when reviewing for abuse of discretion, must nonetheless consider a defendant\u2019s conflict of interest. The greater the conflict, the greater the \u201clevel of skepticism\u201d a court must apply.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Relevant to this inquiry are, among other things, the degree of an insurer\u2019s conflict and any failures to comply with procedural requirements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Both factors appear to be relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">From the existing record, it appears that MetLife has a structural conflict of interest; that is, it both funds the plan and determines whether to pay benefits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, Volynskaya argues that MetLife violated several procedural requirements. For example, MetLife was required to inform Volynskaya \u201cof any additional material or information necessary ... to perfect [her] claim and an explanation of why such material or information [wa]s necessary.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> MetLife may not have done so. MetLife now complains that Volynskaya never submitted to objective diagnostic testing for fibromyalgia. However, Volynksaya argues that MetLife never informed her of the need for such testing. Similarly, Met-Life was required to provide \u201cupon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to the claimant\u2019s claim for benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is unclear from the current record whether MetLife satisfied this obligation after Vo-lynskaya requested her records.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\"><em>Abatie </em>made MetLife\u2019s apparent conflict of interest and possible violation of procedural requirements relevant to the district court\u2019s review of MetLife\u2019s decision to deny benefits. Accordingly, we vacate and remand the remainder of the district court\u2019s decision in order to allow the court to consider the degree of any conflict, to make factual findings regarding the alleged procedural violations, and to consider, in the first instance, the effect of <em>Aba-tie.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">Ml parties to bear their own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">CALLAHAN, J., concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">While I concur in the result and agree with the remand to permit the district court to reconsider the case in light of <em>Abatie v. Alta Health &amp; Life Insurance Company, </em>458 F.3d 955 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc), I write separately to express my view that because Volynskaya did not raise the conflict of interest question in the district court she is not entitled to a remand based on a change in law. Because this issue involves a change in law we may decide to address conflict of interest on appeal even though we would ordinarily deem the issue waived. <em>See United States v. Robertson, </em>52 F.3d 789, 791 (9th Cir. 1994). While remand is appropriate here, I believe it is essentially discretionary and must be decided on a case by case basis.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b513-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-13\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1191c.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-14\">. <em>Feibusch v.
