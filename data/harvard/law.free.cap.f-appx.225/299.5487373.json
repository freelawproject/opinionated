He argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court failed to properly weigh the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and imposed a term of imprisonment greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-22\">The district court sentenced VallePerches within a properly calculated advisory guideline range. Such a sentence is given \u201cgreat deference,\u201d and we infer that the sentencing court considered all the factors for a fair sentence under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 828, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Therefore, we conclude that Valle-Perches has failed to show that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-23\">Valle-Perches argues, in light of <em>Ap-prendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 87-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case violates due process because it exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in the indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-24\">Valle-Perehes\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Valle-Perches properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
