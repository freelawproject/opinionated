Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>No. AT-1221-05-0790-W-1 (Oct. 4, 2006). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Ms. King has been a GS-9 Medical Technologist with the VA Health Care System in Montgomery, Alabama since 1998. During her time at the VA, she engaged in several whistleblowing disclosures. Ms. King alleges that several personnel actions were taken by the VA in reprisal for these disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">After exhausting her remedies with the Office of Special Counsel regarding these actions, Ms. King filed an Individual Right of Action appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221(a). Prior to hearing the case, Administrative Judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) Joseph E. Clancy, limited the appeal to two personnel actions the VA allegedly took against Ms. King: (1) the denial of a bonus in 2003 and (2) the denial of a promotion to the position of Supervisory Medical Technologist in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">In an initial decision on March, 30, 2006, AJ Clancy found that the VA had shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel actions even in the absence of Ms. King\u2019s whistleblowing. The AJ therefore denied Ms. King\u2019s request for corrective action. On October 4, 2006, the Board denied Ms. King\u2019s petition for review, making the AJ\u2019s decision final.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">This court must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it is \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">Ms. King argues that the AJ improperly limited the scope of the appeal. She argues that the AJ should have allowed her to argue that the VA wrongfully refused to credit her with past experience, reducing her pay; that the VA refused her training opportunities; and that she suffered verbal abuse from members of the VA\u2019s management. However, in an order on November 1, 2005, the same AJ found that \u201c[t]he remaining matters raised by appellant did not constitute cognizable personnel actions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A), were the subject of relief already obtained in other fora, and/or involved alleged reprisal under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(9).\u201d These findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and the AJ did not abuse his discretion by restricting the appeal to those matters properly before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-13\">Ms. King also argues that the AJ improperly refused Ms. King\u2019s discovery requests. This court reviews the Board\u2019s rulings regarding discovery and other evi-dentiary matters for an abuse of discretion. <em>Curtin v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>846 F.2d 1373, 1378-79 (Fed.Cir.1988). However, after limiting the case to the two personnel actions at issue here, the AJ gave the parties a new opportunity to submit discovery requests. The AJ received no submissions from the parties in response to this opportunity and determined, in an order on January 5, 2006, that the VA had \u201cresponded specifically and sufficiently with respect to [Ms. King\u2019s] requests for documents.\u201d There is no evidence in the record that the AJ abused his discretion in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-14\">Ms. King makes several arguments that the AJ made erroneous findings of fact. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>In support of these arguments, Ms. King points to a statement in the AJ\u2019s opinion that was made by one witness but that he attributed to another. The statement itself, that the qualifications of each of the candidates for the promotion had been reviewed by Human Resources, is supported by the record. The attribution of the statement to a particular VA employee was not important to the AJ\u2019s holding. Ms. King also argues that the official in charge of the promotion that she was denied did not know if the person whom he selected for the position had the required credentials. However, there is substantial evidence to support the AJ\u2019s finding the official in charge reasonably relied on Human Resources to screen the candidates for qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Ms. Bang further argues that the AJ refused to consider circumstantial evidence and that he made erroneous credibility findings. As to the AJ\u2019s consideration of evidence, Ms. King points to several places in the hearing transcript where the AJ tried to get her to focus on what he considered the relevant parts of the case. It is not an abuse of discretion for the AJ to focus a litigant away from irrelevant matters. As to the AJ\u2019s findings that several witnesses for the VA \u201ctestified in an extremely straightforward and forthright manner, and [that he] found their testimony both credible and compelling,\u201d such credibility determinations \u201care virtually unreviewable.\u201d <em>Hambsch v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>796 F.2d 430, 436 (Fed.Cir.1986). Ms. King\u2019s simple assertion that this \u201ctestimony was particularly lacking in credibility\u201d is insufficient for this court to overrule the AJ\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Another argument presented by Ms. King is that the AJ did not properly apply the clear and convincing evidence standard, by which the VA had to prove that it would have taken the same personnel actions had Ms. King not been a whistleblower. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1209.7(b). However, it is clear from his opinion that the AJ applied the correct standard. He clearly laid out the proper test and after weighing all of the evidence found \u201cthat the agency ha[d] met its burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that the personnel actions would have been taken even absent [Ms. King\u2019s] protected activity.\u201d The AJ\u2019s holding is supported by substantial evidence in the record as discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">As to the denial of the bonus, only two of ten employees who worked under Ms. King\u2019s supervisor were granted bonuses. The supervisor\u2019s testimony, which the AJ found highly credible, was that the two employees given bonuses were \u201coutstanding\u201d and \u201cgave \u2018110% every day.\u2019 \u201d The AJ found that Ms. King\u2019s own opinion that she \u201cwas \u2018at least as good as\u2019 the [other] two\u201d was insufficient to overcome what he saw as strong evidence that the supervisor would have made the same choice in the absence of Ms. King\u2019s activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">As to the denial of the promotion, Human Resources presented six employees to the selecting official as qualified. Of the six, five were GS-9 Medical Technologists (including Ms. King) and the sixth was a GS-10 Lead Medical Technologist who was eventually selected for the promotion. The GS-10 was the independent first choice of each of the three members of the panel who interviewed the candidates. Each of the panel members testified, with high credibility according to the AJ, that the GS-10 was the person most qualified who had the most relevant experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">Ms. King\u2019s final argument is that the \u201cAJ was clearly biased and this bias permeated this entire process.\u201d In support of this argument, Ms. King invites this court to examine the hearing transcript. However, in order to find an AJ biased, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>showing of \u201ca deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible\u201d is required. <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994); <em>Bieber v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>287 F.3d 1358, 1362 (Fed.Cir. 2002). After a thorough review of the record, we find that no such showing has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Because this court finds that the AJ\u2019s holdings are supported by substantial evidence, that the AJ did not abuse his discretion in making discovery and evidentia-ry rulings, and that the AJ has not been shown to be biased, the decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
