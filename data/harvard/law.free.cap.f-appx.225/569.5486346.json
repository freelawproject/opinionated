Kimani contends he is <em>not </em>eligible for removal under these statutes because he was not an \u201calien\u201d when convicted of two California drug crimes but, rather, was a United States citizen, such citizenship having been automatically conferred by the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 (\u201cCCA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431, even though Kimani was over the age of eighteen on the CCA\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">This court has previously considered and rejected Kimani\u2019s argument. <em>Hughes v. Ashcroft, </em>255 F.3d 752 (9th Cir.2001). Because we are bound by the decisions of previous panels, <em>Koemer v. Grigas, </em>328 F.3d 1039, 1050 (9th Cir.2003), Kimani\u2019s argument fails and his petition must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b598-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
