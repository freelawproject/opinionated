We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, because the BIA actually addressed the issue. <em>Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc) (\u201cWhen the BIA has ignored a procedural defect and elected to consider an issue on its substantive merits, we cannot then decline to consider the issue based upon this procedural defect.\u201d). We grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The BIA\u2019s decision in this case preceded <em>Galeana-Mendoza v. Gonzales, </em>465 F.3d 1054 (9th Cir.2006), in which we held that \u201cCalifornia Penal Code section 243(e) does not qualify as a crime categorically involving moral turpitude.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1061. We therefore remand for the BIA to reconsider Singh\u2019s eligibility for the petty offense exception contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II) and his requested relief under the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">Singh\u2019s request to accept evidence is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
