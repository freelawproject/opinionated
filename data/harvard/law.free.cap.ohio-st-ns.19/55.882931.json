A witness may refresh his memory from a copy of items of original en-tiles made by himself in a memorandum book which has been lost, where it appears that the copy was .written by the attorney as the items were read off to him by the witness from the original memoranda, and was afterward compared by the attorney reading the copy and the witness the original, and by them found to correspond.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b63-6\">2. In an action brought under the second and third sections of the act of March 12, 1831 (S. &amp; O. Stat. 664), to recover money lost by gaming, where the plaintiff furnished the money and employed another to bet or play for him, and was present at the game or play in which the money was lost, he is entitled to recover in the same maimer as if he had lost the money without the assistance of such other person.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b63-7\">3. On the trial the court was asked to charge the jury, that if they believed the plaintiff had knowingly sworn falsely to any material fact or circumstance, it not only affected his credibility, but it was their duty to reject and disbelieve his entire testimony. This was refused, and in lieu thereof the court instructed the jury, that if they believed that a witness had knowingly testified falsely to a material fact, they were at liberty to discard his testimony altogether; hut that the credibility of witnesses was a subject for the consideration and decision of the jury; and they should give the testimony of each witness such weight as they thought it deserved. <em>Held </em>\u2014 That in the refusal to charge as asked, and in the charge as given, there was no error. The holding to the contrary in <em>Stoffer </em>v. <em>The State </em>(15 Ohio St. 47), is overruled.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b63-8\">4. The maxim, <em>ilfalsus in uno, falsus in omnibus,'\u201d </em>is, in a common-law trial, to be applied by the jury according to their own judgment for the ascertainment of the truth, and is not a rule of law in virtue of which the judge may withdraw the evidence from their consideration, or direct them to disregard it altogether.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b63-9\"><em>5. </em>Tho action was brought against eight defendants, who filed a joint answer, denying the allegations of the petition. The jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff against four of the defendants by name, and made no finding either for or against the other defendants. After verdict the plaintiff dismissed the action as to the defendants not embraced in the finding of the jury, and the court rendered judgment against the remaining defendants in accordance with the verdict. The eight defendants then join in a petition in error to reverse the judgment. Held\u2014 1. That the defendants as to whom the suit was dismissed were not prejudiced by the judgment against their co-defendants. 2. That the dismissal of the suit as <em>to </em>part of the defendants without a finding of the issues as to them, where, as in this case, all of the defendants are sued as principals in an <em>unlawful transaction, </em>constitutes no ground on which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>remaining defendants against whom a verdict has been rendered, cam ash a reversal of the judgment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">Error to the superior court of Cincinnati.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">The original action was brought in the superior court of Cincinnati, by McGraw, the defendant in error, against Thomas Mead, Eobert Lear, Eobert Barker, Charles Stone, Horace Dodge, John Woodruff, James Davis, Charles Colter, and Charles Black, plaintiffs in error, to recover of them $5130, which he alleged they had won from him at the game of <em>faro. </em>The petition contained nineteen counts, each alleging the loss of a specified sum, at a particular date, from.

Our first proposition is, \u201c That a party plaintiff has no right as a witness to refresh his memory from the items of an account attached to and made a part of his petition filed in the case, unless the same shall have been prepared by the witness' himself or have been compared by him with the books of original entries, and found to be correct; the books of original entries at the time of the trial being lost.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-9\">2. Our second proposition is, that the court erred in refusing to charge the jury \u201c that plaintiff, before he can recover in this action, must prove that he himself actually lost the money; if he furnished money to Lytle, and Lytle lost it, the right of recovery is in Lytle, as the pleadings are now framed, and plaintiff cannot recover therefor,\u201d as prayed for by plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-10\">By an inspection of the petition it will be seen that the suit was instituted strictly under the gaming statute. S. <em>&amp; </em>O. 664.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-11\">Now, whilst we freely admit that the law provides an adequate remedy, by which MeG-raw could have recovered any sums of money which he might have furnished Lytle to game with, and which were won from Lytle by plaintiffs in error, yet we respectfully submit, that upon the pleadings as they now stand, McGraw claiming to recover as the person who actually played at the game, under the section of the statute that gives to the <em>actual gamester </em>the right to recover, there was no right of recovery in him, for money lost by Lytle, though actually furnished by him. And why ? \u2014 The answer is plain \u2014 there could of course be but <em>one </em>recovery, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>and Lytle being the <em>actual </em>gamester, the statute saves to him the right of action <em>solely </em>for six months. A recovery in this ease <em>under this petition </em>could not be pleaded by plaintiffs in error, in an action brought by Lytle as the actual loser, in bar, because the petition claims for McGraw <em>as an actual loser, </em>and not for money belonging to McGraw and lost by Lytle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-5\"><em>3. </em>Our third proposition is, that the court erred in refusing to charge the jury, as prayed for by plaintiffs in error, that \u201cif the jury believe that plaintiff has knowingly sworn falsely to any material fact or circumstance, it not only affects his credibility, but it is their duty thus to reject and disbelieve his entire testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-6\">\u2022 Such is the ruling of the court in <em>Stoffer </em>v. <em>The State, </em>15 Ohio St. 47; nor is the correctness of the rule doubted in <em>Lear et al. </em>v. <em>McMillen, </em>17 Ohio St. 464.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-7\">4. Qur fourth proposition is that, \u201cthis action being brought originally against eight defendants, all of whom united and joined issue by joint answer, the verdict of the jury finding in favor of plaintiff against four of the defendants by name, and making no finding whatsoever either for or against the remaining defendants, is incomplete, irregular, and insufficient to found a judgment upon.\u201d'</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-8\">We call the attention of the court to the fact, that this petition in error is presented by <em>all </em>of the original defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-9\">How can such a verdict be sustained ? Were not the remaining defendants entitled to a verdict, from the jury sworn to determine the issue joined between <em>all </em>the parties in the original action <em>% </em>Were they not entitled to a judgment for costs ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-10\">\"Upon the other hand, were not.the four defendants below, who were mulct in damages, entitled to know and to have the determination of <em>that </em>jury as to the liability of their co-defendants, in order that they might, if in law they were entitled so to do, claim contribution ? Nor will it do to say that they were not nor could they be in this case entitled to contribution; for if this description of verdict is up'held in this case, so must it be in every other kind, even where contribution is a matter of course.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Nor will it do to say that the error so committed is cured by dismissal after verdict. The issue was joined, the jury was sworn, and all of tbe defendants below were entitled to tbe determination of <em>that </em>jury, to whom, under all tbe rules of both law and practice, they bad submitted their controversy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-5\"><em>J. JR. Challen </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b68-6\">White, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApO\">Several of tbe questions originally made in this case have since been decided in tbe case of <em>Lear et al. </em>v. <em>McM</em>illen, <em>17 </em>Ohio St. 464. Tbe remaining questions we will dispose of in tbe order in which they are presented in tbe argument for tbe plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">1. Tbe plaintiff below, while being examined as a witness on tbe trial, was allowed to refresh bis memory from tbe items of an account attached to, and made part of, tbe petition in tbe case. \u2022 The ruling of the court in allowing this was excepted to, and tbe first question is whether, in so ruling, tbe court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">It appears from tbe bill of exceptions, that the original entries were made by the witness at the time of tbe transaction in a memorandum book, which had been lost. Tbe copy was written by tbe attorney as the items were read off to him by tbe witness from tbe original memoranda, and was after-wards compared by tbe attorney reading tbe copy and the witness tbe original, and tbe two were found to correspond. Both tbe witness and tbe attorney testified to tbe correctness of what they respectively did. The use made of tbe copy was to refresh tbe memory of tbe witness as to a series of dates and amounts of bis alleged losses. We think, undei tbe circumstances stated, there was no error in allowing the copy to be so used.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">2. Tbe action was brought under tbe second and third sections\u2019 of tbe act of March 12, 1831 (S. <em>&amp; </em>C. Stat. 664), to recover money lost by gaming. .The second section provides <em>\u201c </em>that if any person or persons, by playing at any game or g\u00e1mes, or by means of any bet or wager, shall lose to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>other person or persons, any sum of money or thing of value, and shall pay or deliver the same, or any part thereof, to the winner or winners, the person or persons so losing and paying or delivering, may . . . sue for, and recover the money or thing of value so lost and paid or delivered, or any part thereof, from the winner or winners,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The money sought to be recovered was lost at the game of faro. The evidence tended to show that on several occasions the plaintiff furnished the money and employed one Lytle to bet or play for him, but was himself present at the game or play in which the money was lost. On this aspect of the case, the defendants below asked the court to instruct the jury <em>\u201c </em>that plaintiff, before he can recover in this action, must prove that he himself actually lost the <em>money; </em>if he furnished money to Lytle, and Lytle lost it, the right of recovery is in Lytle, under the pleadings, and the plaintiff cannot recover therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">This instruction was refused, and the court, in substance, charged, that if the plaintiff was present at the game or play in which his money was lost, he was entitled to recover in the same manner as if he had lost the money without the assistance of Lytle. We think there was no error in the charge, nor in the refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">It is unnecessary to inquire whether, if the plaintiff had been absent at the time of the play, he could have recovered under the statute. The rule at common law is, that in of-fences less than felony, all who aid, advise, or procure the commission of an offence, though absent at the time of its commission, are principals. But in all classes of offences, those who are present at its commission, giving aid and assistance, are alike principals. In respect to the aspect of the case now under consideration, the plaintiff was as much a player as if he had with his own hands participated in the game. Both he and Lytle were principals in the unlawful game, but the money lost by the play was that of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">8. On the trial the court was asked to charge the. juxy, that if they believed the plaintiff had knowingly sworn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>falsely to any material fact or circumstance, it not only affected liis credibility, but it was their duty to reject and disbelieve his entire testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">This was refused, and in lieu thereof the court instructed the jury, that if they believed that a witness had knowingly testified falsely to a material fact, they were at liberty to discard his testimony altogether; but that the credibility of witnesses was a subject for the consideration and decision of the jury, and they would give the testimony of each witness such weight as they thought it deserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The charge asked is substantially the third proposition laid down in the syllabus in <em>Stoffer </em>v. <em>The State, </em>15 Ohio St. 47. The charge given is in conflict with it. The state of the evidence justified a charge from the court on the subject. \"We are, therefore, called upon either to reaffirm or overrule the decision made upon this question in <em>Stoffer </em>v. <em>The State.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">We have not felt satisfied with the ruling in <em>Stoffer's </em>case upon the point now in question. And upon full reconsideration of the subject, both in the light of principle and authority, we are led to the unanimous conclusion, that the rule of law was incorrectly stated in that <em>case; </em>and that in the case now before us the coiu*t below did not err in its instruction to the jury on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">This is not a case in which we should forbear to correct the error on the principle of <em>stare decisis. </em>It is not a rule of property that is involved, but a rule affecting the practical administration of justice, and which, if wrong, ought at the earliest opportunity to be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">In the administration of justice according to the course of the common law, it is a fundamental rule that it is the duty of the court to decide questions of law, but that the decision of issues of fact, and the passing upon the credibility of witnesses, are exclusively within the province of the jury. The court, by its control over the admissibility of evidence, is required to exclude all that is incompetent, and the jury are relied upon to ascertain the truth from the evidence which the law thus submits to them for their consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The supposed rule in effect declares the witness incompetent, upon the contingency of his having sworn falsely to a fact or circumstance deemed material, by requiring the absolute rejection of his whole testimony, without regard to the motive which may have prompted the false statement, or the object of the witness in. making it. He maybe in the interest of one of the parties, and his object be to favor such party by only making partial disclosures ; yet the rule, as stated, compels the rejection of the testimony that makes against the party in whose interest he is, as well as that which makes for him. Other examples might readily be given to show that the application of the rule as an <em>absolute rule of law, </em>irrespective of circumstances, would be impracticable in its operation, and would often tend rather to defeat than to promote the ascertainment of truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The grounds on which the rule has been supposed to rest is, that <em>\u201cfaith in a witness\u2019 testimony ca/rmot be partial or </em>fractional.\u201d This is the theory on which it was applied in <em>Staffer\u2019s </em>case, and is recognized as its foundation in the extract from Starkie\u2019s Evidence found in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">But this is certainly not universally true; for as was said by Lord Mansfield, in <em>Birmon </em>v. <em>Woodbridge </em>(Doug. R. 788), in speaking of the testimony of a witness : \u201cIt is said, that, as the case rests entirely on his evidence, you must take it altogether, and believe the whole; but though the whole of an affidavit or of an answer must be <em>read, </em>if any part is, yet you need not <em>believe </em>all equally. Tou may believe what makes against his point who swears, without believing what makes for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Besides, it never was true that a jury was required, as matter of law, to give equal credit to the testimony of witnesses of equal capacity- having like opportunities of knowing the truth. The relations of the witnesses to the parties and the subject-matter were to be considered, and such weight given to the testimony as the jury, under the circumstances, thought it deserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">In this State no witness in a civil suit is disqualified by reason of his interest, however great, or by reason of his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>vietion of crime; but such interest or conviction may partially affect his credit, or may wholly discredit him, in the minds of the jury. If he is but partially discredited, their faith in his testimony is necessarily partial.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The maxim, <em>falsus m </em>uno, <em>falsus im, </em>omnibus, is derived from the civil law, and addresses itself more particularly to tribunals charged with the investigation of evidence and the determination of issues of fact, and should be applied with more or less force according to circumstances. The maxim is not limited in its application to the matter of the credit due to witnesses who have in some particular testified falsely. The presumption on which it is founded is applicable, with more or less force, to other cases of unfaithful conduct. 1 Sumner\u2019s R. 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Under the civil law, justice was administered by fixed tribunals, which were charged with the determination of both law and fact. To this class, under our system of jurisprudence, belong courts of equity, and admiralty courts. In passing upon the credibility of witnesses in determining issues of fact, the maxim is often applied by these tribunals as justifying the total disregard of the testimony of particular witnesses. Such was the case in the opinion in the matter of the <em>Santissima </em>Trinidad, <em>7 </em>Wheaton, 283; and in <em>Hargraves </em>v. <em>Miller's </em>Administrator, 16 Ohio, 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">For the administration of justice under the common law, a jury is constituted, to whom, as_a distinct body, is exclusively confided the duty of determining questions of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">And we agree with the supreme court of North Carolina, in the case of <em>The State </em>v. <em>Williams (2 </em>Jones. L. R. 257), that <em>\u201c </em>the maxim is, in a common-law trial, to be applied by the jury according to their own judgment for the ascertainment of the truth, and is not a rule of law in virtue of which the judge may withdraw the evidence from their consideration, or direct them to disregard it altogether.\u201d In that case there is an able and elaborate discussion of the question by Pearson, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">In <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(3 Wis. R. 645) the court below had instructed the jury that it was \u201c a general rule, that if a wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>ness, when testifying under oath, states what is false intentionally and knowingly, he is not to be believed in anything he swears to, unless corroborated by other evidence.\u201d On error this instruction was held by the supreme court to be erroneous. The court say: <em>\u201c </em>It is true, as a general rule, that when a witness deliberately swears falsely in regard to a material fact, the jury are not bound to believe him in any of his statements, unless he is corroborated. But it is wrong to say that the jury are not at liberty to believe him. The maxim, <em>falsus i/n tmo, falsus i/n \u00f3mnibus, </em>does not operate to preclude the jury from believing the witness if they choose to do so. The <em>jury may </em>believe any competent witness, though in many instances they ought not. A jury ought not to convict upon the testimony of an accomplice uncorroborated, but all now agree they <em>may </em>do so. It would have b'een correct for the court to give the jury general rules by which the credibility of the witnesses is to be judged, but it was not correct to tell them that they were not at liberty to believe the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">To the same effect are the decisions in <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>The People, </em>15 Mich. R. 411, and in <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Hodgdon, </em>17 Maine R. 267. And Taylor, in his recent work on Evidence, places the testimony of such a witness on a similar footing with that of an accomplice. Taylor on Ev. vol. i. \u00a7 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">4. The jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff against four of the defendants by name, and made no finding either for or against the other defendants. After verdict the plaintiff dismissed the action as to the defendants not embraced in the finding of the jury, and the court rendered judgment against the remaining defendants in accordance with the verdict. All of the defendants originally sued join in the present petition in error to reverse the judgment, and it is claimed that the verdict will not support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The dismissal of the action as to part of the defendants is not complained of, except as it is supposed to constitute a ground for the reversal of the judgment recovered by the' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>plaintiff below. It is that judgment alone which is sought to be reversed by the petition in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">But the defendants below, as to whom the suit was dismissed, are not prejudiced by the judgment against their co-defendants. And where, as in this case, all of the defendants are sued as principals in an <em>unlawful </em>transaction, the dismissal of the suit as to part of the defendants without a finding of the issues as to them, constitutes no ground on which the remaining defendants, against whom a verdict has been rendered, can ash a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b74-7\">Brinkerhoee, C.J., and Scott, Welch, and Dav, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
