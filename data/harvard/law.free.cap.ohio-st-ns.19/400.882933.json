W. drew a bill of exchange at Cleveland, Ohio, addressed to G-. at his place of business in the city of New York, and payable on a day certan at the Ocean Bank in the last-named city. At maturity the bill was presented at the bank for payment, and duly protested for non-payment. The drawee was in funds at the maturity of the bill, and would have paid it had he been advised of its existence, but he subsequently became insolvent.

The first point we make for plaintiff in error is, that the bill was never presented to the drawee, or at his place of business or residence; and this being of course indispensable to make the drawee liable, and not having been done, the holders of the bill could not make Stetson liable as indorser, nor Walker as drawer or indorser. And if it was presented for acceptance and acceptance refused, we never had notice of that, nor Stetson; and so both were discharged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-7\">2. Stetson, granting he was an accommodation indorser, could not pay the bill to Mygatt &amp; Brown voluntarily anc negligently, this laches existing, and charge the amount paid to the drawer, Walker.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-8\">3. The circumstances of the transaction involved in this case are such, as disclosed by the evidence, that all the ordinary rules apply which are applicable to a bill of exchange, and in any view of the facts this is the case as between Mygatt &amp; Brown and Stetson.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-9\">Story on Bills, secs. 48, 107, 123, 227, 229, 231, 235, 237, 244, 250, 273, 301, 306, 321, 322, 353, 354, 355, 358, 363, 366, 371, 373, 375, 377, 390, 423; 1 Smith\u2019s Lead.

Gfleason, Esqr., No. 115 \u25a0 Chambers Street, New York.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">The bills were indorsed by Walker and by Stetson, and 'discounted by Mygatt &amp; Brown, as Stetson alleged, for the 'Sole benefit of Walker.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">The bills as they respectively matured, were presented at rthe Ocean Bank and payment demanded, which was refused; -but neither of them was presented to the drawee for acceptance, nor was he notified by the holders, Mygatt &amp; Brown, \u25a0 or otherwise, of the existence of the bills, or of their present\u2022ment at the bank for payment. The bills were duly protested for non-payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">On the trial in the district court, Walker, the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>asked the court to instruct the jury, \u201c that to entitle Stetson to recover, the jury must find that the bills of exchange were presented either personally, or at 115 Chambers Street, to Mr. Gleason, the drawee, for <em>acceptance; </em>and that presentment of them at the Ocean Bank for <em>payment </em>on the day of their maturity, would not be, in law, a sufficient presentment for acceptance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">This instruction was refused, and in respect to it the court charged, \u201c that- a presentment for <em>acceptance </em>to the drawee personally, or at 115 Chambers Street, was not necessary; but that a presentment at the bank where said bills were payable, at the proper time, <em>for payment, </em>would be a sufficient presentment of the bills.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Numerous 'other charges were asked, some of which, with or without qualifications, were given to the jury, and others refused; but as their materiality, as respects the case made in the record, depends upon the assumed error of the court in its charge and refusal to charge as above stated, it is not necessary to set them out.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">A verdict having been rendered for the plaintiff below, the refusal of the court to grant a new trial on the ground that the verdict is not sustained by sufficient evidence, is likewise assigned for error; and the present petition in error is filed by Walker,'the defendant below, to obtain the reversal of the judgment rendered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The material question in the case is, whether, in the absence of an acceptance, the presentation of the bills at the Ocean Bank for payment was a sufficient presentment of the bills to charge the drawer and the indorser. ..</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">In our opinion it was. The theory of a bill of exchange is, that it is drawn on funds to be provided by the drawer. From this it would seem to follow, that, where the drawer, in the bill appoints a time and place of payment, it is his duty to see that funds are provided at the appointed time and place to pay it. And, if this is so, the duty of the holder in respect to demanding payment would seem to be performed by a presentment in due time, at the designated place.'</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">It is not denied that this would be true in the case of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>accepted bill; but it is contended that the holder is <em>bound </em>to make presentment to the drawee for <em>acceptance, </em>and that his failure to do so discharges the antecedent parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We do not so understand the law. It is true that where a bill is made payable within a specified time after sight, it is necessary, in order to fix the period when it is to be paid, to present it to the drawee for acceptance, otherwise the time of payment would never arrive; but when it is payable at a specified date or at a certain period after date, no presentment for acceptance is necessary. Byles on Bills, side pp. 139, 168; Story on Bills, sec. <em>228; Bank of Washington v. Triplett, </em>1 Peters' S. C. R. 25; <em>Townsley </em>v. <em>Sumrall, </em>2 ib. 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">And in <em>O'Keefe </em>v. <em>Dunn </em>(6 Taunton, 308), Dallas, J., in speaking of the nature of the contract arising from the drawing of a bill payable at a future specified date, says, <em>\u201c </em>He [the drawer] does not stipulate for himself that it shall be presented for acceptance, nor does the law impose such an obligation on the payee. The drawer, therefore, must be considered as contented to rest in ignorance, whether it has been accepted or not, till the bill becomes due. And whether presented or not, depends upon the casualty of how the holder of the bill may choose to proceed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The strong probability from the evidence is, that the nonpayment of the bills resulted from the fact that the drawee was not advised of the drawing of the bills. He states that he was in funds, and would have paid them had he been so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The question is, whose duty was it to have given him this advice. It seems to us it was the duty of the drawer, for whom the drawee was expected to act in making the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">The words \u201c No. 115 Chambers Street,\u201d added to the name of the drawee, we regard as <em>descriptio persones. </em>They imposed no additional obligation on the holder in respect to requiring presentment of the bills for acceptance, from what would have existed had the words been omitted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>They were merely intended to direct the holder, if he desired to have the bills accepted, where to seek the drawee.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">As to the assignment of error that the verdict is not supported by sufficient evidence, it is enough to say, we find no grounds which would justify a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b413-7\">Bbinkerhoff, C.J., and Scott, Welch, and Day, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
