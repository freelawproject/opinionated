The injury was charged to have been occasioned by defendant\u2019s negligence. The pleadings show that the plaintiff was being carried gratuitously at the time of the accident, under a contract by which the plaintiff assumed all risks of accident and injury arising from negligence, eto.,, and that such pontract is, valid hy the laws, of New York. Held\u2014 That the validity of the stipulation exempting the defendant from liability for negligence must be determined by the laws of New York, within whose jurisdiction the contract was.made and to be executed; and as the plaintiff, under his contract, could have no right of action in the courts of New York, so his action cannot be maintained in this State..</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-10\">Error to- the court of common pleas of Trumbull county.

That a contract with a railroad company, exempting it from liability for damages caused by the negligence and carelessness of its employes, is, in the State of Ohio, abso\u00a1lutely void, when such contract is made in this State, seems to be fully settled. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Voorhes, </em>10 Ohio, 145; <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad Co., </em>10 Ohio St. 65.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-10\">2. That the general rule is, that the validity of a contract is to be decided by the law of the place where it is made, is not doubted. But it is equally clear that to this general rule there are exceptions, founded upon the absolute right of each State to judge for itself how far they ought to go in enforcing contracts made in other States, and carrying them into effect according to the laws of such States.

But, in this case, the plaintiff by his demurrer admits, that the contract for his carriage was made in New York, and was wholly to be performed in that _State; that it expressly stipulated for defendant\u2019s exemption from all liability for such negligence as that which constitutes his cause of action, and that such contract exempting the carrier from liability is valid in that State. As the contract was made within the jurisdiction of New York, and contemplated no action outside of that jurisdiction, it is clear that the question of its validity must be determined solely by the laws of New York. The rights and obligations of the parties to such a contract, and in respect to the manner of its execution, cannot be affected by the laws or policy of other States. If no cause of action arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>to the plaintiff under his contract, when the accident occurred, the transaction cannot be converted into a cause of action by the fact that the parties have subsequently come within the jurisdiction of Ohio.
