The liability of a railroad company for loss or damage to goods which it has agreed to transport upon or over a line of road other than its own, is founded upon <em>contract, </em>and <em>not </em>upon its office or duty as a common carrier; and consequently its liability in such case is measured merely by the terms of its contract, express or implied, and not by its general duty as a common carrier. <em>York Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>Central </em>Railroad, 3 Wallace (U.

The plaintiff in error was a common carrier, and, <em>as such, </em>was engaged in the business of shipping or transporting freight from Cincinnati to New York. Redfield' on Carriers, pp. 16,17, sec. 23.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-6\">The high responsibility which is imposed upon a common carrier is not a matter arising <em>ex contractu, but attached by law </em>to the calling or employment of the common carrier. If it were a matter resting upon contract, it might be qualified or limited, or dispensed with, by contract. But it is <em>a law </em>founded upon public policy and required by the public safety, and which cannot be changed \u2022 or abrogated by the contracts or agreements of parties. 1 Smith\u2019s Leading Cases 323, 325, 326 (Hare &amp; Wallace\u2019s Ed. of 1855); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Voorhes, </em>10 Ohio, 146.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-7\">2. The only qualification to this doctrine which has been allowed is, that the common carrier might, by express agreement, restrict his liability so far as the common-law rule made him an insurer for the goods entrusted to his charge, and no further. This qualification was first adopted in Ohio, in the case of <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>2 Ohio St. 131, which was subsequently affirmed in <em>Graham &amp; Co. </em>v <em>Davis &amp; Co., </em>4 Ohio St. 362; and also in <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>The </em>Pittsburg, <em>Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad Company, </em>10 Ohio St. 65. The same qualification had been previously settled in England and in several of the other States of this country. But this qualification is based on the ground that the common carrier cannot stipulate against the liability for losses <em>by negligence or misfeasance. </em>So the plaintiff in error could not, by special conditions, limit its liability for losses arising from <em>neglect </em>or <em>misfeasance.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-8\">3. As to the ground of defence, which makes the plaintiff in error <em>a common carrier </em>from Cincinnati to Dayton, and a <em>gyri/oate carrier </em>or <em>mere forwa/rder </em>from thence to New York \u2014 that is a change of character, by the way, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>manifest departure from the nature of the undertaking in the bill of lading. It is an undertaking that the goods shall go through to the place of delivery all the way on railroad. A bill of lading imports not only a receipt of the goods, and an undertaking for transportation, but also <em>a delivery </em>at the place of destination. The business and obligation of the contracting party do not terminate until delivery. <em>The delivery </em>is a very essential part of the business of the carrier. If the special tferms of exemption had been omitted in this bill of lading, no question would have been made, or could have been made, that this was a contract for transportation through to New York, and delivery at that place. Do these special conditions change the nature of the undertaking, and actually annul the obligation of the contract? They were framed by the company itself for its own special benefit, and must, therefore, be construed not only most strongly against the company, but in connection with the other terms and provisions of the bill of lading. Thus taken and construed, these special conditions first express <em>the mode </em>of the transportation, and then prescribe the special exemptions. <em>The mode </em>of transportation by taking over the road of the plaintiff in error to its terminus, and the delivery to the agents of its connecting and forwarding lines previously provided by arrangement made by the contracting company for through transportation; the obligation for through transportation and delivery at the point of destination is not impaired, rescinded, or changed, by any fair and reasonable interpretation. It is still an obligation to transport through to New York and deliver at that point to the consignees <em>m the mode and on the conditions mentioned; and the undertaking </em>is by this company alone, and for <em>a through line </em>of transportation. No other company is mentioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-5\">The special provisions in the bill of lading, strictly and fairly construed, do not exempt the company from liability, which continued to the place of delivery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-6\">The circumstances show most conclusively, that, notwithstanding all the shifts, devices, and artful circumlocution employed in the special conditions, the actual fact was, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>companies of the connecting and continuous lines were simply the agents and instrumentalities employed by the plaintiff in error to transport through to New York. The fact of the authority given to the company, at either terminus of the through line, to contract for a through rate of fare, and their pro-rating or dividing the amount agreed on, shows an agency, and, in one sense, a partnership.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-4\">The Erie Company was liable, as <em>a common ca/rrier, umder the laws of New </em>Yorh, 'and could have been easily made to respond for all damages arranged and paid for it at Cincinnati. See in Bouney\u2019s little work on Railway Carriers, 179, 180, an extract from the Railway Statutes of New York, Acts for 1847, chapter 270. This fixes the liability of the Erie 'Company to the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-5\">Redfield, in his work on Common Carriers, sec. 196, says : <em>\u201c </em>The English courts hold that it is not <em>ultra vimes </em>for a railway company to contract to carry beyond its own route by sea or by coach.\u201d <em>(Wilby </em>v. <em>West Cornwall Railway, </em>2 H. <em>&amp; </em>N. 703.) \u201cAnd where the party contracted with the company ao carry beyond their own line upon a connecting road, but signed a note, without noticing its contents, only extending to the point of departure from the first line, it was held that <em>parol </em>evidence of the extended contract was admissible, as it only supplemented the writing.\u201d <em>(Malpas </em>v. <em>Southwestern Railway, </em>Law Rep., 1 C. P. 336. See also sec. 194, Redfield on Common Carriers, p. 159.) In <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Rutland and Burlington Railway, </em>27 Verm. 110, the court, in affirming the same doctrine, said: \u201c <em>It seems to le now well settled that railway companies, as common carriers, may malee valid contracts to carry leyond the limits of their own road either ly land or water, and thus become liable for the acts and neglects of other carriers in no sense under theim con-troll </em>This doctrine is fully sanctioned by Redfield on Carriers, after an examination of all the authorities, secs. 194 and 197, p. 161; also sec. 183, p. 151; and see cases cited in notes under this last section. The same doctrine is sustained by the following cases: <em>Muschamp </em>v. <em>Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway, </em>8 M. &amp; <em>W. </em>421; <em>Weed </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>Saratoga and Schenectady Railway, 19 Wend. </em>534; <em>Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank </em>v. <em>Champlain Transportation Company, </em>23 Verm. 186.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-5\">4. As to the ground of the defence, that the railroad com pany was protected from liability by the special conditions of exemption in' the bill of lading, I insist, in the first place, that, taken in an unqualified sense, they are illegal and invalid. They do <em>in terms exempt </em>the plaintiff in error from even liability for losses by negligence on its own road between Cincinnati and Dayton. And more than this, they provide against the liability of the companies owning the connecting lines, for losses on their own road, respectively, even by negligence. This is an open violation of the well-settled law of Ohio, and <em>as such </em>these conditions, being unlawful and against public policy, should be wholly rejected as invalid. The company, as a common carrier, had <em>no legal capacity </em>to contract for an exemption from the consequences of its own negligence or malfeasance, and much less for that of the other compames. And the terms of a contract which are unlawful or against public policy <em>in part </em>or for <em>one purpose, </em>must be rejected as void entire, or for all purposes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-6\">But if these special conditions of' exemption be permitted to stand as valid for any purpose or to any extent, it must be on the ground of an interpretation, that they were intended simply to exempt the companyfrom liability as common carriers so far as that liability made it an insurer against losses from accident merely, where there was no negligence. If these conditions admit of such an interpretation, and it can be declared that they were so intended, theymay be permitted to stand <em>pro tanto. </em>But if they were intended in part as a protection for negligence or misfeasance, they should be rejected entirer-</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-7\"><em>Jones </em>v. <em>Voorhes, </em>10 Ohio, 145; <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>2.

(Redfieldon Railways, vol. ii. p. 97, and cases cited in note 9.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-7\">I insist, that the stipulations for exemption from liability in the bill of lading in this case are most <em>unjust, unreasonable, </em>and impracticable on their face, and therefore wholly void.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b242-8\">Welch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1\">The real question in this case is, What was the contract between the parties \u2014 did the company agree to carry the apple butter all the way to New York, or only to Dayton? Upon either construction of their contract, the law fixing the rights and liabilities of the parties seems to be reasonably well settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">If the contract was to carry to Dayton only, there can be no pretence that it was not fully performed on the part of the railroad company. The goods were carried to Dayton in due time, and there safely delivered into the hands of another company, according to agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">On the other hand, if the contract is to be held as an undertaking to carry the goods to New York, what are the rights and liabilities of the parties ?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>It does not seem to be denied that the company had the legal capacity to make such a contract, or which is the same thing in effect, that it is estopped from denying its capacity to do so. That such is the settled law seems to be now well established. (2 Redf. on Railways, p. 9, sec. 152; id. p. 161; M. &amp; W. 421; 21 Conn. 570; 27 Verm. 399; id. 110.)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">It is equally well settled, in Ohio at least, that a common carrier cannot by any stipulation in his contract, or by any notice to the other party, exempt himself from liability for negligence or default of himself or agents. (2 Ohio St. 131; 4 id. 375; 10 id. 65; and <em>C. P. &amp; A. R. R. Co. </em>v. Curran, (decided at the present term of this court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>). He may, by such means, exempt himself from liability as insurer of the property, against accidents and unavoidable losses, but not against those arising from the acts or omissions of himself or his servants. It is quite clear, therefore, that if the company had made a contract to carry to Dayton only, and a similar proviso had been inserted against liability for loss happening on the company\u2019s own road, the proviso would have been void, at least as to any loss occasioned by negligence or default. Now, if the contract is to be regarded as an undertaking to carry to New York, instead of Dayton, why should not the same rule of law apply <em>% </em>The same reasons of public policy seem to exist. The only \u00e9ssential difference is, that in the latter case the distance covered by the undertaking is increased, and the number of the carrier\u2019s agents is multipied ; and perhaps I might add, the company is assuming to exercise doubtful .powers in making the contract. It is difficult to see any reason in either of these facts for relaxing the rule of law in favor of the latter description of contract. Besides, if this was in fact a contract to carry the goods to New York, the company, in making it, was not and could not be acting as agent for any other carriers, and no one would be bound by it but itself. In that case the company\u2019s delivery of the goods to the next carrier at Dayton would create no contract, express or implied, between that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>carrier and the consignor, and would give the latter no right of action against the former, because the delivery would not be made as agent of the consignor. Between the consignor and the second carrier there would 'be, in that case, no connection. As between them the goods, though in fact in the hands of the second carrier, would be in law in the hands of the original party; and if the consignor had no remedy against the original party, he would have no remedy against any one. The same rule of public policy, which denies the right of exemption from loss arising from fault or negligence, and the same reasons supporting it, apply equally to such eases, as it does to contracts for carriage upon the carrier\u2019s own road. Were the law otherwise, it would be in the power of one company to monopolize the business on the road of another, and thus escape the obligation and duty to the public of conducting that business with proper skill and care, which it was the object of the rule in question to enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We think, therefore, that if the contract in question is to be regarded as an undertaking to carry the goods to New York, the company is liable for this loss. It occurred at Salamanca, while the goods were <em>m transitu </em>upon the line covered by the contract, and resulted from the negligence and default of the employees of the plaintiff in error, who was the carrier for the whole route, and who was the only party contracting with the owners, the defendants in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">But what was the contract? Was it an undertaking to carry to New York, or was it an undertaking to carry to Dayton ? The parties have put their contract in writing, in the form of a receipt and agreement. This written contract determines their rights, and cannot be contradicted by parol proof. (4 Ohio, 334; 4 Ohio St. 362.) It acknowledges the receipt of the goods, <em>\u201c </em>to be transported <em>Toy the Omeinnati, Hamilton, a/nd Dayton </em>and <em>Dayton de Michigan Ma\u00e1hroad Oonypany to its termvnus, </em>and <em>there </em>delivered;\u201d with a proviso that the company\u2019s liability shall cease upon such delivery. Language could not be much plainei\\ Surely this bill of lading, apart from the mere description of the goods, imports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>that the undertaking was to carry the goods no farther than to Dayton, the terminus of the companys\u2019 own railroad, and to assume the liability of carriers only to that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Is this plain reading of the written contract to be contra-dieted and set aside by the fact that the goods were destined and marked for New Tork, and were described as being so marked in the bill of lading ? It was surely in the power of the parties, notwithstanding the destination of the goods, to make an express agreement that the company should only take them to Dayton. And had they undertaken to make such an agreement, they could hardly have embodied it in language more plain and direct than that they have used. No case is shown, English or American, where an explicit contract like this has been held to be overruled or varied, by the simple fact that the goods were received with the knowledge that they were consigned to a more distant point than that specified in the contract. The cases cited by counsel, and the argument founded upon them, are merely to the effect that such fact is sufficient <em>frvma-fojcie </em>evidence of a contract to carry the goods to their ultimate destination. This is now apparently settled as the law in England. The American cases are conflicting upon the question. But all the cases, so far as known to us, seem to proceed upon the admission that it can be no more than <em>$rima-fac,ie </em>evidence; that it is competent for the parties, by express stipulation or otherwise, to negative the presumption. It is, therefore, only in the absence of such express agreement that the question can ai\u2019ise. We need not decide this question now. For if it be admitted that the consignment marks upon the goods are, in the absence of a contrary agreement, <em>prima-faoie </em>evidence of the distance they are to be carried, the answer in the present case is, that there was such contrary agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The objection that the bill of lading was not signed by both parties is without validity. It is enough that it was signed by the company, and accepted and acquiesced in by the other party, and that there was no fraud, deceit, or mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>take accompanying the transaction. There are abundant authorities to this effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b246-6\">Bkinkeehoff, .0.J., and Scott, White, and Day, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-5\"> Ante, p. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
