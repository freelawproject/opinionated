But we are not prepared to say that the closing of the polls for the hour spent at dinner, by the officers of the election, in these three townships, under the circumstances disclosed in this record, is, in law, sufficient to invalidate the elections and disfranchise the voters who did deposit their ballots in the boxes. The statute in this respect may be regarded as <em>directory, </em>and a departure from the strict observance of its provisions does not necessarily invalidate the election, where it appears that no fraud has been practised, and no substantial right violated. A case might occur that would require the entire vote of an election precinct to be set aside as invalid, but we are of opinion that this is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
