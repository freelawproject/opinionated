Its board of education, in accordance with the provisions of that act, under section 33, had divided it into two sub-districts. After the passage of the supplementary school law of April 9,1867 (S. &amp; S. 717), the electors of one of these sub-districts (No. 2) took the proper steps, under the last-named act, to erect the sub-district into a separate school district, organized as such, and proceeded regularly to levy and caused to be assessed and collected a school tax. The plaintiffs, citizens, and tax-payers resident within its territory filed their petition in the court of common pleas of Highland county, to enjoin the collection of this tax, upon the ground that the proceedings to create the school district were void, not for any alleged irregularity, ' but because the law of 1867 conferred no authority upon the sr\u2019b-district to become a separate districts The court of common pleas gave judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. In the: district court this judgment was reversed, and a judgment rendered dismissing the petition. To reverse this latter judgment is the object of this petition in error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b585-8\"><em>Slocme &amp; </em>Steel, for plaintiffs in error, cited:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AM8\"><em>Administrator of Tracy </em>v. <em>Administrator of Card, </em>2 Ohio St. 431-445; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number><em>Stone </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>11 Ohio St. 252-258; Keiffer <em>v. </em>E<em>hler, </em>18 Penn.
