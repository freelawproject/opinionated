After directing that his debts shordd be paid, he bequeathed his library to his sons, or the survivors of them, to be equally divided between them when they respectively become of age ; and his household goods he bequeathed to his wife, Mary Boyd, to be by her kept, used, and employed during her life, and what may be remaining at her death\u2019 he directs to be divided amongst Ms daughters, or the survivors of them, or that his wife may, during her life, make such distribution thereof to Ms daughters, as she may deem advisable. He disposes of the remainder of his property as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-7\"><em>\u201c </em>I also give and bequeath unto my wife my estate, real, leasehold, and personal; and all moneys and proceeds that may arise from the same, or that shall be remaining in the hands of my executors after the payment of my just debts and funeral and administration expenses, to be used, employed, and kept by her during her natural life for the support of herself, and the support and education of my minor children. I also allow and direct that my wife shall, if she deems it proper, advance my sons, or any one of them, as they severally arrive at the age of twenty-one years, such sum of money as she may deem advisable, out of any surplus funds remaining in her hands not required for the-support of herself and the support and education of my said minor children, she taking from them, respectively, for such advances, sufficient security for its repayment without interest. I also order and direct that my said wife shall draw from my said executors, on her own order, all such sum or sums of money as shall be in their hands, at any time, over the amount sufficient for the payment of my debts and the expenses aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-8\">\u201c I also order and direct that, after the death of my wife, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>all the estate and property, real, leasehold, and personal, remaining (except as aforesaid), shall be by my executors, a majority or the survivors of them, divided equally amongst all my children, male and female, or the survivors of <em>them; </em>but in case the same, or any part of the same, in the opinion of my executors, cannot be fairly divided without injury thereto, then such part shall be by them sold and conveyed for the best price that can be had, and the proceeds divided as aforesaid: provided, that any advances made by my wife to my sons under the provision for that purpose, shall first be deducted out of -their respective portions; and if any shall have overdrawn his equal proportion by way of advance, the surplus shall be refunded, so as to make the portions to each equal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-5\">After adding certain directions as to the management of other houses and lots, he proceeds to direct as to the property in controversy as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-6\"><em>\u201c </em>I also direct that my said executors, a majority or the survivors of them, shall lease, rent, on the best terms that can be had for the same, my houses and lots on the north side of Eifth street, between Yine and Race streets, which were leased to me by Samuel Talbert and brother, the proceeds of which, after paying ground-rents and taxes, to be paid to and received by my wife for the purposes aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-7\">The testator died, leaving Mary Boyd, his widow, and eight children. One of these children, James S. Boyd, died in 1836, leaving a widow and Kate J. Boyd, his only child, who was born in 1833.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-8\">The estate of John Boyd was largely insolvent. About the time of the testator\u2019s death, a quarter\u2019s rent of the leasehold having fallen due, the lessor demanded rent, claimed a forfeiture for non-payment, and the tenant attorned. An unsuccessful suit in chancery was brought to set aside the forfeiture. Afterward, a suit in ejectment was brought, which, after a protracted litigation, was decided in favor of the executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-9\">The leasehold was sold to the widow of the testator with the consent of all the heirs, except Kate J. Boyd, the grand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>child, who was then a minor. The property was exchanged by the widow for another house and lot, which, after .her death, descended to her heirs. Her grantee sold the leasehold to David Sinton, the defendant in the court below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-5\">Nothing was realized to the estate from the property, and it seems to have been mostly exhausted in various ways in connection with the litigation for its recovery from the for \u2022 feiture claimed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-6\">Many matters in connection with the management and disposition of the property are set forth in the record, that upon the view taken of the case by the court, need not be further stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-7\">It was claimed, on the part of the plaintiff below, that the disposition of the property, after its recovery, and all the transactions in relation thereto, were void as to her. She recovered a judgment; and a motion for a new trial, on the ground that the judgment was against the law and evidence, was overruled in the general term. A bill of exceptions was taken, embodying all the evidence. To reverse this judgment, this petition in error is prosecuted in this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-8\"><em>Aaron F. Perry, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As\">among other points argued the following:</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-9\">Under John Boyd\u2019s will, nothing could vest in his children until the death of his wife; and then only in the \u201csurvivors of them.\u201d A child dying before the death of the wife was not a \u201csurvivor,\u201d and the child of such child) though surviving, was not one of the surviving \u201c children \u201d of John Boyd; consequently, such grandchild could have taken nothing under the will. <em>Radcliffe </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>10 Ves. 195; <em>Lord Oxford </em>v. Churchill, 3 Ves. &amp; Bea. 59; <em>Crooke </em>v. <em>Brookeing, </em>2 Vern. 107; <em>Reeves </em>v. <em>Brymer, </em>4 Ves. 692; <em>Izord </em>v. <em>Izord, </em>2 Des. R. 308; Redf. on Wills, 491 (citing in note <em>Osgood </em>v. <em>Lovering, </em>33 Maine, 464), 492; Hawkins on Constr. of Wills, 85, 261, 263; <em>Buckle </em>v. <em>Fawcett, </em>4 Hare, <em>536; </em>Powell on Devises, 286; 2 Williams on Executors, 887; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 Vern. 92.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-10\">It is respectfully submitted, that as the father of Kate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>died before the widow, he took nothing by the <em>will; </em>and consequently that Kate inherits nothing from him. In the language of Lord Westbury \u2014 <em>(Martin </em>v. Colgate, 1 Eng. <em>&amp; </em>Irish App. Br. L. R. Appellate, 175: decided in 1866) \u2014 \u201c <em>Substitution really is where the parent tahes something : here he was dead before the tenant for </em>life, <em>and so he tooJc nothing at allL</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-5\">\n<em>Lewis' E. Mills</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APK\">argued the case for defendant in error but not upon the distinct point upon which it is decided.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b42-6\">Day, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG\">Numerous perplexing questions have been presented in this case, but they are all founded on the assumption that Kate J. Boyd derives title under the will of her grandfather1, John Boyd. If this assumption be not well founded, there is an end of the case. This, then, is the prime question to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">There is no express devise to grandchildren; nor is there anything in the will that will admit of that construction. The devise is to <em>\u201c </em>children; \u201d if, therefore, she has any interest in the estate in controversy, she derives it by descent \u25a0from her father, James S. Boyd, who was the child of the testator. If nothing was vested in him at the time of his \u00a1death, she can inherit nothing from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The question, then, is, whether an interest under the will \u2022vested in James S. Boyd. He survived the testator, but died \u2019before the widow, <em>\u201c </em>after \u201d whose death the property was to \u2022-be divided. The property was to be divided equally .amongst the testator\u2019s children, <em>\u201c </em>or the survivors of them.\u201d It is necessary, therefore, to ascertain what was the point of time at which the survivorship was to be determined. Was \u2022it at the decease of the testator, or of his widow, who had a .life interest in the property? This depends entirely upon the intention of the testator. In seeking that, we arrive at the same result, whether we apply the settled rules of the '\u2022law, or are guided only by a study of the will itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The ancient holdings on this subject have been much \u00a1modified by more recent decisions. Also the soundness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the distinction, taken between real and personal estate, has been questioned, until it has nearly or quite faded away. 2 Jar. on Wills [650] ; Hawkins\u2019 Treat. 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The case of <em>Young </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>(8 Jurist, N. S., 825), decided in the House of Lords in 1862, is directly in point. It was a will of real and personal estate to trustees, to account to the widow during her life, and, after her death, to certain grand nephews and nieces, or their survivors.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In that case it was held, \u201c upon the authorities, as well as upon principle,\u201d to be the rule, \u201c that where there is a clause of survivorship, <em>prvma-faoie </em>survivorship means the time at which the property to be divided comes into enjoyment\u2014 that is to say, if there be no previous life estate, at the death of the testator; if there be a previous life estate, then at the termination of that life estate:\u201d or (as the rule is more briefly stated by the Lord Chancellor), that words of survivorship should be referred to the period \u201c for the payment or distribution of the subject-matter of the gift.\u201d This is declared by him to be \u201cthe rule that is now finally established \u201d in England.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">This undoubtedly is the general rule recognized in this country, subject, of course, to such modifications as the paramount rule, giving effect to the intention of the testator, may require.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">We think the general rule is the law applicable to this case, and that it is in harmony with the obvious purpose and intent of the testator, as gathered from the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Nor are we embarrassed by any question as to the state of the legal title to the leasehold in controversy, during the lifetime of the widow, for this court, in the case of <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Talbert </em>(12 Ohio, 212), held, that it \u2022 was vested in the executors. The legal estate, then, was not vested in the father of Kate J. Boyd during his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">Nothing is given directly by the will to the children, except the library to the sons, and the household furniture contingently to the daughters. Everything else is given to the wife, \u201c to be used, employed, and kept by her during her natural life, for the support of herself, and the support and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>education of the minor children.\u201d It is only that which, may he \u201c remaining \u201d after her death, that he <em>directs </em>to be di vided amongst the children. Their interest, then, attaches at her death, and to that only which may bo then <em>remwming.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">This view is strengthened by the provision in the will for the repayment of any advances the widow might make to the sons; nor does this provision conflict with that requiring the division to be made only among his children who might be alive at the period fixed for the distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">It is clear, then, that, during the life of the widow, no interest in this leasehold vested in the father of Kate J. Boyd. He died before the time for the distribution of the estate arrived; therefore, nothing vested in him or his heir, for the distribution was to be made only amongst the <em>\u201c </em>children \u201d of the testator that might be surviving at the time mentioned in the will for the distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The testator, it would seem from the record, was an educated man, and' from the manner in which he has frequently used the words, <em>\u201csurvivors of them\u201d </em>in his will, we cannot but think that he fully understood their meaning, and that he intended to use them in their ordinary sense, when applied to his children, as he clearly does, in the same sentence, when applied to his executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\u25a0 He directs his <em>\u201c </em>executors, a majority or the survivors of them,\u201d to make the division \u201c equally amongst all my children, male and female, or the survivors of them.\u201d The distribution is to be made by the executors to the children, if all of each class are alive when the period for the division arrives; if not, then it is to be made by one class of survivors to the other class of survivors, \u2014 that is, by those of one class then living to those of the other class then alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">The testator has used apt words to confine the distribution of his property to his own children; and, in the absence of anything indicating a contrary intention, it is but reasonable to presume that he intended what is imported by their ordinary sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">We are, therefore, constrained to hold, that the plaintiff, in the court below, had no interest in the leasehold for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>she brought suit. It follows that it is unnecessary to consider the other questions made in the case, and that the judgment of the court below must be reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b45-5\">Brinkerhoff, O.J., and Scott, Welch, and White, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
