A master is not responsible for the wrongful act of his servant, unless that act be done in execution of the authority, express or implied, given by the master. Beyond the scope of his employment, the servant is as much a stranger to his master\u2018as any third person, and the act of the servant not done in the execution of the service for which he was engaged cannot be regarded as the act of the master.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b118-11\">2. Where the plaintiff after purchasing a ticket as a passenger, applied to the servant of the defendant charged with the duty of checking baggage, to have his baggage checked to his place of destination, and by his importunate conduct and abusive language towards the servant provoked a quarrel, in which the servant, to gratify Ms personal resentment, struck the plaintiff : <em>Held </em>\u2014 That the wrongful act of the servant in striking the plaintiff cannot be regarded as authorized by the master, nor as an act done in the execution of the service for which he was engaged by the master. And the fact that the blow was inflicted with a hatchet furnished by the master, to be used for a wholly different purpose in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the servant\u2019s business, is immaterial as respects the liability of tbe master.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b119-5\">3. A charge to the jury, though not strictly objectionable in point of law, but which leaves the jury to draw an incorrect inference from facts in the <em>case </em>material <em>to the </em>issue, constitutes good grounds for a new trial, where it is reasonable to suppose, from a consideration of the whole evidence, that a different verdict would have been rendered if the jury had been fully instructed. The charge ought not only to be correct, but to be so adapted to the case and so explicit as not to be misconstrued or misunderstood by the jury in the application of the law to the facts as they may find them from the evidence.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-6\">Error to the court of common pleas of Hamilton county.

My wife was.going east <em>via </em>N. Y. <em>&amp; </em>E. R. R., and Mr. Clinton and myself were to accompany her as far as Columbus. We arrived early at the depot \u2014 the first carriage; I think I paid some employe of the road to put my trunks on the platform. I asked Ilalpine if he would please check my baggage ; he made some remark, the purport of which was, he would let me know when he would check my baggage. Then I walked around the depot, and came back and said : I wish you would check my baggage, as my wife and child are waiting for me in the sleeping car.\u2019 I saw baggage being checked and put upon my trunks, and I went around the tables and said : I wish you would check my trunks by the New York and Erie Railroad;\u2019 there were two trunks and' a bonnet-box. He caught hold of me, and shoved me up against some trunks, and said, D \u2014 n you, I told you once I would check your baggage when I got ready.\u2019 He caught me by the right collar, and shoved' me against my left side. I had some cigars in my breast-pocket, -which were broken, and it took my breath away for a moment; other baggage, which had arrived after mine, was being checked; baggage was arriving at the time, and some was checked before and some after mine. My trunks were on top of the platform. After he shoved' me against the trunks or counter, I went outside the tables, and shook my finger in his face, and said, <em>\u2018 </em>You d \u2014 n scoundrel, you shall suffer for this; what do you mean by annoying me in this manner; why don\u2019t you check my baggage ? \u2019 He then seized the hatchet and struck me over the head, saying, God' d \u2014 n you, I\u2019ll kill you.\u2019 I didn\u2019t see him take the hatchet. After striking me he went right on checking baggage.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-6\">J. O. Clinton testified: I live in Cincinnati; have lived here some years; went down with Wetmore from the Spencer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>House in the carriage with his wife and child. The Captain had got tickets at the corner of Front and Broadway, for Columbus, <em>via </em>Little Miami Railroad. His wife was going on east. Captain gave me sleeping-car tickets, and told me to take berths while he got the baggage checked. I went to the sleeping car, and he went to the end of the depot where they checked baggage. I saw his wife and child seated in the berth and remained with them some time. We left the Spencer House at 9.30. Train left at 10.30. It took us, I should think, about 15 minutes to drive down. I went out to see why the Captain didn\u2019t come. Found him at the platform where they checked baggage. Wetmore said, \u2018Will you please check my baggage; \u2019 said this to Halpine; \u2018 My wife and child are waiting for me; \u2019 Halpine did not answer at all. Wetmore was oh the outside of the platform, and Halpine on the inside, where he usually checks the baggage. Wetmore\u2019s baggage was on the platform. This was when I first came out and went out to where Wetmore was standing. We waited some time, perhaps fifteen minutes, but previous to this some other baggage had come on the bus, after our baggage had come. It was all checked while I was standing there. It was placed on the platform, and covered Wetmore\u2019s trunks. This baggage arrived after Wetmore\u2019s. Wetmore waited some time and became very indignant, and walked around the other side of the platform, and said, \u2018 Are you doing this to annoy me; why don\u2019t you check my trunks <em>\\ </em>\u2019 When he said this he was inside the platform, about three feet from it. Halpine answered, giving him a push, \u2018 God' d \u2014 n you, I told you I would check your baggage when I got ready ; get out of here,\u2019 or some such remark, and shoved him against a trunk. Wetmore put his hand to his breast; he had some cigars in his pocket, which were broken. It seemed to knock the breath out of him for a moment. Wet-more went outside of the platform, and stepped up opposite to where Halpine was standing, raised lfis finger, and said, \u2018 You d \u2014 d scoundrel, you shall suffer for annoying- me in tMs manner.\u2019 Halpine then seized a hatchet and struck Mm on the head with the edge, and said, \u2018 You d \u2014 n son of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>b \u2014 h, I\u2019ll kill yon.\u2019 Wetmore fell back; would have fallen, but I supported him. . . . When Halpine struck Wetmore he (Halpine) was checking the baggage, behind the platform for the railroad company \u2014 the usual place. It was while Halpine was engaged in checking baggage for the Little Miami Railroad Company, and while Wetmore was trying to secure checks for his baggage, that Halpine struck the Captain. Wetmore was on the other side of the platform, and Halpine leaned over the platform and struck him. He took the hatchet from a shelf or somewhere behind the counter. After striking Wetmore, Halpine proceeded as usual, checking baggage.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-5\">On behalf of the defendant the following witnesses testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-6\">John Halpine: \u201c In August, 1864, I was baggage-master or check-agent at Little Miami R. R. Depot. My duties were to put the checks on the trunks \u2014- checking was my business. Brelsford was general baggage-master. On the night of 4th August, I left the baggage room about 20 minutes before 10 \u25a0o\u2019clock. As I came up to the tables, Capt. Wetmore was inside the tables. These are movable tables, on which the \u2019baggage is placed, and when trains are not coming in or going out, they are set up against the wall. When we check baggage, they are drawn out and placed end to end \u2014 two on -the east side and two on the west 'side of one of the depot -doors. The tables run from the wall to within a foot or so -of the cars, so that a person can pass between the end and the cars. As I came up and passed around the end, inside -.the tables, Wetmore was having some words with Brelsford. 'The first I heard was Wetmore saying to Brelsford, Cod \u25a0d \u2014 m you, I\u2019ll have you put out of this depot before morning.\u2019 Brelsford told him that he would have to go out- . side the tables, and that he did hot check baggage, and when he saw me he said, There is the check man; now step outside :and get your baggage checked.\u2019 I passed into the check-box \u2022.and got some Saratoga checks, as there was a party of ladies \u25a0there who had been in the waiting-room all the afternoon, sand who were going to Saratoga,:and I -commenced checking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>their trunks for them. Wetmore stepped up and said, I want my baggage checked, sir.\u2019 I told him to pass outside, show his tickets, and he would get his baggage checked. We compel passengers to show their tickets in order to avoid mistakes. There are different routes to New York and other places, and we have to know what route a passenger is going in order to send his baggage the same way. I kept on checking, and Wetmore came up on the inside of the table again, and said, catching me by the shoulder, You God d \u2014 d \u25a0pup, I want you to check my baggage.\u2019 I took him by the arm and led him to the end of the table and told him he would have to keep on the outside; that he would get his baggage checked by having it put upon the tables, and showing his tickets. He came in the inside again, and I told him he would have to keep outside. He then went out of his own accord. Nobody laid hands on him. He passed around outside the tables and came up opposite the place where I was checking, and struck across the table at me with his fist, and said, You God d- \u2014 d son of a b \u2014 h.\u2019 I threw my head back so that he did not hit me. I kept on checking, moving towards the street. There were ladies and gentlemen standing there, and he passed through them towards me and said, You God d \u2014 n son of a b \u2014 h, I\u2019ll fix you now,\u2019 and got his hand behind his coat this way (witness indicates the movement). Tstooped and caught the hatchet, and shoved it at him so \u2014 (witness indicates the motion), and it struck him as he approached the table. The eye through which the handle passes hit him. . . . The hatchet was standing with the handle up, and is used for fastening on straps to trunks or boxes, and fastening on checks. This was an ordiary hatchet, which we had there to nail straps on to trunks. I was at the time in my ordinary business of checking \u2014 was in my usual place.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-5\">Henry Bonte: I was in the employ of the Little Miami Railroad Company when this difficulty occurred, as a porter to handle baggage \u2014 that is, to take trunks off the buses\u2019 and wagons, and bring them into the depot and put them on the tables. Wetmore first asked me to check his baggage; I told1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>him he\u2019d have to wait till the check man came.' He then went to Brelsford inside the tables, and asked him to check his baggage. Brelsford told him he didn\u2019t -check baggage, and he\u2019d have to wait till the check man came. Then we moved the tables out. Wetmo\u2019re\u2019s trunks were on the table, and we put them down on the floor when we moved the tables out. He asked me if I would check his baggage, and offered me fifty cents if I would get his baggage checked. He had some money in his hand. Then Halpine came up, and Brelsford pointed him out as the checker, and Wetmore went to him and told him he wanted to have his baggage checked. Halpine told him to go outside the tables, as no one was allowed inside. Then Wetmore went outside, and Halpine opened his check-box. There were some ladies there who wanted their baggage checked, and they showed their tickets, and Halpine commenced checking for them. Wet-more came inside again and caught Halpine by the shoulder, and said,\u00a3 I want you to check my baggage.\u2019 Halpine told him to go outside, and took him by the arm and put him outside. He didn\u2019t go clear outside, but came back again and said,\u00a3 D \u2014 n you, you won\u2019t be here any longer if you don\u2019t ' check my baggage.\u2019 Halpine told him to go outside, show his tickets, and he would get his baggage checked. He then went outside and came around the table, opposite to where Halpine was, and struck him with his fist across the table, and said,\u00a3 You God d \u2014 n son of a b \u2014 h, if you don\u2019t check my baggage; \u2019 he then went back a little in the crowd, and then came rushing on again, and Halpine struck him with the hatchet. I couldn\u2019t see it hardly, it was too quick done; then Wetmore went away. ... I was standing outside the tables, within two or three feet of Wetmore when he'was struck, and was on the left side of him, and Dick Sohl was on the other side of him. . . . Wetmore was trying all the time to get his baggage checked. When Wetmore went to Halpine and took hold of him, the words he used were, \u00a3 I want you to check my baggage ; \u2019 he spoke to me politely enough. When Wetmore came up I didn\u2019t see Halpine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>strike him. Halpine said to me, \u2018I struck him with a hatchet; \u2019 I was standing two or three feet from Wetmore.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aj0\">Dick Sohl: \u201cI am employed at Little Miami Depot, as porter, to handle baggage, and was so employed in August, 1864:. There were four of ils \u2014 two outside and two inside the tables. Bonte and I were outside the tables. I saw Wetmore talking with Brelsford, and said to him,\u00a3 I want my baggage checked; \u2019 Brelsford said he did not check baggage, and he must wait till the check man came. Then Halpine came up from the baggage room aud went inside the tables. Wetmore stepped up to him and said,\u00a3 I want my baggage checked,\u2019 or something like that. Halpine said to him,\u00a3 If you want your baggage checked you must step outside and show your tickets.\u2019 Wetmore went to the end of the tables, and stepped outside; I believe I saw Wetmore inside again, but didn\u2019t hear what he said, for just then the omnibus came. Afterward Wetmore came irp behind me, where I was standing at. the tables, and came close to me. Then he said to Halpine, \u00a3 You d \u2014 -d son-of-a-b \u2014 h,\u2019 and tried to strike him this way \u2014 (here the witness made a motion, as of a blow). Halpine drew back so that the blow did not reach him. Then I saw Wetmore, and he put his hand behind him so \u2014 (indicating the motion). Wetmore was then at my left side, and when he put his hand behind him in that way, I watched him, intending,'if he pulled out a knife or a pistol, to catch it, so that he should not hurt any one with it. He looked like a man that was very mad. . . . Wetmore came up and struck at Halpine across the counter. Did not hit Halpine. Went back into the crowd, and came up and struck at Hal-pine again; liad his arm raised this way \u2014 (shows position of the arm raised to strike); then Halpine struck him. Did not see Ilaipine strike Wetmore. Had just turned away to go after baggage. When Wetmore came up this second time, at the time Halpine hit him with the hatchet, Wetmore had his arm raised so \u2014; right arm. I was standing on the left side, within six inches of Wetmore.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-5\">Henry Ulm : \u00a3\u00a3 I was working inside the baggage tables ; I was putting baggage inside the baggage car of the night <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>express, which went ont at that time at half-past ten o\u2019clock in the evening. Halpine was checking the baggage. It was about nine o\u2019clock in the evening; more than one hour before the train was to leave. Captain Wetmore came to me before Halpine came, and asked me where the checker was ? I told him he was not there, and he would have to wait a few minutes; just as I told him he would have to wait, Mr. Brelsford came up from the baggage room. Then the Captain went up to Mr. Brelsford and told him to check his baggage. Then Brelsford told him to go outside the tables; that he was not checking yet, and he would have to wait a few minutes; that it was against the rules for anybody to come inside the tables except the officers of the road. When Brelsford told him this, he went outside the tables, then he turned round and came right back again. He told Mr. Brelsford again to check his baggage; Mr. Brelsford told him he would have to wait a few minutes, for the checker was not there; that he must go outside the table and stay outside. Then Wetmore went outside and jnst then Halpine came and commenced checking. Then, as Halpine commenced checking, he came right back inside the tables and told him to check his baggage. Then Johnny Halpine told him he had to go outside the tables, and he would check his baggage just as soon as he could get to it. Wetmore said he would not go outside the tables. Then Halpine told him two or three times to go outside the tables; and he said he would not do it \u2014 that he would not go out for anybody. Then Johnny Halpine took hold of him by the arm and told him to go outside of the tables. Wetmore then went outside and said to Johnny Hal-pine, c God d \u2014 n you, you won\u2019t be inside this depot long.\u2019 After this I did not notice Wetmore particularly any more.\u201d On being asked how it came that he did not see or hear what finally passed between them, the. witness said, \u201cI just had the baggage in my arms and turned round and went to the baggage car. I did not see anything of it then.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-5\">Herman Schore : <em>\u201c </em>The difficulty occurred just before the - night express went out. Capt.

Here you will examine the testimony very carefully; for a railroad company is not liable for every act of its employes. It is liable for their wrongful acts only when they are don\u00e9 by the employes in the course of their employment. When a conductor seizes a man and puts him off a train, he commits an assault. If he does this in exercising his control over a train under his charge, lie commits an assault in the course of his employment. If the man is wrongfully put off, the railroad company is liable. . Hence, in this case, the defendant is not liable unless the assault complained of was committed by Halpine in the course of his employment. Now, when a train is about to start, and a number of pieces of baggage are waiting to be checked, and the owners are pressing for priority, the baggage-master, or whatever may be the proper designation of the employe who has charge and superintendence of checking baggage, taking one trunk at a time, necessarily selects in turn the pieces which he cheeks.- In doing this he is acting in the course of his business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-10\">\u201c The plaintiff has offered testimony for the purpose of showing that, at the time of the alleged assault, there was an accumulation of baggage in defendant\u2019s passenger depot; that a train was about to start; that Halpine was employed by the defendant to take charge of and superintend the checking of the baggage; that he was in his place, his regular employment, and was selecting and checking other baggage lately arrived, in preference to the plaintiff\u2019s, when he committed the assault; and that he gave the blow with an instrument put into his hands by the defendant, to be used by Mm in the employment in which he was then engaged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>\u201cNotwithstanding this, even if you find all these to be proved, still, if you find that the employe struck the plaintiff as a personal act, on his own account, not in the way of carrying on his business, you will find for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-5\">\u201c On the other hand, if you find these proved, and if you find that he struck the plaintiff by way of facilitating his business, carrying out his own selection and order of checking baggage, and enforcing his authority, and with an implement given him by the defendant for the purpose of carrying on his employment, and you further find he did it without fault on the part of the plaintiff, you will be authorized to find for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-6\">\u201cIf you find for the plaintiff, you will assess damages.

Whereupon the court replied: \u201c It would not be sufficient; a man, while in the employ of the defendant, may do many acts for which the defendant cannot be held liable. He may be engaged in his own business, or even be out of the county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>or State, though still in the hire of the defendant.

If this were a suit by Wetmore for damages against Halpine as an individual, it may be safely assumed that a verdict for the defendant would have followed, on the ground that there was sufficient reason for Halpine to apprehend grievous bodily harm, and that he struck in self-defence; but the strong point in this regard is, that Halpine, the man who did the injury, is not the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-17\">2. When is the master liable for the wilful act or trespass of his servant; or when can a corporation be made liable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>such an act? See Smith's Master and Servant (2d ed.), pp. 135 (side page 158), 183; Story on Agency, sec. 452; <em>Croft </em>v. <em>Alison, </em>4. B. <em>&amp; </em>A. 590; <em>McManus </em>v. Crickett, 1 East, 67.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-6\">Can it be for a moment doubted in this' case, but that Hal-pine struck Wetmore to effect some purpose of his own. His testimony, and that of Sohl, the witness who stood near, is, that, from what Wetmore said and did, they supposed he was about to draw a knife or pistol, and hence the blow was given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-7\">It does not matter, in this connection, whether that supposition of Halpine\u2019s was well founded or not; this testimony shows that the blow was given by Halpine in self-defence, or <em>\u201c </em>some (other) purpose of his own.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-8\">If Halpine was employed by defendant to check baggage, and proceeds to beat people about the head, he is certainly quitting sight of the object for which he is employed, and no longer has in view his master\u2019s orders, but is pursuing that which his own malice suggests, and is no longer acting in pursuance of the authority given him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-9\">The petition should state, and the evidence should show, that the act complained of was in some way within the scope of the agency; which is not done, and cannot be done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-10\">The wilful act of the servant cannot and ought not to make his master liable, unless done in the course of seiwice. Of course there are wilful acts for which the master is responsible, because done in the course of the employment. A conductor puts a man off of a train; the act.is wilful, but it is in the course of the conductor\u2019s employment, for that he is hired to do; but for a wilful act entirely foreign to the business, the master cannot be held liable, without breaking down all the rules of law that relate to this subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-11\">The liability arises from the fact that the servant is doing the master\u2019s business, and, in so far, is the master himself; but when not doing his master\u2019s business, no relation between them exists any longer. Smith on Master and Servant, p. 136 (side page 160); <em>Cox, Brainard &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Keahey, </em>36 Ala. 340, 344; <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>8 A. &amp; E. 512.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Agencies can only be instituted to do lawful things; and if they are limited to this sphere, how can it be exceeded ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b133-5\">It is no answer to this to say that railroad employes can beat anybody, and there is no remedy to the aggrieved party; there is precisely the same remedy as in any other case. Mr. Iialpine can be sent to one of the public institutions of Columbus, for a term of years, or his natural life; or he can be sued in a civil action for damages; and the fact that he is not pecuniarily responsible, but the railroad is, ought not to change the established rules of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b133-6\">The case of the <em>Steamboat Ohio </em>v. <em>Stunt, </em>10 Ohio St. 582, in effect, holds that the master is not responsible for an assault by his servant, with which assault the master was in no wise connected.

The act of striking Wetmore was not an act which Halpine in his. business of checking baggage was called upon to do; it was not an act which forwarded the business of his employer; his agency and its whole scope was to do lawful things, and when he commits this unlawful act, he goes outside of his business; he is not doing a lawful thing negligently, or even wilfully so; he is doing an illegal act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b133-8\">Reference is also made to <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>8 D. &amp; E. 533; <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Essex Bank, </em>17 Mass. 308, 309.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b133-9\">In <em>Mechanics' Bank </em>v. <em>Bank of Columbia, </em>5 Wheat. 326, it is said that the liability of the principal depends rtpon the facts \u2014 (1) That the act was done in the exercise; and (2) Within the limits of the powers delegated.

That would have been outside of his business.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-6\">If it be shown that hitting folks with a hatchet is the usual, ordinary, or customary mode of checking baggage; or that it is in any way useful in that employment; that it is necessary to do so before one can get the trunks on board of the train; or that it facilitates the business, and enables the business of checking to be carried on more expeditiously, or with greater satisfaction to the parties \u2014 railroad employers may be liable for acts similar to that of Halpine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-7\">But if none of these things are in the ordinary routine of business; if there is nothing in the vocation of baggage master that calls for hatchets and force and arms; if the assault is in no way the natural or necessary consequence of handling the baggage \u2014 then it is not an act contemplated by the master, and not within the scope of the employment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-8\"><em>Vanderbilt </em>v. <em>Richmond Turnpike Co., </em>2 Conn. <em>479, 482; Wright </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>19 Wend. 343, 345, 347; <em>Roe </em>v. <em>The Birkenhead, Lancashire and Cheshire Junction Railway Co., </em>7 E.

He was baggage-master, and as such was engaged checking the baggage of passengers at the time of this assault. He was at the post assigned to him, and in pursuit of his usual avocation. The hatchet used on the occasion of the assault was a necessary implement to him in the conduct of the business of his employment, placed in his hands by his master so as better to carry out that business. The company gave to him the instrument, the opportunity, and the power, and left their use to his discretion alone. Of this discretion he availed himself in this case in the manner stated, by way of facilitating his business, and enforcing his authority upon the defendant, Wetmore. That the act was wanton and malicious, cannot be denied; but this, under the modern rulings, in nowise relieves from responsibility his master, the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-6\">The jury, after careful consideration of the facts, found that Halpine was, at the time of this assault, acting within the scope of his employment.

Was it not violative of his duty to refuse to check Wetmore\u2019s baggage as re-quested ? Proceeding in his business of checking baggage, in conducting \u2014 managing \u2014 the business of checking bag-gage, he violates his duty, and refuses to check Wetmore\u2019s baggage.

Could a clearer case ever be made of an assault occurring in the conduct of the business of the agent or -servant ?

The difficulty arises in the application of the rule to the peculiar facts of the case. Halpine, the person guilty of the wrong, as the servant of the company, was charged with the duty of-checking the baggage of passengers; and whatever liability, if any, devolved upon the company for the consequences of his wrongful acts, grew out of the relation of master and servant which existed between him and the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The general\u00bb rule as to the liability of the master for the wrongful acts of his servant, is thus stated by Mr. Smith in his work on Master and Servant: \u201c A master is ordinarily liable to answer in a civil suit, for the tortious or wrongful acts of his servant, if those acts are done in the course of his employment in his master\u2019s service. The maxims applicable to such cases being <em>respondeat </em>superior, and that before alluded to, <em>qui faeitper alium faeit per se. </em>This rule, with some few exceptions, which will hereafter be pointed out, is of universal application; whether the act of the servant be one of omission or commission, whether negligent, fraudulent, or deceitful, or even if it be an act of positive malfeas-. anee or misconduct, <em>if it be done in the course of Ms employment, </em>his master is responsible for it <em>ewiliter </em>to third persons.\u201d Smith\u2019s M. <em>&amp; </em>S. s. p. 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">But, to make the master responsible, the act of the servant must be done in the course of his employment, that is, under the express or implied authority of the master. Beyond the scope of his employment, the servant is as much a stranger to his master as any third person, and the act of the servant-not done in the execution of the service for which he was engaged cannot be regarded as the act of the master.

Co., </em>L. R. 2 Q. B. 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>That there was in this ease no express authority given to the servant, is conceded. Can such authority be implied under the circumstances of the case from the nature of the business intrusted to his charge? The company contends that it cannot; and the tenth instruction was asked on the grounds that there was no evidence tending to show such authority. For the plaintiff below, it is insisted that the servant was impliedly invested with such powers as were essential to the regular and certain performance of his duties; that for the dispatch of his business, in certain emergencies, he must be considered as authorized to suppress by force, if necessary, any interference with, or obstruction of, the quick and certain discharge of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Without undertaking to lay down a general rule to govern all cases, it may safely be admitted that the servant is invested with authority to use the' neeessary means to the performance of the duties assigned him; and that the character of the \u25a0means that may be used will vary according to the nature of the duty to be performed and the attending circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">But, in looking at the evidence, it is to be noticed that the assault complained of was not committed in endeavoring to eject the plaintiff from the space enclosed by the tables, over which the servant may be supposed to have had a special control.: The plaintiff, according to his own statement, had gone outside of the tables, and was shaking his finger in Halpine\u2019s face, and addressing him with an opprobrious epithet.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">It seems to us the assault was in no way calculated to facilitate or promote the business for which the servant was employed by the .master; nor could it have been supposed to be, or intended, as, an act done with that view or object. It is not a case of excess of force and violence in executing the authority of the master, but rather an act beyond such authority and foreign to the objects of the employment. There was no evidence tending to show that Halpine had any charge of the portions of depot not allotted for the purpose of checking baggage; neither did his employment imply any authority or control over the persons of passengers or others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>who might be found there. Nor is this the case of an act done from a wrong judgment in regard to a matter committed by the master to the discretion of the servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Another ground assumed is, that the assault was an act of the servant done in part execution of the contract of carriage betweeu the plaintiff and the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">This is merely presenting the question in a different form, the principle being the same as that already referred to, namely: whether the act was done in the execution or performance of the service for which the servant was engaged. Whether the service to be rendered by the master is in the performance of a contract, or in the discharge of any other duty resting on him, can, it is conceived, make no difference the question being, in either case, whether the act is' within the scope .of the servant\u2019s express or implied authority in respect to the master\u2019s service.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In order to withdraw this case from the operation of the general rule, and hold the company responsible on the ground of its contract with the plaintiff as a passenger, it is necessary to maintain that the company, in requiring the plaintiff to apply to its servant for the purpose and as the only means of getting his baggage checked, impliedly undertook to vouch for and warrant the good conduct of the servant towards the plaintiff while the two were engaged in transacting the business. Whether this position is tenable, we do not find it necessary in the decision of the case now before us to express a definitive opinion. The case was not tried on this theory in the court below, nor has this phase of the question been argued here.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Rut if any such rule of liability could be applied against the company, it would necessarily impose the reciprocal duty upon the plaintiff to so demean himself towards the servant as not, by misbehavior, to provoke a personal quarrel between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The evidence of the company on the trial tended strongly to prove that the plaintiff, by his importunate conduct and abusive language towards the servant, provoked a personal quarrel between <em>them; </em>that the assault was the result of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>quarrel, and that the blow was inflicted by the servant as an act of personal resentment. If these facts had been found by the jury, the wrongful act of the servant in striking the plaintiff could not be regarded as authorized by the master, nor as an act done by the servant in the execution of the service for which he was engaged by the master. The fact that the blow was inflicted with a hatchet furnished by the master to be used for a wholly different purpose, though in connection with the servant\u2019s business, was wholly immaterial as respects the liability of the master. If he would not otherwise have been liable for the assault, the fact that it was committed with <em>his </em>hatchet did not contribute to make him so.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The existence of the quarrel and its bearing upon the character of the assault was not noticed in the charge. And if the jury found the quarrel to have been of the character which we have stated the evidence tended to show it, they were not advised as to the influence it might properly have in enabling them to determine whether the assault was an act done in the course of the servant\u2019s employment, or was merely his own personal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">It is true, the charge stated the general rule correctly. But the difficulty encountered by the jury, as shown by the nature of the case and by the questions they propounded to the court, was to ascertain how to apply the general rule to the peculiar facts of the case in making up their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The reference made in the charge to the use for which the hatchet was provided, was calculated, we think, to make an erroneous impression on the jury on the very point on which their verdict hinged. And, furthermore, the charge, from the generality of its terms, failed to give the jury the assistance they ought to have received in view of the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">A charge though not strictly objectionable in point of law, but which leaves the jury to draw an incorrect inference from facts in the case material to the issue, will constitute good ground for a new trial, where it is reasonable to suppose, from a consideration of the whole evidence, that a dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>ferent verdict would have been rendered if the jury had been fully instructed. The charge ought not only to be correct, but to be so adapted to the case and so explicit as not to be misconstrued or misunderstood by the jury, in the application of the law to the facts as they may find them from the evidence.
