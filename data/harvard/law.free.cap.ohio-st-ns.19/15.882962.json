A bequest of the right to take tolls upon a road, in trust to pay out of the tolls to a third person a specified sum. monthly, is not in the nature of a demonstrative legacy to such third person, and upon failure or insufficiency of the tolls the monthly instalments cannot be charged upon the estate.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b23-11\">3. In such case the expense of making necessary repairs upon the road, in order to make the tolls available, including a reasonable compensation to the trustee, is chargeable upon the tolls, and not upon the estate, unless the contrary appears from other provisions in the will.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b23-12\">8. The general direction in item first of the will, that all \u201c debts\u201d and just \u201ccharges\u201d shall be paid out of the testator\u2019s estate is not sufficient to show such contrary intention.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-13\">Error to the district court of Green county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>This case involves a single question relating to the con-, struction of the last will of William E. Morris.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-5\"><em>Item </em>first of the will directs that the \u201c debts \u201d of the testa tor and \u201call just charges\u201d shall be paid out of his \u201cestate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-6\">By <em>itrem </em>fourth certain real estate is devised to trustees, to be held during the minority of testator\u2019s daughter, with power to sell ; and the trustees are directed to \u201c take and receive the rents and profits\u201d that should accrue during the continuance of their estate, and \u201c therewith make all necessary <em>repairs, </em>pay all taxes and otlier necessary <em>charges </em>and <em>expenses </em>to and about the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-7\">By <em>item </em>sixth the testator bequeathed to said trustees all his \u201c right to take tolls \u201d upon a certain turnpike road, and certain (worthless) stock which he owned in the road company, in trust that they should pay out of the tolls and dividends on the stock twenty-five dollars per month to the testator\u2019s mother during her natural life, and pay the residue of the same to testator\u2019s wife and daughter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-8\">The testator\u2019s right to take these tolls was derived under a sale on execution against the company, made in pursuance of a statute enacted for that purpose. The right was unavailable unless the owner would keep up repairs upon the road, and the testator had for many years kept them up at his own expense, the company being hopelessly insolvent, if not extinct Soon after testator\u2019s death the road was found to be so ruinous, that it became necessary to apply all the tolls for a time to repairs, and thus suffer the monthly payments due the mother to run in arrears. This she objected to, and claimed that the repairs were chargeable upon the estate generally, and not upon the tolls; while the trustee (one only having accepted the trust) claimed that the repairs, as well as a reasonable compensation to him for his services, were chargeable upon the tolls.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-9\">The mother, who is plaintiff here, then filed her petition against the trustee, making the daughter and wife also parties, asking a construction of the will, that the necessary repairs be charged upon the estate, and that her twenty-five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>dollars per month be paid to her, irrespective of repairs or other charges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-5\">The common pleas held that the cost of repairs, including a reasonable compensation to the trustee, was chargeable upon the tolls, and decreed accordingly. The case was taken by appeal to the district court, where a similar judgment was rendered. And now the plaintiff seeks to reverse the latter judgment by her petition in error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-6\"><em>John Little </em>for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-7\">1. The will is silent as to repairs of the road, unless included in the \u201c charges \u201d mentioned in the first item, which are. payable out of the general <em>\u201c </em>estate \u201d of the testator, upon the same footing with his debts. And as the testator, under the trusts of the fourth item, directs the trustee <em>to malee repairs, </em>it is reasonable to infer that he either meant to include repairs of the road under the general term <em>\u201c </em>charges\u201d in the first item, and to provide for their payment out of his estate generally, or <em>designedly </em>omitted to provide for repairs, because <em>not liable to malee them. </em>As to rules for the construction of wills, see <em>Worman </em>v. <em>Teagarden, </em>2 Ohio St. 380; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Thompson, 4 </em>Ohio St. 333.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-8\">2. As the testator has made no <em>express </em>provision for repairs of the road, and, unless included in the charges payable out of his <em>general </em>estate, has made none <em>by fair intendment, </em>so neither does the law by implication impose upon the trustee the duty of repairs. <em>Shephard </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>cited in 2 Jarman on Wills, 201.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-9\">3. The testator\u2019s right, depended upon and was defined and limited by statute. S. &amp; O. 337. By his purchase he had only the right to take tolls, and was vested with none of the <em>franchises </em>of the company. Had he sold or assigned his <em>right, </em>the purchaser or assignee would have been subjected to \u2022 <em>no duty to repair. </em>The will is but an assignment \u2014 a transfer of a precise estate, accurately defined by law without express condition or encumbrance. If neither the testator nor the law creating the estate imposes the .condition of repairs, how can the court do it without legislating \u2014 without making. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>a new will for the testator, or adding, to the terms of the statute?</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-5\">4. If \u2022 the l\u2019epairs were a charge upon. the tolls, etc., and were to be made to the exclusion of the plaintiff, then, inasmuch as the plaintiff\u2019s legacy was <em>for her support, </em>it was payable at all events, and it was and is a <em>demonstrative </em>legacy. And whether from the insufficiency of the fund out of which it is payable, or because of its exhaustion for precedent uses, the plaintiff has not received it or does not enjoy it, it is payable by the executrix out-of the general assets. 2 U. S. Dig. 760, sec. 88; 2 U. S. Eq. Dig. 227, sec. 533; see also p. 228, sec. 538; <em>Gilbreath &amp; Wife </em>v. <em>Winter's Executors, </em>10 Ohio, 64; 1 Roper on Leg. 150, 153.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-6\">5. The trustee was allowed reasonable compensation for his services. He is not entitled to compensation. The will makes no provision for him. 2 Story Eq. Jur., sec. 1268; p. 348, note 5; <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Sutliff, </em>3 Ohio St. 149.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b26-7\"><em>P. Odlim, </em>and <em>P. F. Howard </em>for defendants in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-8\">1. The first clause of the will is the usual one. The word -\u201c charges \u201d in it refers to funeral expenses, costs of adminisftration, etc., but has no reference whatever to the repairs of :the turnpike given' specifically in the sixth clause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-9\">2. The law imposes upon the trustees the obligation of keeping the trust estate in repair. If the testator would -discharge it from repairs, he must so affirm. Hill on Trus-tees (Ed. of 1846), p. 571.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-10\">3. If no right to repair exists, either by implication or with-out the consent of the company, repairs out of the <em>general fund </em>would be equally objectionable. The property cannot ibe preserved without impairs; but they must be made by the <em>\u25a0 owner, </em>as in case of all other perishable property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-11\">4. The legacy in item sixth is not a <em>demonstrative, </em>but a \u2022specific legacy, and if the fund fails, it is adeemed, the legacy fails. In other words, manifestly and clearly by the language and intent, the legacy is to be derived from this estate dn <em>tolls </em>and <em>stoch, </em>and <em>nothing else. </em>Redf. on Wills (Ed. of 1866), p. 457, part 2; <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Lockerman, </em>11 Gill <em>&amp; </em>J. 185; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>Gilbreath </em>v. <em>Winter's </em>Executors, 10 Ohio, 64; <em>Creed </em>v. <em>Creed, </em>11 Clark <em>&amp; Fin. </em>491; <em>Heneago v. Lord </em>Andover, 3 Young <em>&amp; </em>Jarvis, Exch. Rep. 370, 371.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-5\">5. There was no error in the court below allowing reasonable compensation to the trustee. Hill on Trustees, 577.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b27-6\">Welch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax\">We see no error in this judgment. The ground assumed, that the money payable to the mother is in the nature of a demonstrative legacy, is clearly untenable. It is not a legacy at all. It is a trust fund, payable out of a specific legacy, and must be satisfied from that legacy alone, unless the contrary appears in other provisions of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Counsel say that the contrary does appear in <em>items </em>first and fourth of the will. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">The direction contained in <em>item </em>first is nothing more than the general provision found in most wills for the payment of debts. The addition of the words \u201c all just <em>charges,\u201d </em>does not in our opinion change the meaning in the least.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">As to <em>item </em>fourth, it is quite unnecessary to say, that the words \u201c repairs,\u201d \u201c charges,\u201d and \u201c expenses,\u201d therein, refer to the real estate devised by that <em>item. </em>The plain reading of the <em>item </em>is, that the \u201c repairs,\u201d \u201c charges,\u201d and <em>\u201c </em>expenses \u201d mentioned, are the repairs, charges, and expenses <em>\u201c </em>to and about the <em>same </em>\u201d \u2014 that is, to and about the land devised.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">We also concur with the court below in holding that the trustee is entitled to charge a compensation for his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b27-12\">Day, O.J., and Beinkerhoef, Scott, and White, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
