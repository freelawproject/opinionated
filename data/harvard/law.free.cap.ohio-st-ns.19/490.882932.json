M. </em>and <em>J. E. Smith </em>for plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-11\">1. We would not undertake to deny, if Item 1st of the will was the only one which related to the disposition of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>estate, that under it Mrs. Baxter would have taken all the property of her husband absolutely! But such is <em>not </em>the case. Both Items 2 and 3, so far as they are operative, limit the interest before given to the widow to a life estate, and direct what shall be done with the estate on the death of Mrs. Baxter. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>15 Ohio, <em>561; Thompson </em>v. Thompson, 4 Ohio St. 351; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Hoop, </em>6 Ohio St. 487; <em>Brasher </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>15 Ohio St. 108; Redfield on Wills, vol. 1, 431 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-5\">If, then, on a fair interpretation of this will, it appears that the intention of Mr. Baxter was to give his wife but a life estate in his property, and that on her death it should pass to the other devisees, it would seem clear, on authority, that this intention must be carried out by the court, unless it contravenes some other principle of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-6\">2. To the argument of counsel for defendants, that the bequest first made to her was of the whole estate absolutely, and that there was nothing left to go to the other legatees ; that it is contrary to the settled principles of law to allow a limitation over on a fee-simple estate, etc, \u2014 we reply: while denying, as we have already done, that there was, taking the whole will together, the gift of a fee-simple estate to the widow, we claim that the authorities relied upon by opposing counsel do not sustain their positions. In each of the cases referred to in their brief, it will be seen, on examination, that an <em>absolute estate </em>and jiower of disposition was given to the first taker, <em>and for his use. </em>And as nothing of the kind appears in the Baxter will, as we claim, the cases above examined are not in point in this. The doctrine of these cases, as it is stated by Judge Redfield in his work on Wills, vol. 1, page 676, sec. 19,hath this extent only: \u201cThat where personal estate (or real) is <em>given absolutely to one with no limitation or restriction upon his title, </em>a subsequent bequest of so much as the legatee should be possessed of at the time of his death, without leaving issue, is void, as being repugnant to the first bequest.\u201d Surely the rule ought not, at this day, be made more stringent than this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-7\">' 3. But whatever may have formerly been the decisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>our courts, or those in England, on questions of this charac- - ter, we think the tendency of courts in both countries, in later times, is towards a more sensible and rational doctrine; and that is, to favor the manifest intention of testators, and to be exceedingly averse to finding such a total repugnancy to exist between the devise to the first taker, and the limitation over, as to render the latter void. 1 Redfield, p. 444, and post, sec. 1 and note 3; sec. 2 and note 6; secs. 9, 13, 16, and 17, and note 36; also p. 679, secs. 20, 21, and 23; <em>Sherrall v.

As to the non-election of the widow : \"We claim that Mrs. Baxter having died within the time limited by law for the making of her election, and without having made the same in the legal mode, the devise for her benefit never took effect; and that at the death of her husband, by operation of law, her right of dower in his estate became vested; that the same not having been subsequently barred by her own act, at her death her estate in the lands of her husband ceased and determined, and consequently that only her distributive share of her husband\u2019s personal estate passed to her heirs-at-law, the defendants in this case. The nature of this electing act, the circumstances under which it is to be done, and the legal effect bf it, are specifically set forth in sections 43, 44, 45, and 46 of the Statute of Wills. See <em>Davis et al. </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>11 Ohio St. 386; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>20 Verm. 270; <em>Stilley </em>v. <em>Folger et al., </em>14 Ohio, 610; <em>Delay </em>v. <em>Vinal, </em>1 Metc. 57; <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Felton, </em>4 Cushing, 174; <em>Merril </em>v. <em>Emery, 10 </em>Pick. 507; <em>Boone's Representatives </em>v. <em>Boone, </em>3 Harris &amp; McHenry, 95; <em>Welch et al. </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>20 Misso. 293.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-8\">Looking, then, at this case in the different aspects in which it has been presented on either side, it would seem that there are three views, one of which must be adopted as the true one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-9\">1. If the construction of the will, as claimed by the counsel for the heirs of Mrs. Baxter, be the correct one, viz.: that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the devise to the widow was of an absolute estate, and the limitation over void, and, in addition to this, that no election was necessary under our law to give to her the estate devised, instead of her dower and rights by law; then, of course, the whole estate, on her death, passed to her brothers and sisters. But all of these propositions must be true, or the result will not follow; failure on either is fatal to their claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-5\">2. If the widow took but a life estate in the property of her husband, by the will, and no formal election was necessary on her part for the acceptance of the devise; then clearly, at her death, the whole estate would pass as provided in Items 2 and 3 of the will, and the heirs of Mrs. Baxter would receive nothing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-6\">3. If Mrs. Baxter took under the will a life estate, or an estate with power of sale, if she chose to exercise it, and the limitation over is good; and, by our law, an election is necessary before a widow can be barred of her dower or distributive share of a husband\u2019s estate \u2014 then, as she did not, in fact, make such election, on her death her heirs are entitled tc such share of the personal estate left by D. \"W. Baxter, as his widow, on distribution, would have been entitled to had he died intestate and without children, viz.: the one-half of the first $400, and the one-third of the residue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-7\">This last view is the one adopted by us at the time of the filing of the petition for the construction of this will, and subsequent examination has but strengthened the opinion of its correctness.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b503-8\"><em>Matson &lt;&amp; Paxton </em>and <em>Caldwell de Coppoch </em>for defendants :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-9\">By the terms of the will, the devisee, Deborah Baxter, wife of the testator, took an estate in fee-simple. The limitation over to the Missions, as claimed by the plaintiff, is void, being inconsistent with the former estate granted to Mrs. Baxter. To admit that a remainder could be limited, on such a title as Mrs. Baxter takes under this will, would certainly confound all our ideas of ownership of property. We refer to a number of decisions, in which all that we contend for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>has been definitely settled in our favor. It will be found that in all cases wherever the right of absolute disposal of property is given, the fee passes, and no remainder can be .limited on such estate. It will be seen, too, that it is a matter of no importance whether the party thus taking the property has disposed of it or not. The title is complete on the taking effect of the will. <em>The Attorney-General, etc. </em>v. Hall, Fitzgibbon, 314; <em>Goodtitle ex dem. Pearson </em>v. <em>Otway, </em>2 Wilson's Rep. 6; 4 Kent's Com. 270; <em>Ide </em>v. <em>Ide, </em>5 Mass. 500; <em>Jackson ex dem. Brewster </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>10 Johns. 19; <em>Pells </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>Cro. Jac. 590; 1 Salk. 299; Powell, 1; <em>Jackson ex dem. Bush </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>2 Johns. 392; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>16 Johns. 537; <em>Ramsdell et al. </em>v. <em>Ramsdell, </em>8 Shipley (Maine), 288.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-5\">It is true that, as a general rule, the intention of the testator is to prevail. This, however, is always subject to that other inflexible rule, that such intention must be consistent with the'primdiples of law and the established rules of property. In making a will a man does not become a lawgiver; his intention cannot contravene the laws and policy of the government. This principle is well expressed in the case of <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>11 Wendell, 260. See also <em>King </em>v. <em>Ackerman, </em>2 Black, 408.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-6\">2. As to the election of the widow:</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-7\">This is not a case where any election was necessary; it is not one of the cases contemplated by the statute. Here the whole property is given \u2014 the whole, with all its parts, vests on the- death of the testator. The widow is endowed of the lands of her husband; she has no dower in her own lands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-8\">But if we should admit that this was one of the instances where the statute required an election, still the case would be equally clear in our favor. The widow did not live through the year in which she was required to elect; she died a few months after the death of her husband. She had possession of all the property (except such parts of the personal property as she had disposed of), treating it as her own.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-9\">The cases are numerous in which the- courts have had before them the question: <em>\u201c </em>What are the rights of the widow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>when she has died before the expiration of the time in which she was required to elect and has made no election ? \u201d This question has always been decided the same way, that the widow will be presumed to have elected to take what would be most beneficial to her. If the provision in the will was of greater value than the dower, she has been presumed to have elected to take it. It has also been held, that the provision in the will vests on the taking effect of the will, without reference to the election. <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>32 Maine, 132; <em>Thompson v. McGee, </em>1 Metc. 66; <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Emery, </em>10 Pick. 507; <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Felton, </em>4 Cushing, 174; <em>Vaughan </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>30 Ala. 329; <em>Lessee of Thompson </em>v <em>Hoop, </em>6 Ohio St. 485.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b505-5\">Welch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7R\">The first question involved is, whether, by the terms of the will, the wife took an absolute estate in fee, or only a life interest. The language of the first item, construed by itself, would undoubtedly give her a fee. But the whole will must be construed together;. and in the light of the whole will, and of the surrounding circumstances, each clause is to receive its interpretation. It is only in cases of total and irreconcilable repugnancy, that any of the provisions of a will can be rejected. It is claimed that there is such a repugnancy here, and that the two last items of this will must be stricken out, leaving the first item to stand alone as the testator\u2019s will. Having disposed of the whole estate absolutely by the first item, the other two items, it is said, are a mere attempt to do what the law will not permit, to engraft a remainder upon a fee-simple estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">It is true that a remainder cannot be engrafted upon a fee. The true reason of this rule, however, is not because the law will not permit it, but because the thing is impossible. I cannot give the <em>whole </em>of my estate to one, and <em>part </em>of it to another. I cannot give the absolute fee to my wife, and the remainder to the church, for the same reason that I cannot give a square circle, or give nothing, because it involves an. absurdity. But before this rule can be applied, it must first be well ascertained that the will in question <em>does, </em>when con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>strued fairly, and in the light of all its provisions and sur roundings, give an estate in fee. Whether this will does so, is the very question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The testator\u2019s intention is the polar star in the construction \u25a0of a will. It is quite evident on the face of this will, and in view of the fact that neither the testator nor his wife had .any children, that he intended his property should go to her .and the presbytery, to the exclusion of all others. By the .\u25a0last two items he undertakes to dispose of the entire estate in remainder. He gives, unconditionally and absolutely, .$200 for tombstones, and a sum sufficient to defray the \u2022expenses of the wife\u2019s last sickness and death; and then provides that, when these two things have been adjusted, \u201c all \u2022the property <em>then </em>remaining\u201d shall go to the presbytery. <em>When </em>remaining ? Why, remaining after the deduction of \u2022these two sums. In other words, all the estate, except these two sums, and the widow\u2019s life interest, shall go to the presbytery. These last two items constitute a very important part of the will, and are not to be rejected if they can at all -be reconciled with the provisions in the first item. To reject hem <em>m toto </em>would be doing much greater violence to thp language of the will than would be done by holding that the testator intended by the provisions of the first item to give a life estate only. What are the provisions of the first item <em>% </em>They are simply these: He gives his \u201c property \u201d to his wife, with the unrestricted right to <em>\u201cpossess </em>\u201d and <em>\u201cuse\u201d </em>it, and with .a power of <em>\u201csale\u201d </em>to be exercised publicly or privately. The provisions as to the \u201cpossession\u201d and \u201cuse\u201d of the property .add nothing to the word property, and certainly do not import \u2022an absolute estate. Indeed, their introduction at all, after .the clause devising the \u201c property,\u201d would seem to negative the idea that the testator supposed he had already vested the property absolutely in his wife. If he supposed he had .already made her the absolute owner, why make <em>cmy </em>provision as to her manner of <em>usvng </em>or <em>possessing </em>it. She would, as a matter of course, use and possess <em>her own </em>property as she pleased. The same may be said of the power to <em>sdl. </em>The absolute owner of property can sell it when and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>where he pleases. But the tenant for life cannot sell without a power granted for that purpose. When so granted, <em>prima, facie, </em>it is in the nature of an executorial power, or power to change the property into money for the benefit of the estate, or for its better enjoyment. That such is the nature of the power intended here, is also to be argued from the fact that a similar power is given to the wife to collect and pay the debts of the estate. The only thing, therefore, in the first item, which is actually, or even apparently, repugnant to the limitation over, is this word \u201cproperty.\u201d The testator gives to his wife all his \u201c property.\u201d If he had added the words \u201cfor life\u201d after the word property, all parts of the will would harmonize, and nothing need be rejected. But any equivalent words will surely answer the same purpose ; and words fully equivalent are found in the provisions of <em>items </em>two and three. Read together, the two apparently conflicting provisions would stand thus: \u201cI give all my property to my wife, with remainder in fee at her death to the presbytery of Cincinnati.\u201d Such is substantially the language of the will construed in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>6 Peters, 68. Indeed the language there was more repugnant than here. The language there was, \u201cI give to my wife Elizabeth Goodwin all my personal estate ... to and for her own use and benefit, <em>and disposal absolutely; </em>the remainder of said estate, after her decease, to be for the use of said Jesse Goodwin.\u201d And yet the court held, Chief-Justice Marshall delivering the opinion, that .the wife took only a life estate, and that the limitation over was effectual. Substantially to the same effect are many other eases, both English and American. Most of the authorities cited by .counsel, where an apparently contrary doctrine has been held, are distinguishable from the present case by a single peculiarity. In most of them the subject-matter of the limitation over was, not the remainder of the estate, but such part of the estate as the first devisee or legatee <em>chose to learn. </em>Thus, in the leading ease of <em>Att'y-Gen. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>Fitzgibbon, 314, the subject-matter of the limitation over was, \u201cso much as he should be <em>possessed </em>of at his death.\u201d In <em>Ide </em>v. <em>Ide, </em>5 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>500, it was \u201c the estate he shall <em>lerneP </em>In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>10 J. R., it was \u201c the property he died <em>possessed </em>of.\u201d In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>16 J. R., 537, it was \u201csuch estate as should remain unsold, <em>umdevised, </em>or unbequeathed.\u201d These and the like cases are clearly distinguishable from the present one. They are cases where the testator gives to the first devisee full dominion and control over the estate, and then, under <em>Ike form </em>of a limitation over, undertakes to make, as it were, a <em>will </em>for the first devisee, to take effect in case the first' devisee should fail to make one for himself, or otherwise to dispose of the property. This the testator cannot do. Every one has the right to dispose of his own property. To make one the absolute owner of my property, and at the same time retain any power in my own hands to control or dispose of it, is simply impossible. In the cases referred to, where the limitation was held to be void, the repugnancy was total and irreconcilable. The language of the will left no escape, in those cases, from the conclusion, that the testator intended to give the first devisee absolute dominion and control over the property. There was no escape, because the <em>bimitation itself, </em>as well as the previous devise, necessarily <em>implied </em>such absolute power and dominion, by making the thing limited over, its existence or non-existence, to depend upon the <em>pleasure </em>of the first devisee. Such a limitation cannot be sustained, because it is only a limitation in <em>words, </em>and not a limitation in fact, or in law. It is in legal effect what the will here would be if it had read: \u201c I give all my property to my wife, and <em>she </em>may give to the presbytery of Cincinnati such part of it as she chooses to give.\u201d Such is not the legal meaning and effect of the will under consideration. It simply gives the property to the wife, with remainder at her decease to the uses specified in items two and three. A,majority of the court are satisfied -that these provisions are not necessarily repugnant, but are reconcilable upon the theory that the wife took a life estate and life maintenance, with an unrestricted right as to the manner of enjoying the property, and with power to change the property into money, by sale, for the benefit of the estate; and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>limitations expectant upon her death are, therefore, valid and effectual.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">It being determined that the widow took only a life estate,, the question as to the effect of her non-election becomes comparatively unimportant to the present case. The argument of plaintiff\u2019s counsel is, that even if she took a fee by the terms of the will, she lost it by her non-election, and the whole estate at her death passed to the parties in remainder. Tin's argument is clearly fallacious. If the wife took the whole estate, she took it because the limitation over was a <em>nullity. </em>If the will gives her the <em>whole </em>estate, it gives <em>nothing </em>to the presbytery; and if she, being offered by the will the whole estate, refuses to take it, then it goes to the <em>testator\u2019s </em>heirs, and not to the uses specified in items <em>2 </em>and 3. The widow would, in that event, moreover, be liable to the testator\u2019s estate for the rents of the real estate, less the dower interest, and for the personal effects she has consumed, less such portion thereof as she would have been entitled to in case of intestacy. This argument, it seems to me, if carried to its results, would work mischief, instead of benefit, to the parties claiming in remainder, whether we hold that the wife took a fee, or a life estate. In the former case, the parties claiming in remainder would take nothing. In the latter case, the widow would take a portion of the personal estate, which would go in remainder in case she takes under the will. We are unanimous, however, in the opinion that, under the circumstances of this case, the widow must be held to take under the will, and that, therefore, her representatives are entitled to no part of the personal estate. The circumstances I allude to are these: 1st. The provision made for her by the will <em>meludes </em>her dower, and is, therefore, tantamount to a provision in addition to dower, and entitles her to hold the dower interest freed from the claims of the testator\u2019s creditors. 2d. She in fact accepted and enjoyed the provision, although she never made the statutory election in court. 3d. She was never cited to appear in court, and died within the time allowed by law for that purpose. What would be our holding as to the effect of the widow\u2019s non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>election, in a case where either or any of these circumstances should be wanting, we do not at present undertake to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">A decree can, therefore, be taken upon the principles indicated, to wit: that the widow took a life estate and maintenance in both* the real and personal property, with remainder over for the purposes and uses specified in items 2 and 3 of the will. <em>*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b510-7\">Brinkerhoff, O.J., and Day, J., concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b510-8\">Scott and White, JJ., dissent from the construction given to the will in proposition 3 of the syllabus.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
