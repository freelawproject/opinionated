The object of the enactment is manifest. Associa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>tions for <em>mining, quarrying, </em>and <em>manufacturing, </em>evidently, not only in reference to the inherent nature of their business, but most expressly in view of the discrimination found in this very law between- them and other associations, are regarded as peculiarly promotive of the common interests of the public, whose utility will be extended by clothing them with the <em>power </em>to connect their establishments, mines, and quarries by railroad with the common railroads of the country.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-5\">Such a system of railroads connecting manufactories, mines, and quarries with the common railroads of the country, becomes, immediately, a public use, and promotive of the public interests in precisely the same way, if not in the same degree, with the general railroads themselves of the country ? It is, in truth, only an extension of the system.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-6\">It will be seen, on referring to section one of this supplemental act, that it provides for associations becoming incorporated .for various other purposes \u2014 canals for hydraulic purposes, building and repairing steamboats and other water crafts, dry docks, marine 'railways, printing and publishing newspapers, books, etc., etc.; yet, for the reason mentioned, no doubt, to none of these is given the power to construct railways, as in the cases in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-7\">Assuming, then, that it was the legislative intent to confer upon mining compames, etc., the same power, \u201c <em>in respect to thei/r </em>railroads,\u201d as are conferred upon railroad companies, the question whether such companies are clothed with power to condemn private property, etc., becomes easy of solution. Section 1 of the \u201cAct to provide for compensation to the owners of private property appropriated to the <em>use of corporations </em>\u201d (S. &amp; C. 311), requires the appropriation to be \u201c made and conducted in accordance with the provisions of that act; \u201d and section 10 of the general corporation act (S. &amp; C. <em>21T) </em>contains the grant of power to railroad companies <em>to </em>make appropriations of private property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-8\">' The plaintiff, being clothed with this same power, entered upon the lands of the defendant, and surveyed its railroad line, and instituted the proceedings under review in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>to perfect the appropriation of the strip required for the right of way, etc., in conformity with the provisions of the act referred to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-5\">The use for which the plaintiff thus sought to make the appropriation is a <em>pubUo use.

The Miami Coal Company is not a representative of the public; the public have no interest in it. This company undertakes to appropriate our lands, not to construct a railroad with termini, but to enable it to reach its own lands, over which it lays a track, which is as clearly and conclusively private property as \u00e1re the shovels and picks with which it takes out its coal. Who can control, or, of right, use that portion 'of the track lying on the lands of this company ? The land on which that portion of the track lies has never been changed from its condition of private property, nor has the public any interest in it. The company condemn and take our land to run its private cars, to its private banks, over its private road track, for its private profit. In what does it differ from a.farmer? It furnishes fuel at its own prices, and sells or refuses to sell to whom it pleases; the farmer furnishes bread on the same terms. The keeper - of a hotel is obliged to entertain all well-behaved persons, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>the capacity of his house; yet no one would undertake to appropriate private property for the erection of a hotel. What is there in the mere fact that property is to be transported by steam over iron rails, that gives this coal company these extraordinary rights?</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-5\">The act of appropriating under color of a statute does not give character to the enterprise; it is the character of the enterprise that determines the right to appropriate. The language of the statute appears to be broad enough to authorize this proceeding, but we can hardly suppose that a legislative body, looking to the provisions of the constitution, regarded the act as' within the authority of that body.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-6\">If this plaintiff may condemn and appropriate, then any coal, or iron, or other company may do the same, and no man can feel assured of his lands against demands of this character. In that event, men, instead of holding their lands subject to the public interest, hold them subject to the demands of such corporations as private interest may bring into being for private gain. This would work so great, and so anti-American, a revolution in our tenures, that real estate would become little less unstable than chattels.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-7\">We refer to <em>Cooper </em>v. Williams, 4 Ohio, 253, and Am. Law. Reg. (Aug. 1870) 487.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b573-8\">Day, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aix6\">A number of questions are made in argument, but the conclusion to which we have arrived on one is decisive of the case. Had the Miami Coal Company power or authority to make the appropriation sought by it? Clearly not, unless such authority has been conferred upon it by the legislative power of the State. This company is a corporation deriving its powers from <em>\u201c </em>an act supplementary to the act entitled <em>\u2018 </em>an act to provide for the creation and regulation of incorporated companies in the State of Ohio,\u2019 passed May 1, 1852.\u201d The act was passed April 8, 1856 S. <em>&amp; </em>O. Stat. 344. Among the various purposes for which corporations may be formed under this act, that of <em>\u201c </em>mining co\u00e1l, ores, and other minerals \u201d is one. The act authorizes the \u201c carrying on business usually connected with the main <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>objects of the corporations.\u201d It also provides, in the first section, that such corporations, \u201cwhen organized, shall be a body corporate, having all the privileges, immunities, and powers conferred upon manufacturing companies by said act, and shall be governed in all respects by the provisions of said act [the act of 1852], and the acts supplementary and amendatory thereto.\u201d The third section of the act of 1856 is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">\u201c The several companies which may be organized under the provisions of this act, for the purpose of mining, quarrying, or manufacturing, shall be authorized, when such purpose shall be stated in the certificate of organization, to construct a railroad, with a single or double track, with such side tracks, turn-outs, offices, and depots, as they may deem necessary to carry out the objects of the incorporation, from any such mine, quarry, or manufactory, to any other railroad, or any canal, slack-water navigation, or other navigable water or place within or upon the borders of this State; and shall, in respect to such railroad, be subject to and governed by the act aforesaid, and the said supplementary, amendatory, and other acts in relation to railroads, so far as applicable thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The 10th section of the act of 1852 provides, \u201c in relation to railroads,\u201d that \u201c such corporation is authorized to enter upon any land for the purpose of examining and surveying its railroad line, and may appropriate so much thereof as may be deemed necessary for its railroad,\u201d etc. The act contains a great number of provisions in relation to the construction- and management of railroads. Does the act of April 8, 1856, confer upon this corporation the same authority to appropriate lands for a railroad that is expressly conferred upon railroad corporations organized under the act of 1852 ?</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">In deciding this question, it must be kept in mind, as a fundamental principle, held and clearly stated in <em>Currier </em>v. <em>Marietta &amp; Cincinnati R. R. Co. </em>(11 Ohio St. 231), \u201c that grants of corporate power, being in derogation of common right, are to be strictly construed; and this is especially the case where the power claimed is a delegation of the right of eminent domain, one of the highest powers of sovereignty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>pertaining to the State itself, and interfering most seriously and often vexatiously with the ordinary rights of property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">It is claimed that the same right of appropriating land for a railroad, which is granted to railroad companies under the act of 1852, is conferred, by the third section of the act of 1856,upon corporations organized \u201cfor the purpose of mining, quarrying, or manufacturing.\u201d This section does confer upon such companies the authority to build railroads, which is an addition to the powers conferred by the preceding sections. But is anything more conferred than the mere power to construct a railroad in the manner defined in the section <em>% </em>It is claimed that, in addition to the power to construct a railroad, the concluding clause of the section confers the right of appropriating land. The literal reading of the clause only subjects the company, in respect to its railroad, to be <em>governed </em>by the \u201c acts in relation to railroads, so far as applicable thereto.\u201d There is no express grant of authority to condemn land in the clause, nor does it expressly confer upon such corporations the powers and privileges granted by law to railroad corporations. The grant of the power in question can only be inferred from the language of the last clause of the third section of the act of 1856. But this power cannot be derived by intendment or inference. Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim. 530. The only manifest purpose of this clause is to subject the company, in respect to its railroad, to the governing provisions of the acts in relation to railroads; it evinces no purpose to confer additional powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The strict meaning of this clause is rendered clear by comparing it with the last clause of the first section of the same act. It is there provided that the corporation, \u201c when organized, shall be a body corporate, having all the privileges, immunities, and powers conferred upon manufacturing companies by said act, and shall be governed in all respects by the provisions of said act, and the acts supplementary and amendatory thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Here it will be seen that the legislature plainly distinguishes the provisions of the act conferring powers upon the corporation, from those governing the exercise of such powers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The language used in the last clause of the third section is substantially, only that which is used in the first section, to subject the company to the government provided in the acts ref erred to in each section. If the legislature intended by the thii\u2019d section to confer on these companies the powers enjoyed by railroad corporations, why was it not done, in as explicit terms, as it is in the first section, in relation to the powers of manufacturing corporations ? We think that if such had been the legislative intent, it would have been as clearly expressed in the one case as in the other. The language used in the third section, requiring such companies to be governed by the acts in relation to railroads, has no broader significance than that of like language in the first section; and, therefore, since the language used in the first section to confer power, is omitted in the third, a negative, rather than an affirmative, intent to confer additional power is indicated. But, however this may be, under a rule requiring a strict construction we are constrained to hold, that the act in question does not confer upon the corporation, plaintiff in this case, the power to appropriate property to its use, against the will of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">This construction is strengthened by the fact, that there can be no pretence of a grant of power in the act for the appropriation of property to the use' of a company that may be organized <em>\u201c </em>for the purpose of constructing and maintaining a canal or canals for hydraulic purposes ; \u201d yet, a.corporation for that purpose is expressly authorized by the act; and it would seem that the necessity for- the exercise of the right of condemnation might be as essential for the canal of such a corporation as for the railroad of a mining corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Since, then, the plaintiff had no right to appropriate the land of the defendant, the probate court erred in overruling the motion of the defendant to dismiss the proceeding for that purpose. It follows that the judgment of the common pleas, reversing that of the probate court, was right, and must be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b576-6\">Brinkerhoff, C.J., and Scott, Welch, and White, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
