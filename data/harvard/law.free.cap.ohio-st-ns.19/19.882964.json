But the powers thus conferred are in their nature legislative and govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>mental; the extent and manner of their exercise, within the sphere prescribed by statute, are necessarily to be determined by the judgment and discretion of the proper municipal authorities, and for any defect in the execution of such powers, the corporation cannot be held liable to individuals. Nor is it liable for a neglect of duty on the part of fire companies, or their officers, charged with the duty of extinguishing fires. The power of the city over the subject is that of a delegated quasi sovereignty, which excludes responsibility to individuals for the neglect or non-feasance of an officer or agent charged with the performance of duties. The case differs from that where the corporation is charged by law with the performance of \u00e1 duty purely ministerial in its character.- We know of no case in which an action like the present has been held to be maintainable. <em>Brinkmeyer </em>v. <em>Evansville, </em>29 Ind.
