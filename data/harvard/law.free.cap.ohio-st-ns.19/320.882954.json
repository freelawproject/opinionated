The sale of stock to McComb was authorized by the local law of 1846.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-17\">The sale must be one producing the full par value of the stock. The par value is an amount equal to the stock. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>is expressly decided in <em>Town of Newark </em>v. <em>Elliott et al., </em>5 Ohio St. 113.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-5\">This sale of $5000 in stock was for the sum of $5000, and was therefore a sale at par. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-6\">But it is said that this was a sale on credit, and that a sale at par is a sale for cash. This point has been settled by this court against the claim of the defendants. <em>Newark </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>5 Ohio St. 113.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-7\"><em>We </em>call particular attention to the case of <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>The City of Rochester, </em>28 New York, 605.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-8\">In the case at bar, it is'true that the stock was transferred at the time of the sale, but it is also true that it was, <em>eo instante, </em>transferred back again to the county commissioners as security for the payment of the bond of McCoinb.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-9\">After the execution of this pledge <em>the title to the stock was and now is in the commissioners, </em>and it cannot be divested until full payment is made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-10\">It is urged against the validity of this sale that it did not produce the <em>actual </em>extinguishment or cancellation of an equivalent amount of county bonds, and therefore was pro* hibited by sec. 5 of the act of 1846.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-11\">The true interpretation of that section is, that the legislature did not intend that the sale should, <em>at the time it was made, </em>produce an actual extinguishment or cancellation of an equivalent amount of bonds, but that it should furnish the means 'for cancelling them <em>at their maturity, </em>and when the terms of sale were fully complied with.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-12\">Eor rules for the interpretation of statutes, see <em>Burgett </em>v. <em>Burgett, </em>1 Ohio, 221; <em>Spicer </em>v. <em>Gesleman, </em>15 Ohio, 341.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-13\">If McComb had paid in bonds, they would have been can-celled.

The local law of February, 1846, which imposed the conditions and limitations insisted upon by the defendants, was itself <em>repealed, </em>by the 25th section of the act to regulate railroad companies, passed May 1, 1852. S. &amp; C. Stat. 282.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-5\">This law is repugnant to the provisions of the local law of 1846. That law provided that the stock should sell for its par value. This authorizes the sale upon \u201c such terms as the commissioners shall deem to be for the interest of the county.\u201d That law required the sale to produce the actual extinguishment or cancellation of an equivalent amount of the bonds issued by the county. This requires no such thing, but allows the commissioners to apply the proceeds of the sale to the payment of the county bonds or not, in their discretion. The two acts cannot stand together; they-flatly contradict each other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-6\">The intention of the legislature to repeal the former law is plain. They have used language that clearly expresses such intention.

It violated the pledge in favor of \u25a0 the bondholders, it took the dividends and profits from the commissioners and gave them to McComb, and it annulled the provisions for the payinent of interest and creation of a sinking fund. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>And in this connection, note that the interest to be paid by the county on her obligations, and that to be paid by Mo-Comb on his contract, were payable, not upon the same, but upon different days, remote from each other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-5\">II. Were the commissioners authorized to make the sale by section 25 of the general incorporation act of May 1, 1852? (S. &amp; C. 282.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-6\">The whole matter is in a nut-shell. The act of 1846 is not <em>expressly </em>repealed by that of 1852. It is not named, nor is there in the act of 1852 any general provision that former acts inconsistent with section 25 ai\u2019e repealed. Yet the general assembly had the subject of repeals in view, for in section 15 of the act (S. <em>&amp; </em>O. 279) they provide for repealing certain provisions of charters. But not a word, either general or special, repealing said act of 1846.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-7\">The question then is, was it repealed by implication? I confidently affirm that it was not, and for the following reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-8\">1. Both statutes are <em>affirmative. </em>And the rule is, that: \u201c When two affirmative statutes exist, one is not to be construed to repeal the other by implication, <em>unless they cam, be reconciled by no mode of vnterpreiation.\u201d Dodge </em>v. <em>Gridley, </em>10 Ohio, 178; <em>Cass </em>v. <em>Dillon, </em>2 Ohio St. 611; <em>Ludlow </em>v. <em>Johnson, 3 </em>Ohio, 553.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-9\">The statutes under consideration can be reconciled by applying each to its proper subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-10\">2. There are subjects for both statutes to operate upon, and in such a case there is no repeal by implication. The principle is well stated by Pendleton Pres., 2 Wash. Va. Rep. 282.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-11\">3. The act of 1846 is special, particular, and positive. That of 1852 is general and affirmative. <em>It contains no negati/ve words.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-12\">That there is no repeal by implication in such a case, was clearly decided in the well-considered case of <em>Fosdick </em>v. Perrysburg, 14 Ohio St. 485 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-13\">The principle was tersely and well stated by Black, C.J., in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>21 Penn. St. R. 43.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>The rule is as old as <em>Gregory's Case, </em>6 Coke's Rep. 196. And see Sedgwick, 486.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-5\">No one will pretend that sec. 25 of the act of 1852 would be without meaning if it did not repeal the act of 1846.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-6\">4. The act of 1852 does not repeal that of 1846 by implication, because that would be inconsistent with the vested rights of the holders of the county bonds, secured to them by sec. 4 of the act of 1846.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-7\"><em>H. H. Hunter </em>for defendants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-8\">I. The contract of sale to the defendants\u2019 testator, of the stock, by the plaintiffs, and their transfer of the same to him, is void <em>ah </em>initio, by reason of the plaintiffs, in making the same, having exceeded the power conferred upon them by the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-9\">The plaintiffs in making a ease entitling them to recover by virtue of a special statutory power, must show by averment not only the statutory grant of power, but also, that in the exercise of the power they conformed to the prescribed \u25a0 conditions and limitations. This has not been done in this case. Their petition therefore is insufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-10\">2. If it were legally competent to disregard the question of pleading referred to, and consider the case in reference to the special act and the exhibits, A and B of the petition, we then insist that it appears negatively, that the transaction was void under the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-11\">The two instruments are to be read together as parts of one transaction. Thus read, they show that the commissioners exceeded their power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-12\">The stock was actually transferred to the intestate, and full power vested in him to annihilate it, substituting a different thing in its place, without any payment of money or county bonds to the value of one cent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-13\">The sole object, to effect which a sale was authorized, was <em>\u201cin order to pay off the*indebtedness\u201d </em>which might arise under the act. But the <em>actual doing of that, </em>and not <em>a possible </em>provision for it, dependent upon the future ability of the purchaser to make payment, <em>was required.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The sale upon the agreed extended term of credit was not authorized. The sale authorized was a sale <em>at par for cash</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-5\">3. A further question arises in the case: whether the restrictive provisions of the special act, which have been referred to, are repealed, by implication by section 25 of the act of May 1, 1852. (S. &amp; C. 282.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-6\">This question has been so fully discussed by the counsel for the defendants, that I do not deem it necessary to make an additional remark about it, except to remind the court of the general rule, \u201c that repeals by implication are not favored, and that if the intent to repeal be not clearly deducible from the subsequent enactment, and it be possible for both to stand together, no repeal is to be implied.\u201d How this is, in the case in hand, is easily solved; and is to be done, not upon any basis of reasoning which the court might deem expedient, but simply in view of what is said and expressed in the subsequent law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-7\">4. There is, however, a further consideration growing out of this branch of the subject, of vital importance in the case, which remains to be presented.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-8\">It is this: That a repeal of the special act, as claimed by the plaintiffs, would be a.violation of the constitution of the State of Ohio, and that of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-9\">Section 28, art. 2, of the constitution of Ohio provides: \u201c The general assembly shall have no power to pass retroactive laws, or laws impairing the obligations of contracts,\u201d .etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-10\">Sec. 10, art. 1, of the Constitution of the United States \u2022provides: \u201cNo State shall pass any ex post facto law, or law -.impairing the obligations of contracts,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-11\">\u25a0 The terms of the special - act in question operate as, and -form part of the contract between the holders of the bonds \u25a0 of the county issued in payment of the subscription of the \u25a0 county for the stock, and the county, whereby the dividends \u25a0 to accrue on the stock (in legal effect the stock itself) should \u2022.stand pledged for the payment of the bonds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-15\">Section 4 of the act provides: \u201c That the faith of the .county so subscribing stock under the provisions of this act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>and the net <em>profits or dividends upon the stools subscribed by the county to such </em>company, shall stand pledged <em>for the fayment of the indebtedness and </em>interest, <em>which may become d/u,e and payable from the county under this </em>act,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-5\">The answer specifically sets up this provision of the act, together with that so frequently referred to above, in section 5, conferring power, subject to the specified conditions, upon the commissioners to sell the stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-6\">It is obvious that these terms restricting the power of sale by the commissioners, and the grant of the power itself, are part and parcel of the conditions of the pledge of the dividends and profits of the stock, as contained in section 4. That is to say, the <em>pledge </em>is subject to the exercise of <em>this </em>power of sale and transfer of the stock, but is only subject to the exercise of the power <em>as limited and restricted. </em>This statutory pledge, in express terms, is \u201c as a security for the payment-of the bonds of the county authorized to be issued under the act;\u201d and upon their being issued and delivered, to any <em>bona-fide </em>holder thereof by legal operation, became not merely a <em>vested-right </em>in the holder, but a <em>contract </em>right in behalf of each holder thereof. And it is manifest, that any law enacted by the general assembly after the issuing and delivery of the bonds to a <em>bona-fide </em>holder thereof, which in any respect altered or changed the terms or conditions of the pledge, would, to the same extent, impair the obligation of the contract of pledge, and be therefore unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-7\">It appears from the answer (demurred to) that at the date of this supposed repealing act, the <em>contract </em>relation provided for by the <em>special </em>act, of pledge of the profits and dividends of the stock for the payment of the bonds, had become and was fully operative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-8\">Was the contract of pledge, as stated, a <em>contract </em>within the meaning of the constitution <em>%</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-9\"><em>\u201c </em>The <em>lien </em>of a bondholder, who has loaned money to the State, on a pledge of property by legislative act, cannot be divested or postponed by a subsequent legislative act.\u201d <em>(Wabash, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Beers, </em>2 Black, 448.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>It is obvious in what respect the repeal, if valid, would impair the contract. It is this: By the original or special act the commissioners were only authorized to sell and transfer the stock subject to the conditions prescribed by that act But, if that act be repealed, its restrictions, if the repealing act be held constitutional, are abrogated, and unlimited power is conferred upon the commissioners to sell the same <em>at discretion.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-5\">The court is referred to the recent well-considered case of <em>Von Hoffman </em>v. <em>City of </em>Quincy, 4 Wallace, 522, 523, 535, 548, and the cases therein cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-6\">But it maybe objected that, admitting the effect of the act of 1852 to be, to repeal all of that part of the special act of 1846 which is inconsistent with it (which is the claim of the plaintiffs), and admitting that such repeal would be unconstitutional and ineffectual as against the holders of the county bonds, that the question only affects <em>them </em>\u2014 and that if <em>they </em>do not raise it, that it is not competent for the defendants, or others in like relations, to make or interpose it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-7\">The first answer to this is, that if a law be unconstitutional and void as to some persons, it necessarily is so as to all other persons \u2014 <em>void </em>means <em>void; </em>and in respect to an unconstitutional law, it is the manifest right of all, whose interest it is to do so, in defence of a demand asserted against them resting upon the law, to show its unconstitutionality.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-8\">But we have shown that prior to, and at the time of the passage of this act, which the plaintiffs claim to have <em>k </em>repealing effect, the bonds of the county were issued and outstanding in the hands of <em>lon\u00e1-fide </em>holders, and that the sale and transfer of the stock by the commissioners to the testator and others was in violation of the pledge secured to the bondholders by the provisions of the special act; and <em>that </em>being so, it follows of legal necessity, that the sale and transfer remained subject to the lien of the bondholders precisely as if the repealing act had not been passed; and why so? Simply because the .repealing act was void in so far as it impaired the contract of pledge in behalf of the bondholders.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>The principle settled in the case of <em>Hawthorn </em>v. <em>Calef, 2 </em>Wallace, 10, has a material bearing upon the constitutional question under consideration.

Defendants claim that the plaintiffs were prohibited, by the fifth section of the act of February 26, 1846, from making any sale which was not a sale <em>at par, </em>and which did not result in an <em>actual </em>extinguishment or cancellation of an equivalent amount of the bonds of the county. And they allege that the sale and transfer of stock set out in the plaintiffs\u2019 petition, did not produce its full par value, nor extinguish or cancel an equivalent, or any amount of the obligations of said county, created under said act. On the other hand, it is claimed for the plaintiffs that the conditions and limitations upon the power of sale, imposed by the 5th section of the local act of February, 1846, were.repealed by the 25th section of the general act to regulate incorporated companies, passed May 1,1852, which conferred on the plaintiffs a power of sale limited, as to terms, only by their own discretion; and secondly, that however this may be, the terms of sale, as stated in the pleadings, were not inconsistent with the limitations of the act of 1846. The 1st, 2d, 4th, and 5th sections of that act (44 O. L. L. 192) read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\u201c Seo. 1. That whenever a majority of the qualified electors of the counties of Delaware, Marion, Holmes, Medina, Crawford, and Knox, respectively, shall consent thereto, as provided in the sixth and seventh sections of this act, it is hereby made the duty of the commissioners of said counties, respectively, for and in behalf of their respective county, to become subscribers to 'an amount not exceeding one hundred thousand dollars to the capital stock of any qompapy heretofore or which may hereafter be incorporated to construct any railroad which of itself, or in conjunction with other com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>pa\u00f1\u00edes, may open a direct communication through their respective county, and to or near its county seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\"><em>\u201c </em>Seo. 2. That the commissioners of each of the said counties, in payment of any amount of stock subscribed under this act, shall issue, or cause to be issued, bonds or obligations of the county, of equal amount, payable to said company and made negotiable, bearing interest, to be paid annually at the treasury of said county, at the rate of six per cent, and redeemable at such time as may be deemed expedient by the commissioners, not over twenty years from date.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Seo. 4. That the faith of the county so subscribing stock under the provisions of this act, and the net profits or dividends upon the stock subscribed by the county to such company, shall .stand pledged for the payment of the indebtedness and interest which may become demandable from the county under this act; and it is, moreover, hereby made the duty of such commissioners and the auditor of the county, from and after any indebtedness of the county arising, under this act, against the county, to add such per centum upon the tax duplicate of the county annually, over and above the ordinary State and county taxes, as shall be sufficient, including the dividends aforesaid, to pay the accruing interest arising under this act, and also to produce a sinking fund of such amount as they may deem expedient; and the money so levied shall, when collected, be applied to the purpose aforesaid, and to none other.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Seo. 5. That the commissioners of such county shall, by themselves or such agents as they may appoint, have full power to vote at all meetings of stockholders of said railroad company, in proportion to the stock owned by the county, and in all other respects to act in behalf of the county in \u2019the business of said company, as may be in accordance with law and best calculated to promote the true interests of the company without injustice to the county; and, moreover, <em>the sand commissioners a/re hereby authorized, whenever they may deem the same expedient, to sell and tramsfer a/ny and all stoclc of the company subscribed or owned by </em>the county, m <em>order to pay off the i/ndebtedmess which may a/rise under </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>this act: Provided, however, that no sale or transfer of the stock thus owned by the county shall be of any force, except upon condition of its producing its full par valme, and the actual extinguishment or cancellaUon of an egui/oalent amount of obligations of the county created under this act.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">By the general \u201c act to provide for the creation and regulation of incorporated companies in the State of Ohio,\u201d passed May 1,1852 (1 S. &amp; C. Stat. 282), it was provided in the twenty-fifth section as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u201c The commissioners of any county, the city or town council of any city or town, and the trustees of any township, which county, city, town or township, has heretofore subscribed to the capital stock of any railroad company, or turnpike or plank-road company, and has issued, or shall hereafter issue, any bonds for the payment of such subscription, are hereby authorized to sell the said stock, or any part thereof, and on such terms as they shall deem to be for the interest of said county, city, town or township, respectively, and may apply the proceeds of such sale to the payment of the bonds of such county, city, town or township, respectively subscribed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The question arises whether the general power here given to sell stock previously subscribed operates a repeal, by implication, of the conditions and limitations of the power of sal\u00e9 given to the plaintiffs by the local and special act of 1846.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Prior to 1852, many local and special acts had been passed by the legislature, authorizing cities, counties, and townships to subscribe to the capital stock of railroad, turnpike, and other companies, but no <em>general </em>law had ever conferred such powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">In some of these special enactments, a general power was given to sell the stock which might be subscribed, without any restriction or limitation thereon. In many cases no power of sale was expressly granted, the act being silent on the subject; and in other cases a sale was allowed only for the purpose of paying off the bonds or indebtedness arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>from the subscription, of stock, or was coupled with other limitations and restrictions, as in the act of 1846, now under consideration. By the research of counsel we have been referred to numerous instances of these various classes of special acts, which it would be tedious and unnecessary to cite in detail. Under these special grants of authority many of the cities, counties, and townships of the State subscribed largely in aid of railroad and other enterprises. These subscriptions frequently proved to be unwise and unprofitable as investments, and imposed heavy liabilities on the communities upon whose behalf the subscriptions were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The experience of the people of the State in this behalf was such, that in framing the constitution of 1851 it was specially provided, that no authority to make such subscriptions should ever be conferred by the general assembly on any county, city, town or township of the State. In the following year, the <em>general </em>act of May 1, 1852, was passed, which purports in the most <em>general </em>terms to authorize <em>\u201c </em>the commissioners of <em>any </em>county, the city or town council of <em>any </em>city- or town, and the trustees of <em>any </em>township, which county, city, town or township has heretofore subscribed to the capital stock of <em>any </em>railroad company, . . . and has is sued, or shall hereafter issue, any bonds for the payment of such subscription, ... to sell the said stock, or any part thereof, and on such terms as they shall deem to be for the interest of said county, city,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">It cannot be denied that the broad terms of this enactment clearly comprehend the case of Knox county, as it stood at the date of the act. The commissioners of that county had previously subscribed $100,000 to the capital stock of the Columbus and Lake Erie Eailroad Company, and in payment therefor had issued its bonds. This is the case contemplated and provided for by the statute. And whether we look to the terms of the act, or the circumstances which may be supposed to have led to its passage, we see no reason to doubt that it falls within the very purpose and intention of the legislature. The cases intended to be provided for could not have been such as had arisen under a <em>general </em>law, for no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>general law had ever authorized subscriptions by counties to the stock of railroad companies. The prior statutes to be affected by the new law could, therefore, be none other than the special acts to which we have referred, or some of them. None of them is expressly repealed or referred to in the new law \u2014 to which, however, we can give, effect only by allowing it to modify prior legislation on the same subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">If it was not intended to apply to all cases in which a conditional or qualified power of sale had been previously granted as well as to cases in which no power of sale had been expressly conferred, then to what class or classes of cases is its application to be limited ? To cases, say counsel, arising under the special acts which contained no grant of power to sell the stock. But what conceivable policy could have induced the legislature to confer an unlimited and discretionary power of sale in every case in which a power of sale liad been previously wholly withheld, and to refuse a like extensive discretion in all cases where the power had been previously granted with limitations ? If a continual and progressive depreciation in the market values of railroad stocks had made it expedient to give full and unlimited powers of sale, where no discretion had been previously conferred, would not the same circumstance have dictated the removal of the limitations on discretion with which previous grants of a power of sale had been accompanied? The circumstances which evidently induced this general grant of unqualified powers in 1852, justify the belief that the intention of the legislature was no less general than the terms employed would seem clearly to indicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">It is true, that repeals by implication are not favored, and are only allowed where the repugnancy is clear; but in this case there is a plain repugnancy, and the two enactments can only be reconciled by assuming, without reason, that the legislature in the latter act did not mean what they have clearly and plainly said. It has been well said, that \u201c every act is made either for the purpose of making a change in the law or for the purpose of better declaring the law; and its operation is not to be impeded by the mere fact that it is incon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>sistent with some previous enactment.\u201d <em>Dean of Ely </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>5 Beav. 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The present is not, then, the case of two affirmative statutes which are so far consistent with each other that full effect may be given to both. And in this respect we think the case of <em>Wardell </em>v. <em>Arell, </em>2 Wash. Va. R. 282, and other cases cited by counsel for defendants, are not analogous to the case \u25a0 before us. Nor is it a case for the application of the rule that <em>\u201c </em>a later statute, general and affirmative, does not abrogate a former, which is particular; \u201d for, here, no effect whatever can be given to the later general statute, unless it be allowed to modify prior special statutes by conferring powers which they withheld. And in giving this operation to it, as we have already said, no good reason is perceived for discriminating between the act of February, 1846, and other special acts which had either conferred a limited power of sale, or had failed to confer any such power. We see no reason to doubt that the legislature intended to confer a discretionary power of sale, as unlimited in respect to terms as the rights of individuals vested under prior laws would in each case permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">It is claimed, however, that the legislature could not, constitutionally, confer on the county commissioners of Knox county the discretionary power of sale which the act of 1852 purports to confer. The argument is, that by the fourth section of the act of 1846, the net profits or dividends upon the stock subscribed by the county were pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds to be issued under that act; that this statutory pledge was a part of the <em>contract </em>under which the bonds previously issued by the county were at the time held by the <em>bondholders; </em>that the contract of sale on which suit is brought \u25a0 is inconsistent with this pledge, and cannot therefore be held valid without impairing the obligations of a contract, which under our constitutions, both State and Federal, cannot be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">To this claim, we think, several answers may be made. 1. We do not see that the terms of the contract sued upon were in derogation of the rights of the bondholders under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>this statutory pledge; for the pledge was as a security for the payment of the annual interest accruing upon the bonds, and of the principal sum at maturity. By the contract of sale, the purchaser of the stock was bound to pay a corresponding amount of interest annually, and of principal at maturity. If defendants\u2019 testator, therefore, complied with his contract, the bondholders\u2019claims would be fully satisfied, and no occasion could arise for the assertion of his statutory lien. And we think it no valid objection that the purchaser might have involved himself in trouble by a failure to perform his contract. Besides, the hypothecation of the stock, made concurrently with the sale, left it in the power of the commissioners to secure the application of profits or dividends to the discharge of interest in arrear, or of principal at maturity. But if we are mistaken in this, still, this statutory pledge was for the security of the bondholders only, and can therefore be asserted only by them. If they are content with the sole responsiblity of the county of Knox (the obligor in their bonds), surely the defendants have no right to complain on their behalf. The act of 1852 does not become void, though it cannot, constitutionally, operate to the prejudice of rights previously vested. It does not appear that the bondholders have ever asserted or threatened to assert the right which is here set up for them; nor but that they have at all times acquiesced fully in the purchase made by defendants\u2019 testator; nor that defendants have lost or are likely to lose any of the benefits of their testator\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Under these circumstances, we think the defendants cannot avoid the obligations of the contract in question; and that the court of common pleas therefore erred in overruling the demurrer of the plaintiffs to the answer of 'the defendants. The judgment of the court of common pleas is therefore reversed, and the demurrer to defendants\u2019 answer sustained.</p>\n<judges id=\"b355-6\">Bbinkebhoff, C.J., and Welch, White, and Day, JJ., con\u00ab curred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
