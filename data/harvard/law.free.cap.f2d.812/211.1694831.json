Assuming that this is true (as it appears to be), it remains that such orders as that of the trial court \u2014 orders which recite the magic words that we quote above \u2014 are \u201cnot subject to challenge in the court of appeals by appeal, by mandamus, or otherwise.\u201d <em>Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, </em>423 U.S. 336, 343, 96 S.Ct. 584, 589, 46 L.Ed.2d (1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-27\">The <em>Thermtron </em>court does not say that we cannot review orders purporting to remand on this basis on certain grounds, or for certain faults; for constitutional infirmities, but not for statutory ones: it says that we cannot review them <em>at all. </em>There it ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-28\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-19\">. The Court\u2019s opinion, at the page cited, makes plain that the words are indeed magic ones: the order is proof against review even if it merely \"purports\u201d to remand on the ground quoted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
