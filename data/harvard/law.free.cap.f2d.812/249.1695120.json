As we declined to do so for Texas, so we decline to do so for Louisiana. Indeed, insofar as Louisiana has declared itself on the subject of the \u201cproduct line\u201d theory, it seems to be hostile to it. <em>Bourque v. Lehmann Lathe, Inc., </em>476 So.2d 1125 (La.App. 3rd Cir.1985) (defendant must be responsible in some manner for plaintiffs injuries before liability attaches; deep pocket not sufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Mr. Page points to a clause in the agreement of purchase by which the defendant Joy Manufacturing Company acquired its manufacturing business that \u201cThis Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the internal laws of California,\u201d asserting that this causes the law of California \u2014 one of the few states recognizing the \u201cproduct line\u201d theory \u2014 to govern his tort claim against Joy. Mr. Page had no part in that agreement, however, and his claim for damages does not arise from it or turn upon any particular construction of it. Rather, it arises from a claimed defect in a unit manufactured by Joy\u2019s predecessor, long before the agreement was entered into. In these circumstances, it is all too plain that the accord of the parties to the contract regarding how it should be construed vis-a-vis each other is of no help to Page\u2019s cause. His injuries occurred on a fixed platform off the Louisiana coast, a locus governed by Louisiana law as surrogate federal law pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. 43 U.S. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1331 <em>et seq. </em>Summary judgment for Joy was correct and must be</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-11\">. <em>Rhynes v.
