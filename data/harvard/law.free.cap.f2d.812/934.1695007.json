He maintains that the Secretary\u2019s decision to deny him benefits is not supported by substantial evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-24\">Shipley alleges that he became disabled in 1974 due to a back injury, but his last employment occurred in 1982. His past job positions include deck hand, meat grinder, and security guard; he has a fourth grade education and currently is in his late thirties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-25\">Plaintiff appealed the Social Security Administration\u2019s decision to deny his claim for benefits to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), who conducted a hearing de novo in 1983. She issued an opinion and decision explaining why Shipley is not entitled to benefits. He appealed this decision in a United States District Court and a magistrate held a hearing on the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The magistrate issued findings and a recommendation favoring the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff filed objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>tions to the findings, but the district judge, after considering the entire record, adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings as its opinion. The court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\">The Social Security Act defines \u201cdisability\u201d as \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). Regulations set forth by the Secretary prescribe that disability claims are to be evaluated according to a five-step process. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520 (1986). The first step involves determining whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity. If so, the claimant will be found not disabled \u201cregardless of [his] medical condition or [his] age, education, and work experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(b). The second step involves determining whether the claimant\u2019s impairment is \u201csevere,\" which is defined as an impairment \u201cwhich significantly limits [the] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(c). If the impairment is not severe, the claimant is deemed not disabled. The third step concerns whether the severe impairment is at least equal to one in a list of specific impairments. If the claimant suffers from a listed impairment, he is deemed disabled without considering his age, education; and work experience. Fourth, if the claimant has a severe impairment that is not included on the list of impairments, the Social Security Administration is to review the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity and the demands of his past work. If he \u201ccan still do this kind of work, [the Administration] will find that [he is] not disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(e). Fifth, if the claimant \u201ccannot do any work [he has] done in the past because [he has] a severe impairment(s),\u201d the Administration asks whether, given the claimant\u2019s residual capacities and his age, education, and work experience, he can do other work. If not, he will be found disabled. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">Shipley points out that we set out the appropriate test for \u201cseverity\u201d of an impairment in <em>Stone v. Heckler, </em>752 F.2d 1099, 1101 (5th Cir.1985): \u201c[A]n impairment can be considered as not severe only if it is a slight abnormality [having] such minimal effect on the individual that it would not be expected to interfere with the individual\u2019s ability to work, irrespective of age, education.or work experience.\u201d (quoting <em>Estran v. Heckler, </em>745 F.2d 340, 341 (5th Cir.1984)). Shipley is correct in his assertion that, given the medical testimony in this case, his impairment must be considered \u201csevere\u201d under the <em>Stone </em>test. What he overlooks, however, is that having a severe impairment is not a sufficient condition for receiving benefits under the Secretary\u2019s regulations. Satisfying the <em>Stone </em>test of severity means only that claimant has passed the second step of the inquiry mandated by the regulations. While the opinion could have been clearer on this point, the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s ruling of ineligibility was not based on step two.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">The AU found that Shipley\u2019s impairments do not equal or exceed the listed impairments and that he is able to perform the work of a security guard. This suggests, without explicitly stating, a finding that claimant\u2019s disability was severe under the <em>Stone </em>test. Without such a finding, there is no reason to ask whether claimant\u2019s disability is a listed one (step three) or whether he can perform the work of a security guard (steps four and five).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">Moreover, we find the AU\u2019s determination that Shipley can do the work of a security guard to be supported by substantial evidence. A vocational expert testified to this effect at the hearing. There was sufficient medical evidence from which the AU could conclude that Shipley has the residual capacity to do physical work \u201cexcept for work involving lifting more than 30 pounds occasionally, lifting or carrying more than 25 pounds on a frequent basis, engaging in repetitive bending, or using the right dominant hand for gripping objects or fine movements.\u201d It is true that two of the physicians consulted wrote \u201ctotally disabled\u201d on forms that were sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>mitted into evidence. But the AU found that these statements were not supported by clinical or laboratory findings. \u201cThe duty of an appellate court when reviewing an agency decision regarding disability benefits and supplemental security income benefits is not to reweigh the evidence, but merely to determine if there is substantial evidence in the record to support the agency\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Fortenberry v. Harris, </em>612 F.2d 947, 950 (5th Cir.1980). We find that in this case such substantial evidence exists in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
