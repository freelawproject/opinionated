U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cInsofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum rests solely on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. As such, we limit our review to that finding. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">A credibility finding is a finding of fact reviewed under the substantial evidence test; hence, we will reverse such finding \u201conly if the evidence compels a reasonable fact finder-to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1230-31 (quotation omitted). Under this highly deferential standard of review, we may not reweigh the evidence and must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the agency\u2019s finding. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">To establish eligibility for asylum, an alien bears the burden of showing with \u201ccredible, direct, and specific evidence\u201d that he is a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of the INA. <em>Id. </em>at 1286-87 (citation omitted). The alien may meet this burden by showing either (1) past persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of the above protected grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 1286; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">The agency\u2019s denial of asylum can rest \u201csolely [on] an adverse credibility determination, especially if the alien fails to produce corroborating evidence.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. However, if the alien produces corroborating evidence, the IJ must consider it. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. The IJ must state \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for an adverse credibility finding, and the burden is then shifted to the alien to show that those reasons are not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>Substantial evidence supports an adverse credibility finding where the alien failed to mention details of his involvement with a political party in his asylum application and interview, raised these details for the first time at his merits hearing, and failed to produce corroborating evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1287-88. We have affirmed an adverse credibility determination that was based on the agency\u2019s finding that the alien\u2019s testimony conflicted with prior answers given in an affidavit, interrogatories, and other evidence. <em>Dailide v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>387 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">Here, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that the testimony of Ar-tan Hulej was not credible, and petitioners have not shown that the record compels a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>contrary conclusion. During his credible fear interview with an asylum officer, he stated, in response to the question whether he belonged to a political group, that he \u201cliked the Democratic party, but ... was not a member.\u201d He denied he had been harmed in Albania. He came to the United States because, as he put it, \u201cfarming ... could hardly keep us alive.\u201d He chose the United States for refuge because he had \u201ca chance to come here with the [fraudulent] documents.\u201d Asked whether anyone in Albania had harmed or threatened him, he answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In his testimony before the IJ, Hulej told a different story. He was a member of the Democratic Party, having joined it in 1993 at age 13, and he participated \u201cin every meeting.\u201d His political activity in the Party escalated until, in his early twenties, he became \u201ca leader of the youth forum ... a member of the council ... and ... a representative for the Democratic Party during the election of [2001].\u201d His candidate won the election on July 15, 2001, and his party is now in power in' Albania.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The material inconsistences between Hulej\u2019s credible fear interview and his testimony before the IJ were numerous. His contradictory statements about Democratic Party membership and activity are mere examples. The documentary evidence petitioner presented did nothing to enhance Hulej\u2019s credibility. Accordingly, suffice it to say that the evidence supporting the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding was substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\">. Petitioners, natives and citizens of Albania, entered the United States using false passports and visas in October 2001.

The BIA denied petitioners withholding of removal and protection under the U.N. Convention Against Torture as well as their application for asylum. In their brief to this court, they only challenge the asylum decision. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that a petitioner abandons an issue by failing to offer argument on that issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
