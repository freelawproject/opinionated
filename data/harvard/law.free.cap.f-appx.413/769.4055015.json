He argues that the district court erred in its determination that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1 was applicable to his offense. Richarte maintains that the district court should have applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-25\">This court typically reviews a district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). However, \u201c[w]hen a defendant objects to his sentence on grounds different from those raised on appeal, we review the new arguments raised on appeal for plain error only.\u201d <em>United States v. Medina-Anicacio, </em>325 F.3d 638, 643 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-26\">The parties dispute the applicable standard of review. The Government argues for plain error review because Richarte did not object to the application of \u00a7 2X1.1 in the district court. Richarte maintains that the issue was preserved because the district court was asked at the sentencing hearing to determine whether \u00a7 2B3.1 or \u00a7 2X1.1 was to be applied, and he notes that he set forth alternative arguments in the district court as to how the guidelines should be applied under each section.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-27\">\u201cTo preserve error, an objection must be sufficiently specific to alert the district court to the nature of the alleged error and to provide an opportunity for correction.\u201d <em>United States v. Neal, </em>578 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.2009). Exacting precision is not required; nor is it necessary that the district court properly construe the issue or rule on it. <em>See id. </em>at 272-73. A defendant will not be limited to plain error review if he did not have an opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>nity to object at sentencing, or if \u201cthe party made its position clear to the district court and to have objected would have been futile.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>430 F.3d 230, 242 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Richarte did not contend in the district court that \u00a7 2B3.1 was the guideline applicable to his offense, nor did he argue against the application of \u00a7 2X1.1. Indeed, in his -written objections to the Presentence Report, Richarte argued that \u00a7 2X1.1 was the appropriate section of the Guidelines for a conspiracy to commit a violation of the Hobbs Act. Richarte also did not object at the sentencing hearing after the district court had expressed its determination that \u00a7 2X1.1 applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Because Richarte did not preserve the issue, we will review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Alvarado-Santilano, </em>434 F.3d 794, 795 (5th Cir.2005). To demonstrate plain error, an appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">Under our precedent, \u00a7 2X1.1 is the guideline applicable to a conspiracy to violate the Hobbs Act by extortion. <em>United States v. Villafranca, </em>260 F.3d 374, 381 (5th Cir.2001). We have not specifically addressed whether \u00a7 2X1.1 is applicable to a conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery. The published opinions of other circuits reveal a split on this question. <em>See, e.g. United States v. Amato, </em>46 F.3d 1255, 1261-62 (2d Cir.1995) (holding that \u00a7 2X1.1 is applicable); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>8 F.3d 1552, 1564-65 (11th Cir.1993) (holding that \u00a7 2X1.1 is inapplicable).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-14\">An appellant cannot demonstrate plain error where this circuit\u2019s law is unsettled and other federal circuits have reached divergent conclusions. <em>United States v. Salinas, </em>480 F.3d 750, 759 (5th Cir.2007). Because Richarte has not met his burden to establish plain error, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b791-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
