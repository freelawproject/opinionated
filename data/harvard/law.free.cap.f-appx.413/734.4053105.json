Montgomery argues that postjudgment relief was warranted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 60(b) because his attorney failed to withdraw from his case after he fired her and then sabotaged his ease by failing to file adequate pleadings, including an adequate opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. He contends that if his attorney had withdrawn, he would have received notice of the defendants\u2019 motions and would have had the opportunity to properly respond to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-18\">Whether Montgomery\u2019s postjudgment motion is construed as arising under Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the result is the same: Montgomery has failed to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in denying his postjudgment motion. <em>See Johnson v. Diversicare Afton Oaks, LLC, </em>597 F.3d 673, 677 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981). The record does not support Montgomery\u2019s assertion that he fired his attorney. Despite his assertion, Montgomery did not obtain new counsel or move to proceed pro se. Because there is no evidence that he, in fact, fired his attorney, Montgomery has failed to demonstrate that the district court based its denial of his postjudgment motion on either an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. <em>See Ross v. Marshall, </em>426 F.3d 745, 763 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-19\">Montgomery also has failed to demonstrate that the district court erred in granting summary judgment. This court reviews the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo. <em>Xtreme Lashes, LLC v. Xtended Beauty, Inc., </em>576 F.3d 221, 226 (5th Cir.2009). Summary judgment is proper if the record discloses \u201cthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a) (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-20\">Athough Montgomery\u2019s opposition to the motion for summary judgment was inadequate to defeat summary judgment, the mistakes and omissions of Montgomery\u2019s counsel are chargeable to him no matter how unfair this may seem. <em>See Pryor v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>769 F.2d 281, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>288 (5th Cir.1985). Further, Montgomery has failed to point to any evidence showing the existence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact. Thus, Montgomery has failed to demonstrate that the district court erred in granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b757-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
