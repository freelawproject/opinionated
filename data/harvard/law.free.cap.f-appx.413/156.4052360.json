Pursuant to the sentencing guidelines, Guzman-Alas\u2019s offense level was 21 and criminal history category was III, resulting in a guideline range of 46 to 57 months. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), 3El.l(a) &amp; (b) (2010). Guzman-AIas argues that his within-guideline sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-27\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>tion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We must first \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error ... [and] then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). Procedural errors include: \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597). We look to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to guide our substantive reasonableness review. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Guzman-Alas first argues that his sentence is proeedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately explain its reasons for imposing his' 46-month sentence. \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1313 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005)). When the district court imposes a sentence within the guideline range \u201cdoing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The district court need only make \u201can acknowledgment ... that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. \u201c[N]othing ... requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The district court committed no procedural error in imposing Guzman-Alas\u2019s sentence. At the beginning of Guzman-Alas\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court explained the guideline calculation. Guzman-Alas conceded at sentencing that the guideline range the district court applied was correct. Guzman-Alas acknowledges that the district court stated that it had considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Moreover, the district court explained that it was imposing Guzman-Alas\u2019s sentence to deter him from future criminal conduct and to protect the public. The district court\u2019s explanation was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Guzman-Alas next argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the circumstances of his case warrant less severe punishment in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. When reviewing a sentence for substantive reasonableness, we examine the totality of the circumstances and determine whether the sentence achieves the sentencing goals stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Culver, </em>598 F.3d 740, 753 (11th Cir.2010); <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. We ordinarily expect a sentence within the guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Further, it is within the district court\u2019s discretion to weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and \u201c[w]e will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant [statutory] factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">Guzman-Alas\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable. His sentence is at the bottom of the guideline range. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. It is also well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>below the twenty-year statutory maximum sentence for illegal reentry. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). It was within the district court\u2019s discretion to weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, in light of Guzman-Alas\u2019s criminal history, and select a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range. <em>See Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
