Relying on <em>In re Grijalva, 21 </em>I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 27 (BIA 1995), GaloMartinez contends that the BIA erred in holding that he was provided sufficient notice of the deportation hearing because there was no evidence that the hearing notice was sent by certified mail. In the alternative, he argues that even if the hearing notice was properly served, he presented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of delivery by regular mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-24\">This court reviews the denial of a motion to reopen \u201cunder a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Zhao v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number><em>Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005). The BIA\u2019s decision must be upheld as long as it is not \u201ccapricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). While questions of law are reviewed de novo, this court \u201caccord[s] deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of immigration statutes unless the record reveals compelling evidence that the BIA\u2019s interpretation is incorrect.\u201d <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, meaning that this court may not overturn the BIA\u2019s factual findings unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Chun v. INS, 40 </em>F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). This court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision and will consider the underlying decision of the IJ only if it influenced the determination of the BIA. <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 348 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Galo-Martinez\u2019s reliance on <em>Grijalva </em>is misplaced. Galo-Martinez\u2019s hearing notice was served prior to June 13, 1992. Thus, as the BIA correctly noted, his in absentia deportation proceedings were conducted pursuant to former \u00a7 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as codified in former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b). <em>See WilliamsIgwonobe v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 453, 455 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2006). Under former \u00a7 1252(b), a deportation hearing could be held in absentia if the alien was given a reasonable opportunity to be present and without reasonable cause failed or refused to attend the proceedings. \u00a7 1252(b) (1990). Section 1252(b)(1) required that the alien \u201cbe given notice, reasonable under all the circumstances, of the nature of the charges against him and of the time and place at which the proceedings will be held.\u201d \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (1990). The applicable regulations provided that the \u201cOffice of the Immigration Judge [was] responsible for providing notice of the time, place, and date of the hearing to the government and respondent/applicant.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.17 (1990). Notice of the hearing could be accomplished by routine service, that is, \u201cmailing a copy by ordinary mail addressed to a person at his last known address.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.5a(a)(l) (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Galo-Martinez acknowledges that he was personally served with the Order to Show Cause (OSC) on April 2, 1990. The OSC provided that Galo-Martinez was required to appear before the IJ at a date and time to be set later and advised him that if he failed to attend the hearing, a determination could be made in his absence. The OSC also contained the address Galo-Martinez had provided immigration officials upon his apprehension. Eight days later, the immigration court issued a written notice indicating that a master calendar hearing had been scheduled for May 3, 1990. The hearing notice was sent by regular mail to the address on the OSC. The record does not indicate that the notice was returned to the court as undeliverable. Therefore, the BIA did not err in holding that Galo-Martinez was properly served with the hearing notice. <em>See Matter of Munoz-Santos, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 205, 206 (BIA 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The BIA\u2019s determination that Galo-Martinez failed to overcome the presumption of delivery is also supported by substantial evidence. Although Galo-Martinez filed an affidavit asserting that he did not receive the hearing notice, he did not submit an affidavit from any individuals who were knowledgeable about the facts relevant to whether notice was received. Galo-Martinez did not initiate deportation proceedings nor did he have any applications for relief pending at the time of his failure to appear. Thus, there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>indication that he had an incentive to appear for the hearing. Further, although Galo-Martinez acknowledged that he received the in absentia deportation order at the same address in May 1990, he did not file a motion to reopen until 19 years later. Galo-Martinez\u2019s alleged failure to receive actual notice of the deportation hearing was due to circumstances of his own making. Therefore, he has not shown that the BIA abused its discretion when it dismissed his appeal of the IJ\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen his in absentia deportation proceedings. Accordingly, Galo-Martinez\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b717-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
