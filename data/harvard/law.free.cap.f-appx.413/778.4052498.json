He reserved the right to challenge only the denial of a'pretrial motion to suppress evidence. Kapenekas was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment on each count of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>conviction, to be served concurrently, and five years of supervised release. He did not file a direct appeal. Kapenekas now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on the issue whether \u00a7 2251(a), as applied to him, is an unconstitutional extension of the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">\u201cA plea of guilty admits all the elements of a formal criminal charge and waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings leading to conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Smallwood, </em>920 F.2d 1231, 1240 (5th Cir.1991). In general, a valid guilty plea forecloses a collateral attack on a final judgment of conviction except upon grounds that the plea was not intelligent or voluntary. <em>See Taylor v. Whitley, </em>933 F.2d 325, 327 (5th Cir.1991). The basis upon which Kapenekas now seeks to challenge his conviction \u2014 an as-applied constitutional challenge to \u00a7 2251(a) \u2014 is a non-jurisdictional defect in the trial court proceedings that is waived by a valid guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Sealed Appellant, </em>526 F.3d 241, 242-43 (5th Cir.2008) (direct appeal). Thus, Kapenekas\u2019s constitutional argument is waived. <em>See Taylor, </em>933 F.2d at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Kapenekas also asserts that the indictment and the plea agreement to which he agreed omitted an essential element of the offense, i.e., that he actually produced visual depictions. However, he did not raise this issue in the district court, and there is no indication that the district court\u2019s grant of a COA included the instant issue. While Kapenekas has briefed the issue, he has not expressly requested that the district court\u2019s grant of a COA be broadened to include this issue. Therefore, we may not consider it. <em>See United States v. Kimler, </em>150 F.3d 429, 431 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.1998) (per curiam); <em>Lackey v. Johnson, </em>116 F.3d 149, 151 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Kapenekas\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is AFFIRMED. Kapenekas\u2019s motion to strike a portion of the appellee\u2019s brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b800-8\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
