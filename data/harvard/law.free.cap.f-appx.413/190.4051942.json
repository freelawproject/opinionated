Collier does not challenge the 60-month consecutive sentence imposed for his conviction of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. Instead, Collier argues that his 46-month sentence, which is at the lowest point of the applicable guideline range, is substantively unreasonable because the district court did not adequately consider the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), or determine whether the sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>tence was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to meet the purposes of sentencing, and therefore the court abused its discretion by not varying downward from the guideline range. Collier contends that the court did not consider his rehabilitative efforts, family support, or the facts of the offense, and unjustifiably relied on one factor \u2014 his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In the sentencing regime existing after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentencing decisions are reviewed on appeal for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A review for reasonableness requires us to apply a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard to the sentence of the district court, whether the sentence is inside or outside the guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 41, 128 S.Ct. at 591. Specifically, such a review requires us to invoke a two-step process to evaluate procedural and substantive reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. If a district court\u2019s decision is procedurally sound, then we review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id.; United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1091 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">To arrive at a substantively reasonable sentence, the district court must give consideration to the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Section 3553(a) first states that \u201c[t]he court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2),\u201d namely, the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, adequately deter criminal conduct, protect the public, and provide the defendant with needed correctional treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The court must also consider the following factors in imposing a sentence: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of available sentences, the sentencing guideline range, any pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities, and the need to provide for restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) and (3)-(7); <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">On appeal, the \u201chighly deferential\u201d review for substantive reasonableness does not involve the consideration of each individual decision made during sentencing. <em>United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 938 (11th Cir.2007). Instead, it requires a review of only the final sentence for reasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Tjhere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d and ordinarily, we expect a sentence within the guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. \u201cThe district court must evaluate all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when arriving at a sentence, but is permitted to attach great weight to one factor over others.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009) (quotation and citation omitted). On appeal, we must determine if the sentence \u201cfail[ed] to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. The burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable, considering both the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, is on the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">After a review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that Collier\u2019s total 46-month sentence on 3 counts of the indictment was substantively reasonable. In light of all the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>that was presented at sentencing and the court\u2019s statement that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Collier has not shown that the court abused its discretion in refraining from varying downward, and in imposing a sentence at the lowest point of the guideline range. Accordingly, we affirm the total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
