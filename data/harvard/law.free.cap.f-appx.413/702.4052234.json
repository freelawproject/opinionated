At the sentencing hearing, he did not argue that the district court failed to provide sufficient reasons for rejecting his arguments. Therefore, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). To show plain error, the defendant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights; if he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-28\">The record reflects that the district court considered all of his arguments, the advisory guidelines range, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and provided sufficient reasons for the sentence imposed. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 359, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>see also Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 361. We previously rejected the argument that consideration of prior convictions to determine offense level and criminal history results in double counting. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). Nothing in the record suggests that the district court believed that the Guidelines were mandatory or that the guidelines range was presumptively reasonable. He has not shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>that the district court committed any error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">De La Cruz Sierra argues his sentence is substantively unreasonable due to the lack of empirical data to support the enhancement, the double counting of his criminal history, and offense levels that are disproportionate to the seriousness of the offense. He concedes that we have previously rejected these arguments. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31; <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67; <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 566 (5th Cir.2008). He has not rebutted the presumption that the within-guidelines sentence was substantively reasonable. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b724-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
