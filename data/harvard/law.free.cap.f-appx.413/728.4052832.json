Ferm\u00edn appeals the district court\u2019s grant of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Fermin\u2019s complaint that alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>violations of the federal Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 et seq., as well as various federal and state law claims, in connection with a home equity conversion loan (a/k/a reverse mortgage) obtained by Ferm\u00edn in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-21\">We review de novo a.grant of summary judgment, applying the same legal standards as the district court. <em>Cuadra v. Houston Indep. School </em>Dist., 626 F.3d 808, 812 (5th Cir.2010). Under the version of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in effect when the district court entered judgment, summary judgment should be granted \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-22\">Ferm\u00edn enumerates twelve issues for appeal that are summarized as follows: (1) The loan agreement terminated when Financial Freedom failed to notify him that its parent company had been ordered into conservatorship status; (2) a judge had determined in a prior lawsuit that Ferm\u00edn was not abusing the legal system; (3) the district court lacked personal jurisdiction because Financial Freedom\u2019s name was stated incorrectly in the caption of the case; (4) Financial Freedom\u2019s pleadings were void because they contained the incorrect caption; (5) Financial Freedom\u2019s assignment of the deed of trust on March 28, 2005, was illegal; (6) Financial Freedom committed mail fraud by mailing statements for illegal monthly charges; (7) Financial Freedom failed to notify him of its assignment of the deed of trust in November 2009; (8) the loan origination fees and finance charges were illegal; (9) his fourth and sixth claims in his second amended complaint show a forfeiture of the loan; (10) his bipolar disorder was an affirmative defense to his \u201cbad conduct\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>(11) he should have been allowed to change his deposition; and (12) the loan agreement was governed by state and federal laws. He also makes several unenumerated assertions, including that (a) the district court overruled his objection regarding the liability of assignees; (b) the order that he pay the defendant\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees was not authorized under Texas law; (c) Financial Freedom failed to comply with 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.33(a); (d) Financial Freedom\u2019s collection of finance charges after it was placed under conservatorship was illegal; (e) he is entitled to a default judgment under Texas precedent; and (f) he is entitled to a default judgment because the magistrate judge misled him regarding several subsections of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them, <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). An appellant\u2019s argument must contain his \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies,\u201d and must contain \u201cfor each issue, a concise statement of the applicable standard of review.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A), (B). Although Ferm\u00edn cites to the record and to statutes, he fails to explain how these entitled him to relief on his claims. Ferm\u00edn has not adequately briefed any of his issues. Issues not adequately briefed are deemed abandoned. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Fermin\u2019s motion is DENIED in part to the extent it seeks to strike the appellee\u2019s brief and is GRANTED in part to the extent it seeks to correct Fermin\u2019s reply brief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b750-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
