In the only four claims relevant to this appeal, Every challenges the dismissal of claims concerning three instances of mail censorship related to litigation in state court (Claims One, Two, and Four), and the censorship of a letter to a Louisiana civil service official (Claim Three). All other claims that were raised in the district court, including all claims against Governor Jindal, are waived by Every\u2019s failure to brief them here. <em>See Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-18\">The district court dismissed the claims both as frivolous and for failing to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 &amp; 1915A and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e. We review its ruling de novo. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-19\">A prisoner\u2019s right to be free from unlawful interference with his mail, including outgoing legal mail, arises from two distinct rights, the right of access to the courts and the right of free speech, which is \u201cthe right to be free from unjustified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>governmental interference with communication.\u201d <em>Brewer v. Wilkinson, </em>3 F.3d 816, 820-21, 825-26 (5th Cir.1993). To state a claim that interference with mail denied him access to court, a prisoner must show an actual injury by establishing that he was prevented from raising a nonfrivolous claim concerning his conviction or the conditions of his confinement. <em>Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 325 (5th Cir.1999); <em>see Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 349-50, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). If a prisoner contends that he was prevented from litigating a claim that does not challenge his conviction or the conditions of his confinement, he alleges no injury that would bring his claim within the scope of his right of access to court. <em>See Jones, </em>188 F.3d at 324; <em>Ruiz, </em>160 F.3d at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">In his first, second, and fourth claims, Every asserts that mail censorship prevented him from litigating in state court. He has expressly declined to explain what nonfrivolous claims he was prevented from raising and has thus abandoned any challenge to the dismissal of these access-to-court claims. <em>See Ruiz, </em>160 F.3d at 275. Moreover, the record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Every suffered no legal prejudice. See <em>Lewis, </em>518 U.S. at 349-50. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Every\u2019s three access-to-court claims pertaining to state court litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">However, Every\u2019s third claim is different, as are his distinct assertions that all four instances of mail censorship denied him his First Amendment right to free speech. Prisoners retain free speech rights consistent \u201cwith the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system,\u201d and restrictions on those rights cannot be greater than necessary to protect the correctional interests involved. <em>Brewer, </em>3 F.3d at 821-22 (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted). Thus, the First Amendment protects a prisoner from mail censorship that is not \u201creasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\u201d <em>Thornburgh v. Abbott, </em>490 U.S. 401, 409-12, 109 S.Ct. 1874, 104 L.Ed.2d 459 (1989); <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987), <em>see also Brewer, </em>3 F.3d at 823-25 &amp; n. 9. Prison officials may not censor clearly-marked legal mail. <em>Freeze v. Griffith, </em>849 F.2d 172, 175 (5th Cir.1988). Censorship\u2019s effect on free speech \u201cneed not be great in order to be actionable.\u201d <em>Keenan v. Tejeda, </em>290 F.3d 252, 259 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see McNamara v. Moody, </em>606 F.2d 621, 623, 625-27 (5th Cir.1979) (upholding an award of nominal damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, and injunctive relief to a prisoner).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">In <em>Brewer, </em>where the defendants allegedly censored a prisoner\u2019s legal mail, we distinguished a free speech claim from an access-to-court claim and noted that different reviewing criteria apply to each claim. <em>Brewer, </em>3 F.3d at 825-26. We did not impose a legal prejudice requirement on the free speech claim, even though it concerned the same mail as did the access-to-court claim. <em>Id. </em>at 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">The district court regarded all of Every\u2019s claims as access-to-court claims and thus did not address Every\u2019s distinct free speech claims. The court also incorrectly applied an access-to-court analysis to Every\u2019s claim concerning nonlegal mail to the civil service agency. <em>See Taylor v. Sterrett, </em>532 F.2d 462, 478-80 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal to the extent that it tacitly rejected Every\u2019s free speech claims without considering them. On remand, the district court should consider, in light of <em>Brewer, </em>whether Every has stated free speech claims concerning his state court litigation or his nonlegal mail. We note that the district court need not reach the merits of any claim against any defendant if dismissal is warranted on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b748-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
