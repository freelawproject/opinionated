He argues that the provisions of the policy endorsement work to create an ambiguity, which must be construed against Southern-Owners as the drafter of that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 1253, 1263 (11th Cir.2010). Because it is a question of law, we also review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of a insurance contract. <em>Vector Prods., Inc. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>397 F.3d 1316, 1318 (11th Cir.2005). This is a diversity case to which Florida law applies. <em>Davis v. Nat\u2019l Med. Enter., Inc., </em>253 F.3d 1314, 1319 n. 6 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Under Florida law, \u201c[i]t is well settled that the actual language used .in the contract is the best evidence of the intent of the parties and, thus, the plain meaning of that language controls.\u201d <em>Rose v. M/V \u201cGulf Stream Falcon\u201d, </em>186 F.3d 1345, 1350 (11th Cir.1999) (citing <em>Green v. Life &amp; Health of Am., </em>704 So.2d 1386, 1391 (Fla.1998)). Where a word or phrase in a contract is subject to more than one reasonable meaning, it is ambiguous. <em>See Friedman v. Va. Metal Prods. Corp., </em>56 So.2d 515, 517 (Fla.1952). Courts decide as a matter of law whether ambiguity exists in a contract, <em>Abis v. Tudin, D.V.M., P.A., </em>18 So.3d 666, 668 (Fla. 2d DCA 2009), and any ambiguity is generally construed against the insurer and in favor of coverage. <em>Garcia v. Fed\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>969 So.2d 288, 291 (Fla.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">The policy endorsement provides that the insurer \u201cwill pay the sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay because of [damages] arising out of the ... use of an \u2018auto\u2019 you do not own or which is not registered in your name, but which is used in your business.\u201d \u201cYou\u201d means the \u201cNamed Insured in the Declarations\u201d and JPH is the insured entity that the declarations name. And \u201cinsured\u201d means \u201cany person ... qualifying as such under\u201d the provision appropriately titled \u201cWho Is An Insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">The \u2018Who Is An Insured\u201d provision states, in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">Each of the following is an insured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-12\">1. You.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-13\">2. Any partner or executive officer of yours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-14\">3. Any person using the \u201cauto\u201d and any person or organization legally responsible for the use of an \u201cauto\u201d not owned by such person or organization, provided the actual use is with your permission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-15\">None of the following is an insured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-16\">2. Any person using the \u201cauto\u201d and any person other than you, legally responsible for its use with respect to an \u201cauto\u201d owned or registered in the name of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-17\">a. such person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>b. any partner or executive officer of yours or a member of his or her household; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">c. any employee or agent of yours who is granted an operating allowance of any sort for the use of such \u201cauto\u201d, [sic]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Hayden argues that the language of the \u201cWho Is An Insured\u201d provision in the policy endorsement contains completely conflicting clauses that create an ambiguity. Hayden argues that the modifying clauses of \u201cnot owned by such person or organization\u201d and \u201cowned or registered in the name of ... such person\u201d do not modify the two \u201c[a]ny person using the \u2018auto\u2019\u201d clauses in that provision. He argues that the policy endorsement can be reasonably read to include without limitation \u201cany person using the \u2018auto\u2019 \u201d as an insured, but then later to exclude without limitation that same class of persons \u2014 \u201cany person using the \u2018auto.\u2019 \u201d There would be an ambiguity if the policy endorsement did grant coverage to \u201cany person using the \u2018auto\u2019 \u201d with one hand and take it away from that same \u201cperson using the \u2018auto\u2019 \u201d with the other. That ambiguity would have to be resolved in favor of coverage under Florida contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">If those clauses are considered in isolation, Hayden\u2019s argument has some force. But, under Florida law, we do not read clauses in a contract in isolation; we look to the contract as a whole. <em>See Jones v. Warmack, </em>967 So.2d 400, 402 (Fla. 1st DCA 2007). \u201cWhen a contract contains apparently conflicting clauses, we must interpret it in a manner that would reconcile the conflicting clauses, if possible.\u201d <em>Lloyds Underwriters v. Netterstrom, </em>17 So.3d 732, 735 (Fla. 1st DCA 2009). Looking at the policy endorsement as a whole, Hayden\u2019s interpretation is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">In defining who is an insured, coverage is limited to \u201c[a]ny person using the \u2018auto\u2019 ... not owned by such person or organization, provided the actual use is with your permission.\u201d The exclusions reiterate that limitation on who is an insured by specifically excluding \u201c[a]ny person using the \u2018auto\u2019 ... owned or registered in the name of ... such person.\u201d Those provisions, read as a whole, contemplate coverage in situations where a JPH employee using a rental car, or another employee\u2019s car drives it on a business errand for JPH. Those provisions, however, exclude a JPH employee who is driving his own vehicle or a vehicle owned by a partner or executive officer of JPH even if he is doing so within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">While the provisions in the policy endorsement are not the clearest contract clauses ever composed, they do not conflict and are not ambiguous. The provision manifests an intent to provide coverage for losses arising from the use of vehicles by people who do not own them while specifically excluding losses arising from people driving their own vehicles. In this case John Hayden was injured while driving his own motorcycle. He is thus not an insured under the policy endorsement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-16\">. The parties dispute whether Hayden was on the job at the time of accident or off the clock and en route to the regional Bikefest. For purposes of summary judgment, the district court assumed Hayden was within the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>of his employment at the time of the accident. We make that same assumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-8\">. Southern-Owners alternatively argues in its response brief that we should affirm because JPH\u2019s policy is not a policy governed by Florida's uninsured motorist statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.727. Because we affirm the district court's order granting summary judgment on other grounds, we need not address Southern-Owners' alternative ground for affirmance. Also, because we affirm the district court\u2019s order of summary judgment, Hayden's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>argument that the costs awarded to Southern-Owners should be reversed if we reversed the summary judgment order is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
