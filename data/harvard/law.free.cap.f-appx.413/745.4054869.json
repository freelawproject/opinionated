Dayo contends that he gave credible testimony establishing that he suffered past persecution in Nigeria and fears future persecution if he is removed to Nigeria. He also asserts that his due process rights were violated during his removal proceedings because the notice to appear did not charge him properly and because the transcript of his hearing was incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-20\">An alien\u2019s application for asylum must be filed within one year of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). The immigration judge held that Dayo\u2019s asylum application was not timely filed. The BIA agreed with the immigration judge\u2019s untimeliness finding. Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the immigration judge\u2019s factual finding that Dayo\u2019s asylum application was untimely. <em>See Nakimbugwe v. Gonzales, </em>475 F.3d 281, 284 &amp; n.1 (5th Cir.2007). A review of the record demonstrates that the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 538 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Vidal v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 250, 254 (5th Cir.2007). Furthermore, to prevail on his due process claims, Dayo must make a prima facie showing that he was eligible for relief from removal. <em>See Anwar v. I.N.S., </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997). In light of his incredible testimony, Dayo has failed to do so. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-21\">In a supplemental brief, Dayo asserts that his due process rights were violated by \u201cICE Officer Davis\u201d who notified the Nigerian government about Dayo\u2019s removal proceedings. He asserts that the officer\u2019s actions have now made the Nigerian government aware of his existence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>have placed him in danger. As the Government argues, Dayo failed to exhaust this issue before the BIA. Accordingly, this court does not have jurisdiction to consider the issue. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, Dayo\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision upholding the immigration judge\u2019s decision regarding Dayo\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Dayo also petitions this court to review the BIA\u2019s decision denying his motion to reopen on the basis of newly discovered evidence. However, Dayo does not challenge the BIA\u2019s reasons for denying his motion to reopen. He does not explain how the affidavits he sought to introduce constituted newly discovered evidence in his petition. Thus, he has waived the issue. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Further, Dayo\u2019s attempt to reassert his argument surrounding Officer Davis\u2019s alleged actions are unexhausted and barred from this court\u2019s review. <em>See Roy, </em>389 F.3d at 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Accordingly, Dayo\u2019s petitions for review are DENIED. Any outstanding motions for stay of removal are DENIED as well.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b767-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
