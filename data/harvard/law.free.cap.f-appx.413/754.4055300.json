Harris argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a search of his apartment. He maintains that the search warrant was invalid because it contained the wrong apartment number. He asserts that the good-faith exception to the warrant requirement does not apply because the search warrant affidavit executed by Officer Carlos Alcocer contained material false statements that were made with reckless disregard for the truth, because Officer Alcocer made material omis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>sions in the affidavit regarding how he learned the apartment number, and because without the false statements in the search warrant affidavit there was not a sufficient description of the place to be searched. Harris maintains that the precedent relied upon by the Government and the district court is factually distinguishable from the present case. He contends that Officer Alcocer\u2019s leading the SWAT team that executed the search warrant to the correct apartment did not validate the warrant because Officer Alcocer had no authority to act as a magistrate and amend the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Harris acknowledges that, even assuming that the warrant was invalid and the good-faith exception did not apply, the officers had probable cause to enter the apartment and detain him after he began firing at the officers. Nevertheless, he maintains that the officers then had authority only to perform a protective sweep, and they exceeded that authority by searching the apartment for drugs and drug paraphernalia in areas where an armed man could not have been hidden. The Government asserts that we should not consider this argument because Harris did not raise it in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">This court employs a two-step process for reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress where a search warrant is involved. <em>United States v. Froman, </em>355 F.3d 882, 888 (5th Cir.2004). We must first decide whether the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies. <em>Id. </em>If the good-faith exception applies, our inquiry ends, and the district court\u2019s judgment must be affirmed. <em>Id. </em>However, if the exception does not apply, we must determine whether there was a substantial basis for the magistrate judge to find probable cause. <em>Id. </em>We review findings of fact made by a district court on a motion to suppress for clear error and the district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>See United States v. Jacquinot, </em>258 F.3d 423, 427 (5th Cir.2001). The good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule will not apply if the affidavit in support of the search warrant contains intentionally false material statements or false material statements made with reckless disregard for the truth, and the affidavit would not have sufficiently established probable cause absent such false statements. <em>United States v. Cavazos, </em>288 F.3d 706, 709-10 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The search warrant affidavit contained an inaccurate statement that the confidential informant (Cl) was seen leaving Harris\u2019s apartment after a controlled buy when the Cl actually was seen only coming down the staircase from Harris\u2019s apartment after the controlled buy. The search warrant affidavit also inaccurately related that the Cl told Officer Alcocer that Harris and his brother were distributing crack cocaine at 8801 Monticello Drive, Apartment 163, when the Cl had stated only that Harris and his brother were distributing crack cocaine from Harris\u2019s apartment, and Officer Alcocer obtained the apartment number from another officer\u2019s reading of a map of the apartment complex. These minor inaccuracies did not materially distort actual facts and were insufficient to show reckless disregard for the truth. <em>See United States v. Arce, </em>633 F.2d 689, 695 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">Other than those minor inaccuracies, all of the statements in the search warrant affidavit that Harris challenges contained the same incorrect statement: that Harris\u2019s apartment was Apartment 163 when it was actually Apartment 165. The overwhelming evidence presented at the suppression hearing showed that the officers could not read the apartment number on Harris\u2019s apartment for safety reasons and that Officer Alcocer honestly believed at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>the time he executed the affidavit that Harris\u2019s apartment was Apartment 163 based upon another officer\u2019s reading of a map of the apartment complex. As the evidence showed that Officer Alcocer\u2019s inclusion of the incorrect apartment number was a negligent mistake based upon the other officer\u2019s misreading of the apartment complex map, Officer Alcocer\u2019s inclusion of the incorrect apartment number in the search warrant affidavit was not made in reckless disregard of the truth and did not make the good-faith exception inapplicable. <em>See Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 171, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Harris maintains that Officer Alcocer\u2019s omission of the facts concerning how he obtained the apartment number and the uncertainty regarding the apartment number required the exclusion of the evidence obtained during the search of his apartment. His argument, however, is without merit because \u201c[t]here is no requirement that an affidavit detail the manner in which the affiant gathered information.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>941 F.2d 1300, 1304 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">While the search warrant incorrectly identified Harris\u2019s apartment as Apartment 163, the Cl showed the apartment to Officer Alcocer, and Officer Alcocer directed the SWAT team that executed the search warrant to the correct apartment. As the same officer both executed the search warrant affidavit and directed the SWAT team to the apartment, \u201c \u2018there was no possibility the wrong premises would be searched.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>901 F.2d 48, 50 (5th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 981, 111 S.Ct. 510, 112 L.Ed.2d 522 (1990) (quoting <em>United States v. Burke, </em>784 F.2d 1090, 1093 (11th Cir.1986)). Given the circumstances, the good-faith exception applied, and the district court did not err by denying the motion to suppress. <em>See id.; United States v. Smith, </em>988 F.2d 1210, -(5th Cir.1993) (unpublished) (\u201cUnpublished opinions issued before January 1, 1996, are precedent.\u201d 5th Cir. R. 47.5.3). We do not reach Harris\u2019s argument that the officers who searched his apartment exceeded the scope of the authority they had to search the apartment based solely upon Harris\u2019s shooting at the officers. <em>See Froman, </em>355 F.3d at 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b776-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
