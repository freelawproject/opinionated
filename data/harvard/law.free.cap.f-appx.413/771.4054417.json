He contends that he was a mere courier, that his transportation of a large amount of marijuana did not preclude a minor role adjustment, and that the district court should not have relied on his unrelated criminal history in denying the requested adjustment. However, Aguilera\u2019s courier status alone did not entitle him to a role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 241 (5th Cir.1995). Furthermore, Aguilera admitted in the presentence report, which the district court adopted, and at rearraignment that he knew that he was transporting marijuana and that he was going to be paid $1,500 for doing so. Accordingly, Aguilera did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his role in the offense was peripheral, and thus the district court did not commit clear error in refusing to award Aguilera a minor role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203-04 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Brown, </em>54 F.3d at 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b794-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court lias determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
