LAPLANTE, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b454-20\">This negligence action arises out of a bicycle accident on Ocean Boulevard in Hampton, New Hampshire, in April 2009. Plaintiff Julie Westerdahl was riding her bicycle along the side of the road, to the right of the fog line, when a vehicle driven in the same direction by defendant Bruce Williams, entering a driveway, made a right-hand turn in front of her. Westerdahl managed to stop her bicycle in time to avoid colliding with Williams\u2019s vehicle but, in so doing, she fell to the ground, dislocating her shoulder. She has sued Williams to recover her resulting damages, including medical expenses, lost wages, loss of enjoyment of life, and pain and suffering, while her husband has joined with a claim for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-21\">This court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1) (diversity), because the Westerdahls are citizens of New Hampshire while Williams is a citizen of New York, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. In Williams\u2019s final pretrial filings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>see </em>L.R. 16.2(b)(3), (d), he objected to two pieces of evidence that Westerdahl intends to introduce at the upcoming jury trial: (1) testimony by Dr. W. Bradley White, who treated her for the injury she sustained in the accident, that he recommends she have corrective surgery to her shoulder, and that the surgery would cost as much as $30,000, and (2) a statement in the police report of the accident that it was caused by Williams\u2019s failure to yield and to exercise due care.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on the parties\u2019 filings, and the arguments of their counsel at the preliminary pretrial conference, the court (1) sustains Williams\u2019s objection to Dr. White\u2019s proffered testimony and (2) denies Williams\u2019s motion in limine to exclude the officer\u2019s conclusion as to fault, without prejudice to Williams\u2019s ability to establish that the conclusion is untrustworthy by examining the officer at trial, outside of the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">1. <em>Dr. White\u2019s opinion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Dr. White, an orthopedic surgeon, treated Westerdahl for her injuries in the wake of the accident, beginning two days afterwards, in April 2009, and continuing through December 2009. Williams does not question that Dr. White can testify as to medical opinions he reached during the course of that treatment, insofar as those opinions are reflected in contemporaneous medical records. But Williams does object to Dr. White\u2019s testifying to conclusions set forth in a letter sent to Westerdahl\u2019s counsel, and forwarded to Williams\u2019s counsel, on June 7, 2011, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">[w]ere [Westerdahl] to have persistent mechanical symptoms then relatively simple arthroscopic management might well be helpful, whereas if she was having instability episodes arthroscopic management might well be possible____For such procedures, which can both be done on an outpatient basis, the surgical fee would be between [$] 2.5-5K, and total charges from the hospital, on the order of [$] 20-30 K.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">I would consider her to have a 12% permanent partial impairment (upper extremity), which translates into a 7% whole person permanent partial impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">(certain parentheticals omitted). Williams argues that, because these opinions were not disclosed until well after the applicable deadline set forth in the scheduling order, Westerdahl should not be able to offer them at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-14\">The scheduling order issued as the result of this court\u2019s approval of the parties\u2019 joint proposed discovery plan. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(f). Under the heading \u201cDates of Disclosure of Experts and Experts\u2019 Written Reports and Supplementation,\u201d the plan states, \u201cPlaintiffs: January 1, 2011.\u201d In a letter to Williams\u2019s counsel, dated February 8, 2011, Westerdahl\u2019s counsel stated that her \u201ctreating physicians will testify____in accordance with the medical records.\u201d The letter further stated that their testimony would be \u201cessentially limited to the fact that her treatment was reasonable and necessary\u201d and \u201cto her prognosis as indicated in the records and by her and that her current condition is permanent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-16\">On June 1, 2011, the deadline for challenges to expert testimony, Williams filed a motion to preclude Westerdahl from \u201cintroducing expert opinion testimony as to diagnosis, prognosis, causation or permanence not contained within the four corners of medical records previously disclosed.\u201d Following an objection, a reply, and a sur-reply, this court denied the motion, observing that \u201cDr. White\u2019s role as a non-retained treating physician witness, and the subject matter of his testimony\u201d had been disclosed to Williams in the February 8 letter, \u201cbarely one month after the deadline set forth in the Discovery Plan (if it even applied to non-retained experts).\u201d Order of July 13, 2011 (document no. 14). Thus, the court ruled, any lateness in the disclosure had not prejudiced Williams. But the court also imposed limitations on the opinions that Dr. White could offer at trial: they had to be \u201c(a) fairly discernible from Julie Westerdahl\u2019s medical records or otherwise based on opinions that [he] formed in a reliable manner while exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>ining and treating her; and (b) within the scope of opinions that a treating physician reasonably and normally would form during such examination and treatment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Prior to that order, but subsequent to the filing of the motion, Westerdahl\u2019s counsel provided Williams\u2019s counsel with Dr. White\u2019s June 7 letter, discussed <em>supra, </em>opining on the advisability of surgery depending on Westerdahl\u2019s present condition, the likely cost of that surgery, and Westerdahl\u2019s level of permanent impairment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Williams argues that Westerdahl should not be able to offer any of those opinions at trial, because they were not disclosed until well after the January 1 deadline set forth in the scheduling order. Westerdahl counters that the deadline does not even apply to Dr. White, because he is a \u201ctreating physician,\u201d not a \u201cretained expert.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Rule 26(a)(2)(B), by its terms, applies only to a witness \u201cretained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or one whose duties as the party\u2019s employee regularly involve giving expert testimony.\u201d So this court has held \u2014 and repeatedly reaffirmed \u2014 that \u201cRule 26(a)(2)(B) reports are not required as a prerequisite to a treating physician expressing opinions as to causation, diagnosis, prognosis and extent of disability where they are based on the treatment.\u201d <em>Sprague v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>177 F.R.D. 78, 81 (D.N.H.1998) (Muirhead, M.J.); <em>see also, e.g., Bartlett v. Mut. Pharm. Co., </em>742 F.Supp.2d 182, 200 (D.N.H.2010); <em>Aumand v. Dartmouth Hitchcock Med. Ctr., </em>611 F.Supp.2d 78, 87-89 (D.N.H.2009).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The self-contained limitation on this rule, however, is that such opinions must be \u201cbased on the treatment.\u201d <em>Sprague, </em>177 F.R.D. at 81. So, as this court has explained, a plaintiffs treating physician may testify to an expert opinion, even in the absence of a report, \u201cprovided that [he or she] reached that conclusion in a reliable manner while examining and treating\u201d the plaintiff. <em>Bartlett, 142 </em>F.Supp.2d at 200. But, in the absence of a report, a plaintiffs treating physician cannot testify to opinions based on \u201c \u2018information not learned during the course of treatment,\u2019\u201d e.g., information contained in a hypothetical posed by counsel. <em>Vosburgh v. Bourassa, </em>2008 DNH 133, 5-8, 2008 WL 3166387 (McAuliffe, C.J.) (quoting <em>Ngo v. Std. Tools &amp; Equip. Co., </em>197 F.R.D. 263, 267 (D.Md.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">This distinction was recently elucidated by the court of appeals (albeit with reference to an exterminator, rather than a physician, whose services the plaintiffs allegedly needed as a result of the defendant\u2019s tortious conduct):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">where ... the expert is part of the ongoing sequence of events and arrives at his ... opinion during treatment, his opinion testimony is not that of retained or specially employed expert. If, however, the expert comes to the case as a stranger and draws the opinion from facts supplied by others, in preparation for trial, he reasonably can be viewed as retained or specially employed for that purpose, within the purview of Rule 26(a)(2)(B).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-12\"><em>Downey v. Bob\u2019s Discount Furniture Holdings, Inc., </em>633 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2011). The court went on to recognize that, under this rubric, \u201can on-the-scene expert whose views are not subject to the written report requirement of Rule 26(a)(2)(B) might also be retained or specially employed to develop <em>additional </em>opinions for purposes of trial (and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>would, to that extent, trigger the written report requirement).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8 n. 5; <em>see also Vosburgh, </em>2008 DNH 133, 7-8 (ruling that, without a report, a treating physician could testify as to \u201chis diagnosis and treatment of plaintiff,\u201d but not the cause of plaintiffs condition, because that was not based on his \u201cexamination and treatment of plaintiff\u2019).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">That aptly describes Dr. White\u2019s role here. In the course of treating Westerdahl for her injuries following the accident, he reached certain opinions about her condition that, presumably, are reflected in her contemporaneous medical records. Williams has not questioned that Dr. WTiite may testify to those opinions at trial and, indeed, this court previously ruled that he could. Order of July 13, 2011 (document no. 14). Williams does challenge, however, the opinions set forth in Dr. White\u2019s June 7 letter, i.e., that Westerdahl\u2019s present condition might indicate surgery, that it could cost as much as $29,000, and that her levels of permanent impairment are 12% in her upper extremity and 7% overall. There is no indication Dr. WTiite reached those opinions in the course of treating Westerdahl.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">To the contrary, as Williams has pointed out, in Dr. Wfliite\u2019s note of one of Westerdahl\u2019s last visit to him, in September 2009, he stated, \u201cI do not see enough to recommend any sort of surgical procedure and only if she were to develop true mechanical symptoms or recurred instability but [sic] I would be comfortable recommending surgery.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Dr. White also stated his expectation that Westerdahl \u201cwill continue to improve [as] regards her range/function and hope that by the 1-2 year mark she will tolerate all activities without significant residual symptoms.\u201d This makes clear that Dr. White had not concluded that Westerdahl needed (or would need) surgery, or was (or would become) disabled, by the time he stopped treating her \u2014 and that any opinion on those subjects he has now is necessarily the result of information he learned since then. Accordingly, Westerdahl ordinarily could not offer those opinions at trial unless she had provided Williams with an expert report stating them and containing the other information required by Rule 26(a)(2)(B). <em>See Downey, </em>633 F.3d at 8 n. 5; <em>Bartlett, </em>742 F.Supp.2d at 200; <em>Vosburgh, </em>2008 DNH 133, 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">That is \u201cordinarily\u201d the case, because there are a few qualifications. First, Rule 26(a)(2)(B) enables the parties to stipulate to forms of expert disclosures other than the formal reports envisioned by the rule. The parties did so here, requiring, in relevant part, only \u201ca brief summary of the expert\u2019s education and experience relevant to his or her area of expertise\u201d and \u201ca report containing a summary of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion.\u201d Westerdahl does not claim to have provided anything approaching that until June 7, 2011, when her lawyer forwarded Dr. White\u2019s letter to Williams\u2019s lawyer. She argues that this was timely because, under Rule 26(b)(2)(D)(I), expert reports need not be made until 90 days before trial. But this is the default deadline that applies \u201c[a]bsent a stipulation or a court order,\u201d and, here, the parties\u2019 joint discovery plan, which the court later adopted as its scheduling order, listed January 1, 2011, as the \u201cDate[ ] of Disclosure of Experts and Experts\u2019 Written Reports and Supplementation\u201d for the plaintiffs. Though Westerdahl has gamely suggested otherwise, the only possible import of this provision is to set January 1, 2011, as the deadline for the plaintiffs to provide their expert reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">Second, when a party \u201cfails to provide information ... as required by Rule 26(a),\u201d a party is \u201cnot permitted to use that ... information ... at a trial unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1). So, as the court of appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>has stated, \u201cthe baseline rule is that the required sanction in the ordinary case is mandatory preclusion\u201d of late-disclosed information. <em>Harriman v. Hancock County, </em>627 F.3d 22, 29 (1st Cir.2010) (quotation marks and bracketing omitted). In deciding whether to impose that remedy, the court of appeals has endorsed considering \u201can array of factors,\u201d including \u201cthe sanctioned party\u2019s justification of the late disclosure; the opponent-party\u2019s ability to overcome its adverse effects (i.e., harmlessness); the history of the litigation; the late disclosure\u2019s impact on the district court\u2019s docket; and the sanctioned party\u2019s need for the precluded evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Esposito v. Home Depot U.S.A, Inc., </em>590 F.3d 72, 76 (1st Cir.2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Here, none of these factors suggests that this court should eschew the \u201cbaseline rule\u201d and impose any remedy other than precluding Dr. White\u2019s challenged testimony. Westerdahl has not offered any justification for waiting until June 7, more than six months after her expert disclosure deadline, to provide Williams with notice of the challenged opinions. The late disclosure was not harmless, because it came after the discovery cutoff and the deadline for Williams to designate his own medical expert if he so chose.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the late disclosure included an opinion that, if allowed, could potentially more than triple the amount of special damages recoverable by Westerdahl at trial. <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra. </em>While neither the history of the litigation (Williams does not suggest that Westerdahl has missed other deadlines in the case) nor the late disclosure\u2019s impact on this court\u2019s docket (aside from the fact that, to overcome the prejudice caused by the late disclosure, Williams would likely have to avail himself of measures that could necessitate a continuance of the trial, <em>see </em>note 6, <em>supra) </em>weighs heavily, if at all, in favor of preclusion, those factors likewise do not weigh against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Finally, although depriving Westerdahl the use of Dr. White\u2019s challenged opinions figures to limit her recoverable damages, as just discussed, it will not \u201cobviously or automatically result in dismissal\u201d of her ease, so her need for the evidence does not weigh strongly against preclusion either. <em>See Harriman, </em>627 F.3d at 32. After due consideration of the applicable factors, this court finds that preventing Westerdahl from offering Dr. White\u2019s challenged opinions (as to her need for surgery, its likely cost, and the level of her permanent disability) is the appropriate remedy for her late disclosure of them. <em>See id.; see also, e.g., Adams v. J. Meyers Builders, </em>671 F.Supp.2d 262, 269-70 (D.N.H.2009). Dr. White will not be permitted to give those opinions at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">2. <em>The investigating officer\u2019s conclusion as to fault</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Williams has moved to exclude the conclusion of the officer who investigated the accident, William Adams, as to its cause. Adams wrote in his police report that \u201cit appears [Williams] failed to yield to [Westerdahl] and exercise due care before making his right turn\u201d (capitalization omitted). Williams argues that this conclusion is untrustworthy and therefore inadmissible under Rule 803(8)(C) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which recognizes an exception to the hearsay rule in civil actions for reports setting forth \u201cfactual findings made pursuant to authority granted by law, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.\u201d He bases this argument on purported deficiencies in Adams\u2019s investigation that came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>to light during his deposition, including, principally, his failure to recognize that a skid mark left by Westerdahl\u2019s bicycle at the scene could have indicated that she had been traveling at an unsafe speed just prior to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Williams\u2019s motion appropriately recognizes that the Federal Rules of Evidence govern the admissibility of Adams\u2019s conclusion here. <em>See, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Expressway Sewerage Constr., Inc., </em>177 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir.1999). Yet the motion cites New Hampshire case law for the propositions that (1) a court \u201cproperly exclude[s] the conclusions of a police officer who is not an accident reconstructionist and ha[s] not investigated many accidents,\u201d and (2) courts \u201croutinely exclude opinions of police officers where they require a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d Even if these are correct as matters of New Hampshire law, however (which this court need not decide because, again, it is federal evidence law that applies in this court) the controlling federal case law on Rule 803(8)(C) does not impose such requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Taking Williams\u2019s second point first, the United States Supreme Court has squarely held \u201cthat portions of investigatory reports otherwise admissible under Rule 803(8)(C) are not inadmissible merely because they state a conclusion or opinion.\u201d <em>Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey, </em>488 U.S. 153, 170, 109 S.Ct. 439, 102 L.Ed.2d 445 (1988). So the fact that, under New Hampshire evidentiary law, \u201cthe opinions of a police officer on fault and causation [of an accident], which are mixed questions of fact and law, must be excluded,\u201d <em>Johnston ex rel. Johnston v. Lynch, </em>133 N.H. 79, 88, 574 A.2d 934 (1990), has no bearing on the admissibility of Williams\u2019s conclusion as to fault and causation under federal evidentiary law.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">As to Williams\u2019s first point, the court of appeals has held that \u201can initial presumption of admissibility\u201d attaches to an officer\u2019s accident report, including its conclusions, so long as it is based on his or her factual investigation. <em>Lubanski v. Coleco Indus., Inc., </em>929 F.2d 42, 45-46 (1st Cir.1991). The court did not adopt any uniform approach or rule, such as the one Williams believes to exist under New Hampshire law, requiring the officer to be qualified as an accident reconstructionist or, for that matter, to have conducted his or her investigation in any particular way. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">This is not to say, of course, that factors such as the investigating officer\u2019s qualifications, or his methodology, are irrelevant to whether his or her report, including any conclusion it expresses, is trustworthy and therefore admissible under Rule 803(8)(C).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. Rule 803(8) advisory committee\u2019s note (1974) (citing \u201cthe special skill or experience of the official\u201d as among \u201cthe factors to be considered\u201d in assessing trustworthiness). It is just that federal law does not absolutely demand such qualifications as a condition of admissibility.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To the contrary, as <em>Lubanski </em>observes, most federal courts have adopted a \u201cbroad interpretation\u201d of Rule 803(8)(C) that favors admitting an investigating officer\u2019s conclusions. 929 F.2d at 45 (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">Taking this approach here, this court denies Williams\u2019s motion to exclude Adams\u2019s conclusion as to the cause of the accident.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>While the motion sets forth arguable shortcomings in Adams\u2019s investigation, those shortcomings, as just discussed, do not render his conclusion untrustworthy under Rule 803(8)(C). This ruling, however, is without prejudice to Williams\u2019s ability to challenge the trustworthiness of Adams\u2019s conclusions at trial, by examining him outside of the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">For the foregoing reasons, Williams\u2019s motion in limine to exclude reference to his liability insurance<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is GRANTED as unopposed, his motion in limine to exclude Adams\u2019s conclusion as to fault<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is DENIED without prejudice as just explained, and his objection to Dr. White\u2019s challenged opinions is SUSTAINED.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-9\">. Williams has also moved to preclude Westerdahl from making any reference to the fact of Williams's liability insurance. Westerdahl does not object to that relief, which is granted. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 411.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\">. Westerdahl later filed, as part of her final pretrial statement, an itemized list of her special damages, <em>see </em>L.R. 16.2(a)(6), that includes a charge in the amount of $29,000 for \"Future Arthroscopic Surgery.\u201d The balance of Westerdahl\u2019s claimed special damages is roughly $18,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b456-8\">. There are other disclosure requirements that apply to treating physicians: the party seeking to offer their expert opinion testimony must disclose their identities, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(A); <em>Aumand, </em>611 F.Supp.2d at 88, as well as \"the subject matter\u201d of that testimony and \"a summary of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(C). Williams does not question that Westerdahl complied with these requirements through her counsel's letter of February 7. Insofar as Williams argues that this disclosure was untimely, coming after the \"Dates of Disclosure of Experts and Experts' Written Reports and Supplementation\u201d set forth in the discovery plan, it is not clear from the plan that this deadline even applies to non-retained experts and, even if it did, Westerdahl missed it by just over a month, which was harmless. <em>See </em>Order of July 13, 2011 (document no. 14).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b457-6\">. Indeed, this court drew the same distinction in its prior order on Dr. While\u2019s opinions, ruling that they were admissible only insofar as they were reflected in her medical records or \"otherwise based on opinions that [he] formed in a reliable manner while examining and treating\u201d Westerdahl. Order of July 13, 2011.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b457-12\">. In a note of Westerdahl\u2019s last visit to him, on December 30, 2009, Dr. White wrote, \u201d[g]iven her time frame, I don't expect she would want to consider major capsular labral reconstruction, but she might simple/scope debridement versus activity modification.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b458-5\">. Westerdahl argues that she nevertheless offered to produce Dr. White for deposition before trial (he had not been deposed during the discovery period) which would have eliminated any prejudice to Williams. While this may be the appropriate remedy for the late disclosure of expert testimony in some circumstances, resorting to it in every such case would effectively turn court-ordered expert disclosure deadlines into \"merely aspirational\u201d guidelines, against the counsel of the court of appeals. <em>Lohnes v. Level 3 Commnc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>272 F.3d 49, 60 (1st Cir.2001). Indeed, \"[i]f continuances were granted as a matter of course for violations of [scheduling orders], [they] could always be disregarded with impunity.\u201d <em>Thibeault v.

McLaughlin, ed., 2d ed. 1999 &amp; 2010 supp.); <em>see also Aumand, </em>611 F.Supp.2d at 85-86 (discussing similar split of authority as to opinions in business records admissible under Rule 803(6)). While the court of appeals has not squarely addressed this issue, its opinion in <em>Lubanski </em>strongly suggests that it would not superimpose the Rule 702 requirements on to a conclusion in a public record; indeed, the court\u2019s opinion contains no discussion of the officer\u2019s qualifications or methodology, yet holds that the district court erred by excluding his report \"pro forma.\" 929 F.2d at 46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b459-14\">. Despite Williams's suggestion to the contrary, neither does New Hampshire law. <em>See Carignan v. Wheeler, </em>153 N.H. 465, 468, 898 A.2d 1011 (2006) (\"there is no requirement that a police officer be an expert in accident reconstruction or have investigated a large number of accidents\" for a conclusion from his or her report to be admitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b459-15\">. It is unclear from the parties\u2019 submissions whether Westerdahl intends to elicit an opinion as to the cause of the accident from Williams at trial. It seems clear, though, that he would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>be qualified to do so. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Evid. Rule 702. While the court realizes that this presents a bit of a paradox \u2014 that an officer\u2019s opinions as to causation or fault would be inadmissible when offered from the witness stand but admissible when offered through his or her police report \u2014 it is a paradox that the controlling caselaw seems to tolerate, as just discussed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b460-26\">.
