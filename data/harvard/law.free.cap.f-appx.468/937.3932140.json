After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Wingfield pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute five or more grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and one count of possession with intent to distribute five or more grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Because he had at least two prior felony controlled-substance convictions, Wingfield\u2019s presentence investigation report applied the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). As a career offender, and based on the total amount of crack cocaine for the offenses, Wingfield received a base offense level of 34. After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Wingfield\u2019s guideline range was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">At Wingfield\u2019s sentencing, the government stated that it would not object to a reasonable variance in Wingfield\u2019s sentence based on the Department of Justice\u2019s recent position that sentences for crack and powder cocaine offenses should be equivalent. Had Wingfield been convicted of a powder cocaine offense, his guideline range would have been 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court accordingly sentenced Wingfield to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">In 2011, Wingfield filed a pro <em>se </em>motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on retroactive amendments to the guidelines that lowered the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court denied the motion, determining that Wingfield was ineligible for a reduction because he was sentenced as a career offender. Wing-field now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a term of imprisonment \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">Wingfield\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by our precedent. A defendant sentenced as a career offender, whose guideline range was not based on the offense level for crack cocaine, is ineligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327 (holding that, when a defendant was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, that defendant\u2019s base offense level for his crack cocaine offense did not play a role in the calculation of the guideline range and the amendments did not lower the applicable guideline ranges). Moreover, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions, so Wingfield\u2019s argument that the district court had the discretion to modify his sentence under that section, despite his career offender status, is without merit. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2693, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b966-7\">. Wingfield also contended that his post-sentencing rehabilitation warranted a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), but the district court found that argument meritless. Wingfield does not challenge this ruling on appeal; he has accordingly abandoned his assertion. <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
