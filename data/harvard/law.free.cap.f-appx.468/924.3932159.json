No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-25\">Berry pleaded guilty to a drug-trafficking offense, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. The sentencing court concluded that Berry qualified as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and sentenced him to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment in February 2007. Berry appealed neither his conviction nor sentence..</p>\n<p id=\"b952-26\">Almost three years later, in January 2010, Berry filed a section 2255 habeas motion. Citing <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009), Berry argued that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>had been sentenced improperly as a career offender because it is now clear that the predicate offenses used to support his career-offender enhancement \u2014 carrying a concealed firearm \u2014 no longer qualify as violent felonies. Berry argued that he is factually innocent of the career-offender enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The district court determined that Berry\u2019s motion was untimely: it was filed more than one year after entry of judgment had become final. The district court rejected Berry\u2019s argument that his motion was timely because it was filed within one year of the <em>Chambers </em>decision. The <em>Chambers </em>decision was an extension of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008); the limitations period under section 2255(f)(3) starts to run from \u201cthe date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(3). The district court concluded that even if <em>Begay </em>and <em>Chambers </em>applied retroactively, Berry had only to 16 April 2008 \u2014 one year from the date <em>Begay </em>issued \u2014 to file his motion. It also ruled in the alternative \u2014 on the merits \u2014 that Berry was entitled to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">The district court issued a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) asking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcC\">whether the \u201cactual innocence\u201d doctrine applies within the context of challenging a predicate offense utilized to classify a defendant as a career offender, and if so, whether an \u201cactual innocence\u201d exception exists to AEPDA\u2019s one-year limitation period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">As a general rule, a criminal defendant who fails to object at trial or to raise an issue on direct appeal is procedurally barred from raising the claim in a section 2255 motion, absent a showing of cause for failing to preserve the claim and actual prejudice from the alleged error. <em>See United States, v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 1594, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982). Berry argues that the one-year statute of limitations should be tolled and his procedural default excused because he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d \u2014 both factually and legally \u2014 of being a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">The merits of a procedurally defaulted claim may be reached, in very narrowly defined circumstances, if failure to address the claim would result in a \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Murray v. Carrier, 477 </em>U.S. 478, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 2649, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986). And, actual innocence of the offense may be shown to satisfy the fundamental miscarriage of justice standard. <em>See Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 115 S.Ct. 851, 864, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995) (\u201ctying the miscarriage of justice exception to innocence ... accommodates both the systemic interests in finality, comity, and conservation of judicial resources, and the overriding individual interest in doing justice in the \u2018extraordinary case.\u2019 \u201d). But Berry does not claim to be actually innocent of the crime for which he was sentenced or innocent of the predicate crimes upon which his career-offender status was based; instead, he claims to be actually innocent of being a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\"><em>McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2011) rejected the argument that an actual-innocence-of-sentence exception applies to an initial section 2255 claim that the petitioner was wrongly sentenced as a career offender where one of his predicate convictions \u2014 carrying a concealed weapon \u2014 did not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Because the actual innocence exception is focused on actual (not legal) innocence, we concluded that petitioner <em>McKay </em>\u2014 who, like Berry, made no claim to being factually innocent of the crime of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>carrying a concealed weapon \u2014 cannot qualify for the actual innocence exception. <em>Id. </em>at 1199. The actual innocence exception has no application to Berry\u2019s sentencing claim that he was wrongly sentenced as a career offender. <em>See id. </em>at 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Because Berry fails to show that his procedural default should be excused, the district court committed no abuse of discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration of the denial of his habeas petition. We decline to reach the merits of his procedurally-defaulted claim.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b954-16\"> Because the actual innocence exception has no application to Berry's claim, we need not address whether an \"actual innocence\u201d exception to AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations might exist.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
