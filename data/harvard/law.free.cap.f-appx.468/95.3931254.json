We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> conducting plenary review of the dismissal and abuse-of-discretion review of denials of post-judgment motions for reconsideration. <em>Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (Bd Cir.1999); <em>Bushman v. Halm, </em>798 F.2d 651, 656 n. 9 (3d Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-20\">We are in full accord with the District Court, and finding no substantial question presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm the Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 248 (3d Cir.2011); <em>see also </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. To the extent that the complaint intended to attack conduct taking place in 1989 and 1990, relief is likely forestalled by the limitations periods of both 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the Federal Tort Claims Act, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a), a defect that is clear from the face of the complaint. <em>Kach v. Hose, </em>589 F.3d 626, 634 (3d Cir.2009); <em>Ray v. Kertes, </em>285 F.3d 287, 296 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Fratus v. DeLand, </em>49 F.3d 673, 674-75 (10th Cir.1995). To the extent that a liberal reading of the pro se complaint, <em>see Richardson v. Miller, </em>446 F.2d 1247, 1248 (3d Cir.1971), suggests that Fleming intended to complain of ongoing conduct that might fall within the limitations period \u2014 or, in the alternative, were he able to make a case for tolling of the statute of limitations, <em>see, e.g., Santos v. United States, </em>559 F.3d 189, 194-95 (3d Cir.2009); <em>Lake v. Arnold, </em>232 F.3d 360, 370 (3d Cir.2000)\u2014we find that the complaint still fails to \u201cstate a plausible claim for relief.\u201d <em>Burtch v. Milberg Factors, Inc., </em>662 F.3d 212, 225 (3d Cir.2011) (citing <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1950, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009)). The motions for reconsideration, all of which were properly denied, amply demonstrate that amendment of the complaint would have been futile and that granting leave to amend was therefore unnecessary. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 110-111 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">In sum, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-18\">. The District Court's order did not comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(a). <em>See In re Cendant Corp. Secs. Litig., </em>454 F.3d 235, 242-43 (3d Cir.2006); <em>see also Kidd v. District of Columbia, </em>206 F.3d 35, 39 (D.C.Cir.2000). Therefore, because Fleming's postjudgment motions and notice of appeal were timely filed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(c)(2)(B), the appeal itself is timely as to all of his submissions. <em>See CTC Imp. &amp; Exp. v. Nigerian Petroleum Corp., </em>951 F.2d 573, 577 (3d Cir. 1991); <em>Federal Kemper Ins. Co. v. Rauscher, </em>807 F.2d 345, 348 (3d Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
