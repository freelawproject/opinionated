Jones also has filed a motion requesting a telephone hearing. The district court dismissed her complaint on the ground that she did not describe a claim recognized at law. We construe the district court\u2019s dismissal as a dismissal as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-20\">Jones has failed to address the district court\u2019s rationale for dismissing her claims against Citimortgage, Inc., or her claims against Pioneer Homes. Although we liberally construe pro se filings, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must raise arguments in order to preserve them, <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). By failing to discuss the district court\u2019s rationale for dismissing these claims, Jones has abandoned them. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although Jones provides some discussion in her brief regarding her claim against the United States Postal Service, Jones has inadequately briefed this issue as well. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25; <em>Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Because Jones has failed to demonstrate that she will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal, her motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 24(a); <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). Her motion requesting a telephone hearing also is denied. The appeal is without arguable merit, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), and it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b448-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
