The district court denied his motion, and Robiou timely appealed. After reviewing the briefs, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-22\">In 2007, Robiou pled guilty to two counts of possession with the intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Counts 1 and 2), one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Count 3), and one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Count 5). Because of Robiou\u2019s pri- or felony drug conviction, Count 5 carried a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced Robiou to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts 1, 2, and 3, and 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 5 with each sentence to run concurrently. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, Robiou\u2019s sentence was subsequently reduced to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-23\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). A defendant is ineligible for a sentence reduction where an \u201camendment does not have the effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>lowering [his] applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g. </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339-42 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Although Amendment 750 reduced Robiou\u2019s adjusted offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1, the district court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment based on the statutory mandatory minimum. Therefore, the district court properly denied Robiou\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence because Amendment 750 did not alter the statutory mandatory minimum 120 month sentence that is required under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
