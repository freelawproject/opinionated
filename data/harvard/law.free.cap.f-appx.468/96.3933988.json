He was sentenced to sixty months of imprisonment followed by five years of supervised release. We affirmed Hasan\u2019s conviction but remanded for resentencing on a discrete issue. <em>See United States v. Hasan, </em>407 Fed.Appx. 602, 608 (3d Cir.2011). Thereafter, the District Court conducted a hearing and ultimately imposed a new sentence of fifty-seven months of imprisonment, again followed by five years of supervised release. The District Court\u2019s amended criminal judgment was entered on June 15, 2011.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Five days later, the District Court denied Hasan\u2019s pro se motion for relief under Rule 12(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hasan\u2019s undated notice of appeal was received by the District Court thirty-five days after it entered its order on June 20, 2011. This might have been late under the fourteen-day time period that governs criminal appeals, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i), but special rules govern the application of that time period. <em>See Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988) (a pro se prisoner\u2019s notice of appeal is deemed filed at the moment of delivery to prison authorities for forwarding to the district court); <em>United States v. Grana, </em>864 F.2d 312, 316 (3d Cir.1989) (\u201cin computing the timeliness of <em>pro se </em>prisoners\u2019 appeals, any prison delay in transmitting to the prisoner notice of the district court\u2019s final order or judgment shall be excluded from the computation of an appellant\u2019s time for taking an appeal\u201d). In this particular case, we need not turn to those special rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">We recently held that \u201cRule 4(b) is not jurisdictional and is subject to forfeiture.\u201d <em>V.I. v. Martinez, </em>620 F.3d 321, 327 (3d Cir.2010). As in <em>Martinez, </em>here the Government did not respond to the Clerk\u2019s order permitting \u201cwritten argument regarding jurisdiction.\u201d (Order of the Clerk dated August 10, 2011). Nor did it invoke Rule 4(b) in a motion to dismiss. Accordingly, the Government has forfeited any available untimeliness argument. <em>See Martinez, </em>620 F.3d at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">We therefore exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s June 20, 2011 order because this appeal does not present a substantial question. <em>Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 247 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">In Hasan\u2019s Rule 12(b)(3) motion, he contended that \u201cany [plea] agreement signed or verbally contracted which violates Federal Statutes is <em>NULL AND VOID.\u201d </em>The motion also challenged the jurisdiction<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the District Court: \u201c[Co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>defendant] never signed a contract or any other piece of paper which would make a material false representation [in order to defraud a financial institution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344]. She had no contract with the bank; hence no involvement with the FDIC, and no violation of Interstate Commerce, which is the basis of all Federal Jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The District Court noted both its rejection of identical arguments made by Hasan in February 2008, and that we likewise found Hasan\u2019s arguments to be meritless on appeal. <em>See Hasan, </em>407 Fed.Appx. at 603. Accordingly, the District Court denied Hasan\u2019s motion as barred by \u2018the law of the case doctrine.\u2019 The District Court alternatively found Hasan\u2019s arguments to be \u201cequally meritless the second time around.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The District Court appropriately invoked the law of the case doctrine in rejecting Hasan\u2019s arguments in support of Rule 12(b)(3) relief, based on the fact that those arguments were previously rejected by the District Court and again by this Court on appeal. <em>See Farina v. Nokia, Inc., </em>625 F.3d 97, 117 n. 21 (3d Cir.2010) (\u201cThe law of the case doctrine \u2018posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). While there exist exceptions to the doctrine, <em>see Schneyder v. Smith, </em>653 F.3d 313, 331-32 (3d Cir.2011), none is remotely applicable to Hasan\u2019s case. We also note that, the law of the case doctrine aside, Rule 12(b)(3) is hardly the appropriate vehicle to challenge a guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Bergrin, </em>650 F.3d 257, 268 (3d Cir.2011) (\u201cGenerally speaking, [Rule 12(b) triggers] a narrow limited analysis geared only towards ensuring that legally deficient charges do not go to a jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Accordingly, for the reasons given in this opinion, we will summarily affirm the June 20, 2011 order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-6\">. Hasan\u2019s counseled appeal from that judgment was docketed at C.A. No. 11-2689.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\">. Rule 12(b)(3) \"states that, 'at any time while the case is pending, the court may hear a claim that the indictment or information fails to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction or to state an offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Vitillo, </em>490 F.3d 314, 320 (3d Cir.2007). Hasan\u2019s motion was filed two months before the District Court entered its amended criminal judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b125-8\">. The denial of a Rule 12(b)(3) motion generally occurs prejudgment and is considered a non-appealable interlocutory ruling. <em>See United States v. Litman, </em>661 F.2d 17, 18 (3d Cir.1981). Because Hasan's Rule 12 motion was denied <em>after </em>the District Court\u2019s entry of judgment, his appeal is not \u201cinterlocutory.\u201d <em>See </em>Black's Law Dictionary 113 (9th ed.2009) (defining the 'term \"interlocutory appeal\u201d as \u201d[a]n appeal that occurs <em>before </em>the trial court\u2019s final ruling on the entire case\u201d) (emphasis added). Were we to characterize the District Court\u2019s June 20, 2011 order as something other than a \u2018final,\u2019 appealable order, the decision would effectively evade appellate review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b125-14\">.We use the term \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 only to be consistent with prior descriptions of Hasan\u2019s arguments. <em>Cf. Vitillo, </em>490 F.3d at 320 (\"We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>conclude that Vitillo's challenge to the indictment [under Rule 12(b)(3)] is more properly characterized as a \u2018pleading\u2019 challenge than one of 'jurisdiction' \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
