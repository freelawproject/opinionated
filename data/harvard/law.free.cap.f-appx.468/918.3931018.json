On appeal, In-fante argues that the district court erred in granting BOA\u2019s motion to dismiss because: (1) his complaint pled fraud with sufficient particularity to satisfy the pleading requirements of federal law by alleging that BOA\u2019s agents misrepresented In-fante\u2019s income on his loan application and concealed this fact by not giving Infante an opportunity to review the application; and (2) his complaint properly presented a present need for a declaration of his right to recision under the TILA. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Am. United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, </em>480 F.3d 1043, 1056-57 (11th Cir.2007). The complaint is viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and all of the plaintiffs well-pleaded facts are accepted as true. <em>Id. </em>at 1057. Dismissal is not appropriate unless it is plain that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would support the claims in the complaint. <em>Davila v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>326 F.3d 1183, 1185 (11th Cir.2003). However, a district court may properly dismiss a complaint if it rests only on conclusory allegations, unwarranted factual deductions, or legal conclusions masquerading as facts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">The relevant background is this. In-fante is the current owner of a parcel of property located in Coconut Grove, Florida (\u201cthe property\u201d). In October of 2007, In-fante closed on two mortgage loans whereby Countrywide Bank, FSB (\u201cCountrywide\u201d), a corporate entity that has since been purchased by BOA, agreed to finance the \u201cconstruction of a residence and related improvement on the property\u201d and to refinance the property. The first mortgage loan was for $1,462,500 (\u201cfirst mortgage loan\u201d) and the second mortgage loan was for $195,000 (\u201csecond mortgage loan\u201d). In order to obtain these loans, Infante submitted a loan application \u2014 commonly referred to as a Uniform Residential Loan Application (\u201cURLA\u201d) \u2014 that required In-fante to provide a variety of detailed information regarding his financial standing, such as net assets, income, and expenses. This application, which Infante swore contained true and correct information, reflected a monthly income of $35,416.00. However, Infante claims that his income at the time was only $15,522.28 and that BOA \u201cinflated the true income figures to justify the loan and prepare the loan for future assignment or sale\u201d and to induce Infante to \u201cincur a loan obligation that the Defendant was fully aware that Plaintiff would ultimately be unable to pay.\u201d Infante also asserts that BOA neglected to make certain disclosures required by the TILA and that Infante is thus entitled to rescind the transactions at issue pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">First, we are unpersuaded by Infante\u2019s claim that the district court erred in dismissing his fraud claim. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b) provides that in \u201calleging fraud ... a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.\u201d In order to do so, a plaintiff must set forth \u201c(1) precisely what statements were made in what documents or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>oral representations or what omissions were made, (2) the time and place of each such statement and the person responsible for making (or, in the case of omissions, not making) same, (3) the content of such statements and the manner in which they misled the plaintiff, and (4) what the defendants obtained as a consequence of the fraud.\u201d <em>Ziemba v. Cascade Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>256 F.3d 1194, 1202 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Brooks v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Fla., Inc., </em>116 F.3d 1364, 1371 (11th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The crux of Infante\u2019s fraud claim is that \u201cDefendant made misrepresentations in the [URLA] when it specifically knew that the representations as [they] pertain to the Plaintiffs income [were] false.\u201d In order to state a cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation under Florida law, the relevant state law in this case, a plaintiff must adequately allege: (1) a false statement by the defendant concerning a material fact; (2) the defendant\u2019s knowledge that the representation was false; (3) that the representation was made by the defendant with the intent to induce another to act on it; and (4) that the plaintiff suffered a consequent injury in reliance on the representation. <em>Johnson v. Davis, </em>480 So.2d 625, 627 (Fla.1985). A plaintiffs \u201c[fjailure to allege a specific element of fraud in a complaint is fatal when challenged by a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Strack v. Fred Rawn Constr., Inc., </em>908 So.2d 563, 565 (Fla. 4th DCA 2005) (affirming dismissal of fraud count with prejudice where plaintiff failed to allege all elements despite having been given multiple opportunities to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Among other things, Infante\u2019s fraud claim fails to state a claim because his complaint fails to allege facts that, if proven, would render BOA liable for torts committed by Countrywide prior to its acquisition by BOA. Florida follows the traditional corporate law rule that where a corporation acquires 100% of another corporation\u2019s stock or assets, it \u201cdoes not as a matter of law assume the liabilities of the prior business.\u201d <em>Corporate Express Office Products, Inc. v. Phillips, </em>847 So.2d 406, 412 (Fla.2003). There are exceptions to the general rule, such as where: \u201c(1) the successor expressly or impliedly assumes obligations of the predecessor; (2) the transaction is a de facto merger; (3) the successor is a mere continuation of the predecessor; or (4) the transaction is a fraudulent effort to avoid liabilities of the predecessor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bernard v. Kee Mfg. Co., </em>409 So.2d 1047, 1049 (Fla.1982)). However, in this case, Infante failed to allege any facts giving rise to the reasonable inference that BOA is liable for the pre-acquisition torts committed by Countrywide. In fact, the only allegations in the complaint concerning the BOA-Countrywide transaction are that \u201cCountrywide ... is now owned by the Defendant\u201d and that \u201cCountrywide Bank, FSB was purchased by the Defendant.\u201d Because the burden is on Infante to make sufficient allegations of fraud, the district court properly concluded that these bare allegations, standing alone, are inadequate under federal pleading standards to give rise to an inference of a merger, a de facto merger, or any other corporate law principle that might impose liability on BOA for the fraud allegedly perpetrated by Countrywide. Accordingly, Infante\u2019s fraud claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Nor do we find any merit to Infante\u2019s argument that the district court erred in dismissing his TILA rescission claim. The TILA-based right to rescission does not apply to a \u201cresidential mortgage transaction.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635(e)(1); <em>see also </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.23(f)(1). A \u201cresidential mortgage transaction\u201d is defined in the statute as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>a transaction in which a mortgage, deed of trust, purchase money security interest arising under an installment sales contract, or equivalent consensual security interest is created or retained against the consumer\u2019s dwelling to finance the acquisition or initial construction of such dwelling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(w).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">While the statute does not expressly address the applicability of TILA to multipurpose loans \u2014 for example, loans that are used to both construct a dwelling and refinance the property upon which the dwelling is built \u2014 the pertinent Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Official Staff Interpretations <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> note that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-7\">[a] transaction meets the definition of this section if any part of the loan proceeds will be used to finance the acquisition or initial construction of the consumer\u2019s principal dwelling. For example, a transaction to finance the initial construction of the consumer\u2019s principal dwelling is a residential mortgage transaction even if a portion of the funds will be disbursed directly to the consumer or used to satisfy a loan for the purchase of the land on which the dwelling will be built.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">12 C.F.R. pt. 226, Supp. I, Subpart A, \u00a7 226.2(a)(24)-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">In this case, Infante\u2019s claim for rescission of the first mortgage loan fails because some of the loan proceeds were used to finance the cost of constructing Infante\u2019s residence. Although Infante conclusorily alleges that the purpose of the mortgage loans \u201cwas a refinance and not a residential mortgage for acquisition or initial construction of a dwelling,\u201d the more specific contents of the controlling signed loan documents unequivocally establish the fact that the first mortgage loan proceeds were disbursed \u2014 at least in part \u2014 to finance the construction of Infante\u2019s principal dwelling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the document provides that \u201cBorrower, lender, and a contractor are entering into a Construction Loan Agreement ... under which Lender has agreed to extend to Borrower a loan ... to finance Borrower\u2019s construction of a residence and related improvements on the Property.\u201d). As a result, the first mortgage loan constitutes a \u201cresidential mortgage transaction\u201d and is exempt from TILA\u2019s rescission provisions. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-10\">. The official staff interpretations are binding \"unless demonstrably irrational.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Fleet Finance, Inc., </em>4 F.3d 946, 949 (11th Cir.1993) (citing <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 565, 100 S.Ct. 790, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b949-11\">. Because these loan documents are central to the claims and referred to and relied on throughout the operative complaint, they were appropriately considered on BOA's motion to dismiss. <em>See Brooks v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Fla., </em>116 F.3d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cwhere the plaintiff refers to certain documents in the complaint and those documents are central to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, then the Court may consider the documents part of the pleadings for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal\u201d). Moreover, because these documents contradict the general and conclusory allegations of the complaint, these documents govern. <em>Crenshaw v. Lister, </em>556 F.3d 1283, 1292 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
