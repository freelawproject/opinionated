Arrow Financial Services, LLC, </em>421 Fed.Appx. 920 (11th Cir.2010) (unpublished), we applied our binding precedent holding that Congress had granted state courts exclusive jurisdiction over private actions under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227, and that federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over those lawsuits. <em>See Nicholson v. Hooters of Augusta, Inc., </em>136 F.3d 1287, 1288-89 (11th Cir.1998), <em>abrogated by Mims v. Arrow Fin. Servs., LLC, </em>565 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 740, 181 L.Ed.2d 881 (2012). Because we were bound by that precedent, we affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing for lack of subject matter jurisdiction Mims\u2019 complaint, which alleged that Arrow Financial Services, LLC violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. <em>See Mims, </em>421 Fed.Appx. at 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-26\">The Supreme Court reversed our judgment in the <em>Mims </em>case and remanded it to us. <em>Mims, </em>132 S.Ct. at 753. In its <em>Mims </em>decision the Supreme Court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>\u201cthat Congress did not deprive federal courts of federal-question jurisdiction over private TCPA suits,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 747, and that \u201cfederal law gives rise to the claim for relief Mims has stated and specifies the substantive rules of decision,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 753. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Mims\u2019 complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
