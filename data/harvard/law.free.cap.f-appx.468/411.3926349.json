He contends that the district court procedurally erred in upwardly departing from the advisory guidelines range of 6-12 months in prison and that the sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Gutierrez-Hernandez, </em>581 F.3d 251, 254 (5th Cir.2009). Additionally, we review upward departures for reasonableness, which necessitates that we review \u201cthe district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly and the extent of that departure for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">Initially, we reject Beltran-Cer-vantes\u2019s argument that the district court misapplied the upward departure Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, because it stated that his criminal history category merely \u201cunderrepresented\u201d his risk of recidivism instead of stating that it \u201csubstantially underrepresented\u201d his risk of recidivism as required by \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l). There is no indication in the record that the district court misunderstood the proper standard for an upward departure under \u00a7 4A1.3 or that its statement was not merely a shorthand reference to that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">Beltran-Cervantes has not shown that the district court\u2019s decision to impose an above-guidelines sentence under \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1) was procedurally or substantively unreasonable. After considering Beltran-Cervantes\u2019s mitigating argument of cultural assimilation, the sentencing court cited case-specific reasons for the upward departure, including his history of assaultive conduct, the lack of deterrent effect from his prior lenient treatment and sentences, and his prior uncharged offense of attempted illegal reentry into the United States. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l), (2)(E) &amp; comment, (backg\u2019d); <em>Zuniga-Peratta, </em>442 F.3d at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-17\">As Beltran-Cervantes insists, for the first time on appeal, that the district court could not consider his association with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>gang as a basis for an upward departure under \u00a7 4A1.3, we review that contention for plain error. To establish plain error, a defendant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The list of categories of information regarding conduct that \u201cmay\u201d support a departure under \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2) is nonexclusive, <em>see United States v. Cantu-Domin guez, </em>898 F.2d 968, 970 (5th Cir.1990), and Beltran-Cervantes points to no precedent prohibiting the district court from considering his association with a gang when imposing an upward departure. Accordingly, he has not shown error that is clear or obvious. <em>See United States v. Valles, </em>484 F.3d 745, 759 (5th Cir.2007). Moreover, Beltran-Cervantes conceded to the district court that (1) he was affiliated with a gang when he was a juvenile, (2) he did not expressly deny the presentence report\u2019s statement that he associated with members of a different gang since becoming an adult, and (3) he has not shown that any of the other varied bases for the district court\u2019s upward departure were improper. Thus, even assuming any error, he has not shown that it affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 438 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Given the district court\u2019s reasons for the departure, Beltran-Cervantes has failed to show that the 24-month sentence constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347. In fact, we have upheld upward departures of greater magnitude than the departure in this case. <em>See, e.g., Jones, </em>444 F.3d at 433, 442; <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Daughen-baugh, </em>49 F.3d 171, 174 (5th Cir.1995). Beltran-Cervantes\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
