J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">The issue confronting us on this appeal is whether L.1980, c. 147, effective November 22, 1980, increased the term of the incumbent Paramus Borough Clerk from one year to three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">The facts are not in dispute. Prior to November 22, 1980 <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:9-133 provided that the term of office of a municipal clerk was three years, \u201c[u]nless otherwise provided by law.\u201d Similarly, prior to that date, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:87-15 provided that the term of office for appointive officers under the borough form of government was \u201cfor 1 year and until their successors shall have qualified.\u201d Since Paramus is governed under the borough form of government, the applicable section for appointment of the borough\u2019s appointive officers (including the borough clerk) is <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:87-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-14\">Plaintiff was first appointed borough clerk in January 1977. She was also appointed to that office at the borough\u2019s annual reorganization meetings in 1978, 1979 and 1980. Her most recent appointment was made on January 1, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>On November 22,1980, L.1980, c. 147, was enacted. Under \u00a7 5 the phrase \u201c[uJnless otherwise provided by law\u201d was deleted from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:9~-133, and the statute now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">In every municipality there shall be a municipal clerk. When so provided by law the municipal clerk shall be elected, otherwise he shall be appointed by the governing body of the municipality. His term of office shall be 3 years. If elected, his term shall commence on January 1 following his election and when appointed, his term shall run from January 1 in the year in which he was appointed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Under \u00a7 1 <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:87\u201415 was amended to provide that the term of office of borough appointive officers was \u201cfor 1 year, or for such specific term as is generally provided by law, and until their successors shall have qualified.\u201d Section 6 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">Nothing contained in this act shall be deemed to affect the term of office of any municipal clerk serving on the effective date of this act a specified term of more than 3 years during such term.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Section 9 provides that the act \u201cshall take effect immediately\u201d\u2014 <em>i. </em>e., November 22, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">On January 1,1981, when the borough held its annual reorganization meeting, the mayor did not nominate anyone for appointment to the office of borough clerk. Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:87-16, if the mayor \u201cfails\u201d to make a nomination for an appointive office \u201cwithin thirty days after the office becomes vacant,\u201d the borough council \u201cshall appoint\u201d the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">On February 5, 1981 plaintiff filed a verified complaint for declaratory judgment against defendant borough council in the Law Division, Bergen County. She requested the court to construe the application of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:87-15 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:9\u2014133 to her term of office and demanded judgment (a) declaring that defendant has \u201cno statutory or other power or authority to terminate plaintiff\u2019s employment as Paramus Borough Clerk,\u201d (b) restraining defendant \u201cfrom altering\u201d her employment as borough clerk and (c) awarding her attorney\u2019s fees and costs of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">Following the hearing on the return date of the order to show cause, the trial judge, in a written opinion, held that plaintiff \u201cholds a three year term of office as the Paramus Borough Clerk terminating on January 1, 1983.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Defendant contends that the trial judge erred in holding that L.1980, c. 147 (the \u201cact\u201d) should be retroactivity applied to plaintiff\u2019s term of office because no expression of legislative intent to make the act retroactive can be found in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In his opinion the judge noted that in 1971, \u201ccontinuing the trend toward uniformity,\u201d the. Legislature adopted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:9-133, which \u201cestablished a three year term for municipal clerks in all municipalities [unless otherwise provided by law].\u201d This meant that the \u201conly exceptions\u201d to the three-year term specified by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A-.9-133 were \u201cclerks serving under forms of government where different terms had been specifically set by prior legislation.\u201d Plaintiff was one of these exceptions, serving as she did from January 1, 1980 as borough clerk \u201cfor 1 year and until . . . [her successor] shall have qualified\u201d pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:87\u201415. He also found that the act adopted on November 22, 1980 removed the \u201cfew exceptions to the new legislative mandate that all municipal clerks serve three years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">In addressing plaintiff\u2019s contention that the act increased her term of office to three years, the judge noted that the Legislature \u201chas the power to extend the terms of [incumbent] municipal officers.\u201d However, he acknowledged that this \u201csubject\u201d was \u201cnot directly addressed\u201d by the Legislature in the act and, therefore, he had to \u201capply the rules of judicial construction to ferret out the legislative purpose.\u201d He concluded that this \u201cprocedure\u201d revealed \u201can intention to extend the term of incumbent clerks [such as plaintiff] for ... three reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">First, he found that the act \u201cis remedial in nature and represents an effort to complete an ongoing task as quickly as possible.\u201d He noted that, under the act, the words \u201cunless otherwise provided by law\u201d were \u201cstricken\u201d from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:9-133, \u201cthe measure applicable to every municipality.\u201d Thereby the term \u201cof every municipal clerk is set at three years.\u201d He also noted that the drafters of the act had \u201cpains<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>takingly collected all five statutes,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which gave municipal clerks different terms from the vast body of municipal law\u201d and had added to each of them \u201cthe phrase \u2018unless a specific term is generally provided by law.\u2019 \u201d He found that this was done \u201cbecause other municipal offices had been included [in the five statutes] and the object [of the act] was to change the term of only municipal clerks.\u201d He, therefore, concluded that \u201c[r]etroactivity must be inferred\u201d because the act \u201cclearly was the remedy for an existing evil, [i. e.,] lack of uniformity in the term of office for all municipal clerks.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Second, the judge noted that \u201ctwo classes of incumbent clerks [were] involved\u201d: those with \u201cterms of more than three years\u201d and those with \u201cterms of less than three years.\u201d He also noted that the \u201cact [in section 6] specifically exempts municipal clerks serving a term of more than three years,\u201d but that the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u201cremains silent as to clerks serving a term of less than three years.\u201d He, therefore, held that the maxim <em>expressio unius est exclusio aiterius </em>applied and that the \u201comission\u201d of a specific exemption for clerks serving terms of less than three years \u201cmust be considered an inclusion\u201d of such clerks within the act\u2019s applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Finally, he noted that the act provided that it shall take effect immediately (i. e., November 22, 1980) and that \u201cthe term of all clerks commenced\u201d on January 1, 1981. He, therefore, concluded that, if the Legislature had intended that the act have no effect on \u201cthe incumbent clerks,\u201d it \u201ccould have made the effective date January 1st.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Defendant\u2019s argument for reversal relies heavily on <em>Bird v. Johnson, </em>59 <em>N.J.L. </em>59 (Sup.Ct.1896), which \u201ccreates a presumption against retroactively extending a present term of office.\u201d There, one Johnson was elected in December 1892 to the office of collector for a one-year term (January 1893 to January 1894). In March 1893 the Legislature enacted a statute *12<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> providing that the term of office for Johnson\u2019s position \u201cshall be three years.\u201d In December 1893 Johnson was again elected to the office of collector. One of the questions before the court was whether the act of March 1893 \u201cwas purely prospective\u201d (in which case Johnson would have been elected in December 1893 to a three-year term\u2014January 1894 to January 1897) or whether the act \u201coperated to enlarge the term of the incumbent [i. e., Johnson] from one year to three\u201d (in which case the December 1893 election would have been invalid because Johnson\u2019s term, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>began on January 1893, would not have expired until January 1896). The court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">.. . the legislative purpose expressed in the act of 1893, did not enlarge or in any wise affect the term of an officer elected previous to its passage. The legislature was dealing with an elective office by simply altering its duration. In the absence of anything to the contrary, the presumption is that it was a rule of conduct for the election of such officers for the term so indicated. In fine, that it was a purely prospective provision regulative of the terms of said office for the future. If, in addition, its object had been to bestow upon an existing placeman a term of office in excess of that to which he had been elected, some indication of such a purpose would appear in its context. The power of the legislature, by bare fiat, to fill a municipal office for a term to which the incumbent was not elected, may be granted without casting a shadow of doubt upon the proposition that such a purpose, to be operative, must be discoverable in the language of the lawmaker. Unless this be so, the legislature, whenever it changes the term of any office, either ousts an incumbent chosen for a longer term or retains one for a term to which he was not elected. I do not find that such a rule has been anywhere applied to officers chosen under a system of popular election. On the contrary, the established doctrine is that an incumbent may be legislated out of a term to which he was elected or into a term to which he was not elected, only when the purpose so to do is found in the language of the statute, [at 60-61]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Defendant contends that the trial judge ignored the \u201cpresumption against retroactively extending a present term of office\u201d created in <em>Bird </em>and then applied \u201cthree selected principles of judicial construction to infer retroactivity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Turning to the first of the trial judge\u2019s three reasons for \u201cinferring retroactivity,\u201d defendant maintains that to \u201csuggest\u201d that retroactivity was \u201cintended\u201d because the act is remedial in nature \u201cmakes no sense\u201d and asserts that there is \u201cno court decision or . . . rule of statutory construction that states [that] retroactivity should be inferred because the legislation is remedial in nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Defendant also contends that the trial judge\u2019s second reason, <em>i. e., </em>applying the maxim <em>expressio unius est exclusio aiterius, </em>is \u201ccontrary to the holding of <em>Bird.\u201d </em>In short, defendant maintains that the act cannot be considered to satisfy \u201cthe requirement of <em>Bird\u201d </em>because \u201cthere is absolutely no discoverable language\u201d in the act \u201cto show\u201d a \u201cpurpose\u201d to extend the term of an incumbent holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The trial judge noted that (1) only \u201ctwo classes of incumbent clerks\u201d were \u201cinvolved\u201d under the act, (2) the act \u201cspecifically\u201d exempted from the effects of the act any municipal clerk \u201cserving\u201d a specified term of more than three years on the effective date of the act and (3) the act was \u201csilent\u201d as to any clerk \u201cserving\u201d a term of less than three years on the act\u2019s effective date. He, therefore, applied the <em>expressio unius </em>maxim and found that the \u201cexpression\u201d in the act of an exemption from the act\u2019s effects for one class of incumbent clerks (those serving specified terms longer than three years) meant the \u201comission\u201d from this exemption of the other class of clerks (those serving terms shorter than three years), which, in turn, \u201cindicated\u201d the \u201cinclusion\u201d of the latter class of clerks within the act\u2019s effects (i. e., their original terms of office were extended to three years effective as of November 22, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">We do not regard chapter 147 as remedial legislation. While the act does bring about uniformity in the terms of municipal clerks, we can find nothing in the record that even suggests that the prior lack of uniformity in terms was a \u201cevil,\u201d to use the word of the trial judge, which required remedy. The characteristics of a remedial statute has been described in <em>Sutherland </em>as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">Every statute that makes any change in the existing body of law, which excludes only occasional enactments which undertake merely to restate or codify prior law, can be said to have as its purpose to \u201cremedy\u201d some flaw in the prior law or some social evil. The mere fact that a statute is characterized as \u201cremedial,\u201d therefore, is of little value in statutory construction unless the term \u201cremedial\u201d has for this purpose a more discriminate meaning. For, if all laws are \u201cremedial\u201d the rule amounts to nothing more than a statement that all legislation is to be liberally construed. The trend today appears to favor a liberal construction of all legislation with the view to effectuating legislative purpose. Traditionally, however, the courts have been more discriminating, and in selecting a liberal or strict construction the emphasis has usually been placed upon the persons, things or interests affected by a statute. [3 <em>Sutherland, </em>Statutory <em>Construction, </em>(4 ed. Sands 1974), \u00a7 60.02 at 31]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">We do not believe chapter 147 should be regarded as remedial so as to require retroactive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>We also do not believe that the trial judge was justified in employing the maxim <em>expressio unius est exciusio alterius </em>to arrive at a retroactive construction of the statute. The mere fact of a reference excluding clerks who were currently serving more than three year terms on its effective date does not, in our judgment, considering the history of the legislation, justify the employment of the maxim. The legislative history discloses that the exception was not in the bill as originally introduced. It came into the law by amendment made by the Senate County and Municipal Government Committee, at the request of the Department of Community Affairs, out of an abundance of caution lest the term of a municipal clerk serving a term of more than three years be shortened. That concern does not, in our opinion, justify employment of the maxim.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Courts employ the legal maxim <em>expressio unius est exciusio alterius </em>with great caution. The maxim, which means that the express mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another, is purely interpretive in aid of determining <em>intention </em>and is not a rule of law. It has been described as serving to describe a result rather than to assist in reaching it. <em>Gangemi v. Berry, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>1, 11 (1957); <em>Reilly v. Ozzard, </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>529, 539 (1960); <em>Esso Standard Oil Co. v. Holderman, </em>75 <em>NJ.Super. </em>455, 470 (App.Div.1962), aff\u2019d o. b. 39 <em>N.J. </em>355 (1963), and <em>Resnick v. East Brunswick Tp. Bd. of Ed., </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>88, 99 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">As a mere aid to construction, and not a rule of law, the maxim must, in our judgment, fall before the presumption that legislation, unless otherwise clearly expressed, acts prospectively. Retrospective operation of legislation is not favored in the law, and the law will not be construed as retroactive unless the act clearly by express language or necessary implication indicates that the Legislature intended retroactive application. In the words of Professor Sutherland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">It is a fundamental principle of jurisprudence that retroactive application of new laws involves a high risk of being unfair. There is general consensus among all people that notice or warning of the rules that are to be applied to determine their affairs should be given in advance of the actions whose effects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>are to <em>be judged </em>by them. The hackneyed <em>maxim </em>that everyone is held to know the law, itself a principle of dubious wisdom, nevertheless presupposes that the law is at least susceptible of being known. But this is not possible as to law which has not yet been made. [2 <em>Sutherland, op. cit., </em>\u00a7 41.02 at 247]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">In <em>Spencer v. Middlesex Tax Bd., </em>95 <em>N.J.L. </em>5 (Sup.Ct.1920), one Spencer was appointed the secretary of the Middlesex County Board of Taxation on May 5, 1919 for a fixed term ending on May 1, 1920. On May 3, 1920 the board appointed another as its secretary for a term of one year, but Spencer refused to giv\u00e9 up his office. He claimed that he had the right to continue to hold the office under L.1920, c. 348, which took effect on April 30, 1920 (the day before his term expired).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">In pertinent part, that act provided that the secretary of any county board of taxation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">... shall hold office during good behavior, efficiency and residence in the county where employed, and no such person shall be removed from any such office for political reasons or for any other cause than incapacity, misconduct, nonresidence or disobedience of just rules or regulations established or which may be established by any such county board of taxation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Spencer argued that the purpose of the Legislature in adopting the act was to retain in office indefinitely secretaries of county boards then holding office, as well as those thereafter to be appointed, notwithstanding that each of the incumbents originally held office for a fixed term which expired the day after the enactment went into effect. His successor argued that the legislative purpose exhibited by the statute was only to provide an indeterminate term for secretaries who should thereafter be appointed and not to extend indefinitely the terms of office of then present incumbents.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">Both parties agreed that the act was \u201csusceptible of being construed either in the one way or the other, without doing violence to the language used.\u201d 95 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 9. The court found this to be \u201ctrue,\u201d but also noted that it was \u201cequally true that to give .. . [the act] the construction urged on behalf of the prosecutor [/. e., Spencer] would make it retroactive in its effect, while that claimed on behalf of the respondent would make it purely prospective.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Therefore, the court determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>that, \u201cin this situation,\u201d the rule of statutory construction laid down in <em>Citizens\u2019 Gas Light Co. v. Alden, </em>44 <em>N.J.L. </em>648 (E. &amp; A. 1882), applied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">.. . [I]t is not enough that words used in an act <em>may </em>be given a retrospect without doing violence to their meaning or that such a course may coincide with their common understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">Laws, generally, are enacted for the regulation of future affairs and conduct, and to establish the basis on which rights may thereafter under them be rested, and are not usually designed to alter or affect the quality or legal relations of past acts and concluded transactions, much less to disturb rights which have arisen under laws running concurrently with their birth. Hence we do not look for or expect in any enactment that it shall be operative as of time prior to its own existence; and before we are permitted to ascribe to it such purpose, there must be found in the law such clear and indubitable expression of the legislative design as precludes any other reasonable interpretation of the words used. The rule in the courts is, that retroactive effect will not be given to a statute when the words in it can be construed as designed to make it prospective only. <em>Williamson v. N. J. S. R. R. Co., </em>2 <em>Stew.Eq. </em>311. All legislation is framed, or presumed so to be, in view of this conspicuous canon of construction governing in courts where the duty of interpretation is reposed. And when the legislature intend to give to law of their enactment operation upon the past, they will and must do it with such choice of words as places it beyond the realm of doubt, [at 653-654]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Accordingly, the <em>Spencer </em>court construed the statute before it prospectively. We believe the principles enunciated in <em>Spencer </em>should be followed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">The trial judge\u2019s third reason (inferring retroactivity from the statement in the act that it is to take effect \u201cimmediately\u201d), seems to be based on an incorrect premise. Contrary to his holding, the commencement date of \u201cthe term of all clerks\u201d was not necessarily \u201cless than six weeks\u201d after the adoption of the act (/. e., on January 1, 1981). Only the terms of <em>all </em>municipal clerks <em>with one-year terms </em>(such as borough clerks) would commence on January 1, 1981. For example, if the clerk of a town governed under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:125-3 was appointed to a fixed two-year term starting on January 1, 1980, his term would not \u201ccommence\u201d on January 1, 1981 since it would not expire until January 1, 1983. Therefore, if the Legislature had made the act effective on January 1, 1981, this would <em>not </em>indicate the Legislature\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d not to \u201caffect\u201d incumbent clerks since in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>such case the act would \"affect\u201d such incumbent, two-year term clerks.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">There is another factor that should be noted, and which we believe was not considered by the Legislature in enacting Chapter 147. Plaintiff here was first appointed borough clerk in January 1977 and has served continuously since then. If chapter 147 is applied to her, and her present term of office (which began on January 1, 1980) is extended to three years, she would achieve tenure under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:9-134, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">Any person holding the office of municipal clerk in any municipality and having held such office continuously for 5 years from the date of his original appointment or election shall have tenure in such office and shall not be removed therefrom except for good cause shown after a fair and impartial hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">While chapter 147 cannot be regarded as a \u201ctenure statute,\" nor an act directly affecting a tenure statute, its effect would be similar. We do not believe that the granting of tenure should be brought about by inadvertence where there is nothing demonstrated in the words of the act to indicate that the Legislature meant to achieve such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">Finally, we have been informed that on January 22, 1981 Assembly Bill 3019 was introduced before the Legislature. It was passed by the Assembly on February 23 and was later amended by the Senate Committee on County and Municipal Government. Under the bill \u00a7 9 of chapter 147 is amended to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">This Act shall take effect immediately <em>but shall not extend the terms of persons holding office as municipal clerk on the effective date of P.L.1980, c. 147. </em>[Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">As of the date of the writing of this opinion, Assembly Bill 3019 is before the Senate on second reading. We have not taken the existence of this Assembly Bill into consideration in reaching our result. In any event, while it has been said that an \u201camendment to an act may be resorted to for discovery of legislative intent in the enactment amended,\u201d it has also been said that \u201cprospective legislative action ..., while instructive, cannot impart substance to the current law.\u201d <em>Matawan v.

The sponsor\u2019s statement to the bill reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">This bill would provide for a uniform 3-year term of office for all municipal clerks. The bill amends various sections of the law concerning the government of towns, boroughs and villages to remove therefrom specified terms of office for clerks, and brings those statutes in accord with N.J.S. 40A:9-133. The section repealed [by section 8 of the act], R.S. 40:125-10, provides for a different term of office for clerks in towns of over 25,000 persons, than for clerks in towns of less than 25,000 persons. The purpose of this bill being uniformity, R.S. 40:125-10 requires repeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">After referral to the Senate County and Municipal Government Committee, the bill was reported out with amendments, and a second paragraph was added to the sponsor\u2019s statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-11\">The Senate committee amendments, proposed by the Department of Community Affairs, would provide that the bill shall not affect the term of any municipal clerk currently serving a term of more than 3 years, during such term. It appears that in some towns of under 25,000 the council has, by ordinance, established a longer term than 3 years (see R.S. 40:125-3 and 40:132-3, sections 2 and 3 of the bill, for authorization to do so).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The act referred to in <em>Bird </em>is <em>L. </em>1893, c. 94, adopted on March 10, 1893:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">1.
