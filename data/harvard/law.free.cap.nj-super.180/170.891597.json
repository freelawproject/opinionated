A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">Defendant appeals from a judgment of $28,205.09 plus prejudgment interest based on a finding that it was negligent in paying a cashier\u2019s check issued from the proceeds of a Small Business Administration (SBA) guaranteed loan without the endorsement of plaintiff-payee. Defendant alleges that the judge erred in finding that plaintiff had standing to bring this action as a third-party beneficiary of the loan agreement between defendant and Restaurant Argentino Tango, Inc. (Tango) of which plaintiff was a creditor. Defendant contends that it was not negligent in paying the check because the check had not been delivered to plaintiff and therefore Tango, as owner of the check, retained the right to cancel and did cancel the check when it deposited the unendorsed document in its account.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>In November 1972 plaintiff, a general contracting firm, was asked by Tice, Tango\u2019s owner, to renovate the restaurant. Plaintiff prepared a contract which quoted a price of $27,415 and required that the work be paid for by 50 interest-bearing promissory notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">After plaintiff completed the work plaintiff\u2019s principal, Hernandez, agreed to allow Tice to pay with money he would receive from an SBA guaranteed loan for which he was applying. As a result plaintiff did not draw any promissory notes. However, plaintiff did prepare a statement as evidence of Tango\u2019s indebtedness to it which was submitted to defendant bank in conjunction with Tice\u2019s application for the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">On July 13, 1973 defendant closed the loan with Tango and issued the proceeds thereof in several cashier\u2019s checks payable to Tango\u2019s creditors, including plaintiff. Defendant gave plaintiff\u2019s check to Tice to deliver. Plaintiff asked Tice for the check several times thereafter and also inquired of defendant as to when the check would be issued. Plaintiff never received the check. The check was subsequently deposited in Tango\u2019s account at defendant bank, which honored the check even though it had not been endorsed. About <em>V/2 </em>years after the check was honored, Tango declared bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Defendant bank was properly held liable to plaintiff. When the cashier\u2019s check was honored by the bank without plaintiff\u2019s endorsement there was a common law conversion of the proceeds. \u201cReceiving the funds without a proper endorsement and crediting the funds to one not entitled thereto constitutes a conversion of the funds.\u201d <em>Salsman v. National Community Bank of Rutherford, </em>102 <em>N.J.Super. </em>482, 492 (Law Div. 1968), aff\u2019d 105 <em>N.J.Super. </em>164 (App.Div.1969). A proper negotiation of the instrument required the payee\u2019s endorsement. \u201cNegotiation takes effect only when the indorsement is made. . . . \u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-201(3). \u201cIf the instrument is payable to order it is negotiated by delivery with any necessary indorsement.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-202(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Under the Uniform Commercial Code an instrument is converted when it is paid on a forged endorsement. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-419(l)(c). <em>Gast v. American Gas Co. of Reading, </em>99 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538 (App.Div.1968); <em>see Salsman, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 492 We perceive no legal difference between payment of an instrument on a forged endorsement and payment on no endorsement by the payee at all. Although the Code does not specify that payment without endorsement constitutes a conversion, we are free to so find under the general principles of the common law. Unless displaced by the Code, \u201cthe principles of law and equity, including the law merchant.\u201d supplement its provisions. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:1\u2014103. For other authorities holding that payment on a missing endorsement is equivalent to payment upon a forged endorsement and therefore a common law conversion, <em>see Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Marine Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>431 F.2d 341 (5 Cir. 1970); <em>Berkheimer\u2019s Inc. v. Citizens Valley Bank, </em>270 <em>Or. </em>807, 529 P.2d 903 (1974); <em>Peoples Nat\u2019l Bank v. American Fidelity Fire Ins., </em>39 <em>Md.App. </em>614, 386 A.2d 1254 (Ct.Sup.App.1978); <em>see, also, Gillespie v. Riley Management Corp., </em>59 <em>Ill.2d </em>211, 319 <em>N.E.2d </em>753 (Sup.Ct.1974). Nor was Tango\u2019s improper negotiation of the check a surrender of the instrument for cancellation. <em>Cf. N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-605(l)(b); <em>In re Kirschenbaum, </em>44 <em>N.J.Super., </em>391, 398 (App.Div.), certif. den. 25 <em>N.J. </em>51 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Further, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that the cashier\u2019s check was not delivered to plaintiff. There is no doubt that defendant bank had the intention of transferring title to the check and creating an enforceable obligation when it surrendered control of the instrument by giving it to Tice for delivery to the plaintiff. \u201cThe matter of intention is vital to delivery.\u201d <em>Manna v. Perozzi, </em>44 <em>N.J.Super. </em>227, 235 (App.Div.1957). Supporting this conclusion that Tice was acting as agent of the payee plaintiff and not of defendant bank when he accepted the check are the facts that (1) plaintiff agreed to forbear and wait for the proceeds of the SBA loan in lieu of the notes called for under the contract between plaintiff and Tango; (2) plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>assisted Tango in its loan application by submitting a statement of indebtedness to defendant bank, and (3) plaintiff looked to Tice for delivery of its portion of the loan proceeds. Once the check had been constructively delivered to plaintiff its ownership rights vested and it had standing to sue as payee. <em>Salsman v. National Community Bank, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 495; <em>see </em>5B <em>Michie, Banks and Banking, </em>\u00a7 251 at 506 (1973); <em>Anderson\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code </em>(2 ed. 1971), \u00a7 3-102:4 at 586-587.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Defendant also contends that the judge erred in determining that plaintiff was entitled to $28,205.09 because there was no evidence of a debt in that sum and because plaintiff had received partial payment from Tango. The record adequately supports the finding of the trial judge that the face amount of the check represented Tango\u2019s actual indebtedness to plaintiff. We will not disturb a finding adequately supported by credible evidence in the record. <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 483-84 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
