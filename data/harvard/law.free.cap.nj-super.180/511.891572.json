A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The single issue raised by this appeal is whether the municipal defendant-appellant should pay interest to the plaintiff-respondent on an arbitrator\u2019s award where plaintiff, dissatisfied with that award, demanded that it be paid and at the same time sought an order to show cause vacating the award. The court below ruled that defendant must pay 8% straight interest on the award. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The essential facts are not in dispute. Plaintiff is the labor organization authorized to represent all sergeants, lieutenants and captains employed in the police department of the City of Elizabeth. It entered into negotiations with defendant for a new contract to replace an agreement which would expire on May 31, 1979. The parties could not agree and plaintiff sought compulsory interest arbitration pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A~16.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hearings were held and the arbitrator on September 19, 1979 rendered his decision. Bound by statute <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A \u2022 16(d)(2)) to choose between the final economic proposals of the parties as a package and, as to non-economic issues, between the final proposals of the parties on each issue, the arbitrator chose the city\u2019s economic package and did not choose any of plaintiff\u2019s non-economic proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">On October 12, 1979, 13 days after the date of the award, counsel for defendant wrote to plaintiff\u2019s attorney inquiring whether plaintiff intended to accept the arbitrator\u2019s decision and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">If there is to be no appeal, we would like to be formally so advised so that we may implement Arbitrator Collins\u2019 Award and execute a new Collective Bargaining Agreement reflecting that Award ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>On October 17, 1979 plaintiff\u2019s counsel advised that plaintiff would seek \u201ccourt relief to set aside the award.\u201d He noted that under the statute plaintiff had 90 days from the date of the award to take such action and that he would \u201cdo so at my earliest convenience.\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In this letter plaintiff\u2019s attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">In the meantime, it seems to me that the award must be implemented by the City regardless of the action we take. Firstly, let me point out to you that whatever increase the patrolmen received in January of 1979 comes under our old contract and therefore we are entitled to that money retroactively. I also suggest that you implement the July increase as well as the bonus since any determination certainly is not going to be less than the payments you are making and they can always be credited in the event we are successful in having the award set aside and in a subsequent arbitration getting the type of award that we have sought previously.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Defendant\u2019s attorney replied on October 26, 1979 stating</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">... it is clearly premature as well as inappropriate for the City at this time to implement this binding Arbitration Award until your appeal has been heard as well as our motion which is now required to confirm the Award ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Plaintiff did not bring its action to vacate the award until December 3, 1979, 75 days after the date of award. Defendant was not served with the complaint until December 21, 1979.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The matter was heard on January 25, 1980. The trial court refused to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award but ordered defendant to pay interest on the award at 8% from the date of its entry. On January 29, 1980 defendant moved that the trial court reconsider the award of interest or, alternatively, that the court modify the period during which interest was to accrue for a period of at least 60 days to allow the city to \u201cenact the necessary ordinances to lawfully pay increased salaries to [the employees] and to make the necessary adjustments in the City\u2019s business and payroll records.\u201d In a written opinion the court below denied defendant the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The trial court correctly noted that interest is not generally payable as damages for the improper withholding of funds by a governmental entity unless a statute so provides. <em>Consolidated Police, &amp;c., Pension Fund Comm\u2019n Passaic, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>645, 654 (1957); <em>Warren Realty Co. v. East Windsor Tp., </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>322, 326 (App.Div.1980); <em>In re Elizabeth Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>137, 139 (App.Div.1979); <em>Corallo v. Essex Cty. Welfare Bd., </em>140 <em>N.J.Super. </em>414, 417 (App.Div.1976); <em>Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp. v. Paramus, </em>93 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 30 (App.Div.1966). The court below observed that this general rule has exceptions, concluded that principles of equity \u201cultimately control the allow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>anee or denial of interest against governmental entities,\u201d and that a trial court is \u201cinvested with broad discretion in the matter of interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Ultimately the trial judge awarded interest because <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-14 as a statement of public policy requires that the provisions of the act \u201cproviding for compulsory arbitration, shall be liberally construed\u201d; because <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-19 provides that increases in rates of compensation awarded by the arbitrator \u201cshall take effect on the date of implementation prescribed in the award,\u201d and because <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-20 provides that the review of the award in the Superior Court \u201cshall not of itself stay the order of the arbitrator.\" The judge felt, thus, that although interest ordinarily should not be awarded against a municipality in the absence of a statute providing for interest, \u201coverriding equitable considerations\u201d and the \u201cmandate\u201d of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-19 and 20 here compelled an award of interest to plaintiff. This is clear in the following passage from the opinion below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">In any event, there are overriding equitable considerations present here. As provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-19, the award in this case took effect on September 19, 1979. The defendant did not implement the award immediately and it had not been implemented as of the date of the confirmation hearing. <em>In effect what occurred was a self-imposed stay on the part of the defendant I find this contrary to the mandatory language contained in both N.J.S.A. 34:13A-19 and N.J.S.A. 34:13A-20 and contrary to the plainest and simplest considerations of justice and fair dealing. </em>The defendant should have either implemented the award, or if the defendant felt it was justifiable, moved to stay the implementation of the award. Of course, the court recognizes that consideration must be given to the reasonable delays in implementation caused by \u2018provisional rules of procedure and the mechanics of governmental procedure.\u2019 <em>713 Co. v. Jersey City, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>210, 219 (Law Div. 1967). However, the defendant here did not take any steps necessary to implement the award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">Although defendant does not explicitly say so, in not implementing the award it followed what has apparently developed into a general practice of not implementing compulsory interest arbitration awards until all litigation has been resolved <em>despite the fact that this practice is contrary to governing statutes. </em>Even taking this into consideration, the city wrongfully withheld the money due under the award and benefited by retaining it. The individuals represented by plaintiff are entitled to compensation for the loss incurred by this wrongful retention.... (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>We agree with the court below that the basis for an award of interest against a municipality may be found in a given statute, either as an absolute right or as a matter of sound discretion. <em>Consolidated Police, &amp;c., Pension Fund Comm\u2019n v. Passaic, supra, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>at 654. Likewise we concur that the right to such interest may, in a proper case, be awarded in the absence of such a statute because of overriding and compelling equitable reasons. <em>Consolidated Police, supra; In re Elizabeth Educ. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 140. In such circumstances a trial court has broad discretion. <em>Corallo v. Essex Cty. Welfare Bd., supra. </em>In cases where there is an exercise of such discretion a reviewing court ordinarily defers to that action unless it represents a manifest denial of justice. <em>Rova Farms Resort </em>v. <em>Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484 (1974). Here, as we will shortly demonstrate, we feel that the court below, however conscientiously, misconceived the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-19 and 20 as mandating payment of the arbitrator\u2019s award despite plaintiff\u2019s attempt to vacate it, and swayed by this premise, concluded that monies were wrongfully withheld from plaintiff contrary to plain and simple \u201cconsiderations of justice and fair dealing.\u201d We are obliged to reverse. The controlling principle was stated by Judge Foley, speaking for the court, in <em>Kavanaugh v. Quigley, </em>63 <em>N.J.Super. </em>153, 158 (App.Div.1960), and reiterated in <em>State v. Steele, </em>92 <em>N.J.Super. </em>498, 507 (App.Div. 1966). In <em>Kavanaugh </em>the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">It is well settled that discretion means <em>legal </em>discretion, in the exercise of which the trial judge must take account of the law applicable to the particular circumstances of the case and be governed accordingly. Implicit is conscientious judgment directed by law and reason and looking to a just result. <em>Sokol v. </em>Liebstein, 9 <em>N.J. </em>93, 99 (1952), <em>Rossetti v. Public Service Coord. </em>Transport, 53 <em>N.J.Super. </em>293, 298 (App.Div.1958). Consequently, if the trial judge misconceives the applicable law, or misapplies it to the factual complex, in total effect the exercise of the legal discretion lacks a foundation and becomes an arbitrary act, however conscientious may have been the judge in the performance of it. When this occurs it is the duty of the reviewing court to adjudicate the controversy in the light of the applicable law in order that a manifest denial of justice be avoided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>We fail to see in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-19 and 20 and in the dictate of liberal construction contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A\u201414 the implicit power read into them by the court below to \u201cmandate\u201d this award of interest. Section 19 merely, states that, \u201c[i]ncreases in rates of compensation awarded by an arbitrator shall take effect on the date of implementation prescribed in the award.\u201d The same section provides that the award \u201cmay be enforced at the instance of either party in the Superior Court . . . . \u201d Clearly, if both parties agree with the award there is no need to enforce it and the award is payable from the date of its entry. Where, as here, the representative of the municipal employees seeks not to enforce the award but to vacate it, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16f(5) is utilized. This segment of the statute provides that a proceeding to \u201cvacate, modify or correct such award\u201d shall on \u201cextrinsic evidence\u201d be brought \u201cpursuant to <em>N.J.S. </em>2A:24-7 <em>et seq.\u201d </em>This latter general arbitration statute grants to a party \u201cwithin 3 months after the award is delivered to him\u201d the right by summary action to seek confirmation <em>(i. </em>e., enforcement) or vacation, modification or correction of the award. Since utilization of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:24\u20147 <em>et seq. </em>for any of these purposes may not take place for three months, the clear import of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-19 is to insure that when the award'is eventually confirmed or enforced it shall be regarded as effective not on the date of confirmation but as of its date of entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">We see in this language no license to a party who disputes the award to thereby assert a claim to benefit from the award, on pain of interest being imposed, while he seeks its vacation. Interest of the type here sought is for \u201cdamages for the <em>illegal </em>detention of a legitimate claim or indebtedness.\u201d <em>Dial Press, Inc. v. Phillips, </em>23 <em>N.J.Super. </em>543, 551 (App.Div.1952). (Emphasis ours.) There is no equitable reason to aid one who seeks to set aside the benefit he seeks to retain. <em>Cf. Dial Press, Inc., supra, </em>at 552. The mere fact that he wishes both the bird in hand and the two that may be in the bush does not seem reason enough, and the statute does not grant the right sought. Plaintiff\u2019s attempt to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award must be realisti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>cally viewed, plaintiff\u2019s desire to retain its benefits notwithstanding, as a legal rejection of the award. In this context while defendant may in the interim retain and use the monies awarded, such retention cannot and should not be viewed as a benefit achieved through wrongful retention of the award. <em>See Mayor, etc., of Jersey City </em>v. <em>O\u2019Callaghan, </em>41 <em>N.J.L. </em>349, 351 (E. &amp; A. 1879); <em>713 Co. v. Jersey City, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>210, 218-219 (Law Div. 1967). Plaintiff\u2019s members, denied the use of the money, may indeed suffer damage but such loss is not caused by defendant who was willing to implement the award as rendered. The imposition of interest in such circumstances is the imposition, without statutory warrant, of a penalty against the municipal defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Plaintiff contends here that since the arbitrator was bound to accept its economic package or defendant\u2019s, defendant by implementing its own chosen award would lose nothing because if plaintiff were successful in vacating the disputed award \u201cany \u2018new\u2019 award would only result in the same or greater benefits.\u201d If this reasoning were valid a municipality might just as well be directed to pay interest on its final economic package offer when it submits the matter to an arbitrator who, in the circumstances here presented, was bound by statute to at least select its lesser offer where the arbitrator rejects as unreasonable the greater one proposed by the employees\u2019 bargaining representative. Either of these approaches makes for a lack of stability in the financial mechanics and procedure of municipal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Our approach to this matter does not, as the court below suggested, penalize plaintiff for exercising its right to seek vacation of the award. Plaintiff has that right but, like any other litigant in judicial disputes, it should not, in equity, have the benefit of the judgment it views as unjust and seeks to nullify.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-20, which provides that the pendency of a proceeding for the review of the award \u201cshall not of itself stay the order of the arbitrator,\u201d does not require of defendant that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>it move for a stay where plaintiff earlier indicated it would seek to vacate the award and in fact did do so. Clearly, a stay would be necessary in a situation where the defendant as the party responsible for implementation of the award sought to vacate it. Where, however, plaintiff in legal effect rejects the award and defendant stands willing to pay, there is no more need for defendant to seek a stay than there is for any civil defendant to do so, or to seek a supercedeas bond where such defendant is not an appellant under <em>R. </em>2:9-5 and <em>R. </em>2:9-6. The fact that defendant sought by counterclaim to have the award confirmed is of no moment. That action was made necessary by plaintiff\u2019s complaint seeking to vacate the award. <em>R. </em>2:9-5, like <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-20, speaks in general terms but the clear implication of both and the general accepted practice under <em>R. </em>2:9\u20145(b) is that a defendant responsible for payment of a money judgment which is rejected by an appealing plaintiff is not required to seek a stay of the judgment plaintiff rejects. Absent a clear expression of intent in this statute to change what is the accepted practice we see no ground to infer that a legislature, knowledgeable of such practice, intended a different course of procedure here.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The adjuration of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-14 that the provisions of the act be liberally construed does not call for the result achieved below. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">It is the public policy of this State that in public fire and police departments, where public employees do not enjoy the right to strike, it is requisite to the high morale of such employees and the efficient operation of such departments to afford an alternate, expeditious, effective and binding procedure for the resolution of disputes, and to that end the provisions of this act, providing for compulsory arbitration, shall be liberally construed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">This statute clearly seeks liberal interpretation of \u201cthe provisions of this act, providing for compulsory arbitration\u201d not for the purpose of boosting the morale of the fire and police departments generally, but to more realistically do so by expediting effective and binding procedure for the resolution of disputes. No such procedure is effective or binding, nor is the statutory public policy properly served if, having sought binding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>arbitration, the employees, have the right to accept the benefit of the award (or interest on it) while they continue to try to have their final economic package and non-economic demands accepted in a court test and perhaps yet another arbitration procedure. Such a result is hardly an aid to effective and binding arbitration nor does it consider, respect or protect the rights of the citizens and taxpayers of a municipality. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-2. To the contrary, it will insure that any final economic package offered by the employer and deemed reasonable by the arbitrator will always be challenged by court action. Under the result achieved below, despite the municipality\u2019s willingness to implement the award, the employees\u2019 representative can with impunity safely ponder for a full 90 days whether to seek vacation of the award. The mandate to pay interest during this period would make this a relatively painless period and the only way a municipal employer could avoid such liability is to move immediately after the award to have it stayed or confirmed. We see in this statute no legislative expression of intent that taxpayers\u2019 funds shall in every case be used for such purpose. We need not consider, because it is not before us, the converse proposition as to whether equitable principles might dictate imposition of interest on an award favorable to the employees where the municipality seeks to vacate, modify or correct such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">We are constrained to further observe that even if we were inclined to consider granting interest in this case, the facts do not demonstrate that the greater equity rests with plaintiff. Defendant was instantly willing to implement the award of September 29,1979. Plaintiff instructed its counsel either on or before October 17, 1979 (27 days after the award) to seek vacation of the award. Defendant counsel acknowledged that instruction in his letter of that date but, noting plaintiff had 90 days to do so, asserted he would take action at his \u201cearliest convenience.\u201d This suit was filed December 3, 1979, 75 days after the award was rendered and 48 days after counsel\u2019s letter, and defendant was served December 21,1979. We would not, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>any event, be moved in these circumstances to consider plaintiff entitled to interest for the full period from September 19, 1979 to the date the award was confirmed. Also to be considered in determining equitable rights are the mechanical problems attendant to municipal implementation of salary increases. <em>See 713 Co. v. Jersey City, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 219. Allowances should, in a proper case, be made for such a necessary period.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The judgment entered below awarding interest on the arbitrator\u2019s award is reversed and vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-10\">\u201cInterest\u201d arbitration \u201cinvolves the submission of a dispute concerning the terms of a new contract to an arbitrator, who selects those terms and thus in effect writes the parties\u2019 collective agreement ....
