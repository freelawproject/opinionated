J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b79-16\">Ford Motor Company (Ford) appeals from the final judgment in this action in which plaintiff, the purchaser of a new 1978 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Mercury Marquis Brougham, sued Ford\u2019s authorized dealer, Marino Auto Sales, Inc. (Marino Auto) and Ford, as manufacturer, for damages due to defects in the vehicle. Marino Auto cross-claimed against Ford for indemnification. The final judgment (a) granted plaintiff rescission of the purchase and damages of $6,745.59 against Marino Auto Sales (representing the purchase price of $7,847.49 less an allowance for plaintiff\u2019s use of the car and the sales tax), (b) awarded damages in favor of Marino Auto against Ford on the cross-claim in the sum of $2,910.59 (representing $6,745.59 less the resale value of the car), and (c) awarded counsel fees to plaintiff against Ford in the sum of $5,165. Plaintiff\u2019s demands for interest, punitive damages in excess of $2,000,000 and treble damages were denied. The trial court\u2019s published opinion was limited to the issue of counsel fees awarded under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2301 <em>et seq. </em>173 <em>NJ.Super. </em>501 (Ch.Div.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Plaintiff took delivery of the automobile on April 12, 1978. According to the testimony of plaintiff and his wife, they experienced engine hesitation and stalling problems early in their use of the car which continued without interruption despite repeated attempts by Marino Auto to cure the problem. Stanley Bednarz, Ford\u2019s zone service manager and mechanical specialist who assists dealers in satisfying customers, inspected the vehicle on July 13, 1978 and recommended replacing the exhaust regulator valve. Plaintiff testified that he was told by Bednarz that there was nothing wrong with the car and he would \u201chave to live with this one.\u201d Plaintiff also testified that later in July 1978 he returned to Marino Auto intending to ask Mr. Marino to take the car back if it could not be fixed but that he was prevented from doing so and was forcibly removed from the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Before considering the points raised on this appeal we note the unusual procedural aspects of the trial in this case. In a nonjury case such as this, with Marino Auto cross-claiming against Ford for indemnification, the adjudication of any party\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>rights normally would be withheld until all the evidence has been introduced by all parties. The evidence in support or in defense of a cross-claim may tend to buttress or refute plaintiff\u2019s claims. Particularly in products liability cases, where the dealer has an action over against the manufacturer, \u201cit would seem to make sense procedurally to have the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action whenever possible adjudicated in one action against manufacturer and retailer.\u201d <em>Newmark v. Gimbel\u2019s Inc., </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>585, 600-601 (1969). In nonjury cases a single, uninterrupted trial should be the norm.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Nevertheless, on the trial date in this case, Marino Auto\u2019s attorney was unavailable. The trial judge in his discretion severed plaintiff\u2019s case against Marino Auto and ordered the case to proceed against Ford only, as authorized by 12.4:38-2. Ford\u2019s counsel did not object to this procedure. Ford\u2019s witnesses were present at the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case but, after the trial judge denied Ford\u2019s motion for judgment dismissing the claim against Ford, Ford elected to rest its case and renew its motion without introducing any evidence. In these circumstances we will not reverse the trial judge for ordering separate trials of plaintiff\u2019s claims against Ford and Marino Auto, and we reject Ford\u2019s contention that, \u201cin retrospect,\u201d the severance order constituted prejudicial error. 12.1:7\u20142. Ford cannot now renounce the trial tactics which it intentionally employed. On the trial of Marino Auto\u2019s cross-claim against Ford, Ford introduced evidence on which it now relies to refute plaintiff\u2019s claim. That evidence, which is before us, is not conclusive and was available to Ford on the first day of trial. It should have been offered then in an effort to overcome plaintiff\u2019s proofs that the vehicle suffered from a substantial manufacturing defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">We reject the contention that, lacking expert proof, plaintiff failed to establish that a defective mechanism for which Ford was responsible caused the engine to hesitate and stall. This conclusion could be reached by inferences from the evidence. <em>See Moraca v. Ford Motor Co., </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>454, 458-459 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>(1975); <em>Scanlon v. General Motors Corp., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>582, 592-593 (1974); <em>Durfee v. Rod Baxter Imports, Inc., </em>262 N.W.2d 349 (Minn.Sup.Ct.1977); <em>Arnold v. Ford Motor Co., </em>90 <em>N.M. </em>549, 551, 566 P.2d 98, 100 (Sup.Ct.1977); <em>Vernon v. Lake Motors, </em>26 <em>Utah </em>2d 269, 274, 488 P.2d 302, 306 (Sup.Ct.1971). The findings that Ford breached its express warranty and that the car was substantially impaired were supported by sufficient credible evidence and must be affirmed on appeal. <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of America, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 483-484 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case against Ford the trial judge announced his findings and conclusions that Ford had breached its warranty, that the car was substantially impaired because of persistent and continual stalling and hesitation, but that plaintiff had not proven damages against Ford. He held that the only remedy to which plaintiff was entitled was rescission or revocation of acceptance against Marino Auto, see <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-608; <em>Herbstman v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>1, 9-10 (1975), except that plaintiff would also have a claim for attorney\u2019s fees against Ford under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, <em>supra, </em>15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2310(d)(2). Various reasons were given for affording plaintiff the right to rescind the purchase and receive a refund of the purchase price from Marino Auto. At one point in his oral decision the trial judge alternatively relied upon the theory of strict liability in tort and breach of an implied warranty of merchantability and fitness. In his written opinion he stated that this result \u201cpierced through the dealership system, granting rescission against the selling dealer Marino, based upon defects in breach of the manufacturer Ford\u2019s express warranty.\u201d 173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 504. He also said: \u201cThe only remedy under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act for Ford\u2019s violation of the act was rescission against the selling dealer Marino\u201d; and he viewed Marino Auto as Ford\u2019s \u201cauthorized agent to remedy defects. . . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>Punitive damages against Ford were denied because of the absence of \u201cdeliberate, willful, malicious fraud or wanton and gross negligence or unconscionable commercial practice. .. . \u201d Thus, the case was continued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>permit plaintiff to claim a refund of the purchase price, less an allowance for the use of the car, on a rescission basis against Marino Auto, and to permit Marino Auto to claim indemnification against Ford. Ford was to be afforded the opportunity to defend by establishing Marino Auto\u2019s fault in failing properly to repair the auto.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">On the next trial date Marino Auto stipulated the sale of the car to plaintiff and seemingly conceded at one point that plaintiff would be entitled to a judgment against Marino Auto based on the finding of Ford\u2019s breach of warranty on the proofs offered by plaintiff against Ford. The issues to be tried on the cross-claim were held to include damages to Marino Auto on rescission or revocation of acceptance, namely, the purchase price less the value of the car to be returned to the dealer, minus an allowance for the limited use of the car. (There was evidence that plaintiff was financially compelled to continue to use the vehicle in its imperfect state. Upon the seller\u2019s breach the buyer has the right to \u201ccover\u201d by acquiring substituted goods but is not barred from any other remedy if he fails to effect \u201ccover.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-711 and 712. See also, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-711(3), which gives the buyer a security interest in and the right to retain or resell goods after revocation of acceptance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) The case proceeded on the cross-claim although Ford contended that no claim over could arise until plaintiff recovered a judgment against Marino Auto. On the assumption that proof of Ford\u2019s breach of an express warranty established plaintiff\u2019s right to recover against Marino Auto, 173 <em>NJ.Super. </em>at 503-504. the trial judge ordered the trial to proceed on Marino Auto\u2019s indemnification claim. Proof of plaintiff\u2019s damage claim was also anticipated before a final judgment was to be entered on the complaint and cross-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Proofs were presented by Ford to show that the car was not defective and that there could be other causes for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>engine hesitation or stalling, such as contaminated fuel. Although Ford contends that Marino Auto was negligent in not checking the fuel system, there was no proof that contaminated fuel was the actual cause of the problem. Thus, there was no proof that the defect in the vehicle would have been discovered but for Marino Auto\u2019s lack of reasonable care in attempting to repair the car. Marino Auto cannot be denied indemnification because it failed to successfully diagnose the cause of the problem. Ford\u2019s expert could find nothing wrong with the car and, on the facts of this case, the trial judge could properly have rejected Ford\u2019s contention that Marino Auto was at fault for not correcting it, regardless of where the burden of proving Marino Auto\u2019s negligence was placed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">At the conclusion of this testimony Marino Auto contended that there was no proof of any wrongdoing by Marino Auto and no basis for rescission. However, Marino Auto also claimed indemnification from Ford for any damage award granted to plaintiff against Marino Auto. Ford contended that no judgment should be entered against Marino Auto, that there was no basis for rescission and therefore no need for indemnification. Ford also protested the lack of sufficient notice of plaintiff\u2019s complaints about the car\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">We have considered the merits of this appeal on the assumption that, although Marino Auto has not appealed the judgment against it, Ford can contend that no judgment should, have been entered against Marino Auto. Ford has an interest in the judgment against Marino Auto since it was the basis for Ford\u2019s indemnification obligation. In fact, the trial judge did consider Ford\u2019s arguments against Marino Auto\u2019s liability to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Our reasoning through the body of law applicable to this commonplace contractual skein, which binds consumers, car dealers and manufacturers together, differs from that of the trial judge. But we affirm plaintiff\u2019s recovery. We conclude that, despite Marino Auto\u2019s attempted disclaimer of all warranties, plaintiff can recover from Marino Auto for the breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>implied warranty of merchantability. We also uphold the award of counsel fees against Ford pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The contract of sale between Marino Auto and plaintiff conspicuously <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> contained the following legend on its face:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">The seller, MARINO AUTO SALES, Inc., hereby expressly disclaims all warranties, either expressed or implied, including any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, and MARINO AUTO SALES, Inc., neither assumes nor authorizes another person to assume for it any liability in connection with the sale of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">On the back of this sales order-contract were the following terms which were made part of the contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">7. It is expressly agreed that there are no warranties, express or implied, made by either the selling dealer or the manufacturer on the motor vehicle, chassis or parts furnished hereunder except, in the case of a new motor vehicle the warranty expressly given to the purchaser upon the delivery of such motor vehicle or chassis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">The selling dealer also agrees to promptly perform and fulfill all terms and conditions of the owner service policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">For the purpose of this opinion we will assume that the disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability and fitness was effective under the Uniform Commercial Code, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-316. Since the dealer passed on to the purchaser a warranty from the manufacturer, we will not consider whether the attempted disclaimer by Marino Auto should be voided as unconscionable and contrary to public policy under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-302, even though such disclaimer could foreclose rescission or other remedies against the dealer and, without privity between buyer and manufacturer, rescission has been held ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>narily unavailable under the Code against the manufacturer. <em>Edelstein v. Toyota Motors Distributors, </em>176 <em>NJ.Super. </em>57, 64 (App.Div.1980); <em>see Henningsen </em>v. <em>Bloomfield Motors, Inc., </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>358, 372-373, 406-408 (1960); <em>Gladden v. Cadillac Motor Car Div., </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>320, 330-331 (1980); <em>Herbstman </em>v. <em>Eastman Kodak Co., supra, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>at 9-10; <em>cf. Santor v. A &amp; M Karagheusian, Inc., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>52 (1965). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-316(1) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">... words or conduct tending to negate or limit warranty shall be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other; but subject to the provisions of this Chapter on parol or extrinsic evidence (12A:2-202) negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that such construction is unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">It may be argued that the dealer\u2019s conduct in transmitting Ford\u2019s warranty to plaintiff, the reference to such warranty in paragraph 7 on the back of the purchaser order-contract, and the undertaking \u201cto promptly perform and fulfill all terms and conditions of the owner service policy,\u201d are inconsistent with a disclaimer of all warranties and that such a disclaimer is an unreasonable construction. <em>See Gladden v. Cadillac Motor Car Div., supra, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>at 330; <em>Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., supra, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>at 407\u2014408; <em>cf. Murray v. Holiday Rambler, Inc., </em>83 Wis.2d 406, 416, 265 N.W.2d 513, 519 (Sup.Ct.1978). The contract in the <em>Henningsen </em>case contained the identical obligation to perform all terms and conditions of the owner service policy. <em>Id. </em>The combination of the dealer\u2019s undertaking and the automobile manufacturer\u2019s warranty was interpreted in <em>Henningsen </em>to rebut the disclaimer of implied warranty of merchantability by the dealer. The court held that the attempt to limit liability to the replacement of defective parts was contrary to public policy and void with respect to a claim for personal injuries resulting from an accident caused by defects in an automobile. However, we need not explore these issues further because the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act has solved many of the problems posed by the intricacies confronting consumers under the preexisting law of sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, <em>supra, </em>was adopted on January 4, 1975, 88 <em>Stat. </em>2183. Its purpose was to make \u201cwarranties on consumer products more readily understandable and enforceable.\u201d Note, 7 <em>Rutgers-Camden L. J. </em>379 (1976). The act enhances the consumer\u2019s position by allowing recovery under a warranty without regard to privity of contract between the consumer and warrantor, by prohibiting the disclaimer of implied warranties in a written warranty, and by enlarging the remedies available to a consumer for breach of warranty, including the award of attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Id. </em>The requirement of privity of contract between the consumer and the warrantor has been removed by assuring consumers a remedy against all warrantors of the product.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A consumer is defined in 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2301(3) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">(3) The term \u2018consumer\u2019 means a buyer (other than for purposes of resale) of any consumer product, any person to whom such product is transferred during the duration of an implied or written warranty (or service contract) applicable to the product, and any other person who is entitled by the terms of such warranty (or service contract) or under applicable State law to enforce against the warrantor (or service contractor) the obligations of the warranty (or service contract).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">A \u201csupplier\u201d is defined as any person engaged in the business of making a consumer product directly or indirectly available to consumers, \u00a7 2301(4), and a \u201cwarrantor\u201d includes any supplier or other person who gives or offers to give a written warranty or who is obligated under an implied warranty. \u00a7 2301(5). The term \u201cwritten warranty\u201d is defined in \u00a7 2301(6) to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">(A) any written affirmation of fact or written promise made in connection with the sale of a consumer product by a supplier to a buyer which relates to the nature of the material or workmanship and affirms or promises that such material or workmanship is defect free or will meet a specified level of performance over a specified period of time, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>(B) any undertaking in writing in connection with the sale by a supplier of a consumer product to refund, repair, replace or take other remedial action with respect to such product in the event that such product fails to meet the specifications set forth in the undertaking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act provides for two types of written warranties on consumer products, those described as \u201cfull\u201d warranties and those described as \u201climited\u201d warranties. 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2303. The nature of the \u201cfull\u201d warranty is prescribed by \u00a7 2304. It expressly provides in subsection (a)(4) that a consumer must be given the election to receive a refund or replacement without charge of a product or part which is defective or malfunctions after a reasonable number of attempts by the warrantor to correct such condition. For the breach of any warranty, express or implied, or of a service contract (defined in 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2301(8)), consumers are given the right to sue for damages and \u201cother legal and equitable relief\u201d afforded under state or federal law, 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2310(d); 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2311(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Appellant Ford contends that the trial judge improperly invoked \u00a7 2304 of the act as a basis for allowing \u201crescission\u201d in the case since the warranty given by Ford was a limited warranty and not a full warranty. 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2303(a)(2) provides that all warranties that do not meet federal minimum standards for warranty contained in \u00a7 2304 shall be conspicuously designated a \u201climited warranty.\u201d \u201cLimited\u201d' warranties protect consumers by prohibiting disclaimers of implied warranties, \u00a7 2308, but are otherwise not described in the act. Note, <em>supra, </em>7 <em>Rutgers-Camden L.J. </em>at 381. Clearly, Ford\u2019s warranty, which is quoted later in this opinion, was a limited warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2308 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">(a) No supplier may disclaim or modify (except as provided in subsection (b) of this section) any implied warranty to a consumer with respect to such consumer product if (1) such supplier makes any written warranty to the consumer with respect to such consumer product, or (2) at the time of sale, or within 90 days thereafter, such supplier enters into a service contract with the consumer which applies to such consumer product.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">(b) For purposes of this chapter (other than section 2304(a)(2) of this title), implied warranties may be limited in duration to the duration of a written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>warranty of reasonable duration, if such limitation is conscionable and is set forth in clear and unmistakable language and prominently displayed on the face of the warranty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">(c) A disclaimer, modification, or limitation made in violation of this section shall be ineffective for purposes of this chapter and State law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">We will first consider the application of this act to the dealer, Marino Auto. As quoted above, paragraph 7 of the purchase order-contract provides that there are no warranties, express or implied, made by the selling dealer or manufacturer except, in the case of a new motor vehicle, \u201cthe warranty expressly given to the purchaser upon delivery of such motor vehicle. . . . \u201d This section also provides: \u201cThe selling dealer also agrees to promptly perform and fulfill all terms and conditions of the owner service policy.\u201d Ford contended in the trial court that Marino Auto had \u201ca duty\u201d to properly diagnose and make repairs, that such duty was \u201cfixed both by the express warranty . . . which they passed on . . . and by the terms of [paragraph 7 of the contract with plaintiff]\u201d by which Marino Auto expressly undertook \u201cto perform its obligations under the owner service policy.\u201d See 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2310(f); 16 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 700.4 (1980). The provision in paragraph 7 in these circumstances is a \u201cwritten warranty\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2301(6)(B) since it constitutes an undertaking in connection with the sale to take \u201cremedial action with respect to such product in the event that such product fails to meet the specifications set forth in the undertaking .. . . \u201d In our view the specifications of the undertaking include, at the least, the provisions of the limited warranty furnished by Ford, namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">\n<em>LIMITED WARRANTY (12 MONTHS OR 12,000 MILES/19,312 KILOME-TRES) 1978 NEW CAR AND LIGHT TRUCK</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">Ford warrants for its 1978 model cars and light trucks that the Selling Dealer will repair or replace free any parts, except tires, found under normal use in the U.S. or Canada to be defective in factory materials or workmanship within the earlier of 12 months or 12,000 miles/19,312 km from either first use or retail delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">All we require is that you properly operate and maintain your vehicle and that you return for warranty service to your Selling Dealer or any Ford or Lincoln-Mercury Dealer if you are traveling, have moved a long distance or need emergency repairs. Warranty repairs will be made with Ford Authorized Service or Remanufactured Parts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>THERE IS NO OTHER EXPRESS WARRANTY ON THIS VEHICLE.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The record does not contain a written description of the \u201cowner service policy\u201d which the dealer agreed to perform. Nevertheless, since Ford is the appellant here, we take its contentions at trial and documents in the record to establish the dealer\u2019s obligation to Ford and to plaintiff to make the warranty repairs on behalf of Ford (subject to the right of reimbursement or other terms that may be contained in their agreement). For the purpose of this appeal we are satisfied that the dealer\u2019s undertaking in paragraph 7 constitutes a written warranty within the meaning of 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2301(6)(B). Accordingly, having furnished a written warranty to the consumer, the dealer as a supplier may not \u201cdisclaim or modify [except to limit in duration] any implied warranty to a consumer... . \u201d The result of this analysis is to invalidate the attempted disclaimer by the dealer of the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness.* 12**<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Being bound by those implied warranties arising under state law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-314 and 315, Marino Auto was liable to plaintiff for the breach thereof as found by the trial judge, and plaintiff could timely revoke his acceptance of the automobile and claim a refund of his purchase price. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-608 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-711. <em>Zabriskie Chevrolet, Inc. v. Smith, </em>99 <em>NJ.Super. </em>441 (Law Div. 1968). In this connection we note that the trial judge found that plaintiff\u2019s attempted revocation of acceptance was made in timely fashion, and that finding has adequate support in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">As the trial judge noted, 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2310(d)(1) provides that a consumer who is damaged by the failure of a warrantor to comply with any obligation under the act, or under a written warranty or implied warranty or service contract, may bring suit \u201cfor damages and other legal and equitable relief . .. . \u201d Although the remedy of refund of the purchase price is expressly provided by the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act for breach of a full warranty, granting this remedy under state law for breach of a limited warranty is not barred by or inconsistent with the act. 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2311(b)(1) provides that nothing in the act restricts \u201cany right or remedy of any consumer under State law or other Federal law.\u201d See also <em>15 U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2311(c)(2). Thus, for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, plaintiff was entitled to revoke acceptance against Marino Auto, and a judgment for the purchase price less an allowance for the use of the vehicle was properly entered against Marino Auto. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-608 and 711. <em>Cf. </em>15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2301(12) which defines \u201crefund\u201d as the return of the purchase price \u201cless reasonable depreciation based on actual use where permitted\u201d by regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Plaintiff also could have recovered damages against Ford for Ford\u2019s breach of its written limited warranty. Marino Auto was Ford\u2019s representative for the purpose of making repairs to plaintiff\u2019s vehicle under the warranty. <em>See Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., supra, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>at 374; <em>cf. Conte v. Dwan Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., </em>172 <em>Conn. </em>112, 122-126, 374 A.2d 144, 149-150 (Sup.Ct.Err.1976). The limited warranty expressly required the purchaser to return the vehicle \u201cfor warranty service\u201d to the dealer or to any Ford or Lincoln-Mercury dealer if the purchaser is traveling or has moved a long distance or needs emergency repairs. Ford contends that it put purchasers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>on notice that they should advise Ford\u2019s district office if they have problems with their cars that a dealer is unable to fix. The record contains a document listing \u201cfrequently asked warranty questions\u201d which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">The Dealership where you purchased your vehicle has the responsibility for performing warranty repairs; therefore, take your vehicle to that Dealership. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">If you encounter a service problem, refer to the service assistance section of your Owner\u2019s Guide for suggested action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">We do not read these provisions as requiring notice to Ford as a condition of relief against Ford when Ford\u2019s dealer has failed after numerous attempts to correct defects under warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Normally, the measure of damages for a breach of warranty is the difference between the price paid by the purchaser and the market value of the defective product. <em>Santor v. A &amp; M Karagheusian, Inc., supra, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>at 63, 68-69; <em>see Herbstman v. Eastman Kodak Co., supra, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>at 11. However, as Judge Conford said in his concurring opinion in <em>Herbstman, supra, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>at 15-16, under principles of strict liability in tort a purchaser may be entitled to rescind the transaction and receive the return of the purchase price from the manufacturer without privity if the defect causes substantial impairment of value of the product. The strict liability in tort doctrine as developed in this state in the <em>Santor </em>case, <em>supra, </em>eliminated the need for privity of contract between the purchaser and the manufacturer as a condition for the purchaser\u2019s claim for his loss of bargain caused by a defect in the product. As noted above, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act accomplished the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">One question posed by this case is whether recovery of the purchase price from the manufacturer was available to plaintiff for breach of the manufacturer\u2019s warranty. If the warranty were a full warranty plaintiff would have been entitled to a refund of the purchase price under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. Since Ford\u2019s warranty was a limited warranty we must look to state law to determine plaintiff\u2019s right to damages or other legal and equitable relief. 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2310(d)(1). Once privity is removed as an obstacle to relief we see no reason why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>a purchaser cannot also elect the equitable remedy of returning the goods to the manufacturer who is a warrantor and claiming a refund of the purchase price less an allowance for use of the product. <em>See Seely v. White Motor Co., </em>63 Cal.2d 9, 45 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>17, 20, 403 P.2d 145, 148 (Sup.Ct.1965); <em>Durfee v. Rod Baxter Imports, Inc., supra, </em>262 <em>N.W.2d </em>at 357-358, where the Minnesota Supreme Court held as a matter of state law that lack of privity does not bar a purchaser of a foreign car from revoking acceptance and recovering the purchase price from the distributor of such cars as distinguished from the local dealer. The decision was made without regard to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">We are dealing with the breach of an express contractual obligation. Nothing prevents us from granting an adequate remedy under state law for that breach of contract, including rescission when appropriate. Under state law the right to revoke acceptance for defects substantially impairing the value of the product <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-608) and to receive a refund of the purchase price <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-711) are rights available to a buyer against a seller in privity. Where the manufacturer gives a warranty to induce the sale it is consistent to allow the same type of remedy as against that manufacturer. <em>See Durfee v. Rod Baxter Imports, Inc., supra; cf. Seely v. White Motor Co., supra. </em>Only the privity concept, which is frequently viewed as a relic these days, <em>Koperski v. Husker Dodge, Inc., </em>208 <em>Neb. </em>29, 45, 302 <em>N.W.2A </em>655, 664 (Sup.Ct.1981); <em>see Kinlaw v. Long Mfg. N.C., Inc., </em>298 <em>N.C. </em>494, 259 <em>S.E.2A </em>552 (Sup.Ct.1979), has interfered with a rescission-type remedy against the manufacturer of goods not purchased directly from the manufacturer. If we focus on the fact that the warranty creates a direct contractual obligation to the buyer, the reason for allowing the same remedy that is available against a direct seller becomes clear. Although the manufacturer intended to limit the remedy to the repair and replacement of defective parts, the failure of that remedy, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-719(2); <em>Goddard v. General Motors Corp., </em>60 <em>Ohio St.2d </em>41, 396 <em>N.E.2A </em>761 (Sup.Ct.1979); <em>Seely v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>White Motor Co., supra, </em>and the consequent breach of the implied warranty of merchantability which accompanied the limited warranty by virtue of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, make a rescission-type remedy appropriate when revocation of acceptance is justified. <em>Durfee v. Rod Baxter Imports, Inc., supra, </em>262 N.W.2d at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Lastly, we consider Ford\u2019s contention that a counsel fee was improperly granted to plaintiff since no judgment was entered in favor of plaintiff against Ford and Ford contends it was not given adequate notice of the defects in the car. 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2310(d)(2) provides that a consumer who \u201cprevails in any action brought [in any court] under paragraph (1) of this subsection . . . may be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment . . . expenses (including attorney\u2019s fees based on the actual time expended). . . . \u201d This section is subject to the provisions contained in \u00a7 2310(e). Subsection (e) provides that, with certain exceptions, no action based upon breach of a written or implied warranty or service contract may be prosecuted unless a person obligated under the warranty or service contract \u201cis afforded a reasonable opportunity to cure such failure to comply.\u201d Here that opportunity was given to Ford\u2019s designated representative to whom the purchaser was required to bring the car. A direct employee of Ford, Bednarz, also met with plaintiff or his wife and was made aware of some difficulty with the car. We are not certain of the extent of Ford\u2019s knowledge of those difficulties. However, in our view the opportunities given to Marino Auto to repair the vehicle satisfied the requirements of 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2310(e) in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">As noted, Ford also contends that a counsel fee could not be awarded against Ford because plaintiff did not recover a judgment against Ford. The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act permits a prevailing consumer to recover attorney\u2019s fees \u201cas part of the judgment.\u201d The trial judge found that Ford had breached its warranty and that the car\u2019s value was substantially impaired. He entered no damage judgment against Ford. However, in the absence of proof of actual damages, plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>was entitled to a judgment against Ford for nominal damages. <em>Ruane Dev. Corp. v. Cullere, </em>134 <em>NJ.Super </em>245, 252 (App.Div. 1975); <em>Ench v. Bluestein, </em>52 <em>NJ.Super. </em>169, 173-174 (App.Div. 1958); <em>Winkler v. Hartford Accident and Indem. Co., </em>66 <em>NJ.Super. </em>22, 29 (App.Div.), certif. den. 34 <em>NJ. </em>581 (1961); <em>Packard Englewood Motors, Inc. v. Packard Motor Car Co., </em>215 F.2d 503, 510 (3 Cir.1954). Ford was not prejudiced by the failure of the trial judge to enter a judgment for nominal damages to which the award of attorney\u2019s fees could be attached. <em>See Nobility Homes, Inc. v. Ballentine, </em>386 So.2d 727, 730-731 (Sup.Ct.Ala. 1980). The award of counsel fees fulfills the intent of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. Without such an award consumers frequently would be unable to vindicate warranty rights accorded by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">As to the amount of counsel fees allowed by the trial judge, we find no abuse of discretion. The allowance was for actual time spent at an hourly rate of $75. Consideration could properly be given to the fact that plaintiff\u2019s attorney undertook this claim on a contingency basis with a relatively small retainer. <em>DR </em>2-106(A)(8). The normal breach of warranty case ought not require four separate appearances before the trial court. To some extent this was not in the control of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and plaintiff might have obtained all the relief required against Ford on the first day of trial. But it did not work out that way. In other cases it may be possible to stipulate damages and simplify the issues, thus limiting the cost of this type of litigation for consumers and suppliers alike. But the issues raised in this ease were novel in this State, and no one can be faulted for the difficulty and time consumed in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We have stated that in an appropriate case a consumer could recover the purchase price from a manufacturer for breach of a limited warranty causing a substantial impairment of the value of the product. The application of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act is one distinction between this case and <em>Herbstman v. Eastman Kodak Co., supra, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>at 9-12, n.l. However, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>need not determine whether plaintiff had the right to such relief in this case. Ordinarily, a purchaser seeking such relief after unsuccessful repairs should be required to give timely notice to the manufacturer of revocation of acceptance of defective goods and of his demand for a refund of the purchase price. <em>See Durfee v. Rod Baxter Imports, Inc., supra, </em>262 N.W.2d at 353. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that such notice and demand were given to Ford in this case, but no finding was made by the trial judge on plaintiff\u2019s claim against Ford. Having determined that plaintiff was entitled to a judgment for nominal damages and counsel fees against Ford, and that judgments against Marino Auto and for indemnification by Ford were properly entered, it makes no difference in this case whether plaintiff was also entitled to a refund of his purchase price from Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The result in this case differs from that reached in <em>Edelstein v. Toyota Motors Distributors, supra. </em>However, the differences in the cases, the absence there of proof of any warranty from defendants, and the apparent failure of the purchaser to rely on the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act make it unnecessary for us to comment on that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\"><em>See </em>Pavesi v.
