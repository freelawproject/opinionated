On this appeal the municipality contends that considerable evidence was presented which established a higher economic rent than the contract rent provided in the applicable lease; that the cost approach supports an economic rent of $7.25 per square foot; that the lack of demand for office space in Monmouth County is irrelevant in the case at hand, and that the limit on rent that the federal government imposed in soliciting bids is also immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">The case presents a number of unique aspects which were carefully considered in Judge Andrew\u2019s opinion below. Ample credible evidence supports the result reached in the Tax Court, and, not persuaded by the contentions advanced on this appeal, we affirm substantially for the reasons given by Judge Andrew. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v.
