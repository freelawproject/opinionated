The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>29 Conn. App. 584, 617 A.2d 174 (1992). Having decided that our grant of certification was improvident, we now dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Both issues on which we granted certification were fully considered and properly resolved against the defendant in the well reasoned opinion of the Appellate Court. Id., 589-90. Having examined the record on appeal and studied the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we conclude that it would serve no useful purpose to repeat the discussion contained in the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The impact of indigency on a criminal defendant\u2019s liability to pay a fine is codified in Practice Book \u00a7 929. Section 929 provides: \u201cNo person shall be incarcerated as a result of his failure to pay a fine unless the judicial authority first inquires as to his ability to pay the fine.\u201d This section is rooted in the constitutional principle that the state may not \u201csubject a certain class of convicted defendants to a period of imprisonment beyond the statutory maximum solely by reason of their indigency.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>399 U.S. 235, 241-42, 90 S. Ct. 2018, 26 L. Ed. 2d 586 (1970); see also <em>Bearden </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>461 U.S. 660, 664, 103 S. Ct. 2064, 76 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1983); <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>185 Conn. 124, 130, 440 A.2d 848 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Zakrzewski, </em>26 Conn. App. 716, 718, 603 A.2d 432 (1992). In the circumstances of the present case, however, in which the sentence imposed upon a criminal defendant includes a term of imprisonment as well as a fine, \u00a7 929 provides no specific guidance concerning the time when a judicial inquiry into indigency should be conducted. Although a clarifying amendment of the rules of practice to address the problem illuminated by this case might well be desirable, this court does not sit as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Rules Committee of the Superior Court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>216 Conn. 647, 665 n.11, 583 A.2d 915 (1990); <em>Kupstis </em>v. <em>Michaud, </em>215 Conn. 435, 437, 576 A.2d 152 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\"> This court\u2019s order granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">\u201c1. Did the Appellate Court correctly conclude that an arguably indigent defendant, who has been sentenced to a maximum term of imprisonment of fifteen years and the maximum fine of $50,000 for a single offense, may not challenge the imposition of that fine until he has served the fifteen year sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">\u201c2. Did the Appellate Court correctly conclude that the trial court\u2019s definition of a reasonable doubt as \u2018a doubt for which a valid reason may be assigned,\u2019 was not reviewable, or if it was reviewed on its merits, was not erroneous?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>224 Conn. 927, 619 A.2d 851 (1993).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b82-10\"><em> </em>General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 provides in relevant part: \u201cpenalty for ILLEGAL MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION, SALE, PRESCRIPTION, DISPENSING, (a) Any person who . . . possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any controlled substance which is a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, or a narcotic substance, except as authorized in this chapter, for a first offense, shall be imprisoned not more than fifteen years and may be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars or be both fined and imprisoned; and for a second offense shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than one hundred thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned; and for each subsequent offense, shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
