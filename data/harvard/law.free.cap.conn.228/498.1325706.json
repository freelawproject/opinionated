The plaintiff appealed to the trial court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the defendant\u2019s denial of its application. The trial court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, reversed the defendant\u2019s decision and granted the plaintiff\u2019s application. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Thereafter, the defendant petitioned the Appellate Court for certification to appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Court granted the petition, we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff is a private nonprofit organization composed of individuals from the West Hartford community and eleven local churches and synagogues, created for the purpose of \u201c \u2018providing] entry level home ownership opportunities for individuals and families of low and moderate income.\u2019 \u201d At all material times, the plaintiff held an option to purchase approximately one and one-fourth acres of undeveloped property at 2561 Albany Avenue, West Hartford.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On May 6,1991, pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g, the plaintiff submitted an application to the defendant requesting for the property: (1) a zone change from an R-13 single-family zone to an RM-4 multifamily zone;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) a special development district designation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The application, designed to meet the affordability requirements of \u00a7 8-30g for an \u201caffordable housing development,\u201d sought approval for ten affordable housing units in three buildings on the property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">On June 17 and June 27, 1991, the defendant held a public hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s application. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>two-day hearing, the West Hartford town planner, a representative of the Northwest Homeowner\u2019s Association and several members of the public testified in opposition to the application. The plaintiff\u2019s executive director, its counsel, a local real estate appraiser, the president of the League of Women Voters and several members of the public, among others, testified in support of the application. In total, an equal number of people, approximately twenty-six, spoke both for and against the application.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Following the conclusion of the hearing, at an August 6, 1991 meeting, the defendant voted unanimously to deny the plaintiff\u2019s application. In a letter dated August 8, 1991, the defendant informed the plaintiff of its decision. Although the deliberations concerning the application, reflected in the minutes of the defendant\u2019s August 6 meeting, revealed various concerns relating to the plaintiff\u2019s application, the letter failed to state any reasons for the defendant\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">On August 30, 1991, the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court from the defendant\u2019s decision to deny its application. During the pendency of the appeal, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the proposed project was neither \u201cassisted\u201d nor deed restricted and, accordingly, did not constitute an \u201caffordable housing development\u201d as defined in \u00a7 8-30g (a) (1) (A) and (B). After receiving testimony and hearing oral argument on June 10,1992, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Subsequently, after an evidentiary hearing, the trial court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal and granted the plaintiffs application. The defendant has appealed, raising five issues. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) implicitly concluded that the affordable housing land use appeals procedure set forth in \u00a7 8-30g applies to legislative zone changes; (2) failed to apply traditional concepts of zoning review to the plaintiff\u2019s affordable housing appeal; (3) failed to consider the affordability of all housing in West Hartford in assessing the need for \u201caffordable housing\u201d under \u00a7 8-30g (c); (4) failed to require the plaintiff to establish a likelihood that it would succeed in providing affordable housing; and (5) ordered a zone change and approval of the special development district designation in lieu of remanding the plaintiff\u2019s application to the defendant. Additional facts will be set forth hereinafter where relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly concluded, by implication, that the procedure governing the affordable housing land use appeals set forth in \u00a7 8-30g applied to the defendant\u2019s legislative decision<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to deny the plaintiff\u2019s requested zone change. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>The defendant asserts that the plaintiffs application requested two distinct but interdependent actions: first, the plaintiff requested a zone change on the subject property from single-family to multifamily; and second, in the event that the defendant granted the zone change, the plaintiff requested approval of a special development district designation (special designation), which included, inter alia, requests for waivers of certain standards in the underlying zone change solicited by the plaintiff. The defendant further asserts that, under \u00a7 177-44.A of the West Hartford Code of Ordinances, a special designation may be granted <em>only if </em>the request pertains to \u201cpermitted uses of land in the zoning district in which it is located.\u201d The defendant contends that when the plaintiff applied for the special designation, its proposed multifamily residential use for the subject property was <em>not </em>permitted in the underlying single-family zone. Thus, the defendant asserts, approval of the plaintiffs request for a special designation would have required prior approval of the plaintiffs requested multifamily zone change.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">In light of these factors, the defendant contends that \u00a7 8-30g does not apply to the plaintiffs first and separate request for a zone change on the subject property because such a request is not \u201cin connection with\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s affordable housing development application, as required by \u00a7 8-30g (a) (2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In response, the plaintiff asserts, inter alia, that the defendant never raised the issue of the applicability of \u00a7 8-30g to legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>decisions at any point prior to seeking this appeal; consequently, the plaintiff argues that this court should not now consider the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Although our examination of the record confirms that the defendant did not raise this claim below,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the record that is before us regarding the claim is nevertheless adequate for our review. In view of the adequate record, the public character of this case and the significance of the issue to both the parties and the surrounding community, we elect to invoke, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4183, our general power of supervision and control over proceedings on appeal. <em>Matza </em>v. <em>Matza, </em>226 Conn. 166, 189, 627 A.2d 414 (1993); <em>Pisel </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>180 Conn. 314, 330, 430 A.2d 1 (1980); <em>Silverman </em>v. <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, </em>168 Conn. 160, 171, 363 A.2d 22 (1975). Pursuant to this power, we will address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly concluded by implication that \u00a7 8-30g applies to legislative zone changes and hold that the trial court\u2019s implicit application of the statute to the defendant\u2019s decision to deny the plaintiff\u2019s application was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u201cOrdinarily, the construction and interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the courts . . . particularly where, as here, the statute has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny or time-tested agency interpretations.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jutkowitz </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>220 Conn. 86, 106, 596 A.2d 374 (1991). \u201cIn construing a statute, we seek to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 390, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993). \u201cIn seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McVeigh, </em>224 Conn. 593, 607, 620 A.2d 133 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In construing \u00a7 8-30g, we must start with the language employed by the legislature. <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, 220 </em>Conn. 749, 756, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992). Generally, \u201cwhen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>American Universal Ins. Co. v.DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). Further, we must interpret a statute according to its plain and ordinary meaning: <em>Mazur </em>v. <em>Blum, </em>184 Conn. 116, 118, 441 A.2d 65 (1981). \u201cWhen the language of a statute is unclear, [however,] we may ascertain the intent of the legislature by looking beyond the language to the statute\u2019s legislative history and the purpose that the statute was intended to serve.\u201d <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>223 Conn. 336, 341, 612 A.2d 1203 (1992). \u201cA statute . . . should not be interpreted to thwart its purpose.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>217 Conn. 110, 126-27, 584 A.2d 1172 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Applying these principles to our interpretation of \u00a7 8-30g, we conclude that the legislature intended the statute\u2019s appeals procedure to apply to the defendant\u2019s legislative decision to grant or deny a zone change. The plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7 8-30g supports this conclusion. Section 8-30g (a) (2) defines an \u201caffordable housing application\u201d as <em>\u201cany </em>application made to a commission <em>in connection with </em>an affordable housing development by a person who proposes to develop such affordable housing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Apart from requiring that an application be made in connec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>tion with an affordable housing development proposal, the statute contains no exceptions or qualifications limiting the definition of an affordable housing application to certain types of applications to zoning commissions. In contrast, the statute modifies \u201capplication\u201d with the word \u201cany.\u201d In the absence of a single qualification limiting the definition of \u201caffordable housing application,\u201d and in view of the \u201cplain and ordinary\u201d meaning of the word \u201cany,\u201d we construe the language of \u00a7 8-30g to apply to every type of application filed with a commission in connection with an affordable housing proposal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">The circumstances surrounding the statute\u2019s enactment and its legislative history further support our conclusion that the legislature intended \u00a7 8-30g to apply to legislative zone changes. First, the report of the \u201cBlue Ribbon Commission on Housing,\u201d which originally proposed the affordable housing appeals procedure in its 1989 final report to Governor William A. O\u2019Neill and the General Assembly,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> reveals that the proposed appeals procedure contemplated zone changes. In proposing this procedure, the commission described the need to increase density allowances and to circumvent prohibitively costly zoning and subdivision requirements: \u201cExpanding the basis for an appeal gives would-be developers of affordable housing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>opportunity <em>to contrast specific zoning and low-density regulations or anti-growth practices, </em>when encountered, with a community\u2019s need for affordable housing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) State of Connecticut Blue Ribbon Commission on Housing Report and Recommendations to the Governor and General Assembly, February 1,1989, p. 12. During the floor debate in the Senate concerning \u00a7 8-30g, Senator Richard Blumenthal stated that the affordable housing appeals bill (i.e., \u00a7 8-30g) \u201c[was] important because it really is the centerpiece of the series of recommendations that emerged from the Governor\u2019s Blue Ribbon Commission on Housing.\u201d 32 S. Proc., Pt. 12, 1989 Sess., p. 4048. Thus, to the extent that the commission's recommendations served as a basis for \u00a7 8-30g, the commission\u2019s report is illustrative of the legislature\u2019s intent. Cf. <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>213 Conn. 548, 559-62, 569 A.2d 518 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">In addition, during the floor debate in the House of Representatives, various legislators explicitly discussed the applicability of the appeals procedure contained in \u00a7 8-30g to legislative decisions, and in particular to zone change applications. At least one legislator voiced opposition to \u00a7 8-30g on the basis of the statute\u2019s applicability to zone changes. 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 30,1989 Sess., p. 10,630, remarks of Representative James Fleming. Of special significance is the response of Representative William Cibes to a question from Representative Robert Farr about a proposal to develop multifamily housing in a single-family zone, and whether such a proposed change in the underlying zone would be \u201cin itself a basis for denial.\u201d Representative Cibes stated: \u201c[T]he answer is no, not per se. The municipality might have very good grounds for not having multifamily dwellings in the particular area. The soil type, the capacity of the infrastructure, various reasons such as that might have been a reason for the municipality not to adopt a particular zone for that particular area, but per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>se, there would not\u2014it would not [be] a reason for rejecting this application.\u201d 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 30,1989 Sess., pp. 10,608-10,609.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Finally, our interpretation of \u00a7 8-30g as encompassing legislative zone changes promotes the legislative policy that the statute was designed to implement. In contrast, the defendant\u2019s proposed reading of the statute would \u201c \u2018thwart its purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra, 126-27. Our review of the statute\u2019s legislative history reveals that the key purpose of \u00a7 8-30g is to encourage and facilitate the much needed development of affordable housing throughout the state. See, e.g., 32 S. Proc., Pt. 12, 1989 Sess., p. 4051, remarks of Senator Fred Love-grove, and p. 4058, remarks of Senator Kevin Sullivan. The defendant\u2019s proposed interpretation of the statute would undermine this very important objective. Under the defendant\u2019s proposed interpretation, a town could utilize zoning to impede a developer from appealing under the statute. That is, a town could remove itself entirely from \u00a7 8-30g by eliminating any zones appropriate for the development of affordable housing. Conceivably, towns in which no land is zoned for multifamily housing would be wholly exempt from the statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We refuse to construe \u00a7 8-30g to include an implied limitation that would be so antithetical to the intent of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In summary, on the basis of the plain language of \u00a7 8-30g and its legislative history, the circumstances surrounding its enactment, and the purpose for which it was designed, we conclude that the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>intended the statute to apply to legislative zone changes. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court properly applied \u00a7 8-30g to the plaintiffs appeal from the defendant\u2019s decision to deny the requested zone change.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">As a corollary to its prior claim, the defendant next claims that, even if \u00a7 8-30g properly applies to legislative zone changes, the trial court should have applied traditional concepts of judicial review of zoning commission decisions to the plaintiff\u2019s affordable housing appeal. The defendant argues that the trial court failed to do so in several respects. First, the defendant asserts that the trial court required the defendant collectively to state its reasons for denying the plaintiff\u2019s application and refused to search the record for reasons in support of the defendant\u2019s decision. Second, the defendant contends that the trial court substituted its judgment for that of the defendant regarding the density of the site. Finally, the defendant asserts that the trial court both ignored the defendant\u2019s collective vote that the plaintiffs plan was in disharmony with West Hartford\u2019s comprehensive plan and overlooked the defendant\u2019s right to rely on its personal knowledge of the site and its environs. Our review of the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision persuades us that the trial court properly applied traditional concepts of judicial review, where appropriate, to its review of the defendant\u2019s decision. Consequently, we reject the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">As a prelude to a discussion of the merits of the defendant\u2019s arguments, we reiterate the well established concepts that govern judicial review of zoning commission decisions. The defendant, in denying the plaintiffs application, was acting in its legislative capacity.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> When such a denial is appealed, \u201cit is not the func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>tion of the court to retry the case. Conclusions reached by [a zoning] commission must be upheld by the trial court if they are reasonably supported by the record. The credibility of the witnesses and the determination of issues of fact are matters solely within the province of the [commission]. . . . The question is not whether the trial court would have reached the same conclusion, but whether the record before the [commission] supports the decision reached. (Citations omitted.) <em>Calandro </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>176 Conn. 439, 440, 408 A.2d 229 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\u201cWhere a zoning [commission] has stated its reasons for its actions, the court should determine only whether the assigned grounds are reasonably supported by the record and whether they are pertinent to the considerations which the authority was required to apply under the zoning regulations. . . . The zone change must be sustained if even one of the stated reasons is sufficient to support it. . . . The principle that a court should confine its review to the reasons given by a zoning [commission] does not apply to any utterances, however incomplete, by the members of the [commission] subsequent to their vote. [Rather, it] applies where the [commission] has rendered a formal, official, collective statement of reasons for its action.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Protect Hamden/North Haven from Excessive Traffic &amp; Pollution, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 527, 544, 600 A.2d 757 (1991). Thus, \u201cwhere a zoning commission has formally stated the reasons for its decision, the court should not go behind that official collective statement . . . [and] attempt to search out and speculate upon other reasons which might have influenced some or all of the members of the commission to reach the commission\u2019s final collective decision.\u201d <em>DeMaria v. Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>159 Conn. 534, 541, 271 A.2d 105 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Where, however, the zoning commission fails to present a formal collective statement of reasons the court must \u201csearch the entire record to find a basis for the commission\u2019s decision . . . .\u201d <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>178 Conn. 657, 662, 425 A.2d 100 (1979). In such a case, individual reasons \u201cgiven by certain members of the commission [do] not amount to a formal, collective, official statement of the commission\u201d; <em>Protect Hamden/North Haven from Excessive Traffic &amp; Pollution, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 545; and \u201care not available to show the reason[s] for, or the ground[s] of, the [commission\u2019s] decision.\u201d <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>158 Conn. 208, 214, 257 A.2d 795 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">With these concepts of judicial review in mind, we address the defendant\u2019s arguments seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court required the defendant collectively to state its reasons and refused to search the record is wholly without merit. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court never required the defendant collectively to state its reasons. Rather, the trial court merely noted that the defendant\u2019s failure \u201ccollectively [to] express its reasons for the denial\u201d was a \u201cdisfavored\u201d procedure. Moreover, the trial court stated: \u201cA review of [\u00a7 8-30g (c)] indicates that the legislature has now placed the burden of proof on the commission . . . and not, <em>as in traditional land use appeals, </em>on the applicant. <em>Like a traditional appeal, however, </em>the evidence is to be <em>gleaned from the record; </em>the new process is not a trial de novo.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Further, the trial court correctly stated: \u201c[W]here a zoning commission has formally stated the reasons for its decision, the court should not go behind that official collective statement of the commission. It should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>not attempt to search out and speculate upon other reasons which might have influenced some or all of the members of the commission to reach the commission\u2019s final collective decision. . . . The reviewing court ought only to determine whether the assigned grounds are reasonably supported by the record and whether they are pertinent to the considerations which the authority was required to apply under the zoning regulations. . . . Of course, where there is a failure to comply with the obligation to state reasons, the action is not deemed void but the court must search the record to see whether the board was justified in its decision.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Thereafter, the trial court stated that \u201c[i]n the present case, the Council members did not give a formal collective statement for the denial.\u201d Rather, members stated individual reasons, reflected in the minutes of the hearing, prior to voting. Citing <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 214, the trial court correctly recognized that \u201cthese individual views [were] not available to show the reasons for, or the grounds of, the board\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Subsequently, the trial court applied the traditional standard of review applicable to zoning commission decisions, and, in the absence of any formal collective statement by the defendant for denying the plaintiff\u2019s application, thoroughly searched the entire record to see whether the defendant was justified in its decision. <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 661-62. In searching the record of the minutes of the August 6, 1991 meeting, the trial court found expressions of two primary concerns about the plaintiff\u2019s proposed development: its size and density. The trial court concluded, however, that, even if it is assumed that size and density problems met the requirements of \u00a7 8-30g (c) (1) and (2), there was no evidence that those problems \u201cclearly outweigh[ed] the need for afforda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ble housing\u201d as required by \u00a7 8-30g (c) (3). Consequently, the trial court found that the defendant had failed to satisfy its burden of proof under \u00a7 8-30g (c).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that, contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, the trial court did not require the defendant collectively to state its reasons for denial,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and, in fact, properly searched the entire record to find a basis for the defendant\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">We also conclude that the trial court did not substitute its judgment for that of the defendant regarding the density of the site. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court acknowledged and closely analyzed the defendant\u2019s concerns relating to the size, number and proposed height of the units. The trial court, however, determined that under the burden-shifting mechanism of \u00a7 8-30g (c) such concerns were clearly outweighed by the need for affordable housing. The trial court noted that all the existing multifamily areas on the other three sides of the subject property were \u201cmore intensely developed.\u201d Specifically, the court noted that the den<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>sity of the \u201cHartmeadow project is . . . \u2018slightly lower than what is asked for by [the plaintiff]\u2019 \u201d and that the \u201cBrace-Dale project, previously approved, has a greater density (but fewer units).\u201d Additionally, the trial court stated that the proposed lot coverage of 12 percent not only met the existing R-13 single-family zone standards on the subject property\u2014allowing up to 30 percent coverage\u2014but also met the proposed RM-4 multifamily zone standards of 20 percent coverage. Accordingly, the trial court concluded: \u201cThe [defendant had] simply not met its burden of proving that the size of th[e] project, the ten units or, the increase of six units over the allowable four units, outweigh[ed] the need for this approval.\u201d In light of the trial court\u2019s foregoing analysis, we conclude that it did not substitute its judgment for that of the defendant concerning the density of the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Finally, we conclude that the trial court neither ignored the defendant\u2019s collective \u201cno\u201d vote on its motion to grant the plaintiff\u2019s application<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> nor overlooked the defendant\u2019s right to rely on its personal knowledge of the site and its environs in casting that vote. The defendant\u2019s \u201ccollective vote\u201d essentially constituted its <em>decision </em>to deny the plaintiff\u2019s application. The defendant\u2019s argument, claiming that its vote was ignored and its knowledge overlooked, therefore, merely reiterates its claim that the trial court failed properly to search the record to find a basis for its decision. Because we already have concluded that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>court in fact searched the record and was unable to find a basis to justify the defendant\u2019s decision, we reject its argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">We agree with the defendant that its wide discretion in denying the plaintiff's request for a zone change encompasses the ability to rely on its personal knowledge of the site and its environs as a basis for its vote. <em>Stiles </em>v. <em>Town </em>Council, 159 Conn. 212, 218-19, 268 A.2d 395 (1970) (courts allow a zoning authority \u201cwide and liberal discretion ... in determining the public need and the means of meeting it, because the local authority lives close to the circumstances and conditions which create the problem and shape the solution\u201d). The only personal knowledge to which the defendant directs this court\u2019s attention, however, is an awareness on the part of the defendant\u2019s members of various \u201caffordable housing initiatives and opportunities [existing] in West Hartford.\u201d Because we conclude in our discussion of the defendant\u2019s fourth claim, infra, that such initiatives and opportunities do not satisfy the statutory requirements of \u201caffordable housing,\u201d the defendant\u2019s consideration of these factors could not furnish a proper basis to justify its decision. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s argument and conclude that the trial court properly applied traditional concepts of zoning review when it reversed the defendant\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that the trial court improperly refused to consider the affordability of all housing in West Hartford when it assessed the need for \u201caffordable housing\u201d under \u00a7 8-30g (c). In an affordable housing appeal, \u00a7 8-30g (c) requires a zoning commission to prove, inter alia, that (1) \u201cthe [zoning commission\u2019s] decision is necessary to protect substantial public interests in health, safety, or other matters which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>the commission may legally consider\u201d; and (2) \u201csuch public interests clearly outweigh the need for affordable housing.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (c) (2) and (3). Additionally, as we have already discussed, \u00a7 8-30g (a) (1) limits the definition of \u201caffordable housing\u201d either to \u201cassisted\u201d housing or to deed restricted housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">In support of its reversal of the defendant\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s application, the trial court determined that West Hartford was not exempt from the statute pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g (f) or (g) and that substantial public interests<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> did not clearly outweigh the need for affordable housing. As previously stated, the trial court found that the defendant had advanced two primary concerns as justifications for denying the plaintiff\u2019s application\u2014the size and density of the proposed project. Against these concerns, the trial court weighed the need for affordable housing and concluded that the need outweighed the defendant\u2019s concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In evaluating \u201cneed,\u201d the trial court ruled that the only affordable housing units that could be considered were units that met the statutory definition of affordable housing.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Further, relying on the Blue Ribbon Commission\u2019s report on the regional assessment of the state\u2019s housing needs, the trial court concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>state was deficient by 181,535 units and that the capital area was deficient by 35,145 units, resulting in an overall regional deficiency of 12.89 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The defendant argues that under \u00a7 8-30g (c), when weighing the need for affordable housing in West Hartford against the substantial public interests advanced by the defendant as reasons for denying the plaintiffs application, the trial court should have considered evidence of existing housing that did not meet the statutory definition of \u201caffordable housing\u201d but was, nevertheless, \u201caffordable.\u201d In particular, the defendant argues that the trial court should have considered statistical evidence demonstrating that at the time of the plaintiffs hearing before the defendant, there were at least sixty residential units listed on the market in West Hartford for less than $147,500 and thirty-seven housing units listed with an asking price below $99,000. Additionally, the defendant argues that the trial court should have considered evidence that the defendant\u2019s membership had personal knowledge of various efforts on the part of West Hartford to promote affordable housing in the town.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">As the amici curiae point out in their brief, there is no support in the statute or its legislative history for the defendant\u2019s position. Section 8-30g (a) explicitly limits the definition of \u201caffordable housing\u201d to \u201cassisted housing\u201d or deed restricted housing. Further, \u00a7 8-30g (f) and (g) provide specific exemptions from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>statute\u2019s appeals procedure. Because the \u201cevidence\u201d proffered by the defendant does not comport with the statutory definition of \u201caffordable housing,\u201d it satisfies neither statutory exemption. Consequently, when weighing the need for affordable housing, the trial court correctly refused to consider the defendant\u2019s evidence of low cost housing and of private efforts to encourage its development. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly determined that the defendant failed to prove, pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g (c), that substantial public interests outweighed the need for affordable housing in West Hartford.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>IY</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that the trial court should have required the plaintiff to demonstrate not only an intention to provide affordable housing but also the likelihood that it had the practical ability to effectuate its proposal. The defendant derives this claim from the definitional requirements of \u00a7 8-30g (a). Section 8-30g (a) (1) defines \u201caffordable housing development\u201d as \u201ca proposed housing development (A) which is <em>assisted housing </em>or (B) in which not less than twenty percent of the dwelling units will be conveyed by deeds containing covenants or restrictions which shall require that such dwelling units be sold or rented at, or below, prices which will preserve the units as affordable housing . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, \u00a7 8-30g (a) (1) sets forth two alternate tests, under either of which an applicant can qualify for \u201caffordable housing development\u201d status under the statute. Further, \u00a7 8-30g (a) (3) defines \u201cassisted housing\u201d as \u201chousing which is receiving, or will receive, financial assistance under any governmental program for the construction or substantial rehabilitation of low and moderate income housing, and any housing occupied by persons receiving . . .\u2019\u2019certain state or federal rental assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The trial court found that the plaintiff\u2019s proposal satisfied both tests under \u00a7 8-30g (a).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>contends, however, that in light of the above discussed definitions, the trial court should have required the plaintiff to demonstrate a greater likelihood that its proposed housing either (1) was receiving or would receive government financial assistance, or (2) would be deed restricted to ensure its affordability. Because the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u201caffordable housing development\u201d reads into the statute a stricter standard than is mandated by the statute, we reject the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">The record reveals and the trial court properly concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s proposed housing development qualified as \u201cassisted housing\u201d under \u00a7 8-30g (a) (1). At the June 10,1992 hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the trial court received evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s proposed project already had received an $11,600 interest free loan from the department of housing, through the Connecticut Housing Investment Fund, Inc.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Moreover, the director of policy and planning at the department of housing testified that it was likely that the plaintiff\u2019s proposal would receive governmental financial assistance for construction. Finally, the plaintiff\u2019s original zoning application indicated that the plaintiff would be receiving additional governmental funds only upon receipt of approval for its requested zone change.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">To satisfy the definition of \u201cassisted housing,\u201d \u00a7 8-30g (a) (3) merely required the plaintiff to demonstrate that either it received or it would be receiving financial assistance under any governmental program for the construction of its affordable housing development. Because the evidence in the record supports the conclusion that the plaintiff already had received financial assistance from the department of housing through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>the Connecticut Housing Investment Fund, Inc., and would be likely to receive more governmental assistance upon approval of its application, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiff\u2019s application qualified as \u201cassisted housing\u201d under the \u00a7 8-30g.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Adoption of the more stringent standard advocated by the defendant would severely undermine the development of affordable housing. As noted above, the plaintiff indicated in its application that, although it was pursuing governmental assistance through the state department of housing, it was not possible to have final commitment for the funds prior to securing zoning approval. Thus, to require the plaintiff to furnish conclusive evidence of such funding approval prior to obtaining zoning authorization for purposes of determining whether a proposed affordable housing plan is \u201cassisted\u201d under \u00a7 8-30g would thwart the statute\u2019s purpose. Moreover, to have ensured that the appeal provisions of \u00a7 8-30g were not fraudulently utilized, the defendant could have conditioned approval of the plaintiffs application upon the receipt of the promised funds. West Hartford Code of Ordinances \u00a7 177-44.C (4) (\u201cTown Council may attach any conditions to its approval [of a special development district plan] as it considers necessary in order to assure continued conformance to the approved plan and zoning regulations . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The record also reveals and the trial court properly determined that the plaintiff\u2019s proposed housing units would be deed restricted within the definition of \u00a7 8-30g (a) (1) (B) so as to ensure their continued affordability. As evidence of its commitment to make all its proposed units affordable for the life of the units the plaintiff submitted to the trial court a copy of the Brace-Dale Association, Inc. Declaration of Cooperative. The plaintiff indicated its intent to use a similar declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>tion, containing restrictions and covenants that run with the land, for its proposed affordable housing development. Specifically, the plaintiffs declaration will require that \u201c[t]he Association shall not convey a unit to any would-be purchaser whose income exceeds 80% of the median income for the region as defined in the appropriate federal regulations.\u201d The declaration will further restrict membership to an applicant with \u201clow to moderate income as defined in the State of Connecticut, Department of Housing and if that agency ceases to exist then by standards as determined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development . . . .\u201d Finally, the declaration will ensure that both restrictions on alienation will be in force for at least twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">The plaintiffs proposed affordable housing development will come under the provisions of the Common Interest Ownership Act (CIOA), General Statutes \u00a7 47-200 et seq., which provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018limited equity cooperative\u2019 means a cooperative whose declaration contains any restrictions on . . .the amount for which a unit may be sold . . . .\u2019\u2019General Statutes \u00a7 47-242 (a). Under CIOA, the conveyance of a unit owner\u2019s interest in a cooperative is effectuated by delivery to the purchaser of the \u201cinstrument, <em>executed in the same manner as a deed, </em>\u201d conveying the seller\u2019s interest in the unit. (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 47-204 (e) (6). Thus, a limited equity affordable cooperative achieves the goals of a \u00a7 8-30g (a) (1) (B) deed restricted transfer even though the recorded document is not titled a \u201cdeed\u201d per se. The trial court concluded that in view of the technical nature of the plaintiff\u2019s instrument of conveyance, this statutory requirement is a \u201cdistinction without a difference,\u201d and we agree. Consequently, we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the plaintiff\u2019s proposed affordable housing units qualified as deed restricted under \u00a7 8-30g (a) (1) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>In summary, on the basis of the evidence in the record, we are satisfied that the trial court properly concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s proposal met the definitional requirements of \u00a7 8-30g (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly ordered a zone change and approval of the special development district designation in lieu of remanding the plaintiff\u2019s application to the defendant with the instruction that the plaintiff revise its application. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Section 8-30g (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the commission does not satisfy its burden of proof under this subsection, the court shall <em>wholly </em>or partly <em>revise, </em>modify, remand <em>or reverse </em>the decision from which the appeal was taken in a manner consistent with the evidence in the record before it.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Additionally, \u00a7 8-30g (d) provides: \u201cFollowing a decision by a commission to reject an affordable housing application . . . the applicant <em>may, </em>within the period for filing an appeal of such decision, submit to the commission a proposed modification of its proposal responding to some or all of the objections or restrictions articulated by the commission, which shall be treated as an amendment to the original proposal. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The subsection further provides: \u201cNothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the right of an applicant to appeal the original decision of the commission in the manner set forth in this section <em>without submitting a proposed modification </em>or to limit the issues which may be raised in any appeal under this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court held that \u00a7 8-30g (d) did not require the plaintiff to submit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>a modification of its application to the defendant.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The trial court also held that the defendant failed to meet its burden of proof under \u00a7 8-30g (c), and, accordingly, reversed the defendant\u2019s decision and granted the plaintiff\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Both the trial court\u2019s determination that the plaintiff was not required to submit a modification and its remedy granting the application are specifically authorized by the plain language of \u00a7 8-30g. Section 8-30g (d) enables, but does not require the plaintiff to submit a modified application. Additionally, \u00a7 8-3Og (c) permits the trial court \u201cwholly or partly [to] revise\u201d the defendant\u2019s decision on appeal. Notwithstanding this plain language, the defendant asks us to interpret \u00a7 8-30g to require the trial court to remand the plaintiff\u2019s application to the defendant with the instruction that the plaintiff modify its application. We decline so to rewrite \u00a7 8-30g (c) and (d) and, accordingly, conclude that the trial court properly reversed the defendant\u2019s decision and granted the plaintiff\u2019s application.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In this opinion Peters, C.

The trial court correctly noted, however, that pursuant to <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>158 Conn. 208, 214, 257 A.2d 795 (1969), \u201cnone of these individual reasons [were] available to show the grounds for the [defendant\u2019s] decision.\u201d The trial court further stated, that, even if the reasons had constituted a formal collective statement, the defendant had failed to meet its burden under \u00a7 8-30g (c) by proving that any one of the individual reasons outweighed the need for affordable housing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b538-8\"> Because we determine that the trial court did not conclude that General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g requires the defendant collectively to state its reasons for its decision, we leave for another day the issue of whether the statute compels the defendant to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b539-6\"> The defendant\u2019s motion, stated by Town Council Vice President Larry Price, was as follows: \u201cI move that we adopt the change in zone from R-13 to RM-4 and apply a special development district for property at 2561 Albany Avenue and find that the plan is in harmony with the overall objective of the comprehensive plan, superior to a plan possible under regular standards and in harmony with the actual and permitted development of adjacent properties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b541-6\"> The trial court never explicitly found that the defendant\u2019s decision to deny the plaintiff\u2019s application was \u201cnecessary to protect the public interests in health, safety, or other matters which the commission may legally consider.\u201d It is, however, implicit in its progression to the third prong of the statute to reach the balancing required for General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (c) (3), that the trial court first determined that the defendant\u2019s stated concerns about size and density comprised substantial public interests, in satisfaction of \u00a7 8-30g (c) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b541-7\"> In August, 1991, the month the defendant acted on the instant application, West Hartford had approximately 1500 housing units that met the statutory definition of affordable housing, comprising approximately 6 percent of the total housing units in the town.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b542-6\"> The efforts to which the defendant points include: (1) the allocation of community development block grant funds to assist in the rehabilitation of affordable houses; (2) the provision of funds for conversion of two-family to three-family homes with long-term affordability constraints; (3) the development of a housing trust fund and zoning ordinance amendments initiated by the West Hartford Housing Partnership; (4) the development of a sizeable, affordable housing project on West Hartford town property; (4) general initiatives of the West Hartford Housing Authority; and (5) the approval of a zone change in the Brace-Dale Road area for another affordable housing project proposed by the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b543-4\"> As a corollary to its claim, the defendant also argues that by citing to the Blue Ribbon Commission\u2019s report the trial court ignored the specific affordable housing needs of West Hartford and improperly focused on \u201cregional\u201d and statewide figures in assessing that need. The defendant urges that the trial court should have assessed need on the basis of local figures. The defendant points to the legislative history of General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g as reflecting the legislative intent to abandon a regional focus; see 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 30,1989 Sess., p. 10574, remarks of Representative Richard Tulisano; and to \u201cmake very clear that it is the municipality\u2019s responsibility to care for the housing needs of its citizens and not some broader community.\u201d See 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 30, 1989 Sess., p. 10623, remarks of Representative William Cibes. On the other hand, a local focus could severely undermine the development of low income housing because wealthy towns could claim that they have few low income residents, and consequently have little or no local need for low income housing. In addition, as the amicus brief points out, the defendant\u2019s proposed interpretation of the statute, requiring an empirical analysis of need limited to the particular locality, could undermine its effectiveness in the future by inviting litigation over an ancillary, complex factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"A9ky\">We decline to reach this issue. The record, however, reveals, and the defendant does not dispute, that West Hartford at all material times had 1500 units of \u201caffordable housing\u201d under the governing statutory definition, reflecting only 6 percent of its total housing. This percentage falls far below the 10 percent figure needed for West Hartford to qualify under the statutory exemption of \u00a7 8-30g (f). Thus, sufficient evidence of local need existed in the record before the trial court to demonstrate a local deficiency of affordable housing upon which the trial court could have relied in balancing the need for affordable housing with the defendant\u2019s concerns over size and density. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s reliance on regional figures did not affect the outcome of its decision. We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s argument and leave for another day the issue of whether, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>\u00a7 8-30g (c), the need for affordable housing should be assessed on a regional or local basis, or assessed generically in the manner that other balancing tests in our law have been analyzed. See, e.g., <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 527,104 S. Ct. 3194, 82 L. Ed. 2d 393 (1984) (balancing society\u2019s interest in security of penal institutions against prisoner\u2019s interest in privacy within cell without actually undertaking a quantitative, empirical analysis of the respective interests).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b544-7\"> Because General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (a) (1) is written in the disjunctive, we acknowledge that the plaintiff need have satisfied only one test.

This argument, however, is wholly without merit. Contrary to what the defendant claims, the trial court\u2019s decision merely concluded that there was no requirement that the plaintiff submit a revised application to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Berdon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AiH\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"AcT\">In this case of first impression concerning General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (Affordable Housing Act), I agree with the result reached and with most of the majority\u2019s analysis. I write separately only to discuss an issue that the majority concludes it is not required to reach\u2014that is, how the \u201cneed for affordable housing\u201d under \u00a7 8-30g (c) (3)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> should be defined. Defining \u201cneed\u201d is critical to determining whether the defendant town council of the town of West Hartford failed to prove that its identified public interests clearly outweigh the need for affordable housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">I agree with the majority and the trial court that the size and density of the project proposed by the plaintiff, the West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc., are the primary concerns that the defendant expressed in rejecting the project. I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s conclusion in footnote 23 of its opinion that it is not necessary to define \u201cneed\u201d in order to determine whether these concerns outweigh the need for affordable housing pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g (c) (3). The footnote states that it is unnecessary to define \u201cneed\u201d because only 6 percent of West Hartford\u2019s housing is \u201caffordable,\u201d and this is far below the 10 percent required for exemption from the requirements of the Affordable Housing Act under \u00a7 8-30g (f).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>the majority concludes that the defendant did not sustain its burden of proof. There is nothing, however, in the language of the Affordable Housing Act or in its legislative history to suggest that the legislature intended that the 10 percent needed for exemption should be used as a measuring stick in determining whether the town\u2019s interests outweigh the need for affordable housing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, the majority does not advance such a theory, but rather utilizes the 10 percent figure as a convenient means of avoiding the issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">I believe that the failure to define \u201cneed\u201d will cause needless confusion. Furthermore, there are several important reasons why this court should define \u201cneed.\u201d As the majority opinion indicates, what constitutes need under \u00a7 8-30g (c) (3) was clearly raised by the parties. In addition, this issue is an important factor in determining whether the interests that a town advances are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>sufficient to defeat an affordable housing project. Because this issue is squarely before us, it is important that we reach it not only for this case, but also for all the other affordable housing projects that are or will be proposed. Our trial courts and local planning and zoning commissions need to know how to determine whether the public concerns asserted by a town are sufficient to reject an application. Finally, the confusion as to the meaning of \u201cneed\u201d that exists among members of the bar; E. Lyons &amp; M. Lyons, \u201cConnecticut Crosses The Line: The Affordable Housing Appeals Act,\u201d 65 Conn. B.J. 281, 289 (1991); and legal scholars; 9 Connecticut Practice\u2014Land Use Law and Practice (1993 R. Fuller) p. 834; underscores the need for a definition from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The Affordable Housing Act was recommended to the legislature by the February 1, 1989 report of the legislatively created Blue Ribbon Commission on Housing<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (commission report). The commission report concludes, on the basis of a survey,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that there is an enormous statewide deficiency of 181,535 affordable housing units. No one disputes this finding. The defendant argues, however, that, in reviewing the denial of the plaintiffs application, the trial court should have weighed West Hartford\u2019s <em>local </em>need for affordable housing against its public interests. Instead, the trial court weighed the public interests of the town against the need for affordable housing generally as established by the commission report. For the several reasons set forth below, I believe that in sustaining the plaintiffs appeal, the trial court correctly weighed the public interests of the town against the generalized need for affordable housing that exists statewide.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>The legislature could easily have added the necessary words \u201cof the town\u201d after \u201cneed\u201d if it had intended that need was to be limited to the town\u2019s requirements for affordable housing. \u201cIf the legislature had really intended . . . this . . . we think it would have found a way to express that intent quite clearly.\u201d <em>Lee Bros. Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Cram, </em>63 Conn. 433, 439, 28 A. 540 (1893). \u201cThe intention of the legislature is found not in what it meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say.\u201d <em>Colli </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>169 Conn. 445, 452, 364 A.2d 167 (1975). This generic use of the noun \u201cneed,\u201d without any qualification, was meant to encompass not just the need of the local community, but also the generalized need for affordable housing statewide.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Furthermore, it is clear to me that because the legislature adopted the Affordable Housing Act in response to the commission\u2019s report, it took into consideration all the concerns, findings and conclusions of the commission. \u201cWhere ... a report of a special commission or committee to the governor or General Assembly is presented to it, we consider it upon the assumption that its contents are generally known to the members of that body, at least in determining the general intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pettigrew </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>135 Conn. 228, 233-34, 63 A.2d 154 (1948). Surely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>shelter for those people across the state and within each region who are eligible for affordable housing was an important consideration. The commission pointed out that \u201c[throughout the period of our deliberations, the housing crisis continued to threaten the welfare of our citizens and the economic prosperity of our business community. We believe that, if the recommendations made by the Commission are adopted, great progress can be made in producing new affordable housing, preserving existing affordable housing, preventing homelessness, and planning land use strategies that benefit all our citizens.\u201d I agree with the majority that \u201ca local focus could severely undermine the development of low income housing because wealthy towns could claim that they have few low income residents, and consequently have little or no local need for low income housing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The commission\u2019s concerns, however, also extend to other matters that take on a statewide perspective and compel the conclusion that \u00a7 8-30g (c) (3) has reference to the need for affordable housing for <em>all </em>the people of Connecticut.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The commission recognized that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>availability and location of affordable housing have an effect on racial and economic integration. After reviewing significant judicial decisions; e.g., <em>Huntington Branch, NAACP </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>844 F.2d 926 (2d Cir.), aff'd, 488 U.S. 15, 109 S. Ct. 276, 102 L. Ed. 2d 180 (1988), reh. denied, 488 U.S. 1023, 109 S. Ct. 824, 102 L. Ed. 2d 813 (1989); the commission expressed concern that \u201ccertain patterns of housing related land use regulatory decisions reflect (conscious or unconscious) patterns of economic and/or racial discrimination.\u201d If local housing requirements alone are to be considered in determining whether the public interests of a town outweigh the need for affordable housing, the beneficent goals of racial and economic integration through housing will be undermined. \u201cIn determining the true meaning of a statute when there is genuine uncertainty as to how it should apply, identifying the problem in society to which the legislature addressed itself by examining the legislative history of the statute under litigation is helpful.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>180 Conn. 557, 562, 429 A.2d 960 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Finally, the expeditious processing of the applicants\u2019 appeals by the trial court was high on the legislature\u2019s agenda when it enacted the Affordable Housing Act. The legislature directed the judiciary as follows: \u201cAppeals taken pursuant to [the Affordable Housing Act] shall be privileged cases to be heard by the court as soon after the return day as is practicable.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (b). Saddling the trial court with what could be a long, drawn out and complex evidentiary hearing to determine whether a particular town has a need for affordable housing at the time the application is filed would be counterproductive. For example, to determine the need of the individual town would require that the trial court determine the number of such units required not only for those who are living in the town at the time of the application, but also for those who desire to move into the town but cannot because of the lack of such housing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, in view of this legislative concern, it cannot reasonably be said that the legislature wanted affordable housing to be predicated on the then existing individual needs of 169 towns. Rather, because the legislature had before it the commission report focusing on statewide needs, it obviously had in mind this generalized need for affordable housing in the state of Connecticut. \u201c[W]here a statute is capable of two constructions, one that is rational and effective in accomplishing the evident legislative object, and the other leading to \u2018bizarre results\u2019 destructive of that purpose, the former should prevail.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>206 Conn. 203, 210, 536 A.2d 583 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>In sum, I would find that \u201cneed\u201d has reference to the generalized statewide need for affordable housing as set forth in the commission report. Therefore, the trial court properly concluded, among other things, that the defendant was required to prove that the public interest\u2014in this case, the size and density of the project\u2014outweighed the generalized <em>statewide </em>need for affordable housing. Accordingly, I concur in the result reached by the majority.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-5\"> In this appeal under the Affordable Housing Act, the defendant town of West Hartford has the burden of proving that: \u201c(1) the decision from which such appeal is taken and the reasons cited for such decision are supported by sufficient evidence in the record; (2) the decision is necessary to protect substantial public interests in health, safety, or other matters which the commission may legally consider; (3) such public interests clearly outweigh the need for affordable housing; and (4) such public interests cannot be protected by reasonable changes to the affordable housing development.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (f) provides in relevant part: \u201c[T]he affordable housing appeals procedure established under this section shall not be available if the real property which is the subject of the application is located in a municipality in which at least ten per cent of all dwelling units in the municipality are (1) assisted housing or (2) currently financed by Connect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>icut Housing Finance Authority mortgages or (3) subject to deeds containing covenants or restrictions which require that such dwelling units be sold or rented at, or below, prices which will preserve the units as affordable housing, as defined in section 8-39a, for persons and families whose income is less than or equal to eighty per cent of the area median income. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\"> I also find the comparison confusing. As I understand it, the 1500 units of affordable housing (which is 6 percent of total housing) that West Hartford now has is affordable housing as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (a) (1). See footnote 2 of the majority opinion. This figure, which does not include units that are financed by Connecticut Housing Finance Authority (CHFA) mortgages, is being compared with the 10 percent exemption provided in \u00a7 8-30g (f), which would include houses financed by CHFA. See footnote 2. Thus, in determining whether the public interests outweigh the need for affordable housing in this case, the majority compares apples with oranges. For all we know on the record before us, West Hartford may in fact meet the 10 percent requirement of \u00a7 8-30g (f) if CHFA loans are included.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Furthermore, it is for the trial court, at least in the first instance, to make the determination of whether the defendant has met its burden of proving that the public interests outweigh the need for affordable housing. In making this determination, the trial court did not equate \u201cneed\u201d with the 10 percent required for exemption, but rather considered the generalized need for affordable housing on a statewide basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b552-5\"><em> </em>See Public Acts 1987, No. 87-550, \u00a7 4 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b552-6\"> In 1987, the state office of policy and management contracted with each of the state\u2019s fifteen regional planning agencies to conduct a regional housing needs assessment.

I realize that the debates of the legislators are relevant in determining legislative intent. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Wethersfield, </em>165 Conn. 211, 223-24, 332 A.2d 83 (1973). \u201cNonetheless, we approach our attempt to glean the legislative intent from the floor debates with caution and circumspection because we recognize that legislative discussions may only be expressive of the views and motives of individual members and may not be a safe guide to views of the law-making body.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 9, 434 A.2d 293 (1980). In the present case, these suggestions that a local focus may have been intended are not controlling because such a construction would defeat the underlying purposes of the act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b554-5\"> The facts that the legislature provided exemptions from the act if a town achieves certain affordable housing goals, and that the exemptions are uniform for every town, reinforce the conclusion that the act has a statewide focus. For example, a municipality is exempt from the provisions of the Affordable Housing Act for a period of one year after certification by the commissioner of housing that it has completed an initial eligible housing development pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-386. General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (g). Section 8-386 (a) provides as follows: \u201cUpon submission of the initial report of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Housing pursuant to subsection (a) of section 4 of public act 87-550, the secretary of the office of policy and management, in consultation with the commissioner of housing, shall establish a pilot program in two planning regions of the state, as designated under the provisions of section 16a-4a, for the development, through the process of a negotiated investment strategy, <em>of a regional fair housing compact to provide increased housing for low and moderate income families within </em>the regions. The choice of the regions for such pilot program shall be based on the findings contained in the initial report of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Housing. The pilot program shall provide for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>a series of negotiations to be conducted by a mediator with the secretary of the office of policy and management, or his designee, the commissioner of housing, or his designee, and the officers of the regional planning agency or agencies within the chosen regions, or their designees and a representative of each municipality within such planning regions, appointed by the chief executive officer of such municipality. <em>Such negotiations shall be conducted for the purpose of formulating and reaching consensus on a fair housing compact containing regional goals for the development of adequate, affordable housing based on the need for such homing in the regions as balanced against environmental, economic, transportation and infrastructure concerns, and the time frames for achieving such goals. </em>The secretary shall contract with an independent consultant to serve as mediator in such negotiations. Upon the successful negotiation of such regional fair housing compact, the terms of the compact shall be submitted to the regional planning agency or agencies for incorporation into the regional plan or plans of development, as provided under section 8-35a, and shall be transmitted to the chief executive officers of the municipalities located within the planning regions for approval by the municipalities. Such compact shall not be included in the regional plan or plans of development until sixty-five per cent of the legislative bodies located within the planning regions have given such approval.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b556-4\"> The need of the town for affordable housing under any circumstances cannot be judged solely on the basis of the people already living in the municipality. \u201cNo person should be restricted in the right to obtain decent housing in any town, whether it be in towns as far west as Greenwich or as far east as Stonington.\u201d <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Papandrea, </em>222 Conn. 414, 442, 610 A.2d 637 (1992) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
