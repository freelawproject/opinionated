J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWQ\">In this tax appeal, the sole issue is whether, in light of the limitations on the state taxing power imposed by \u00a7 101 (a) of Public Law 86-272, 73 Stat. 555 (1959), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 381,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the state of Connecticut has the authority to levy a corporation business tax pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-214 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>12-218<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the intrastate activities of the plaintiffs, The Kelly-Springfield Tire Company and Lee Tire and Rubber Company (taxpayers). After the defendant, Edward J. Bajorski, acting commissioner of revenue services of the state of Connecticut (commissioner), denied their respective requests for correction and refund of the taxes assessed against them, the taxpayers appealed to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-237. The trial court dismissed the taxpayers\u2019 appeals. The taxpayers then filed a joint appeal to the Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Court, which we transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The stipulations that furnish the entire factual basis for this appeal, as set out in the record, reveal the following. Each taxpayer is a multistate corporation that, during the relevant tax years, had registered with the secretary of the state to transact business in this state. The principal business of each taxpayer is the sale of motor vehicle and truck tires to dealers throughout the United States. Neither taxpayer maintained any inventory in this state. Neither taxpayer owned any real property in this state.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In this state, the business operations of the taxpayers were principally carried out through the services of one or more local sales representatives<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> whose only authority was the solicitation of orders from tire dealers. After orders had been solicited, out-of-state personnel approved or rejected the orders, arranged for shipments from out-of-state facilities and received payments for shipments. In the event of disputes about the tire shipments, the local sales representative\u2019s responsibility was limited to providing information to the local dealer about the location of appropriate out-of-state contact points. Personnel at out-of-state facilities managed the receipt and storage of allegedly defective merchandise and arranged for the appropriate rectification of local dealer accounts. The local sales representative\u2019s responsibility for credit was similarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>limited to an information function. Personnel at out-of-state facilities similarly monitored the credit status of local dealers and arranged for the collection of delinquent accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Apart from their sales representatives, the taxpayers\u2019 only other operational presence in this state consisted of annual visits of their credit managers. Each taxpayer had one credit manager who personally called on all Connecticut accounts once each year, whether or not such accounts were delinquent. The stipulations do not indicate how many accounts each credit manager visited.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Relying on the taxpayers\u2019 registration to do business and on the annual presence of their credit managers, the commissioner issued notices of assessment to the taxpayers pursuant to the Connecticut corporation business tax; General Statutes \u00a7 12-214; computed in accordance with \u00a7 12-218. The trial court agreed with the commissioner that both of the taxpayers were subject to taxation in Connecticut because they had engaged in business activities in this state that were not entirely ancillary to the solicitation of orders and were not de minimis. In their appeal to this court, the taxpayers challenge the validity of these conclusions. We disagree with the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Two fundamental principles govern these tax appeals. First, pursuant to \u00a7 12-237, taxpayers who challenge the validity of tax assessments under \u00a7\u00a7 12-214 and 12-218 are entitled to plenary judicial review of their tax liability. <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>202 Conn. 583, 588, 522 A.2d 771 (1987); <em>Schlumberger Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>202 Conn. 412, 421, 521 A.2d 569 (1987); <em>Xerox Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>175 Conn. 301, 303, 397 A.2d 1367 (1978). Second, ambiguities in the language or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>applicability of statutes governing tax liability are resolved in favor of taxpayers if the issue is the authority to impose a tax, and in favor of the tax commissioner if the issue is the right to a deduction or exemption. <em>Altray Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>224 Conn. 426, 432, 619 A.2d 443 (1993); <em>Morton Buildings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Banrum, </em>222 Conn. 49, 54, 607 A.2d 424 (1992); <em>The B. F. Goodrich Co. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>196 Conn. 1, 6, 490 A.2d 991 (1985); <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>161 Conn. 145, 154, 285 A.2d 352 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In this case, the parties do not disagree about the applicability of the first principle. With respect to the second principle, however, the taxpayers contend that they are challenging the state\u2019s authority to impose a tax, while the commissioner contends that the taxpayers should be deemed to be pursuing rights to a tax exemption. We agree with the taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The tax that is at issue is the Connecticut corporation business tax; General Statutes c. 208; which is \u201cin the nature of an excise tax levied against domestic and foreign corporations alike, for the privilege of doing business in a corporate capacity within this State. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>178 Conn. 243, 247, 423 A.2d 883 (1979). Section 12-214 (a), which imposes the corporation business tax, provides that the tax is \u201cto be measured by the entire net income . . . from business transacted within the state during the income year,\u201d while \u00a7 12-218 provides a measure to determine the taxable net income of multistate corporations to be apportioned to this state. <em>Altray Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>supra, 432-33; <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>supra, 589-91; <em>Schlumberger Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 415-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>We recently considered the proper characterization of issues concerning the scope of taxpayer liability under \u00a7\u00a7 12-214 and 12-218. In <em>Altray Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>supra, a New York corporation having its primary place of business in Connecticut claimed that it had engaged in sufficient activity in New York to satisfy the \u201cconducts business\u201d requirement of \u00a7 12-218, thereby qualifying the corporation for an apportionment of its taxable income between Connecticut and New York. We agreed with the taxpayer that \u00a7 12-218 involves the imposition of a tax, and, therefore, that any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer and against the tax commissioner. Id., 432. In arriving at this conclusion, we expressly rejected the tax commissioner\u2019s contention that a claim relating to a taxpayer\u2019s qualification for apportionment of net income under \u00a7 12-218 should be treated as a claim for a tax exemption. Id., 433-34. We noted, furthermore, that the apportionment of the net income of a multistate taxpayer to Connecticut reflected established constraints on the state\u2019s taxing power that derive from constraints imposed by the commerce and the due process clauses of the federal constitution. Id., 434; see <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes of Vermont, </em>445 U.S. 425, 436-37,100 S. Ct. 1223, 63 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1980) (due process clause); <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>430 U.S. 274, 279, 97 S. Ct. 1076, 51 L. Ed. 2d 326, reh. denied, 430 U.S. 976, 97 S. Ct. 1669, 52 L. Ed. 2d 371 (1977) (commerce clause). <em>Altray Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>supra, establishes, therefore, that the taxpayers\u2019 claims in this case must be examined with the understanding that \u00a7\u00a7 12-214 and 12-218 are statutes that impose a tax on multistate taxpayers rather than statutes that provide an exemption for multistate taxpayers. Viewed from this perspective, any ambiguities in the applicability of the statutes in light of the available factual record must be construed in favor of the taxpayers and against the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>This rule of construction applies not only to the apportionment to this state of the intrastate income of multistate taxpayers but also to limitations on the taxability of multistate taxpayers that derive from federal statutes determining the authority of the state to impose a tax on such taxpayers. Public Law 86-272,15 U.S.C. \u00a7 381 is such a statute. Section 381 is entitled \u201cImposition of net income tax.\u201d It defines and delimits the circumstances under which a state has the authority to consider a multistate taxpayer to be engaged in a \u201cbusiness activity\u201d for state tax purposes. Read conjointly, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 381 and \u00a7\u00a7 12-214 and 12-218 are tax imposition statutes that must be construed accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The taxpayers maintain that the state did not have the authority to impose a corporation business tax on their net income in this state because their Connecticut activities are protected from state tax by the terms of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 381. Subsection (a) (1) of \u00a7 381 prohibits the imposition of state net income taxes on interstate corporations whose only intrastate activity is \u201cthe solicitation of orders ... in such State for sales of tangible personal property, which orders are sent outside the State for approval or rejection, and, if approved, are filled by shipment or delivery from a point outside the State . . . .\u201d The commissioner claims, and the trial court concluded, that \u00a7 381 did not apply in the circumstances of these taxpayers because, in addition to their solicitation of orders in Connecticut, the taxpayers had also elected: (1) to qualify for doing business in this state; and (2) to have their credit managers undertake annual visits to each of the taxpayers\u2019 accounts in this state. The question before us is whether these additional in-state activities are sufficient to permit Connecticut to impose the corporation business tax on these taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Federal law determines the extent to which \u00a7 381 limits the authority of this state to levy a corporation business tax on interstate corporations. In <em>Wisconsin Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>Wrigley, </em>505 U.S. ,112 S. Ct. 2447, 120 L. Ed. 2d 174 (1992), the Supreme Court of the United States recently reviewed the history and the scope of this section. The court noted that \u00a7 381 establishes \u201ca 'minimum standard\u2019 for imposition of a state net-income tax based on solicitation of interstate sales . . . .\u201d Id., 2453. The court rejected the suggestion that \u00a7 381 should be construed so narrowly that \u201cthe solicitation of orders\u201d would encompass \u201conly the actual requests for purchases or, at most, the actions absolutely essential to making those requests.\u201d Id., 2455. The court also rejected, however, the suggestion that \u00a7 381 should be construed so broadly as to \u201ctreat as solicitation of orders any activities that are ordinary and necessary business activities accompanying the solicitation process . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The court chose instead a middle ground that would consider as solicitation of orders \u201cthose activities that are <em>entirely ancillary </em>to requests for purchases\u2014those that serve no independent business function apart from their connection to the soliciting of orders . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 2456. Applying this standard, the court concluded that providing a car and a stock of free samples to sales personnel is part of the \u201csolicitation of orders,\u201d but that the employment of sales personnel to repair or service the company\u2019s products, or the maintenance of an in-state office, is not part of the \u201csolicitation of orders.\u201d Id., 2457.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In the circumstances of this case, <em>Wrigley </em>counsels that the in-state visits by the taxpayers\u2019 credit managers to in-state dealers do not constitute the \u201csolicitation of orders.\u201d Like repairs and servicing, proper credit practices to monitor the collectibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>payments due from dealers as a result of in-state solicitations are not themselves ancillary to \u201crequests for purchases,\u201d as the trial court properly concluded. The fact that credit supervision in this state was carried out by personnel other than the taxpayers\u2019 in-state sales representatives only underscores this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\"><em>Wrigley </em>holds, however, that \u00a7 381 does not automatically authorize state taxation of a company engaged in limited in-state business activities that are not ancillary to the \u201csolicitation of orders.\u201d If such in-state activities are de minimis, that is, if they establish only a trivial connection with the taxing state, \u00a7 381 continues to provide net income tax immunity. Id., 2457-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The difficulty in applying the de minimis test to the facts of this case arises out of the sparsity of the factual record. As noted previously, the parties have stipulated that each taxpayer sent a credit manager into this state for an annual visit with each of its dealers, whether or not those dealers were delinquent in their accounts. We do not know, however, how long these annual visits were, how many dealers were visited, or the extent to which credit information gleaned from the annual visits was made available to the in-state sales representatives to facilitate their solicitation of sales on behalf of the taxpayers. The responsibility for this factual lacuna rests with the commissioner. In accordance with the governing principles described in part I of this opinion, the commissioner has failed to establish that the taxpayers\u2019 activities in this state were more than de minimis.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The commissioner\u2019s position is not strengthened by the taxpayers\u2019 decision to qualify to do business in this state. Section 381 (b) (1) expressly permits a state to impose a net income tax on corporate taxpayers whose only in-state activities are the solicitation of orders if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>such taxpayers are \u201cincorporated under the laws of such State . . . .\u2019\u2019Asa matter of statutory construction, it would make no sense to ascribe the same significance to the act of qualifying to do business.
