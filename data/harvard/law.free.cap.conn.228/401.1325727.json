J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnAL\">The sole issue in this appeal is whether our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applies to an out-of-state nonresident employee of an out-of-state employer who sustains an employment-related injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>as a result of an accident in Connecticut. In considering this issue, we must decide whether to revisit and overrule our recent decision in <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>U.S. Printing Ink, Inc., </em>218 Conn. 181, 588 A.2d 194 (1991). The defendant Second Injury and Compensation Assurance Fund (Fund) appealed to the Appellate Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the decision of the compensation review division (review division) that affirmed the finding and award of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner (commissioner) on the plaintiff\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the decision of the review division.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The relevant facts are as follows. The plaintiff was a truck driver whose residence was in North Carolina. He was employed by the defendant Glenn Howard, doing business as Southland Distributors, a North Carolina company having an office in North Carolina but not in Connecticut. The plaintiff\u2019s duties as a truck operator required him to pick up and deliver produce in numerous states and Canada. The employer did not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In January, 1983, while in the course of his employment and operating a truck owned by his employer, the plaintiff was involved in an accident on Route 1-95 in Stratford as he was approaching a toll booth. As a result of the accident, the plaintiff sustained serious injuries and was hospitalized, first in Bridgeport and then in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>The plaintiff filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim in Connecticut.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commissioner found that the plaintiff had suffered a total temporary disability for more than one year, had permanent significant scarring of his body, and had sustained some permanent partial disability. The commissioner, thus, ordered the Fund to pay various allowed medical bills, temporary total disability benefits, specific benefits for various scars on the plaintiff\u2019s body and specific permanent disability benefits for injuries causally connected to the motor vehicle accident as determined at a future hearing upon the request of either party. Implicit within the commissioner\u2019s finding and award was the conclusion that the commissioner had jurisdiction over the claim of the plaintiff for his injuries while in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The Fund appealed the finding and award to the review division, asserting that the commissioner had improperly determined that he had jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s claim and had improperly denied the Fund\u2019s motion to correct various paragraphs of the finding and award.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The review division affirmed the finding and award of the commissioner, stating that, \u201c[i]n the instant matter there is no question that Connecticut is the place where the injury occurred. Thus, under the principles of stare decisis we are bound to follow <em>Cleveland.\u201d </em>Under <em>Cleveland, </em>the commissioner had jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s claim because the plaintiff\u2019s injury had occurred in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>On appeal, the Fund contends that the review division improperly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that he had jurisdiction in the circumstances of this case. The Fund emphasizes that the plaintiff was a North Carolina truck driver, who simply happened to be injured in Connecticut although he worked for a North Carolina employer, who did not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree with the Fund\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>U.S. Printing Ink, Inc., </em>supra, we directly addressed the question of the applicability of Connecticut\u2019s act to an out-of-state nonresident employee of an out-of-state employer who is injured in the course of employment while in Connecticut. After full briefing and argument, this court, en banc, held that \u201c[tjhe remedial purpose of our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act supports application of its provisions in cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>where an injured employee seeks an award of benefits and <em>Connecticut is the place of the injury, </em>the place of the employment contract or the place of the employment relation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 195. We see no reason to revisit this determination. Stare decisis, although not an end in itself, serves the important function of preserving stability and certainty in the law. Accordingly, \u201ca court should not overrule its earlier decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic require it. Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc., p. 226.\u201d <em>Herald Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>142 Conn. 53, 62, 111 A.2d 4 (1955); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>214 Conn. 378, 384-85, 572 A.2d 944 (1990); <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 307, 335-36, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990). This is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Our decision not to reexamine <em>Cleveland </em>is reinforced by legislative changes that will limit its precedential value in future cases. In its January, 1993 session, the General Assembly amended the act to exclude from the definition of employee \u201cany person who is not a resident of this state but is injured in this state during the course of his employment, unless such person (I) works for an employer who has a place of employment or a business facility located in this state at which such person spends at least fifty per cent of his employment time, or (II) works for an employer pursuant to an employment contract to be performed primarily in this state.\u201d Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228, \u00a7 1 (9) (B) (vi).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Jesse M. Frankl, commissioner and chairman of the workers\u2019 compensation commission, commented in legislative hearings on the significance of this change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>in the governor\u2019s proposal to amend the act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He informed the labor and public employees committee of the General Assembly that the proposal added \u201ca new provision that restricts nonresidents from receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits if they are employed by an out-of-state employer, or if the contract of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>employment is out-of-state, and that the only thing that occurs within the state is that they had an accident in the state. This would be an adoption of the minority opinion in the decision of <em>Cleveland </em>vs. <em>the United States Printing, </em>which is 218 Connecticut 181, also the decision known as the Clerk\u2019s decision. That was a 4 to 3 decision, and this provision would adopt the minority position which would enable us to exclude a mere passing through the state as a provision of receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Public Employees, 1993 Sess., pp. 1210-11. During the debate on the floor of the Senate, Senator Michael P. Meotti, explaining the provisions of the bill, stated that \u201c[t]he [workers\u2019 compensation] bill narrows compensability standards for . . . nonresidents.\u201d 36 S. Proc., Pt. 11,1993 Sess., p. 3934.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u201c[0]ur usual presumption [is] that, in enacting a statute, the legislature intended a change in existing law. . . . This presumption, like any other, may be rebutted by contrary evidence of the legislative intent in the particular case. An amendment which in effect construes and clarifies a prior statute must be accepted as the legislative declaration of the meaning of the original act.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>193 Conn. 506, 513-14, 479 A.2d 208 (1984); <em>Shortt </em>v. <em>New Milford Police Department, </em>212 Conn. 294, 303, 562 A.2d 7 (1989); <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>192 Conn. 353, 364 n.12, 472 A.2d 336 (1984). The statutory amendment of the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d and the pertinent legislative history, however, are not sufficient to rebut the usual presumption and to evince a clear intent on the part of the legislature to enact a clarification of, rather than a change in, Connecticut\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law. See <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Conn. 54, 66, 566 A.2d 670 (1989), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 898, 111 S. Ct. 251, 112 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that, until the 1993 amendment of the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in the act to exclude out-of-state nonresident employees of out-of-state employers who are injured in the state, the interpretation of the act that we announced in <em>Cleveland </em>was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The judgment of the review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">In this opinion Borden and F.X. Hennessy, Js., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Berdon, J., concurring. I concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-11\"> The Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Act can be found at chapter 568 of the General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 31-275 through 31-355a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\"><em> </em>General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 31-30lb provides: \u201cappeal of decision of compensation review division. Any party aggrieved by the decision of the compensation review division upon any question or questions of law arising in the proceedings may appeal the decision of the compensation review division to the appellate court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b426-6\"> The injury in this case occurred in January, 1983. We adhere to the date of injury rule as the applicable date for determining the rights and obligations as between parties in workers\u2019 compensation cases. <em>Iacomacci </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>209 Conn. 219, 222-23, 550 A.2d 640 (1988). Thus, the applicable statutes are those in effect at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s date of injury. Cf. <em>Chieppo </em>v. <em>Robert E. McMichael, Inc., </em>169 Conn. 646, 649-50, 363 A.2d 1085 (1975) (date of injury rule not applicable to changes in appellate procedure).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\"> The commissioner granted in part and denied in part the Fund\u2019s motion to correct the finding and award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b427-6\"> The Fund also asks this court to modify the commissioner\u2019s ruling with regard to the commissioner\u2019s denial of its motion to correct. The review division explicitly ruled on this issue. The relevant paragraphs in his decision that the commissioner refused to correct related to the plaintiff\u2019s contacts with Connecticut, the reason that he brought a claim in Connecticut, the custom and practice of the Connecticut treasurer\u2019s office in treating out-of-state employers with regard to the act, the mode of contribution to the Fund and the fact that the North Carolina workers\u2019 compensation act does not have an assurance component. Each of these paragraphs is important to the Fund\u2019s legal claim regarding jurisdiction. Since we decline to overrule our decision in <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>U.S. Printing Ink, Inc., </em>218 Conn. 181, 588 A.2d 194 (1991), the changes that the Fund seeks in its motion to correct would have no impact on the final disposition of this case. Therefore, the commissioner\u2019s ruling on the motion to correct must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Furthermore, we have stated that \u201cthe power and duty of determining the facts [in workers\u2019 compensation cases] rests on the commissioner, the trier of facts. . . .The conclusions drawn by him from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fair </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>207 Conn. 535, 539, 542 A.2d 1118 (1988). Under this strict standard of review, we find no reason to overturn the commissioner\u2019s findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\"> \u201cEmployee,\u201d as of the date of the plaintiffs injury, was defined as \u201cany person who has entered into or works under any contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer, whether such contract contemplated the performance of duties within or without the state or a sole proprietor or business partner who accepts the provisions of this chapter in accordance with subdivision (5) of this section, and shall include any person elected to serve as a member of the general assembly of this state and shall also include any salaried officer or paid member of any police department or fire department and any elected or appointed official or agent of any city, town or borough, upon vote of the proper authority of such city, town or borough, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>including such elected or appointed official or agent, in the state, irrespective of the manner in which he is appointed or employed, which provision shall not be construed as affecting any existing rights as to pensions which such persons or their dependents had on July 1,1927, or as preventing any existing custom of paying the full salary of any such person during disability due to injury arising in the course of and out of his employment or any volunteer police officer, whether such officer is designated as special or auxiliary, upon vote of the legislative body of the city, town or borough in which such officer serves; but said term shall not be construed to include: (A) An outworker; (B) one whose employment is of a casual nature, and who is employed otherwise than for the purposes of the employer\u2019s trade or business; (C) a member of the employer\u2019s family dwelling in his house; but, if in any contract of insurance the wages or salary of a member of the employer\u2019s family dwelling in his house is included in the payroll on which the premium is based, then such person shall, in the event of his sustaining an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment, be deemed an employee and compensated accordingly; (D) any person engaged in any type of service in or about a private dwelling provided he is not regularly employed by the owner or occupier over twenty-six hours per week; or (E) an employee of a corporation who is a corporate officer and who elects to be excluded from coverage under this chapter by notice in writing to his employer and to the commissioner having jurisdiction. For the purpose of determination of benefits payable under this chapter for death, disability or injury incurred by volunteer police officers, the average weekly wage of such officers shall be the average production wage in the state as determined by the labor commissioner under the provisions of section 31-309.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 31-275 (5).</p>\n<p id=\"ABF\">The definition was most recently amended in 1993 to provide \u201c(A) \u2018Employee\u2019 means any person who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atlc\">\u201c(i) Has entered into or works under any contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer, whether the contract contemplated the performance of duties within or without the state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiG\">\u201c(ii) Is a sole proprietor or business partner who accepts the provisions of this chapter in accordance with subsection (10) [the definition of employer] of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACL\">\u201c(iii) Is elected to serve as a member of the general assembly of this state; \u201c(iv) Is a salaried officer or paid member of any police department or fire department;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWo\">\u201c(v) Is a volunteer police officer, whether the officer is designated as special or auxiliary, upon vote of the legislative body of the town, city or borough in which the officer serves; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARqY\">\u201c(vi) Is an elected or appointed official or agent of any town, city or borough in the state, upon vote of the proper authority of the town, city or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>borough, including the elected or appointed official or agent, irrespective of the manner in which he is appointed or employed.

I write separately, however, to express my disagreement with the choice of laws principle adopted in <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>U.S. Printing Ink, Inc., </em>218 Conn. 181, 588 A.2d 194 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">I do not believe that the legislature intended that the Second Injury and Compensation Assurance Fund (Fund) be available to compensate an out-of-state nonresident employee of an out-of-state trucking company for injuries to the employee resulting from a motor vehicle accident in Connecticut. In such circumstances, the only basis for compensating the plaintiff from the Fund is the happenstance that the accident occurred in this state. Application of the sensible choice of laws approach suggested for workers\u2019 compensation cases by Justice Shea in his dissent in <em>Cleveland, </em>whereby we would apply the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the contract of employment rather than the law of the state in which the accident happened to occur; id., 195-97 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting); would have avoided the unintended result reached in <em>Cleveland. </em>Applying the choice of laws principle espoused by Justice Shea to this case, the plaintiff, a North Carolina resident employed by a North Carolina company, would be entitled to compensation in North <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Carolina, where he has also filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim, to the extent allowed by the laws of that state. He would not be eligible for compensation from this state\u2019s Second Injury and Compensation Assurance Fund\u2014a fund maintained through mandatory contributions from <em>Connecticut </em>employers\u2014because Connecticut is not the state with the greatest interest in the plaintiff\u2019s employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">It is not clear to me, moreover, that the scant legislative history of the 1993 amendment to the definition of the term \u201cemployee\u201d reflects the intent of the legislature to change, rather than to clarify, the statutory scheme. That definitional revision, part of a major overhaul of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes, drew only brief comment from two speakers, Senator Michael P. Meotti and Commissioner Jesse M. Frankl, chairman of the workers\u2019 compensation commission. Meotti\u2019s remarks on the proposed 1993 amendments included a single reference to the issue of recovery by nonresidents, without elaboration or discussion. See 36 S. Proc., Pt. 11,1993 Sess., p. 3934. Frankl, however, specifically noted that the proposed legislation adopted the position of the dissent in <em>Cleveland, </em>which, he concluded, more accurately reflected the legislative purpose underlying the Fund: \u201cWhat occurs in a situation like this is that individuals, the employer in these cases are out of state, and therefore the second injury fund would have to come into being. <em>And that\u2019s not the purpose of the second injury fund. It\u2019s to help pay for claims of Connecticut residents where the employer, for one reason or another, doesn\u2019t have workers\u2019 compensation insurance. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Public Employees, 1993 Sess., p. 1211. In my view, these comments, and the prompt legislative response to <em>Cleveland </em>in connection with the major revisions to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes, suggest that the legislature may well have disapproved our holding in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>I agree with the majority, however, that stare decisis serves \u201cthe cause of stability and certainty in the law\u2014a condition indispensable to any well-ordered system of jurisprudence . . <em>Herald Publishing Co. </em>v. Bill, 142 Conn. 53, 61-62, 111 A.2d 4 (1955); and that \u201c[t]he doctrine requires a clear showing that an established rule is incorrect <em>and harmful </em>before it is abandoned.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>White </em>v. Burns, 213 Conn. 307, 335, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990). Subsequent to the effective date of the 1993 amendment, an out-of-state nonresident employee of an out-of-state employer will not be eligible for compensation from the Fund, so that, as the majority points out, the precedential value of <em>Cleveland </em>has been severely limited. Moreover, consideration must be given to the fact that <em>Cleveland </em>was decided by this court sitting en banc. I concur, therefore, notwithstanding my disagreement with our holding in <em>Cleveland.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
