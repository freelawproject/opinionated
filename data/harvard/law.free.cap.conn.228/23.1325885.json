We answer both of these questions in the negative and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The following facts are undisputed. The plaintiff\u2019s property, located at 25 West Elm Street in Greenwich, is a six-story brick apartment building containing fifty-three units of living space and garage space for thirteen vehicles. On October 1, 1979, in connection with a decennial revaluation mandated by General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 12-62,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Greenwich tax assessor determined that the fair market value of the property was $3,296,300. This translated into an assessed value of $2,307,410 ($742,000 for the land and $1,565,410 for the building).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In 1983, the plaintiff<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> filed a two count complaint in the Superior Court challenging the assessment. In the first count, the plaintiff sought relief under \u00a7 12-118 from its 1979,1980 and 1981 tax assessments. In the second count, the plaintiff claimed, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>\u00a7 12-119, that the assessments were \u201cmanifestly excessive and could not have been arrived at except by disregarding the provisions of the statutes for determining the valuation of such property. . . .\u201d The trial court, <em>Hon. Raymond J. </em>Devlin, state trial referee, rendered judgment for the defendant on both counts. As to the first count, the court found that the plaintiff had not challenged the assessment before the defendant pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-111.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because a party may only appeal under \u00a7 12-118 from the action of a board of tax review, and the plaintiffs claim had never come before the defendant, the court rendered judgment for the defendant. With regard to the second count, the court found that the plaintiff had not met its burden of proof under \u00a7 12-119 and rendered judgment for the defendant on the merits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">In 1985, the plaintiff appealed the 1984 assessment of its property to the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 12-111. The defendant refused to grant relief. The plaintiff then filed a complaint in the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 12-118 challenging the defendant\u2019s denial of relief. In 1986, the plaintiff-amended its complaint to include a challenge to the 1985 and 1986 assessments of its property, and to add a second count directly challenging the assessments of its property pursuant to \u00a7 12-119.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant answered the complaint and raised the special defense of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In an October 12, 1988 motion for summary judgment, the defendant claimed that the 1984 decision by Judge Devlin on the \u00a7 12-119 claim precluded the plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 12-118 appeal under principles of collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>estoppel. On January 6, 1989, the court, <em>Ryan, J., </em>rejected the defendant\u2019s collateral estoppel argument because of the \u201cdistinction in the standard of review between \u00a7 12-118 and \u00a7 12-119.\u201d The court therefore denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to the first count of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant subsequently amended its answer to assert collateral estoppel as a special defense to the plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 12-118 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">After trial, the court, <em>Lewis, J., </em>rendered judgment for the plaintiff on its \u00a7 12-118 appeal. In its November 13, 1992 memorandum of decision, the trial court also rejected the defendant's collateral estoppel defense because of \u201cthe vast difference between \u00a7 [12-118] appeals and \u00a7 [12-119] law suits.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addressing the merits of the plaintiffs claim, the court found that there was no reasonable probability that the plaintiff\u2019s building would be converted to condominium use, and concluded, therefore, contrary to the claim of the defendant\u2019s appraiser, that the highest and best use of the plaintiff\u2019s property was its actual use as rental apartments. The court also found that the comparable sales method, the preferred method for valuing rental property under General Statutes \u00a7 12-63b,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>proper method of appraisal. The court accepted the opinion of the plaintiff\u2019s appraiser that the fair market value<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the property was $2,400,000, rather than $3,296,300. The plaintiff\u2019s appraiser arrived at this figure by comparing the plaintiff\u2019s property with three similar apartment houses that were sold in 1981.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court rejected the claim of the defendant\u2019s appraiser that the capitalization of income approach was the most appropriate method of valuation. The court held that the plaintiff was entitled to a refund or credit for any excess payments made to the town of Greenwich for the 1984 and subsequent tax years.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). The defendant claims that: (1) the plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 12-118 appeal should have been barred because Judge Devlin\u2019s 1984 decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>pursuant to \u00a7 12-119 \u201ccollaterally encompassed the criteria for determining fair market value under \u00a7 12-118\u201d; (2) the trial court improperly rejected the cost of replacement approach used by the Greenwich tax assessor to value the plaintiffs property; (3) the trial court incorrectly determined that conversion to condominiums was not the highest and best use of the plaintiffs property; and (4) the trial court\u2019s reliance on the report and testimony of the plaintiffs appraiser was clearly erroneous because that evidence conflicted with testimony given by the same appraiser in an earlier case. We reject all of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Because the defendant\u2019s collateral estoppel claim, if valid, would dispose of this appeal, we consider it first. The defendant claims that the trial court incorrectly determined that the plaintiff\u2019s appeal under \u00a7 12-118 was not collaterally estopped by Judge Devlin\u2019s earlier judgment under \u00a7 12-119. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">In <em>Second Stone Ridge Cooperative Corp. </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>220 Conn. 335, 339-40, 597 A.2d 326 (1991), we distinguished appeals brought pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 12-111 and 12-118 from direct actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 12-119. Sections 12-111 and 12-118 \u201c \u2018provide a method by which an owner of property may directly call in question the valuation placed by assessors upon his property by an appeal to the board of [tax review for] relief, and from it to the courts. . . . These statutes limit to a short period the time within which the property owner can seek relief under them, and the purpose of this is undoubtedly to prevent delays in the ultimate determination of the amounts a municipality can collect as taxes.\u2019 <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>130 Conn. 699, 702, 37 A.2d 237 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\u201cOn the other hand, \u00a7 12-119 allows a taxpayer one year to bring a claim that the tax was imposed by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>town that had no authority to tax the subject property, or that the assessment was \u2018manifestly excessive <em>and </em>could not have been arrived at except by disregarding the provisions of the statutes for determining the valuation of [the real] property . . . .\u2019 (Emphasis added.) Our case law makes clear that a claim that an assessment is \u2018excessive\u2019 is not enough to support an action under this statute. Instead, \u00a7 12-119 requires an allegation that something more than mere valuation is at issue. It is this element that distinguishes \u00a7 12-119 from its more frequently invoked companion, \u00a7 12-118.\u201d <em>Second Stone Ridge Cooperative Corp. </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra; see also <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>224 Conn. 110, 118, 617 A.2d 433 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The defendant acknowledges the distinctions between the two statutes and concedes that Judge Devlin in the 1984 case dismissed the plaintiffs \u00a7 12-118 appeal without reaching its merits. The defendant nevertheless argues that in deciding the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 12-119 claim, Judge Devlin did not limit his consideration to whether the assessment was manifestly excessive or arrived at in disregard of the statutory provisions governing property valuation; rather, he employed the standard of review applicable to \u00a7 12-118 appeals and considered whether the plaintiff\u2019s property had been substantially overvalued. Specifically, the defendant asserts that Judge Devlin\u2019s comments on the \u201cwide variance in the appraisal figure[s] submitted,\u201d and on his power to accept so much of the testimony of the appraisal experts as he found reasonable, indicate that he was considering issues beyond what is required for a \u00a7 12-119 claim. According to the defendant, these comments, coupled with citations to cases decided under \u00a7 12-118, demonstrate that Judge Devlin did not narrowly confine his consideration to whether there was misfeasance or nonfeasance by the taxing authority, or whether the assessment was arbitrary or so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>excessive or discriminatory as to demonstrate a disregard of duty by the assessors. The defendant claims that in deciding whether the assessment was manifestly excessive, Judge Devlin applied the rule of valuation from \u00a7 12-63, which applies to \u00a7 12-118 appeals as well as \u00a7 12-119 actions, and determined whether the assessment reflected the fair market value of the property. The defendant accordingly asserts that because Judge Devlin, in resolving the \u00a7 12-119 claim, incidentally decided valuation issues pertinent to a \u00a7 12-118 claim in favor of the defendant, the plaintiff should have been barred from relitigating these issues. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Res judicata and collateral estoppel \u201cexpress no more than the fundamental principle that once a matter has been fully and fairly litigated, and finally decided, it comes to rest.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>197 Conn. 436, 464-65, 497 A.2d 974 (1985), on appeal after remand sub nom. <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>213 Conn. 388, 567 A.2d 1221 (1990). \u201cCollateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is that aspect of res judicata which prohibits the relitigation of an issue when that issue was <em>actually litigated </em>and <em>necessarily determined </em>in a prior action between the same parties upon a different claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-DE), </em>190 Conn. 310, 316, 460 A.2d 1277 (1983). \u201c \u2018For an issue to be subject to collateral estoppel, it must have been <em>fully and fairly litigated in the first action. </em>It also must have been <em>actually decided </em>and the decision must have been <em>necessary </em>to the judgment.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Virgo </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>209 Conn. 497, 501, 551 A.2d 1243 (1988); see also <em>Ashe </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 443, 90 S. Ct. 1189, 25 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hope, </em>215 Conn. 570, 584, 577 A.2d 1000 (1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1089, 111 S. Ct. 968,112 L. Ed. 2d 1054 (1991). \u201cAn issue is <em>\u2018actually litigated\u2019 </em>if it is properly raised in the pleadings or otherwise, submitted for determination, and in fact determined. (Emphasis added.) 1 Restatement (Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ond), Judgments \u00a7 27, comment (d) (1982). An issue is <em>necessarily determined </em>if, \u2018in the absence of a determination of the issue, the judgment could not have been validly rendered.\u2019 F. James &amp; G. Hazard, Civil Procedure (3d Ed. 1985) \u00a7 11.19. If an issue has been determined, but the judgment is not dependent upon the determination of the issue, the parties may relitigate the issue in a subsequent action. Findings on nonessential issues usually have the characteristics of dicta. 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 27, comment (h) (1982).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>R. G. Whip</em>ple, <em>Inc., </em>225 Conn. 705, 714-15, 627 A.2d 374 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The defendant argues that because Judge Devlin used the criteria for determining the reasonableness of valuation under \u00a7 12-118 in his consideration of the plaintiffs direct action under \u00a7 12-119, those findings should have precluded the plaintiff from relitigating the claim. Both Judge Ryan, in ruling on the motion for summary judgment, and Judge Lewis, in trying the first count, rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that Judge Devlin\u2019s decision had collateral estoppel effect on this action, in light of the well recognized distinctions between the two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">There is another and more compelling reason why the defendant\u2019s argument must fail. Although it was essential to the decision of a \u00a7 12-119 claim for Judge Devlin to examine whether \u00a7 12-63 had been followed, he did not determine as part of his disposition of the \u00a7 12-119 claim what constituted the highest and best use of the property in 1979, a decision Judge Lewis was later called upon to make in connection with the \u00a7 12-118 appeal. In response to a motion to clarify his March 7,1984 decision, Judge Devlin stated that he had not specifically determined the highest and best use of the plaintiff\u2019s property, although it \u201cwas an element an appraiser was entitled to take into consideration in his determination of the fair market value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Consideration of the highest and best use has been recognized by this court as a valid part of any fair market value determination. Section 12-63<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> indicates that the standard for valuation is the property\u2019s \u201cpresent true and actual value,\u201d which is synonymous with \u201cmarket value, actual value, fair market value, market price and fair value . . . .\u201d <em>Uniroyal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>182 Conn. 619, 623 n.3, 438 A.2d 782 (1981). \u201cFair market value\u201d is defined as \u201cthe value that would be fixed in fair negotiations between a desirous buyer and a willing seller, neither under any undue compulsion to make a deal . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Uniroyal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>174 Conn. 380, 390, 389 A.2d 734 (1978). A further definition is found in <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>175 Conn. 576, 581-82, 402 A.2d 786 (1978), to the effect that fair market value \u201cis the price that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller based on the highest and best possible use of the land assuming, of course, that a market exists for such optimum use.\u201d See also <em>Whitney Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamden, 4 </em>Conn. App. 426, 428, 494 A.2d 624 (1985) (\u201c[a]n assessment of land at its fair value, of necessity, regardless of the method of valuation, takes into account the highest and best value of the land\u201d). As we said in <em>State National Bank </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>156 Conn. 99, 101, 239 A.2d 528 (1968), \u201c[t]he \u2018highest and best use\u2019 concept, chiefly employed as a starting point in estimating the value of real estate by appraisers, has to do with the use which will most likely produce the highest market value, greatest financial return, or the most profit from the use of a particular piece of real estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">We read Judge Devlin\u2019s decision to reflect approval of the assessor\u2019s use of \u00a7 12-63 as a means of assessment, and to hold merely that such consideration by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the assessor had not been inappropriate and did not result in a manifestly illegal appraisal. Therefore, although consideration of the assessor\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 12-63 had indeed been part of the court\u2019s decision as to whether the assessment was manifestly excessive or whether it had been arrived at in disregard of the statutes governing property valuation, Judge Devlin specifically refused to make auxiliary findings as to what actually constituted the highest and best use of the property in 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Regardless of whether Judge Devlin journeyed beyond what was essential for a determination of the \u00a7 12-119 claim, he did not make factual findings that would collaterally estop a later court from deciding the value of the property. The issue raised by the \u00a7 12-119 appeal was whether the relevant statutes had been properly applied by the assessor. On the other hand, the issue raised by the \u00a7 12-118 appeal concerned what actually constituted the fair market value of the property as ascertained by a decision about its highest and best use. The earlier decision, therefore, did not have any preclusive effect upon the later court\u2019s ability to decide the case before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court incorrectly determined, contrary to the decision of the defendant, that the plaintiff\u2019s property had been overvalued by the Greenwich tax assessor. More specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court: (1) improperly rejected the cost of replacement approach used by the Greenwich tax assessor to value the plaintiff\u2019s property; (2) incorrectly determined that conversion to condominiums was not the highest and best use of the plaintiff\u2019s property; and (3) improperly relied on the report and testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s appraiser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>because that evidence conflicted with testimony given by the same appraiser in an earlier case. We reject each of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">First, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly rejected the cost of replacement approach used by the Greenwich tax assessor to value the plaintiffs property. The defendant argues that because the plaintiff did not offer any direct evidence that the assessor\u2019s analysis was erroneous, the trial court should have given deference to the assessor\u2019s judgment and upheld the initial assessment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The trial court in a \u00a7 12-118 appeal hears the case de novo; <em>Stamford Apartments Co. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>203 Conn. 586, 588, 525 A.2d 1327 (1987); and has \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe right to accept so much of the testimony of the experts <em>and the recognized appraisal methods which they employed </em>as [it] finds applicable . . . \u2019 (Emphasis added.) <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>[181 Conn. 217, 221, 435 A.2d 24 (1980)], quoting <em>Greenfield Development Co. </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>172 Conn. 446, 451, 374 A.2d 1084 (1977).\u201d <em>Stamford Apartments Co. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 594.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cWhile we have recognized that proper deference should be accorded to the assessor\u2019s valuation ... no deference to the assessor's valuation [is] warranted\u201d when neither the assessor nor the appraiser who valued the property during the revaluation testifies at trial. Id., 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>It appears from the record that neither the assessor nor the person who appraised the plaintiffs property in 1979 testified before the trial court. The only evidence pointed to by the defendant concerning the methodology employed in the assessment is the assessor\u2019s card and the previously recorded testimony of Albert G. Kirk, who became the Greenwich assessor in December, 1979. Kirk testified that it appeared from the assessor\u2019s card that a cost of replacement approach had been used to value the plaintiff\u2019s property. He stated that he had no way of knowing, however, whether other approaches had even been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">In the absence of any evidence on why the assessor used the cost of replacement approach to value the plaintiff\u2019s property and how the values in the assessment were calculated, deference to the assessor\u2019s valuation was not required. Further, both Robert L. Levy, the plaintiff\u2019s appraiser, and Michael Gold, the defendant\u2019s appraiser, testified that the cost of replacement approach was the least valuable method of valuing the plaintiffs property. The Greenwich assessor at the time of trial, John P. Grecco, Jr., also testified that the cost of replacement approach was the worst method and the comparable sales approach was the best method of valuing an apartment building. It therefore was not improper for the trial court to reject the cost of replacement approach and the assessor\u2019s valuation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court incorrectly determined that conversion to condominiums was not the highest and best use of the plaintiffs property. The defendant argues that this determination was incorrect because: (1) the trial court relied on testimony offered by the plaintiff that, at the time of the revaluation in October, 1979, it had no intention of converting its apartment building into condominiums; and (2) the trial court\u2019s acceptance of Levy\u2019s comparable sales analysis, which was based on the assumption that the building would be converted to condominiums, is inconsistent with its determination. We reject these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The parties agree that, while property should be valued according to its highest and best use, the valuation of an apartment building may be based on its potential conversion to condominiums only if conversion is reasonably probable in the near future. See <em>Stamford Apartments Co. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 592. The highest and best use of a property and the reasonable probability of conversion are questions of fact for the trier of fact. Id., 592-93; see <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>221 Conn. 736, 748, 607 A.2d 402 (1992). We will not \u201csubstitute our evaluation of the evidence for that of the trial court . . . .\u201d <em>Stamford Apartments Co. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The defendant argues that the trial court relied on the plaintiff\u2019s subjective intent in determining whether conversion was reasonably probable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We disagree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>The court cited a number of factors, in addition to the plaintiffs intent, that contributed to its determination, including high conversion costs,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> weak demand for converted condominiums,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> a shortage of rental apartments,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and changes in legislative policy providing enhanced protection against eviction for the elderly.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> These findings are adequately supported by the record and therefore will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The defendant also argues that the trial court\u2019s finding that conversion was not reasonably probable is inconsistent with its acceptance of Levy\u2019s comparable sales analysis, because the analysis assumed conversion to condominiums. This argument is based on the fact that the three apartment buildings that Levy used in the analysis were all converted into condominiums. The trial court was aware of this implied inconsistency, and specifically noted that Levy\u2019s analysis favored the defendant to the extent that the comparable buildings had been converted, even though conversion was not probable at the plaintiff\u2019s building.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We have said that the \u201c \u2018process of estimating the value of property for taxation is, at best, one of approx<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>imation and judgment, and there is a margin for a difference of opinion.\u2019 <em>Burritt Mutual Savings Bank </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>146 Conn. 669, 675, 154 A.2d 608 (1959). \u2018There may be more ways than one of estimating the value of such . . . [property] for taxation.\u2019 <em>Bridgeport Brass Co. </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>102 Conn. 206, 212, 128 A.2d 413 (1925).\u201d <em>Second Stone Ridge Cooperative Corp. </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 342. In accepting Levy\u2019s analysis, the court relied in part upon General Statutes \u00a7 12-63b,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> which indicates that the comparable sales approach is the preferred method of valuing rental property. The court rejected the recommendation of Gold, the defendant\u2019s appraiser, whose capitalization of income analysis relied much more heavily on conversion to condominiums.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In light of \u00a7 12-63b and the evidence in the record, we conclude that the determination by the trial court that there was no reasonable probability of conversion to condominiums and the decision to accept the market value in accordance with Levy\u2019s analysis were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s reliance on the report and testimony of Levy, the plaintiffs appraiser, was clearly erroneous because that evidence conflicted with testimony given by Levy in an earlier case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Levy was the appraiser for the taxpayer in an earlier case, <em>Stamford Apartments Co. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra. In that case, Levy adjusted the results of his comparable sales analysis to reflect differences in interest rates on the revaluation date and on the sale dates of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>parable properties. The defendant claims that a similar adjustment in this case would increase Levy\u2019s appraisal of the plaintiff\u2019s property using the comparable sales method to more than $4,000,000. During cross-examination, Levy conceded that the adjustment would have this effect. He testified that he did not believe that an adjustment was warranted in this case, however, because the Greenwich market differed from the Stamford market.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We have long held that \u201c[t]he question of evaluating the credibility of the appraisers is for the trial court, not this court. <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>[supra, 220-21]; see also <em>Uniroyal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>[supra, 174 Conn. 387].\u201d <em>Stamford Apartments Co. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 592. This court \u201ccannot retry the facts or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>supra, 220. \u201c[W]here the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.\u201d Id., 221-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The trial court gave the defendant ample opportunity to challenge Levy\u2019s credibility. The defendant was permitted to cross-examine Levy extensively about the evidence he had given in the earlier case, and to introduce portions of that evidence as exhibits. In his November 13, 1992 memorandum of decision, Judge Lewis specifically stated, \u201cI find the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s appraiser to be credible.\u201d After reviewing the evidence in the record, we cannot say that that finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 12-118 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person . . . claiming to be aggrieved by the action of the board of tax review in any town or city may, within two months from the time of such action, make application, in the nature of an appeal therefrom, to the superior court for the judicial district in which such town or city is situated . . . .

After adjusting these figures to reflect date of sale and other differences between the three buildings, the appraiser arrived at an adjusted price per room of $8904, $13,382, and $13,205, respectively. The appraiser decided to use $13,000 as the estimated value per room of the plaintiffs building.
