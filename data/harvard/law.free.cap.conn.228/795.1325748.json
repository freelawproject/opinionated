The defendant, Albert Indrisano, was convicted, after a court trial, of disorderly conduct in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1) and (2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of conviction. The Appellate Court rejected the defendant\u2019s constitutional claims that the statute is vague on its face and as applied to him, on the grounds that the defendant had failed to raise these claims at trial and that the appellate record was inadequate to review them. <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>29 Conn. App. 283, 287, 613 A.2d 1375 (1992).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Appellate Court also rejected the defendant\u2019s nonconstitutional claims, namely, that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction, that the trial court had improperly rejected his claim of permissible use of force in defense of stolen property, and that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>had improperly excluded certain statements on grounds of hearsay. Id. Accordingly, the Appellate Court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issues: \u201c(1) Was the Appellate Court correct in concluding that the record was insufficient, pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233 [567 A.2d 823] (1989), to permit adequate appellate review of the defendant\u2019s claims that, on its face and as applied, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 was void for vagueness under the state and federal constitutions? (2) Is General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 void for vagueness on its face and as applied to this case, under the state and federal constitutions?\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>224 Conn. 914, 617 A.2d 168 (1992). We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The Appellate Court set forth the relevant facts: \u201cOn September 26,1988, David Andrews Printing [Andrews], a Norwalk business, entered into a lease agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>with the Eaton Financial Corporation [Eaton] of Massachusetts for the use of a copy machine. The agreement provided, inter alia, that Eaton, as lessor, retained the right to repossess the machine in the event that Andrews defaulted on the required payments. After Andrews compiled a history of delinquent payments, Eaton gave notice in January, 1991, that the Norwalk business was again late in making payment and demanded the return of the copier. Eaton then instructed the defendant [an employee] either to collect the outstanding debt or to repossess the machine. On January 22, 1991, the defendant traveled to Norwalk to carry out his instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">\u201cAndrews\u2019 office space included a common area shared with another tenant, Bonnie Orgovan. Andrews had placed the copy machine in this common area for its exclusive use. At 10 a.m., the defendant entered the common area and encountered Orgovan. He explained that he had come to collect the overdue payments or, alternatively, take possession of the copier. Gordon Anderson, also present in the common area, testified that the defendant entered the room waving a clipboard and that he was \u2018very strident.\u2019 Orgovan then explained to the defendant that the owners were unavailable but would return shortly. Orgovan resumed her work and left the defendant in the common area with Anderson and the copy machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">\u201cThe defendant then telephoned Eaton and, after receiving permission to repossess the machine, unplugged it and began dragging it backward toward the door. When Orgovan realized what the defendant was doing, she reentered the common area, demanding that he await the return of Andrews\u2019 owners. Moreover, she positioned herself between the defendant and the door, which she locked, to prevent him from leaving with the copier. At this point, the defendant exclaimed, \u2018God damn, I don\u2019t have to wait. God damn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>it!\u2019 Directing his attention to Anderson, the defendant said, \u2018You, old man, stay out of this.\u2019 Determined to leave, however, the defendant physically wedged Orgovan away from the door by using his shoulders and buttocks. As soon as this physical contact ensued, Anderson called the police and the confrontation immediately ceased. The entire incident lasted about ten minutes.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 284-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The trial court found that the defendant had been strident and impatient in his efforts to repossess the machine, and that he had refused reasonable requests to wait until the lessee arrived. The court also found that the defendant had used unreasonable physical force against Orgovan as he had tried to pull the machine through the door. Accordingly, the trial court concluded that the defendant had violated \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1) and (2). See footnote 2. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">We first address the question of the reviewability of the defendant\u2019s claim of unconstitutional vagueness. Because the claim was not raised at trial, it falls within the purview <em>of State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), which provides in part that a defendant cannot prevail on a constitutional claim unless the record is adequate to consider the claim. See footnote 3. The Appellate Court determined that the record was inadequate under the first prong of <em>Golding. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">To enable us to review a claim that a statute is facially vague, the record needs to reflect only the fact that the defendant was convicted under the statute in question. To enable us to review a claim that a statute is vague as applied, the record must further reflect the conduct that formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s conviction. The record is sufficient to enable us to perform both of these tasks. We therefore advance our analy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>sis to the third prong of <em>Golding, </em>namely, whether the defendant was deprived of his constitutional right to a fair trial because either \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1) or (2) is unconstitutionally vague on its face or as applied to the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The defendant claims that \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1) and (2) are unconstitutionally vague on their face and as applied to his conduct. We agree in part and disagree in part. We conclude that: (1) \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1) is not subject to facial attack and is not impermissibly vague as applied to the defendant\u2019s conduct; (2) \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (2), as it existed at the time of the defendant\u2019s conduct, was impermissibly vague on its face and, therefore, may not validly be applied to the defendant; and (3) it is nonetheless appropriate to apply interpretive gloss to \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (2) so as to render it sufficiently clear for future cases, and thus, preserve its constitutionality. Because the defendant\u2019s conviction rested on a subdivision of the statute that cannot validly be applied to him, however, we reverse the conviction and remand the case for a new trial under \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (l).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>Certain fundamental principles of constitutional vagueness jurisprudence govern our consideration of the defendant\u2019s claims. We note at the outset that, because this case involves a vagueness challenge pursuant to the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, rather than our state constitution; see footnote 4; we are bound by applicable United States Supreme Court precedents regarding the vagueness principle. We are not free to interpret the federal constitution so as to recognize greater rights than the United States Supreme Court has specifically refrained from recognizing. See <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Hass, </em>420 U.S. 714, 95 S. Ct. 1215, 43 L. Ed. 2d 570 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The purpose of the vagueness doctrine is twofold. The doctrine requires statutes to provide fair notice of the conduct to which they pertain and to establish minimum guidelines to govern law enforcement. The United States Supreme Court has set forth standards for evaluating vagueness. \u201cFirst, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning.\u201d <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S. Ct. 2294, 33 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1972). \u201c[A] law forbidding or requiring conduct in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates due process of law.\u201d <em>Baggett </em>v. <em>Bullitt, </em>377 U.S. 360, 367, 84 S. Ct. 1316, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>12 L. Ed. 2d 377 (1964); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>207 Conn. 456, 459, 542 A.2d 686 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavallo, </em>200 Conn. 664, 670, 513 A.2d 646 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">\u201cSecond, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory applications.\u201d <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, 108-109. Therefore, \u201ca legislature [must] establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357-58, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 75 L. Ed. 2d 903 (1983); see also <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>218 Conn. 580, 591, 590 A.2d 447 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">\u201cThird, but related, where a vague statute abut[s] upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms, it operates to inhibit the exercise of [those] freedoms. Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to steer far wider of the unlawful zone . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">\u201cThese standards should not ... be mechanically applied. The degree of vagueness that the Constitution tolerates\u2014as well as the relative importance of fair notice and fair enforcement\u2014depends in part on the nature of the enactment. . . . The Court has . . . expressed greater tolerance of enactments with civil rather than criminal penalties because the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively less severe. And the Court has recognized that a scienter requirement may mitigate a law\u2019s vagueness, especially with respect to the adequacy of notice to the [defendant] that his conduct is proscribed. . . . [P]erhaps the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>important factor affecting the clarity that the Constitution demands of a law is whether it threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights. If, for example, the law interferes with the right of free speech or of association, a more stringent vagueness test should apply.\u201d <em>Hoffman Estates </em>v. <em>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 498-99, 102 S. Ct. 1186, 71 L. Ed. 2d 362, reh. denied, 456 U.S. 950,102 S. Ct. 2023, 72 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">In a facial vagueness challenge, we also examine the challenged statute to see if it is impermissibly vague in all of its applications. A statute that is impermissibly vague in all its applications is vague, \u201cnot in the sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all. . . . Such a provision simply has <em>no </em>core.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 578, 94 S. Ct. 1242, 39 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1974); see also <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 94 S. Ct. 2547, 41 L. Ed. 2d 439 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>226 Conn. 265, 271, 627 A.2d 892 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>180 Conn. 54, 65, 428 A.2d 322 (1980). Professor Laurence Tribe calls such a statute \u201cperfectly vague.\u201d L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 12-32, p. 1036. A statute may, however, have an unmistakable core meaning of prohibited conduct but, nonetheless, be vague in some of its applications. A defendant whose conduct clearly comes within a statute\u2019s unmistakable core of prohibited conduct may not raise a facial vagueness challenge to the statute. See <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Our vagueness inquiry\u2014whether facial or as applied\u2014extends only to those portions of the statute that were applied to the defendant in this case. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>supra, 581; <em>Gotten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>407 U.S. 104, 111 n.3, 92 S. Ct. 1953, 32 L. Ed. 2d 584 (1972). Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>we confine our vagueness analysis to the mens rea language of subsection (a) of the statute, and the conduct specified in subdivisions (1) and (2). See footnote 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Further, in evaluating the defendant\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of the statute, we read the statute narrowly in order to save its constitutionality, rather than broadly in order to destroy it. \u201cWe will indulge in every presumption in favor of the statute\u2019s constitutionality . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>217 Conn. 73, 79, 584 A.2d 1157 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>212 Conn. 258, 269, 562 A.2d 1060 (1989); <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>Beverly Enterprises-Connecticut, Inc., </em>209 Conn. 692, 705, 553 A.2d 596 (1989). In so doing, we take into account any prior interpretations that this court, our Appellate Court and the Appellate Session of the Superior Court<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> have placed on the statute. See, e.g., <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. 781, 795-96,109 S. Ct. 2746, 105 L. Ed. 2d 661, reh. denied, 492 U.S. 937, 110 S. Ct. 23, 106 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1989) (United States Supreme Court, in evaluating facial challenge to a state law, will consider any limiting instruction proffered by state court); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>195 Conn. 326, 332, 487 A. 2d 1091 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Finally, we may also add interpretive gloss to a challenged statute in order to render it constitutional. \u201cIn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>construing a statute, the court must search for an effective and constitutional construction that reasonably accords with the legislature\u2019s underlying intent.\u201d <em>Calfee </em>v. <em>Usman, </em>224 Conn. 29, 33, 616 A.2d 250 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>224 Conn. 168,176, 617 A.2d 889 (1992), cert. denied, U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 2365, 124 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">. With these principles in mind, we turn to the specifics of this case. These principles require that we examine each of the relevant sections of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 to determine whether the language is: (1) facially vague because it has no core meaning; and (2) vague as applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">We begin with the mens rea language of \u00a7 53a-182 (a): \u201cA person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, <em>with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In accordance with the United States Supreme Court's decision in <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, we conclude that this language is not facially vague if appropriately limited and construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\"><em>Colten </em>involved a challenge to Kentucky\u2019s disorderly conduct statute with language remarkably similar to the statute at issue in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Kentucky Revised Statutes \u00a7 437.016 (1) (f) (Sup. 1968) provides: \u201c(1) A person is guilty of disorderly conduct if, <em>with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, </em>he ... (f) Congregates with other persons in a public place and refuses to comply with a lawful order of the police to disperse . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>The Kentucky Court of Appeals had upheld Colten\u2019s conviction for refusing to obey police orders to leave the scene where the police were issuing a traffic citation to his friend. In order to ensure that the statute did not impede the exercise of constitutional rights, the Kentucky Court of Appeals had, in the same case, construed the statute as follows: \u201cAs reasonably construed, the statute does not prohibit the lawful exercise of any constitutional right. We think that the plain meaning of the statute, in requiring that the proscribed conduct be done \u2018with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof,\u2019 is that the specified intent must be the <em>predominant </em>intent. Predominance can be determined either (1) from the fact that no bona fide intent to exercise a constitutional right appears to have existed or (2) from the fact that the interest to be advanced by the particular exercise of a constitutional right is insignificant in comparison with the inconvenience, annoyance or alarm caused by the exercise.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 108-109, quoting <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>467 S.W.2d 374, 377 (Ky. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The United States Supreme Court approved the Kentucky gloss on the statute and rejected the defendant\u2019s assertion that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court stated: \u201cThe root of the vagueness doctrine is a rough idea of fairness. It is not a principle designed to convert into a constitutional dilemma the practical difficulties in drawing criminal statutes both general enough to take into account a variety of human conduct and sufficiently specific to provide fair warning that certain kinds of conduct are prohibited. We agree with the Kentucky court when it said: \u2018We believe that citizens who desire to obey the statute will have no difficulty in understanding it . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Colten v. Kentucky, </em>supra, 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number><em>Colten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, has subsequently been cited with approval by the United States Supreme Court and been used by federal courts to evaluate the facial vagueness of state statutes. See, e.g., <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>supra, 581; <em>Pringle </em>v. <em>Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County, </em>604 F. Sup. 623, 627 (M.D. Pa.), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 778 F.2d 998 (3d Cir. 1985); <em>Squire </em>v. <em>Pace, </em>380 F. Sup. 269, 275-80 (W.D. Va. 1974), aff\u2019d, 516 F.2d 240 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 840, 96 S. Ct. 68, 46 L. Ed. 2d 58 (1975). Furthermore, <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, has been followed by state courts in evaluating state disorderly conduct statutes similar to ours. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>18 Ohio St. 3d 25, 479 N.E.2d 280 (1985); <em>Cincinnati </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>31 Ohio St. 2d 163, 285 N.E.2d 714 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Begins, </em>147 Vt. 45, 509 A.2d 1007 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Although the court in <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, concluded that the statute was not vague as applied, that conclusion implicitly determined that the statute was not facially vague, because a statute that is not vague as applied, a fortiori is not facially vague. See <em>Hoffman Estates </em>v. <em>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>supra. This is because a conclusion that a statute\u2014at least a statute that does not involve a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct\u2014is not vague as applied to the facts of a case means that the statute <em>has </em>a core meaning, in the sense that it is not impermissibly vague in all of its applications. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Although the statute challenged in <em>Colten </em>referred to \u201cpublic\u201d inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, and our statute is not limited to the \u201cpublic,\u201d the distinction does not substantially alter the meaning of the statute. That difference alone cannot support the conclusion that the mens rea language of the Connecticut disorderly conduct statute is unconstitutionally vague but the language of the Kentucky disorderly conduct statute is not. The United States Supreme Court never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>emphasized nor mentioned the word \u201cpublic\u201d in its analysis. We conclude that if \u201cintent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof,\u201d is not impermissibly vague; see <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 108; then \u201cintent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof\u201d is also not impermissibly vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">In order to ensure that the mens rea language of \u00a7 53a-182 passes constitutional muster, we therefore adopt the Kentucky court\u2019s gloss on the same statutory language. The intent denoted in \u00a7 53a-182 (a) is the predominant intent as defined by the Kentucky Court of Appeals in <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>supra. To paraphrase, in order to support a conviction for disorderly conduct, the defendant\u2019s predominant intent must be to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, rather than to exercise his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Although this construction satisfies federal due process requirements, we are not precluded from defining the terms further, as a matter of state statutory construction, in order to clarify their meanings and insulate them from potential future challenges. The terms \u201cinconvenience,\u201d \u201cannoyance,\u201d and \u201calarm\u201d are relatively elastic, each with a number of distinct meanings. See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. In their most benign interpretations, they may not fit within the intent of the disorderly conduct statute. Because we must construe statutory language strictly to avoid imposing criminal liability where none is intended by the legislature; <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 151, 460 A.2d 26 (1983); we construe these terms further.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">If a statute or regulation does not sufficiently define a term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); see also <em>Ziperstein </em>v. <em>Tax </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number><em>Commissioner, </em>178 Conn. 493, 500, 423 A.2d 129 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lo Sacco, </em>12 Conn. App. 481, 490, 531 A.2d 184, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 814, 533 A.2d 568 (1987); <em>Eanes </em>v. <em>State, </em>318 Md. 436, 569 A.2d 604 (1990). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary includes the following among the meanings of the three statutory terms: \u201cinconvenience\u201d\u2014something that disturbs or impedes; \u201cannoyance\u201d\u2014vexation; a deep effect of provoking or disturbing; and \u201calarm\u201d\u2014fear; filled with anxiety as to threatening danger or harm. Of the definitions contained in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, these impart the most serious intrusions on the potential recipients of the action and the general public. Limiting the terms in this way is consistent with our duty to impose criminal liability only where it is intended by the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>supra. In addition, these usages of the terms are most closely associated with the original statutory language of \u00a7 53a-182 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Furthermore, we conclude that the legislature intended the language \u201cinconvenience, annoyance, or alarm\u201d to be that perceived by a reasonable person operating under contemporary community standards. The concept of the reasonable person runs throughout the law and the concept of contemporary community standards has roots in obscenity law jurisprudence. Thus, this standard should ensure that a person of ordinary intelligence has reasonable notice of what the law permits or forbids. <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">To summarize, the mens rea language of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) can be formulated more precisely as follows: the predominant intent is to cause what a reasonable person operating under contemporary community standards would consider a disturbance to or impediment of a lawful activity, a deep feeling of vexation or provocation, or a feeling of anxiety prompted by threatened danger or harm. In order to sustain a conviction for disor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>derly conduct, the state must begin by demonstrating that the defendant had such a state of mind. This limitation ensures that a person who does not wish to violate \u00a7 53a-182 will not inadvertently do so, and that those involved in enforcing and applying the law have sufficient guidance to carry out their duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">We next turn to subdivision (1) of \u00a7 53a-182 (a): \u201cEngages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior.\u201d This subdivision proscribes conduct; it does not describe a mens rea. We conclude that the defendant may not raise a facial challenge to this language. We also conclude that the subdivision is not vague as applied to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">The defendant may not challenge the facial validity of this language because his conduct was prohibited by its unmistakable core meaning of prohibited conduct. See <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>supra. That core of prohibited conduct, as gleaned from the statutory language and its authoritative judicial gloss, is <em>physically </em>violent and <em>physically </em>tumultuous or threatening behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">The term \u201cfighting,\u201d by its plain meaning, involves physical force. The phrase \u201cviolent, tumultuous or threatening behavior\u201d also refers to physical action. If two or more words are grouped together, it is possible to ascertain the meaning of a particular word by reference to its relationship with other associated words and phrases under the doctrine of noscitur a sociis. 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. Sands 1992) \u00a7 47-16; <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>supra, 152. Applying this doctrine, the Appellate Court, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Lo Sacco, </em>supra, construed \u201cviolent or threatening behavior\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181a (a); to mean \u201cconduct which actually involves physical violence or portends imminent physical violence.\u201d Id., 491. Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Duhan, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 665, 668, 460 A.2d 496 (1982), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>rev\u2019d on other grounds, 194 Conn. 347, 481 A.2d 48 (1984), the Appellate Session of the Superior Court read the term \u201ctumultuous\u201d in connection with its surrounding words, \u201cviolent\u201d and \u201cthreatening,\u201d and held that, because its meaning should be ascertained by reference to those associated words, \u201cyelling and cursing unaccompanied by violent behavior is not prohibited by\u201d \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1). In accordance with these decisions, we conclude that the terms \u201cfighting\u201d and \u201cviolent\u201d lend an aspect of physicality to the more nebulous terms \u201ctumultuous\u201d and \u201cthreatening.\u201d Thus, we conclude that subdivision (1) of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) prohibits physical fighting, and physically violent, threatening or tumultuous behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">This conclusion is consistent with the \u201cfighting words\u201d limitation that must be applied when the conduct sought to be proscribed consists purely of speech. <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 573, 62 S. Ct. 766, 86 L. Ed. 1031 (1942); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1978A), </em>34 Conn. Sup. 689, 695, 389 A.2d 1270 (1978). The <em>Chaplinsky </em>doctrine permits the state to prohibit speech that has a direct tendency to inflict injury or to cause acts of violence or a breach of the peace by the persons to whom it is directed. See <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Presnick, </em>18 Conn. App. 316, 559 A.2d 220 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Thus, the language of subdivision (1) is not completely devoid of a core meaning. A reasonable person need not \u201cguess\u201d at the meaning of the terms to understand what kind of conduct the legislature intended to proscribe. <em>Baggett </em>v. <em>Bullitt, </em>377 U.S. 360, 367, 84 S. Ct. 1316, 12 L. Ed. 2d 377 (1964). A person who desired to be convicted of violating \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1) would have little difficulty identifying conduct that would lead to such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>The defendant\u2019s conduct in this case clearly fell within this core meaning of the language of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1). He acted with an unreasonable degree of force in wedging Orgovan away from the door by using his shoulders and buttocks, and this constituted physical violence prohibited by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Finally, subdivision (1), as previously construed and as further elaborated herein, is not unduly vague as applied to the defendant\u2019s conduct in this case. To challenge successfully the vagueness of the statute as applied to the facts of his case, the defendant must prove that the policies advanced by the vagueness doctrine were violated in his case. Specifically, the defendant must show that a reasonable person could not have foreseen that the statute would be applied to his conduct, or that he was the victim of arbitrary enforcement practices. <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>218 Conn. 580, 592, 590 A.2d 447 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">There is no question that the authoritative judicial gloss on the statute that preexisted the defendant\u2019s conduct applied to him. Moreover, the authoritative gloss that we have added today also applies to his conduct. \u201c[OJnce an acceptable limiting construction is obtained, it may be applied to conduct occurring prior to the construction, <em>see Poulos v. New Hampshire, </em>345 U.S. 395 [73 S. Ct. 760, 97 L. Ed. 1105, reh. denied, 345 U.S. 978, 73 S. Ct. 1119, 97 L. Ed. 1392 (1953)]; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>312 U.S. 569 [61 S. Ct. 762, 85 L. Ed. 1049 (1941)]; <em>Winters </em>v. <em>New York, </em>333 U.S. 507 [68 S. Ct. 665, 92 L. Ed. 840 (1948)], provided such application affords fair warning to the defendants . . . .\u201d <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister, </em>380 U.S. 479, 491 n.7, 85 S. Ct. 1116, 14 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1965). In <em>Dombrowski, </em>the United States Supreme Court indicated that the considerations involved in such a determination include whether the conduct of the defendant is within the reach of an acceptable limiting construction readily to be antici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>pated as a result of the prosecution, and whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was the sort of \u201chard-core\u201d conduct that would obviously be prohibited under any construction. Id., 491-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Furthermore, the language of subdivision (1), as previously construed, and as further elaborated herein, does not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. Physical violence is not the kind of expressive conduct that the first amendment is intended to protect. In <em>Arcara </em>v. <em>Cloud Books, Inc., </em>478 U.S. 697, 706-707, 106 S. Ct. 3172, 92 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1986), the United States Supreme Court cautioned against requiring first amendment scrutiny \u201csimply because each particular remedy will have some effect on the First Amendment activities of those subject to sanction. Rather, we have subjected such restrictions to [first amendment] scrutiny only where it was conduct with a significant expressive element that drew the legal remedy in the first place, as in <em>[United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 88 S. Ct. 1673, 20 L. Ed. 2d 672, reh. denied, 393 U.S. 900, 89 S. Ct. 63, 21 L. Ed. 2d 188 (1968) (burning draft card)], or where a statute based on a nonexpressive activity has the inevitable effect of singling out those engaged in expressive activity, as in <em>[Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co. </em>v. <em>Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue, </em>460 U.S. 575, 103 S. Ct. 1365, 75 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1983) (tax imposed on newsprint and ink)].\u201d The court concluded that \u201cthe First Amendment is not implicated by the enforcement of a public health regulation of general application against the physical premises in which respondents happened] to sell books.\u201d Id., 707. A disorderly conduct statute that applies generally to prohibit physical violence and physically threatening behavior similarly avoids first amendment difficulties. Therefore, we will not apply \u201ca more stringent vagueness test.\u201d See <em>Hoffman Estates </em>v. <em>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>supra, 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>We conclude that, given the language of subdivision (1) and its authoritative gloss, subdivision (1) is not unduly vague as applied to the defendant\u2019s conduct. The Appellate Court\u2019s proscription, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Lo Sacco, </em>supra, against physically violent conduct, as well as the Appellate Session\u2019s interpretation of \u201ctumultuous\u201d in <em>State </em>v. <em>Duhan, </em>supra, gave the defendant fair warning that physically pushing his way through a door against the will of another person might result in criminal liability. Any further gloss we have added has not changed the statute\u2019s core meaning so as to deprive the defendant of notice that his conduct was prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Finally, we turn to subdivision (2) of \u00a7 53a-182 (a): \u201cby offensive or disorderly conduct, annoys or interferes with another person.\u201d This language also purports to proscribe conduct, rather than to describe a mens rea. We conclude that this language is unconstitutionally vague on its face. Although we also interpret the language to provide it with constitutional content, our interpretation may not be applied to the defendant\u2019s conduct in this case. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed to the extent that it was based upon \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">The decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Coates </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>402 U.S. 611, 91 S. Ct. 1686, 29 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1971), controls this case. In <em>Coates, </em>the court sustained a facial vagueness challenge to a statute that made it a criminal offense for \u201cthree or more persons to assemble ... on any of the sidewalks . . . and there conduct themselves in a manner <em>annoying </em>to persons passing by . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 611.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>held this statute to be unconstitutionally vague because it depended upon an unascertainable standard. \u201cConduct that annoys some people does not annoy others. Thus, the ordinance is vague, not in the sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all. As a result, men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 614. Because the Supreme Court of the United States has held that the term \u201cannoying,\u201d when used to proscribe conduct, is unconstitutionally vague, we are bound as a matter of federal due process to conclude that the term \u201cannoy\u201d as used in \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (2) is similarly vague.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Furthermore, we conclude that the phrase \u201coffensive or disorderly conduct\u201d is equally facially vague in the absence of some authoritative gloss that would have rendered it more specific.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Conduct that is \u201coffen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>sive\u201d to or would be considered \u201cdisorderly\u201d by some people would not be so considered by others.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Although the plain language of subdivision (2) is unconstitutionally vague, we may construe it in order to provide constitutional content for the future. Other courts have reached similar conclusions when confronted with such a situation. For instance, in <em>Matter of Welfare of S. L. J., </em>263 N.W.2d 412 (Minn. 1978), the Minnesota Supreme Court declared facially invalid a disorderly conduct statute that prohibited \u201coffensive, obscene, or abusive language,\u201d as well as words that tend to \u201carouse alarm, anger or resentment in others.\u201d The court held that the statute was unconstitutional on its face because, by its own terms, it applied to constitutionally protected speech. The court saved the statute, however, by narrowly construing it to prohibit only fighting words, \u201c \u2018which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\u2019 \u201d Id., 419; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Huffman, </em>228 Kan. 186, 612 P.2d 630 (1980). We employ the same strategy to save the statute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Subdivision (2) has two components, \u201cby offensive or disorderly conduct,\u201d and \u201cannoys or interferes with another person.\u201d We analyze each component separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The phrase \u201cby offensive or disorderly conduct\u201d may be read in two different ways. First, it may be read in the traditional manner, in which each adjective car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>r\u00edes a different meaning. Reading it in that manner, however, is problematic because it leads to defining the offense of \u201cdisorderly conduct\u201d as \u201cdisorderly conduct.\u201d Thus, we conclude that the legislature intended each adjective to complement the meaning of the other under the doctrine of noscitur a sociis, described above. 2A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 47-16. As in subdivision (1) of the statute, the two adjectives are to be read together as a unitary phrase. When this interpretative mechanism is used, it is possible to build upon the definition of \u201coffensive\u201d in prior cases to arrive at a more precise definition of the phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Lo Sacco, </em>supra, 488-89, the Appellate Court adopted the definition of \u201coffensive conduct\u201d originally offered by the Appellate Session in <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1978-4-), </em>supra, 695: \u201cconduct which under contemporary community standards is so grossly offensive to a person who actually overhears it or sees it as to amount to a nuisance.\u201d See footnote 10. We conclude that \u201cdisorderly\u201d in the context of this phrase has essentially the same definition as \u201coffensive.\u201d Building upon established standards in obscenity law; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gagliardi, </em>174 Conn. 46, 381 A.2d 1068 (1977); we therefore advance the following, modified, definition of \u201coffensive or disorderly conduct\u201d: conduct that is grossly offensive, under contemporary community standards, to a person who actually overhears it or sees it.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The second component of subdivision (2) is the phrase \u201cannoys or interferes with another person.\u201d It is difficult to determine precisely what the legislature intended by the word \u201cannoys.\u201d See <em>Coates </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>supra. Therefore, in order to interpret the phrase, we rely primarily upon the term \u201cinterferes.\u201d In interpreting this term in the context of this statutory subdivision, we utilize the definition that we used for the term \u201cinconvenience\u201d that we employed in the discus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>sion of the mens rea language of subsection (a) above, namely, \u201cdisturbs or impedes the lawful activity of another person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">These two glosses serve to save what would otherwise be unduly vague statutory language. To summarize, therefore, we hold that the language of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (2)\u2014 \u201cby offensive or disorderly conduct, annoys or interferes with another person\u201d\u2014means: by conduct that is grossly offensive, under contemporary community standards, to a person who actually overhears or sees it, disturbs or impedes the lawful activity of that person.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> With these constructions and limitations, subdivision (2) of subsection (a) is not facially vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">We cannot conclude, however, that the gloss we add today to subdivision (2) provided the defendant with fair warning that his conduct came within the proscription of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (2) as now construed. <em>Dombrowski </em>v. <em>Pfister, </em>supra, 491. The defendant cannot be retried under subdivision (2) because he could not have anticipated the extent of our construction of the statutory language at the time of his prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">Subdivision (1) of subsection (a), however, is not constitutionally flawed. If the conviction were based on subdivision (1) only, we would affirm the conviction. Because the defendant was convicted under both relevant subdivisions of \u00a7 53a-182 (a), however, and because subdivision (2) was unconstitutionally vague at the time of the defendant\u2019s conduct leading to his conviction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>we must vacate the judgment of conviction. Thus, we remand the case for a new trial under \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1) only.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to vacate the judgment of guilty and to remand the case to the trial court for a new trial under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., Katz and Foti, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 provides in pertinent part: \u201cdisorderly conduct: class c misdemeanor, (a) <em>A person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he: (1) Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior; or (2) by offensive or disorderly conduct, annoys or interferes with another person; </em>or (3) makes unreasonable noise; or (4) without lawful authority, disturbs any lawful assembly or meet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>ing of persons; or (5) obstructs vehicular or pedestrian traffic; or (6) congregates with other persons in a public place and refuses to comply with a reasonable official request or order to disperse.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b819-8\"> Although the information charged the defendant only with \u201cDisorderly Conduct . . . in violation of General Statute No. 53a-182,\u201d in the Appellate Court and in this court, both the state and the defendant have agreed that the defendant was convicted only under \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1) and (2). Indeed, these are the only provisions that match the trial court\u2019s findings, and they are the only provisions that arguably pertain to the defendant\u2019s conduct. We consider this case, therefore, on the basis that the defendant was charged and convicted under only those two provisions of \u00a7 53a-182.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b819-9\"> The Appellate Court based its decision on the first requirement stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), for prevailing on appeal on unpreserved constitutional claims. <em>Golding </em>provides that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) <em>the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; </em>(2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b820-8\"> We decline to review the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim that the statute is void for vagueness under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, however, because he has failed to present an independent analysis. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Joly, </em>219 Conn. 234, 258 n.16, 593 A.2d 96 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>208 Conn. 52, 67 n.9, 544 A.2d 611 (1988). We also note that we have not examined the statute for first amendment overbreadth because the defendant has not raised an overbreadth challenge. Although vagueness and overbreadth challenges are closely related, they are not identical. See, e.g., L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 12-32, p. 1033.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">The dissent misses this last point. Thus, the principal cases on which the dissent relies for its analytical structure; <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>482 U.S. 451, 107 S. Ct. 2502, 96 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>226 Conn. 265, 627 A.2d 892 (1993); and <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 92 S. Ct. 1103, 31 L. Ed. 2d 408 (1972); are overbreadth cases, and involve vagueness claims only tangentially, if at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">Similarly, the dissent's contention that the overlap in the language of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-182 and 53a-181a grants prosecutors an unconstitutional degree of discretion is not a part of this appeal. The issue has never been raised or briefed by either party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b823-8\"> The dissent accuses us of performing \u201cplastic surgery\u201d on the statute in order to save its constitutionality. We disagree; arthroscopic surgery, perhaps, but not plastic. In interpreting the statute as we have, we are properly performing our judicial duty to interpret a statute so as to preserve, rather than destroy, its constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"AxM\">It is ironic that the dissent, while complaining that we are making a new law rather than \u201cenforcing] that which was enacted by the legislature,\u201d would, under the guise of such \u201cenforcement,\u201d prefer instead to invalidate the entire statute, including parts thereof that have not been applied to the defendant\u2019s conduct and are not even arguably applicable to that conduct. In this connection, the dissent\u2019s reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>207 Conn. 456, 542 A.2d 686 (1988), is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"Am7\">In <em>Sckriver, </em>the court was asked to expand on \u201can authoritative judicial gloss that limit[ed] the types of <em>physical </em>harm prohibited by [General Statutes] \u00a7 53-21 to instances of deliberate, blatant abuse\u201d; (emphasis added) id., 466; so as to include conduct that \u201ccreated a cognizable risk of mental injury to the victim.\u201d Id. In that posture, we declined to do so. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>the alternative to glossing the statute further in that case was not to declare the entire risk of injury statute unconstitutional; it was merely to decline to expand the extent of its coverage beyond its prior scope as defined by a well established body of case law. That is not this case. Thus, our approach in <em>Schriver </em>and our approach in this case are consistent in that both approaches afford due respect to the legislative function.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b827-8\"> The rule of federal vagueness jurisprudence is that prior judicial decisions interpreting a state statute are authoritative if they are decisions of \u201ca court of statewide jurisdiction, the decisions of which are binding upon all trial courts in the absence of a conflicting decision of the [state] Supreme Court. . . .\u201d <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 525 n.3, 92 S.

It was certainly a court of statewide jurisdiction, because the Superior Court itself is such. Moreover, the decisions of the Appellate Session, at least those that were published, were binding on our trial court, including the trial session of the Superior Court. Certainly most judges and lawyers considered them to be binding, in the absence of a conflicting decision of this court or the Appellate Court. Indeed, their binding force was the principal reason for their having been published.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b828-11\"> Both the Kentucky and Connecticut disorderly conduct statutes, and many others throughout the nation, are based on Model Penal Code \u00a7 250.2 (Proposed Official Draft 1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b837-9\"> Section 901-L6 of the code of ordinances of the city of Cincinnati (1956) provided: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for three or more persons to assemble, except at a public meeting of citizens, on any of the sidewalks, street comers, vacant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>lots, or mouths of alleys, and there conduct themselves in a manner annoying to persons passing by, or occupants of adjacent buildings.

In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>supra, we noted that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court of the United States \u2018has applied First Amendment scrutiny to a statute regulating conduct which has the incidental effect of burdening the expression of a particular political opinion.\u2019 <em>Arcara </em>v. <em>Cloud Books, Inc., </em>478 U.S. 697, 702, 106 S.

We have applied such scrutiny to a statute that \u2018could, if drafted ambiguously, impinge upon rights of expression protected by the first amendment . . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavallo, </em>[supra, 671].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">An ambiguously crafted statute, which could reasonably foster confusion over whether the statute prohibits expression that is protected by the first amendment, \u201cis unconstitutional for two reasons: (1) it may deter individuals from exercising their first amendment freedoms for fear of incurring criminal liability; and (2) it vests enforcement officials with undue discretion to interfere with the right to freedom of speech. . . . Consequently, we carefully scrutinize a statute that is under attack to determine whether its language, as we have construed it, reasonably warrants such uncertainty among members of the public. We will not enforce a statute that could exert such a chilling effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>on first amendment liberties.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavallo, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Therefore, we must determine if \u00a7 53a-182 (a) reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. I conclude that it does, in light of its inclusion of the following terms and phrases: \u201ctumultuous . . . behavior\u201d in subdivision (1); the entire proscription of subdivision (2) (\u201cby offensive or disorderly conduct, annoys or interferes with another person\u201d); \u201cunreasonable noise\u201d in subdivision (3); and \u201cdisturbs\u201d in subdivision (4). Each of these terms and phrases substantially implicates speech. \u201c \u2018[I]t is now settled that constitutionally protected forms of communication include parades, dances, artistic expression, picketing, wearing arm bands, burning flags and crosses, commercial advertising, charitable solicitation, rock music, some libelous false statements, and perhaps even sleeping in a public park.\u2019 J. Stevens, <em>\u2018The </em>Freedom of Speech,\u2019 102 Yale L.J. 1293, 1298 (1993).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>supra, 272. Moreover, the terms \u201cobstructs\u201d in subdivision (5) and \u201ccongregates\u201d in subdivision (6) of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) implicate the right to assemble. See <em>Coates </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>402 U.S. 611, 614-15, 91 S. Ct. 1686, 29 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Section 53a-182 reaches constitutionally protected speech to at least the same degree as the Connecticut Hunter Harassment Act, codified in General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>\u00a7 53a-183a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>supra. In <em>Ball, </em>we held that \u201cthe first amendment threshold is crossed by subsection (b) (1) of \u00a7 53a-183a, which criminalizes conduct intended to disturb wildlife while someone is lawfully engaged in hunting, because such interference may be verbal as well as physical.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">1 conclude that \u00a7 53a-182, read as a whole,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> reaches a substantial amount of conduct protected by the first amendment. The defendant\u2019s language in the present case\u2014\u201cGod damn, I don\u2019t have to wait, God damn it,\u201d and \u201cyou, old man, stay out of this\u201d\u2014although annoying, offensive and probably noisy\u2014surely is constitutionally protected. \u201cThe mere fact that expressive activity causes hurt feelings, offense, or resentment does not render the expression unprotected.\u201d <em>R.A.V. </em>v. <em>St. Paul, </em>U.S. , 112 S. Ct. 2538, 2559, 120 L. Ed. 2d 305 (1992) (White, J., concurring). Although it is not necessary for the defendant to show that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>own first amendment rights have been adversely affected by the statute, the defendant\u2019s standing to attack the constitutionality of \u00a7 53a-182 on its face is nonetheless enhanced by the fact that his conviction was in part predicated on protected speech. See <em>Young </em>v. <em>American Mini Theatres, Inc., </em>427 U.S. 50, 59, 96 S. Ct. 2440, 49 L. Ed. 2d 310 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">In my facial vagueness analysis of \u00a7 53a-182,1 begin by examining its prefatory language, which provides that in order to be convicted of disorderly conduct, one must first have the \u201cintent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm\u201d or must \u201crecklessly [create] a risk thereof.\u201d The Connecticut Penal Code does not define the terms \u201cinconvenience,\u201d \u201cannoyance,\u201d or \u201calarm.\u201d Accordingly, we are directed by the legislature to look to the ordinary meaning of these words. \u201cIn the absence of an express definition words of a statute are to be given the commonly approved meaning unless a contrary intent is clearly expressed.\u201d <em>DuBaldo </em>v. <em>Dept. of Consumer Protection, </em>209 Conn. 719, 722, 552 A.2d 813 (1989); see General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">The following definitions provided by Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary illustrate the vague nature of the language of \u00a7 53a-182. First, \u201cinconvenience\u201d is defined as \u201cthe quality or state of being inconvenient,\u201d and definitions provided for \u201cinconvenient\u201d include \u201cnot agreeing,\u201d \u201cnot suitable,\u201d \u201cgiving trouble, uneasiness, or annoyance,\u201d and \u201cmorally unbecoming.\u201d Second, \u201cannoyance\u201d is defined as \u201cthe act of annoying,\u201d and definitions provided for \u201cannoy\u201d include \u201cto irritate with a nettling or exasperating effect especially by being a continuous or repeatedly renewed source of vexation.\u201d The definitions of \u201calarm\u201d range from an \u201capprehension of an unfavorable outcome\u201d to a \u201cfear or terror resulting from a sudden sense of danger.\u201d Each of these words is imprecise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>and indefinite, giving rise to numerous interpretations. An individual, presented with words of this nature, simply has no means of ascertaining what is prohibited. In <em>Coates </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>supra, 614, the United States Supreme Court held that an ordinance prohibiting conduct \u201cannoying to persons passing by\u201d was unconstitutionally vague. \u201cConduct that annoys some people does not annoy others. Thus, the ordinance is vague, not in the sense that it requires a person to conform his [or her] conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all. As a result [persons] of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Not only is the language in \u00a7 53a-182 inadequate to provide notice of the type of conduct prohibited by the statute, but it is precisely the type of language that allows police officers, judges and juries to rely on their own subjective judgment to define conduct that they find inconvenient, annoying and alarming. Language virtually identical to \u00a7 53a-182 was found to be unconstitutionally vague in <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Anchorage, </em>500 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>644, 652-53 (Alaska 1972). The defective prefatory language at issue in <em>Marks </em>provided that one could not be convicted of disorderly conduct absent the \u201cpurpose and intent to cause public <em>inconvenience, annoyance or alarm </em>or recklessly create a risk thereof.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 653. Noting that the United States Supreme Court had found the word \u201cannoying\u201d to be unconstitutionally vague in <em>Coates </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>supra, the Alaska Supreme Court concluded that \u201cthe words \u2018inconvenience\u2019 and \u2018alarm\u2019 are no less so.\u201d <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Anchorage, </em>supra, 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Nevertheless, the majority concludes, in reliance on <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>407 U.S. 104, 92 S. Ct. 1953, 32 L. Ed. 2d 584 (1972), that the mens rea predicate language of \u00a7 53a-182\u2014\u201cwith intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm or recklessly creating a risk thereof\u201d\u2014passes constitutional muster. I believe <em>Colten </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">The problem with the majority\u2019s analysis is that it merely compares the mens rea predicate language of \u00a7 53a-182 to that of the Kentucky statute in <em>Colten. </em>In <em>Colten, </em>however, the United States Supreme Court determined that \u201cwith intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof\u201d passed muster not in isolation, but in conjunction with the conduct-specifying clause of the Kentucky statute\u2014that is, \u201c [congregates with other persons in a public place and refuses to comply with a <em>lawful </em>order of the police to disperse . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 108, quoting Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 473.016 (1) (f) (Sup. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">The statute in <em>Colten </em>was a model of clarity compared to the language of \u00a7 53a-182 and the language of the <em>Coates </em>statute. The conduct clause in <em>Colten </em>prohibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>an easy to understand, distinct act: \u201cCongregates with other persons in a public place and refuses to comply with a lawful order of the police to disperse . . . The conduct provisions of \u00a7 53a-182, by contrast, are littered with vague, imprecise words. Indeed, much of the language of the first three subdivisions of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) parallels language held unconstitutional in <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Anchorage, </em>supra.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court in <em>Marks </em>noted that \u201c[t]he rest of the ordinance is . . . peppered with indefinite words\u2014\u2018threatening,\u2019 \u2018tumultuous behavior,\u2019\u2018unreasonable noise\u2019 .... The phrase \u2018tumultuous behavior,\u2019 for example, might encompass conduct ranging from actual violence to speaking in a loud and excited manner . . . .\u201d Id., 653. Accordingly, the Alaska Supreme Court held that the entire statute was void for vagueness. Id. Like the Alaska ordinance, \u00a7 53a-182 also bars \u201cthreatening,\u201d \u201ctumultuous\u201d behavior and \u201cunreasonable noise,\u201d and subdivision (2) of subsection (a) establishes a prohibition that is even more vague than the language held unconstitutional in <em>Coates </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>supra: It is a crime in Connecticut recklessly to \u201c[annoy] or [interfere] with another person\u201d by \u201coffensive or disorderly conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Furthermore, \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (4) makes it a misdemeanor to \u201c[disturb] any lawful assembly or meeting of persons\u201d with a reckless mens rea and without \u201clawful authority.\u201d It is instructive to look to <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra. In <em>Houston, </em>the United States Supreme Court held unconstitutional on its face an ordinance making it unlawful to <em>interrupt </em>a police officer in the performance of his duty because \u201cthe ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>[was] susceptible of regular application to protected expression.\u201d Id., 467. The court distinguished <em>Colten </em>by noting that the <em>Houston </em>ordinance was \u201cnot narrowly tailored to prohibit only disorderly conduct or fighting words, and in no way resembles the law upheld in <em>Colten.\u201d </em>Id., 465. If we are to apply a resemblance test, the vague subdivisions of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) are much closer to the <em>Houston </em>ordinance than to the <em>Colten </em>prohibition of disobeying police officers. In addition, \u00a7 53a-182 is hardly \u201cnarrowly tailored.\u201d As the defendant\u2019s brief points out, it is one of the few disorderly statutes in the country that forbids \u201cdisorderly conduct,\u201d an inherently circular and vague prohibition. It seems fair to assume that <em>Colten </em>is a valid precedent. The manner in which it is distinguished in <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 465-66, however, is strong evidence that <em>Colten </em>is a limited holding, rather than broad authority that disorderly conduct statutes are to be afforded a limited vagueness standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">There is another matter more fundamental that the majority fails to acknowledge. As I previously pointed out, the United States Supreme Court has characterized the arbitrary enforcement concern\u2014that is, \u201c \u2018the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement\u2019 <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>supra, 358;\u2014as the most important aspect of the vagueness doctrine. Id.; see <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 574, 94 S. Ct. 1242, 39 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1974). The discretion on the part of prosecutors, judges and juries to interfere with speech that the vagueness doctrine attempts to control is implicated in an unusual and disturbing manner as follows: The predicate clause and the first three subdivisions of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) are mirrored by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181a, creating a public disturbance. To emphasize my point, I set forth the relevant language of the two statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>Section 53a-181a provides in part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of <em>creating a public disturbance </em>when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he (1) engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior; or (2) annoys or interferes with another person by offensive conduct; or (3) makes unreasonable noise.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-6\">Section 53a-182 provides in part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of <em>disorderly conduct, </em>when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he: (1) Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior; or (2) by offensive or disorderly conduct, annoys or interferes with another person; or (3) makes unreasonable noise . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">The language of the statutes is nearly identical. For constitutional purposes, however, there is a crucial difference between these two enactments. A conviction under \u00a7 53a-182, a misdemeanor offense, creates a criminal record; whereas a conviction under \u00a7 53a-181a, a mere infraction, does not result in a criminal record. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181a (b). As a result of this distinction, a conviction under \u00a7 53a-182 can result in the loss of liberty with a maximum sentence of three months,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and a maximum fine of $500;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the most severe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>sentence authorized under \u00a7 53a-181a is a fine of $100.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is difficult to conceive of a manner in which absolute discretion can better be vested in law enforcement personnel than to have two statutes on the books that provide not merely <em>different </em>punishments for proof of an identical set of elements, but drastically different punishments: a small fine versus the potential for a loss of liberty and the stigma of a criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Finally, the terms incorporated in \u00a7 53a-182 are so imprecise and subject to such a variety of interpretations that \u201cconstruing the statute to apply only to \u2018core criminal conduct\u2019 . . . would be tantamount to . . . \u2018rewrit[ing the] statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dorman </em>v. <em>Satti, </em>862 F.2d 432, 436 (2d Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1099, 109 S. Ct. 2450, 104 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1989).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In an attempt to save the statute, the majority \u201cperform[s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>a remarkable job of plastic surgery upon the face\u201d of \u00a7 53a-182. <em>Shuttlesworth </em>v. <em>Birmingham, </em>394 U.S. 147, 153, 89 S. Ct. 935, 22 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1969). Nevertheless, under our state constitution, the task of legislating is committed to the legislature, not to this court. Conn. Const., art. II. \u201cClearly, this court lacks the authority to reshape public policy by construing a statute in a manner that alters its inherent meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Proto, </em>203 Conn. 682, 698, 526 A.2d 1297 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Simply put, what the majority does here is to make a new law and not enforce that which was enacted by the legislature. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>supra, 456, we were confronted with a void for vagueness challenge to General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (\u201cInjury or risk of injury to, or impairing morals of, children\u201d). The defendant was convicted of impairing the <em>mental </em>health of a child under a provision of \u00a7 53-21 that proscribed injuring the health of a minor. Id., 461. Although we recognized that \u201c[ujnder an appropriately tailored penal law, the legislature would have the power to proscribe\u201d the impairment of the mental health of a child; id., 467; and such injury was arguably encompassed in the vague language of the statute, we declined to perform the extensive surgery necessary to save such an ambiguous and standardless statute. We held the following: \u201cWithout the aid of prior decisions to lend an authoritative gloss to the potentially limitless language of the statute, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>effort to conform \u00a7 53-21 to the mandate of due process would necessarily entail a wholesale redrafting of the statute. We decline to undertake this activity, which is within the exclusive province of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>200 Conn. 268, 288, 511 A.2d 321 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johns, </em>184 Conn. 369, 376-77, 439 A.2d 1049 (1981); see also <em>Harris </em>v. <em>State, </em>457 P.2d 638, 647 (Alaska 1969) (refusing to resurrect by judicial fiat a standardless statute prohibiting \u2018crime[s] against nature\u2019); <em>ABC Interstate Theaters, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>325 So. 2d 123, 126 (Miss. 1976) (declining to exercise the \u2018legislative function\u2019 of revising an unconstitutionally vague obscenity statute).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>supra, 468.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the present case, this court should be all the more reluctant to undertake wholesale redrafting of \u00a7 53a-182 when there exist two statutes that reach the same conduct and the same first amendment activities\u2014one a misdemeanor and the other, \u00a7 53a-181a, an infraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">In sum, it is crystal clear that criminal statutes \u201cmay be held facially invalid <em>even if they also have legitimate application. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 459. \u201cEven if the legislative purpose is a legitimate one of substantial governmental interest, \u2018that purpose cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved.\u2019 \u201d 4 R. Rotunda &amp; J. Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional Law (2d Ed. 1992) \u00a7 20.10, p. 39, quoting <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>364 U.S. 479, 488, 81 S. Ct. 247, 5 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1960). I am \u201cmindful that the preservation of liberty depends in part upon the maintenance of social order. . . . But the First Amendment recognizes, wisely . . . that a certain amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>of expressive disorder not only is inevitable in a society committed to individual freedom, but must itself be protected if that freedom would survive.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Houston </em>v. Hill, supra, 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">I fully agree that there is a place and a need for a disorderly conduct statute, but that statute must be narrowly drafted so as not to punish and deter constitutionally protected conduct, and must have sufficient specificity so that it provides to a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited and avoids undue prosecutorial discretion. That drafting, however, must be left to the legislature. I suspect that this state could survive without a disorderly conduct statute for the few months it would take for the legislature to redraft and adopt an acceptable statute that can pass constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">I would hold that \u00a7 53a-182 is unconstitutional. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-8\"> As Professor Laurence H. Tribe points out, we grant standing to a litigant to challenge such a statute on its face because persons \u201cwhose expression is \u2018chilled\u2019 by the existence of an overbroad or unduly vague statute cannot be expected to adjudicate their own rights, lacking by definition the willingness to disobey the law. In addition, such deterred persons may not have standing to obtain affirmative relief, since the hypothetical \u2018chilling effect\u2019 of the mere existence of an overbroad or vague law does not by itself constitute the sort of \u2018injury-in-fact\u2019 which confers standing.\u201d L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 12-32, p. 1035.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b846-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-183a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) No person shall obstruct or interfere with the lawful taking of wildlife by another person at the location where the activity is taking place with intent to prevent such taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">\u201c(b) A person violates this section when he intentionally or knowingly: (1) Drives or disturbs wildlife for the purpose of disrupting the lawful taking of wildlife where another person is engaged in the process of lawfully taking wildlife . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b846-9\"> 1 disagree with the majority that the court should consider only the first two subdivisions of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a) in its consideration of whether the statute reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, and in undertaking a facial analysis of the statute\u2019s vagueness. The defendant was charged under the statute as a whole, not under any specific provision. Furthermore, the trial court never specified the particular provisions that formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s conviction. In addition, the concern of the vagueness doctrine that constitutionally protected first amendment activities not be deterred by vague statutory prohibitions would not be addressed if we merely examined the provisions under which the defendant\u2019s conduct arguably fell. Otherwise, a vague or over-broad provision could deter constitutionally protected conduct without ever being subject to challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\"> I recognize that the word \u201cannoying\u201d in <em>Coates </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>402 U.S. 611, 612, 91 S. Ct. 1686, 29 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1971), referred to prohibited conduct, whereas General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 refers to a mental state, prohibiting certain conduct committed \u201cwith intent to cause . . . annoyance.\u201d Nevertheless, I fail to see a distinction between these two formulations that would render the former unconstitutionally vague and the latter constitutionally acceptable. \u201cOrdinarily, intent can only be proved by circumstantial evidence; it may be and usually is inferred from the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>219 Conn. 16, 20, 592 A.2d 149 (1991). In practice, therefore, the only means by which a police officer, prosecutor, court or jury can determine whether a defendant had the <em>subjective </em>intent to annoy others is to examine the defendant\u2019s <em>objective </em>conduct and determine if this conduct is likely, in the subjective view of the law enforcement officer or fact finder, to annoy passersby. This is the same standardless determination held unconstitutional in <em>Coates.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b850-7\"> Both statutes, specifying a nearly identical mens rea, prohibit \u201cthreatening, violent or tumultuous behavior\u201d and \u201cunreasonable noise.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182; <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Anchorage, </em>500 P.2d 644, 645 (Alaska 1972).

They rely in part on <em>State </em>v. <em>Lo Sacco, </em>12 Conn. App. 481, 531 A.2d 184, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 814, 533 A.2d 568 (1987). This reliance is misplaced, however, because <em>Lo Sacco </em>construed General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181a, and not \u00a7 53a-182.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">The majority also relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Duhan, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 665, 668, 460 A.2d 496 (App. Sess. 1982), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 194 Conn. 347, 481 A.2d 48 (1984). <em>Duhan </em>was decided by the Appellate Session of the Superior Court. Although I recognize that the United States Supreme Court has held that judicial gloss can be authoritatively placed on a statute by an appellate court of state-wide jurisdiction, so as to place persons on notice of the type of conduct prohibited by the statute; <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 524-27, 525 n.3, 92 S. Ct. 1103, 31 L. Ed. 2d 408 (1972); I do not believe that the mere pronouncements of an appellate division of the trial court constitute sufficient notice to resolve unconstitutionally vague statutory language. The placing of judicial gloss on a statute to enable it to pass constitutional muster, as compared to the mere interpretation of a statute, always marks a fine line between the legislative and the judicial functions. The drawing of this fine line, when constitutionally permissible, is best left to this court or the Appellate Court as now constituted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b854-7\"> This limitation has been recognized by the United States Supreme Court when it has determined whether to put judicial gloss on a federal statute in order to save it. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reese, </em>92 U.S. 214, 221, 23 L. Ed. 563 (1875) (for the court to \u201cintroduce words of limitation\u201d into over-broad criminal statute in order to make it constitutional \u201cwould, to some extent, substitute the judicial for the legislative department .... To limit this statute . . . would be to make a new law, not to enforce an old one. This is no part of our duty.\u201d); <em>Scales </em>v. <em>United States, </em>367 U.S. 203, 211, 81 S. Ct. 1469, 6 L. Ed. 2d 782 (1961); see L.

The court has extensively revamped a statute without the benefit of the legislative process or even the advocacy of the parties. The legislative process would enable representatives of law enforcement, prosecutorial and defense interests to give their input into the rewriting of this legislation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
