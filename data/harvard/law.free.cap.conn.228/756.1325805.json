The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>30 Conn. App. 523, 621 A.2d 298 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">With respect to the certified issue, the defendant maintained in the Appellate Court that he was entitled to a new trial because the trial court had improperly failed to instruct the jury expressly that, once consent has been raised as an issue in a sexual assault case, the state must disprove beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim consented. Id., 525. The defendant had neither requested such a charge at trial nor objected to the charge as given. Id., 524. He sought appellate review of the charge pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). The Appellate Court concluded that \u201c[w]here use of force or a threat of force is proven beyond a reasonable doubt, lack of consent is implicit. . . . Because the use of force or a threat of use of force is essentially the converse of consent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>no duty exists upon the court to instruct the jury as if [lack of consent] were a statutory element.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 30 Conn. App. 525. The Appellate Court accordingly held that the defendant could not prevail on this claim of law. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Having examined the record on appeal and studied the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we conclude that the issue on which we granted certification was fully considered and properly resolved against the defendant in the well reasoned opinion of the Appellate Court. Id., 525-26. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein.
