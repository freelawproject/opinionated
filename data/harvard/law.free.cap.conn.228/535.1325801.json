On March 22,1989, the plaintiff, Arlene Pereira, sent to her employer, the defendant, state of Connecticut, a written notice of claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-294.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In her notice of claim, the plaintiff alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>that she suffered from stress which had arisen out of and in the course of her employment with the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response, the defendant timely filed a written notice of intention to contest the plaintiffs right to compensation (disclaimer) pursuant to \u00a7 31-297 (b). Thereafter, the plaintiff filed with the compensation commissioner for the seventh district (commissioner) a motion to preclude the defendant from contesting compensability. The plaintiff asserted in her motion that the defendant\u2019s disclaimer was a general denial that did not sufficiently set forth the grounds on which liability was contested. After a formal hearing, the commissioner denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion because: (1) the plaintiff\u2019s notice of claim did not fully state the defendant\u2019s name and therefore was \u201cnot sufficient to serve as a basis for a motion to preclude\u201d; and (2) the defendant\u2019s disclaimer \u201cset forth grounds specific enough to meet the requirements of\u201d \u00a7 31-297 (b). The plaintiff thereafter appealed to the compensation review division (review division) pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-301 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The review division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>affirmed the commissioner\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion and the plaintiff filed an appeal with the Appellate Court that was dismissed for lack of a final judgment. After additional formal hearings at which the commissioner received testimonial and documentary evidence, the commissioner concluded that the plaintiffs stress had not been proximately caused by the conditions of her employment and dismissed her claim. The plaintiff appealed to the review division, which again affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-301b<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We now affirm the decision of the review division.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The basic facts are undisputed. Since 1984, the plaintiff had been employed by the defendant as a social worker in its department of children and youth services. As a social worker, the plaintiff was responsible for the daily care of children who had been neglected or abused. Her responsibilities included removal of children from dangerous settings, reunification of families and arrangement of the adoption of children when the families\u2019 problems could not be resolved. The plaintiff described her caseload of between fifty and sixty cases as \u201cenormous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The plaintiff first began to feel anxious when she returned to work in August, 1988, after a six week <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>leave during which she had had knee surgery. Although unable to articulate any specific reasons, she testified that she did not feel comfortable about returning to work. After her return to work, the plaintiff suffered from severe fatigue, palpitations, headaches, insomnia and stress. The plaintiff was treated by her family physician, Darrell Daniels, who prescribed Xanax and rest. In addition, Daniels recommended that she see a psychiatrist if her symptoms continued. During October, 1988, the plaintiff also experienced trouble breathing, for which she saw an allergist, Christopher Randolph. His diagnosis was that the plaintiff\u2019s symptoms resulted from anxiety rather than an organic trigger or an underlying reactive airway disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">While driving to work on November 10, 1988, the plaintiff felt faint, steered her car to the side of the road and rested until she was able to proceed. The plaintiff again felt faint after arriving at work and was taken to Danbury Hospital. After a series of tests failed to reveal any physical malady, the plaintiff was diagnosed as suffering from a viral syndrome. An antibiotic was prescribed and the plaintiff was discharged. While at work on December 9,1988, the plaintiff again had trouble breathing and developed a rash on her chest and back. She was taken to Danbury Hospital and was diagnosed as having a \u201chypertension episode.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Thereafter, on December 13,1988, the plaintiff was treated by Richard Hart, an endocrinologist. At Hart\u2019s direction, a number of tests were performed on the plaintiff, the results of which ruled out any physical illness. Hart\u2019s resultant diagnosis was that the plaintiff\u2019s symptoms were \u201csecondary to job-related stress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Subsequently, on Hart\u2019s recommendation, the plaintiff saw Ellen Fischbein, a psychiatrist, who, along with Susan Jacobson, a therapist and counselor who worked under Fischbein\u2019s supervision, treated the plaintiff from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>February 16, 1989, through the time of the commission\u2019s hearing. In the course of treatment, Fischbein diagnosed the plaintiff as suffering from panic attacks and agoraphobia.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Fischbein further opined that the plaintiff\u2019s condition was caused by stress at work. In reaching her opinion, Fischbein dismissed as possible causes: (1) the chronic illness of the plaintiff\u2019s father, with whom she lived, which, just prior to her attacks, had caused him to become paraplegic; (2) the plaintiff\u2019s loss in 1972 of her three month old child to crib death; (3) the plaintiff\u2019s overweight condition; (4) the attempted suicide, in August, 1988, of the plaintiff\u2019s fifteen year old daughter; (5) problems with the plaintiffs eighteen year old learning disabled son who had dropped out of school; (6) the divorce, in 1988, and return to the family home of the plaintiff\u2019s brother, whose former wife had been a good friend of the plaintiff; (7) the long-term disability of the plaintiff\u2019s husband due to a serious back injury, which rendered him unable to work; and (8) the plaintiff\u2019s previous marriage to a very critical and demanding man, who had been emotionally abusive to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">At the defendant\u2019s request, the plaintiff was examined by another psychiatrist, Walter Borden. After meeting with the plaintiff on May 1 and 16, 1989, Borden concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s symptoms were not the result of workplace stress, but of \u201ca masked depression.\u201d Borden described the plaintiff\u2019s workload as an ordinary stressor that in his opinion was not sufficiently burdensome to trigger anxiety attacks by the plaintiff. According to Borden, the plaintiff\u2019s depression and resulting symptoms were caused by the combination of the stressors that had been dismissed as causes by Fischbein.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The plaintiff first claims that the commissioner improperly concluded that the defendant\u2019s disclaimer was sufficiently specific to apprise the plaintiff of the grounds on which the right to compensation was being contested as required by \u00a7 31-297 (b). The plaintiff relies on <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>165 Conn. 338, 347, 334 A.2d 452 (1973), in which we held \u201cthat the giving of notice by the employer as to specific grounds on which the right to compensation is contested is a condition precedent to the defense of the action.\u201d The plaintiff argues that the defendant\u2019s disclaimer is merely a general denial of liability that reveals no specific defense or reason why the claim is contested and that the defendant, therefore, is precluded from defending the action. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In <em>Menzies, </em>we determined the scope and operation of the 1967 amendments to \u00a7 31-297 (b); Public Acts 1967, No. 842, \u00a7 7; which specified that the employer\u2019s failure to file a notice of intention to contest compensability results in a conclusive presumption of the acceptance of liability. <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>supra, 341. In light of the public act\u2019s legislative history, we concluded that \u00a7 31-297 (b) \u201cwas amended to ensure (1) that employers would bear the burden of investigating a claim promptly and (2) that employees would be timely apprised of the specific reasons for the denial of their claim.\u201d Id., 343. We also stated, however, that the notice need not be expressed with the technical precision of a pleading, but need only reveal the specific grounds on which compensability is contested. Id., 347-48. A disclaimer is sufficient, therefore, if it reveals to the plaintiff specific substantive grounds on which compensability will be contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>In order to qualify for workers\u2019 compensation benefits a claimant must prove five distinct elements. <em>Tovish v. Gerber Electronics, </em>19 Conn. App. 273, 275, 562 A.2d 76, cert. denied, 212 Conn. 815, 565 A.2d 536 (1989). One of the elements of a prima facie claim is that the claimant has suffered a personal injury arising \u201cout of and in the course of employment.\u201d Id., 276; see also J. Asselin, Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Practice Manual (1985) \u00a7 1. In the present case, the defendant\u2019s disclaimer stated: \u201cRespondents do contend <em>[the] plaintiff\u2019s stress did not arise out of or in the course of her employment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) This statement is not a general denial. Although the disclaimer was not artfully drafted, it clearly apprises the plaintiff of the defendant\u2019s intention to challenge an element of her claim, namely, whether the injury arose out of and in the course of employment. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s disclaimer complied with the specificity requirement of \u00a7 31-297 (b) and the commissioner properly denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to preclude.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The plaintiff next claims that the review division improperly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision that she failed to sustain her burden of proof with regard to the compensability of her claim. In order to prevail on her claim for benefits, the plaintiff correctly argues that she must prove only, by competent evidence, that her employment was a material or substantial factor in her disability. See <em>Murxchison </em>v. <em>Skinner Precision Industries, Inc., </em>162 Conn. 142, 150, 291 A.2d 743 (1972). As noted earlier in this opinion, there was evidence of at least eight traumatic events in the plaintiff\u2019s life that might have caused her injury. In light of this conflicting evidence, the plaintiff further argues that because her panic attacks and resulting disability may have been caused by more than one stressor, the commissioner was obliged to count as a proximate cause every stressor for which she produced competent evidence and that his failure to do so required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>reversal by the review division. This argument rests on a misunderstanding of the commissioner\u2019s fact-finding function and the limited scope of review applied to the commissioner\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Whether an injury arose out of and in the course of employment is a question of fact to be determined by the commissioner. <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>227 Conn. 333, 346, 630 A.2d 1027 (1993); <em>Fair </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>207 Conn. 535, 539, 542 A.2d 1118 (1988). The commissioner\u2019s decision may be appealed to the review division, as it was here, pursuant to \u00a7 31-301 (a). See footnote 4. The review division does not, however, conduct a de novo review of the facts. Instead, the appeal is restricted to the record of the hearing before the commissioner, and the facts found by the commissioner. The commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the injury did not arise out of the course of the plaintiff\u2019s employment is accorded the same deference given to similar conclusions of a trial judge or jury on the issue of proximate cause. <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 347. If supported by competent evidence and not inconsistent with the law, the commissioner\u2019s inference that an injury did or did not arise out of and in the course of employment is, thus, conclusive. <em>Fair </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In the present case, the commissioner had before him conflicting evidence as to the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s stress. There was competent evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s stress was caused by traumatic events from her personal life that were not related to her employment. Borden stated in his deposition that the plaintiff\u2019s anxiety attacks were caused by the events from her personal life and not by her workload. He opined that it was the plaintiff\u2019s inability to face these trying obstacles in her life that led to her anxiety attacks. Because the commissioner\u2019s determination that the plaintiff\u2019s injury did not arise out of and in the course of employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>ment was supported by competent evidence and was not inconsistent with the law, we conclude that the review division properly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-297 (b) provides: \u201cWhenever liability to pay compensation is contested by the employer, he shall file with the compensation commissioner, on or before the twentieth day after he has received written notice of claim, a notice in accord with the form prescribed by the commissioner stating that the right to compensation is contested, the name of the claimant, the name of the employer, the date of alleged injury or death and the specific grounds on which the right to compensation is contested, and a copy thereof shall be sent to the employee. If the employer or his legal representative fails to file the notice contesting liability within the time prescribed herein, the employer shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability of such alleged injury or death and shall have no right thereafter to contest the employee\u2019s right to receive compensation on any grounds or the extent of his disability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b558-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-294 provides in pertinent part: \u201cnotice op injury and of claim for compensation.

No proceedings for compensation under the provisions of this chapter shall be maintained unless a written notice of claim for compensation is given within one year from the date of accident or within .three years from the first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease, as the case may be, which caused the personal injury . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b559-6\"> The plaintiff sought temporary total disability benefits for the periods January 25 through September 25,1989, and December 29, 1989, through July 24,1990.

In her notice of claim, the plaintiff referred to the defendant as \u201cDept, of Children &amp; Youth Services\u201d instead of using its full name, \u201cState of Connecticut, Department of Children and Youth Services.\u201d The commissioner denied the plaintiffs motion to preclude on the ground, inter alia, that the notice of claim \u201cfailed to fully and properly state the name of claimant\u2019s employer.\u201d Relying on its previous holdings in <em>Salvaggio </em>v. <em>Candlewood Valley Bus Co., </em>6 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 156 (1989), and <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Central Paving Co., </em>5 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 92 (1988), the review division affirmed and stated: \u201c[F]or a claimant to prevail on a Motion to Preclude the written notice of claim must strictly meet all of the technical requirements of Sec. 31-294.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AnyQ\">Because we hold that the defendant\u2019s disclaimer was sufficiently specific to fulfill its obligation under \u00a7 31-297 (b) and therefore withstand the plaintiffs motion to preclude, our disposition of this issue does not affect the outcome of this case. We address it, however, in order to clarify a miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>ception on behalf of the review division regarding the standard by which the sufficiency of a notice of claim to trigger an employer\u2019s obligation to respond under \u00a7 31-297 (b) should be judged.</p>\n<p id=\"ANI\">The rule of strict compliance adopted by the review division is not supported by either the plain language or the legislative history of \u00a7 31-297 (b). To the contrary, \u00a7 31-297 (b) is remedial legislation that should be liberally construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose. <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>222 Conn. 62, 67, 607 A.2d 431 (1992). Specifically, as noted above, it was enacted to require a prompt and thorough investigation of the employee\u2019s claim so as to yield a specific disclaimer of liability and to avoid unnecessary delay in the adjudication of workers\u2019 claims. As a result, if the notice of claim is sufficient to allow the employer to make a timely investigation of the claim, it triggers the employer\u2019s obligation to file a disclaimer. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"AmCY\">In the present case, the claimed defect in no way prejudiced the defendant by hindering its ability to investigate the claim. In fact, the defendant was able to file a timely disclaimer that specifically declared that the plaintiff\u2019s injury did not arise out of and in the course of employment. We conclude therefore that, on these facts, the plaintiff\u2019s notice of claim was sufficient to trigger the defendant\u2019s obligation to file a disclaimer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
