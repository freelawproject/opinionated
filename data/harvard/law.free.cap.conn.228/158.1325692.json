J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWd\">The principal issue in this appeal is the proper scope of the \u201cinvasion of personal privacy\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>exception codified in General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant freedom of information commission (FOIC), ordered the defendant John Gawrys, superintendent of the New Fairfield public schools, to disclose the sick leave records of the plaintiff school teacher, Karen Perkins, to the defendants Arthur E. Azzarito and the New Fairfield Taxpayers Association (association). The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, which reversed the decision of the FOIC on the ground that the FOIC lacked authority to require disclosure because the request in question was purely for information rather than one for specifically identifiable records. The FOIC<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We disagree with the trial court\u2019s ruling and therefore reverse its order sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The material facts are undisputed. On June 17,1991, Azzarito, the president of the association, made a written request to the holder of records of the New Fair-field board of education for information pertaining to sick leave records regarding the psychologist position held by the plaintiff at Consolidated School. The purpose of his request was to ascertain the number of sick days that she had accumulated, the amount of money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>that had been paid to her to the date of his request, and the date on which she had last worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">On June 17, 1991, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 l-20a (b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Gawrys sent a letter to the plaintiff notifying her that the school district had received a request for the disclosure of her accumulated sick leave prior to the commencement of her sick leave for the current year, and that the district had denied the request on the grounds that disclosure would constitute an invasion of her privacy. The letter also informed the plaintiff that she had four business days from the receipt of the letter to notify the school district as to whether she had an objection to the disclosure of those records, and that the records would be disclosed absent such an objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The plaintiff filed a timely objection with Gawrys, who, in turn, sent a letter to Azzarito denying the records request. Thereafter, Azzarito and the association sent a letter to the FOIC urging it to require compliance with their request.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">After an evidentiary hearing, the FOIC rendered its final decision ordering Gawrys to provide copies of the requested records to Azzarito and the association. The FOIC found that Azzarito had requested information limited to records concerning the plaintiffs sick pay rather than information about the nature of her illness or the state of her health. The FOIC determined that the plaintiff \u201chas no reasonable expectation of confiden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>tiality regarding the characterization of her compensation and absence from work so long as the characterization [is congruent with] the terms of her contract . . . .\u201d Stating that \u201ca reasonable person would not suffer embarrassment as a result of the disclosure of information concerning sick time and compensation, because sick time is an ordinary benefit of employment that is generally used by employees in accordance with specific contract provisions,\u201d the FOIC decided that the \u201cinvasion of personal privacy\u201d exception of \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) did not apply because \u201cthe exemption was not intended to shield the misconduct of public officials from public knowledge.\u201d Id., 3. The FOIC concluded, therefore, that Gawrys and the plaintiff had not met their burden of proof with respect to the invasion of privacy exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The plaintiff filed a timely appeal to the Superior Court. After a hearing, the trial court sustained her appeal. Having first determined that the plaintiff was aggrieved by the FOIC decision requiring disclosure of her sick leave records, the court then, sua sponte, framed and resolved an issue concerning the nature of the request for disclosure made by Azzarito and the association. Relying on the definition of \u201cpublic records or files\u201d contained in General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court determined that Azzarito\u2019s request was one \u201cfor <em>answers </em>to questions and not a request for <em>access </em>to public records which might contain the answers to his questions. His request [sought] pure information and not specifically identifiable records.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Explaining that this distinction was \u201cnot a formal or hypertechnica! one,\u201d the court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Azzarito had failed to meet his burden of identifying the records that he sought to inspect. In the absence of a proper request, the court held that the FOIC had no way of knowing the type of documents or materials that were being sought and, thus, could not properly determine whether a FOIA violation had occurred or a FOIA exemption was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The FOIC has appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. The FOIC first maintains that the trial court mistakenly concluded that the form of the request made by the defendants, Azzarito and the association, deprived the FOIC of authority to find a FOIA violation. Second, the FOIC argues that the trial court should have found that, under General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the administrative record contained substantial evidence to support the commission\u2019s order of disclosure and that its order is justified by an appropriately limited construction of the \u201cinvasion of personal privacy\u201d exception found in \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2). We agree with both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">We must first resolve the issue of the nature of the request that Azzarito and the association made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Gawrys.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> All of the parties to this case, including the FOIC,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> treated the request as one for the plaintiff\u2019s sick leave records and, thus, within the province of the FOIA. The trial court nonetheless, sua sponte, characterized the request as one for \u201cpure information,\u201d <em>\u201canswers </em>to questions,\u201d and \u201cnot specifically identifiable [public] records,\u201d outside the scope of the FOIC\u2019s authority. (Emphasis in original.) We disagree with the trial court\u2019s characterization.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Our resolution of this issue is guided by the limited scope of judicial review afforded by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act; General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq.; to the determinations made by an administrative agency.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c[W]e must decide, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily or illegally, or abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Ottochian </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 393, 397, 604 A.2d 351 (1992). Even as to questions of law, \u201c[t]he court\u2019s ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>mate duty is only to decide whether, <em>in light of the evidence, </em>the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion. (Emphasis added.) . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>205 Conn. 767, 774, 535 A.2d 1297 (1988). \u201cAlthough the interpretation of statutes is ultimately a question of law . . . it is the well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 489, 496, 512 A.2d 199, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 1023, 107 S. Ct. 781, 93 L. Ed. 2d 819 (1986); see also <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 773-74; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 342-43, 435 A.2d 353 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The FOIA states that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by any federal law or state statute [including the exceptions to the FOIA], all records maintained or kept on file by any public agency . . . shall be public records and every person shall have the right to inspect such records promptly during regular office or business hours or to receive a copy of such records in accordance with the provisions of section 1-15. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (a). The act specifically defines \u201c \u2018[p]ublic records or files\u2019 \u201d to include \u201cany recorded data or information relating to the conduct of the pub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>lie\u2019s business prepared, owned, used, received or retained by a public agency . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 M8a (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Azzarito and the association made a written request to Gawrys<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> pertaining to the plaintiff\u2019s sick leave records that was consistently treated, by all the parties, as a request for records. See footnote 8. Neither the plaintiff nor Gawrys ever asked for any clarification regarding the specific information that Azzarito and the association sought, and none of the parties to this case ever made any suggestion that the requested information was not part of the plaintiff\u2019s existing public record.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Although we have not previously had the occasion to articulate an interpretation of what constitutes a FOIA records request, this issue is similar to others in which courts must defer to the exercise of administrative judgment. \u201cThe FOIC has full authority to determine the existence of public records and the propriety of their disclosure.\u201d <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>208 Conn. 442, 454, 545 A.2d 1064 (1988). The FOIC properly, albeit implicitly, reached the conclusion that Azzarito and the association had submitted a request for records. The trial court\u2019s contrary conclusion relied on distinctions that are overly formal and legalistic in light of the public policy expressed by the FOIA. The overarching legislative policy of the FOIA is one that favors \u201cthe open conduct of government and free public access to government records.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 328; <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 193, 196, 585 A.2d 96 (1991); <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>192 Conn. 310, 315, 472 A.2d 321 (1984). As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>have repeatedly noted, \u201c[o]ur construction of the FOIA must be guided by the policy favoring disclosure. . . .\u201d <em>Superintendent of Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>222 Conn. 621, 626, 609 A.2d 998 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">As a practical matter, the FOIA is used repeatedly by members of the public who are unschooled in technical, legalistic language distinctions. It would be unreasonable to deny a member of the public access to the FOIA simply because of arguable imperfections in the form in which a request for public records is couched. A talismanic insistence on the use of the word \u201crecord\u201d would be inconsistent with the spirit and the policy of the FOIA. The trial court\u2019s contrary ruling cannot, therefore, be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Although the request for the plaintiff\u2019s sick leave records was a request within the jurisdiction of the FOIC, the question remains whether the records were exempt from disclosure pursuant to the \u201cinvasion of personal privacy\u201d exception contained in \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2). We conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, because the inquiry was limited to a request for numerical data, the FOIC correctly ordered disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">\u201c[T]he general rule under the Freedom of Information Act is disclosure with the exceptions to this rule being narrowly construed. The burden of establishing the applicability of an exemption clearly rests upon the party claiming the exemption.\u201d <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 775; <em>Superintendent of Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra; <em>Ottochian </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 232, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992); <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>201 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Conn. 421, 431, 518 A.2d 49 (1986); <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information </em>Commission, supra; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">When the claim for exemption involves \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2), \u201c[t]he plaintiffs must meet a twofold burden of proof .... First, they must establish that the files in question are within the categories of files protected by the exemption, that is, personnel, medical or \u2018similar\u2019 files. Second, they must show that disclosure of the records \u2018would constitute an invasion of personal privacy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 431-32; <em>Superintendent of Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra; <em>Ottochian </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 399-400; <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra; <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>210 Conn. 590, 595, 556 A.2d 592 (1989). In this case, because the defendants have conceded, at oral argument, that the FOIA request sought the disclosure of personnel records, we need only determine whether their request \u201cconstitute[s] an invasion of personal privacy.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The FOIA contains no definition of the phrase \u201cinvasion of personal privacy.\u201d Moreover, the parties have cited no relevant legislative history that sheds light on its meaning and we have found none. The legislature substituted the current phraseology in 1967; Public Acts 1967, No. 723, \u00a7 1; for a provision in the original FOIA, enacted in 1957, that denied access to a public record if \u201cnecessary to provide reasonable protection to the reputation or character of any person.\u201d Public Acts 1957, No. 428, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At the time of the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>change, Representative Robert B. August stated, on the floor of the house, that its interpretation would be left to the courts. 7 H.R. Proe., Pt. 5, 1957 Sess., p. 2655.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Although this court has had previous occasions to apply the statutory exemption for \u201cinvasion of personal privacy\u201d in the circumstances of a particular case; see, e.g., <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 198; we have not undertaken to articulate a comprehensive definition of what this phrase means. We have, in effect, imposed a burden of proof on a claimant for an exemption without providing guidelines as to what such a claimant must show in order to obtain relief from the general rule that public records are subject to public disclosure. The time has come to fill this void.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In the absence of express statutory guidance on the meaning of the phrase, \u201cinvasion of personal privacy,\u201d the legislature has required us to inquire whether this phrase is a legal term of art that has \u201cacquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law\u201d so to require it to be \u201cconstrued and understood accordingly.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). This court has stated that \u201clegal terms . . . absent any legislative intent shown to the contrary, are to be presumed to be used in their legal sense. . . . Words with a fixed legal or judicially settled meaning must be presumed to have been used in that sense. ... In ascertaining legislative intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>[rjather than using terms in their everyday sense, [t]he law uses familiar legal expressions in their familiar legal sense. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 70-71, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985); see also <em>Southington </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>210 Conn. 549, 561, 556 A.2d 166 (1989) (terms not defined in statutes should be given common or legal understanding); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>183 Conn. 183, 186, 438 A.2d 859 (1981); <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>Solazzi, </em>79 Conn. 541, 546, 65 A. 947 (1907). We therefore deem it appropriate to construe the phrase, \u201cinvasion of personal privacy,\u201d according to its common-law meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">As a common-law matter, the privacy concerns embedded in the \u201cinvasion of personal privacy\u201d exemption from the FOIA mirror developing notions of protection for personal privacy that have emerged in a variety of legal contexts since the latter part of the nineteenth century.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although the precise definition of a right to privacy varies with the particular context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>in which the right has been recognized,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the statutory exemption finds its most persuasive common-law counterpart in the tort of invasion of privacy,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> particularly in that aspect of the tort of invasion of privacy that provides a remedy for unreasonable publicity given to a person\u2019s private life. 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 652D (1977). \u201c[T]he context in which [this tort] has emerged and the considerations surrounding its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>development are uniquely analogous to the values and interests [that the state FOIA exemption] appears designed to protect.\u201d <em>Hearst Corp. </em>v. <em>Hoppe, </em>90 Wash. 2d 123, 136, 580 P.2d 246 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Section 652D of the Restatement (Second) of Torts defines a tort action for the invasion of personal privacy as being triggered by public disclosure of any matter that \u201c(a) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (b) is not of legitimate concern to the public.\u201d By its terms, therefore, the tort action provides a private remedy to implement a public policy that closely approximates the public policy embodied in \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) of the FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The commentary accompanying \u00a7 652D underscores the close relationship between the tort action and the statutory exemption. Comment (b) of \u00a7 652D describes the types of personal and private information that are given protection under the law of torts: \u201cEvery individual has some phases of his life and his activities and some facts about himself that he does not expose to the public eye, but keeps entirely to himself or at most reveals only to his family or to close personal friends. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Sexual relations, for example, are normally entirely private matters, as are family quarrels, many unpleasant or disgraceful or humiliating illnesses, most intimate personal letters, most details of a man\u2019s life in his home, and some of his past history that he would rather forget. When these intimate details of his life are spread before the public gaze in a manner highly offensive to the ordinary reasonable man, there is an actionable invasion of his privacy, unless the matter is one of legitimate public interest.\u201d 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 652D, comment b (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Comment (c) of \u00a7 652D recognizes, however, that not all personal and private information is protected from public disclosure: \u201cThe rule stated in [\u00a7 652D] gives protection only against unreasonable publicity, of a kind highly offensive to the ordinary reasonable [person]. The protection afforded to the plaintiff\u2019s interest in his privacy must be relative to the customs of the time and place, to the occupation of the plaintiff and to the habits of his neighbors and fellow citizens. Complete privacy does not exist in this world except in a desert, and anyone who is not a hermit must expect and endure the ordinary incidents of the community life of which he is a part. . . . Even minor and moderate annoyance . . . is not sufficient to give him a cause of action under the rule stated in this Section. It is only when the publicity given to him is such that a reasonable person would feel justified in feeling seriously aggrieved by it, that the cause of action arises.\u201d Finally, the Restatement recognizes that there is no invasion of a right to privacy when the subject matter of the publicity is of legitimate public concern. 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 652D, comment (d) (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The analogy between the tort action for \u201cpublicity given to private life\u201d and the statutory exemption for invasion of personal privacy under \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) of the FOIA is close and compelling. We have recognized that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>a reasonable expectation of privacy must be viewed from the vantage point of an objective, ordinary reasonable person when we have held that a \u201cperson\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy ... [is a] significant factor ... in determining if disclosure [of public records] would constitute an invasion of privacy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>West Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>218 Conn. 256, 263, 588 A.2d 1368 (1991); <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 198. Therefore, the tort standard would only supply a remedy for, and \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) of the FOIA would only bar disclosure of, information that is highly offensive to the ordinary reasonable person. The legislature has, furthermore, determined that disclosures relating to the employees of public agencies are presumptively legitimate matters of public concern. That presumption is not, however, conclusive. In <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, we held that the disclosure of internal, departmental, personnel evaluations would constitute an invasion of privacy in part because the evaluations were conducted under appropriate confidential circumstances with the employees, thereby making such reports matters that do not legitimately concern the public. See id., 205 <em>(Borden, J., </em>concurring) (\u201c[disclosing [personnel evaluations] would severely undermine the policy of full and frank exchange of information underlying the need for such reports\u201d). On the other hand, the fact that a personnel file includes information about the acceptance of a bribe by a public employee or a medical file includes information about the incapacity of a high ranking public official to perform his or her duties because of an illness that would be considered highly offensive to a reasonable person would not preclude its disclosure if such information were determined to be of legitimate public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Informed by the tort standard, the invasion of personal privacy exception of \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) precludes disclosure, therefore, only when the information sought by a request does not pertain to legitimate matters of public concern and is highly offensive to a reasonable person. Enunciation of this standard does not signal a return to the invocation of a balancing test, which we explicitly rejected in <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 200-201. We conclude, as have courts in other jurisdictions, that an objective standard derived from the law of torts affords useful insight into the meaning of the phrase \u201cinvasion of personal privacy.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Cox Enterprises, Inc., </em>256 Ga. 299, 348 S.E.2d 448 (1986) (applying common-law tort standard with language similar to the Restatement standard); <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Shreveport, </em>371 So. 2d 316 (La.

Instead, we are judging an invasion of personal privacy in terms of the objective common law concept of the \u201creasonable person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Having articulated the standard and burden of proof that a party must meet in order to claim an \u201cinvasion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>of personal privacy\u201d exemption, we must now determine whether the plaintiff has met her burden in this case. We conclude that the FOIC correctly determined that she had failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The plaintiff, relying on the authority of <em>New London </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New London at New London, Docket No. 28067 (October 25,1978), claims that any disclosure of a named employee\u2019s sick leave records constitutes a per se invasion of privacy. She argues that disclosure of her sick leave records would allow the recipient to compare them with the number of sick leave days allowed by her contract, enabling the recipient to know whether the plaintiff is \u201csickly\u201d or \u201chealthy.\u201d Such knowledge, she contends, could lead to a public discussion of her health and, thus, result in her embarrassment and an invasion of her personal privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u201c [Unsupported conclusory allegations of counsel are not evidence and are insufficient for the application of an exemption from disclosure.\u201d <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 776. \u201cThe burden of establishing the applicability of an exemption . . . requires the claimant . . . to provide more than conclusory language, generalized allegations or mere arguments of counsel. Rather, a sufficiently detailed record must reflect the reasons why an exemption applies to the materials requested.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 775-76; <em>Superintendent of Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 627; <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 434-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">We disagree with the plaintiff that a request for the numerical data dealing with a public employee\u2019s sick leave records constitutes a per se invasion of personal privacy. The plaintiff\u2019s proof consisted of little more than conclusory language and resort to unsubstantiated hypotheticals. Because of the lack of evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>record from which the FOIC could reasonably have found support under either the new standard articulated herein or the prior standard for her conclusions and hypotheticals, the plaintiff cannot possibly prove that disclosure of the numerical data in her sick leave records would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. Thus, it does not have to be determined if the disclosure of such records is of legitimate concern to the public. The plaintiff has not met her burden under the statute and, therefore, she may not prevent disclosure of the requested records by virtue of the exemption contained in \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Finally, we note that when a person accepts public employment, he or she becomes a servant of and accountable to the public. As a result, that person\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy is diminished, especially in regard to the dates and times required to perform public duties. The public has a right to know not only who their public employees are, but also when their public employees are and are not performing their duties. We conclude that a records request under the FOIA for disclosure of the numerical data concerning an employee\u2019s attendance records, including or limited to sick leave, does not constitute an invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2). Disclosure in this instance is required.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">In this opinion Callahan, Norcott and Palmer, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 provides in pertinent part: \u201caccess to public RECORDS.

For example, Ruth Gavison has defined privacy as \u201cour concern over our accessibility to others: the extent to which we are known to others, the extent to which others have physical access to us, and the extent to which we are the subject of others\u2019 attention.\u201d R.

Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d as \u201c[t]he unwarranted appropriation or exploitation of one\u2019s personality, publicizing one\u2019s private affairs with which public has no legitimate concern, or wrongful intrusion into one\u2019s private activities, in such a manner as to cause mental suffering, shame or humiliation to person of ordinary sensibilities. <em>Shorter </em>v. <em>Retail Credit Co., D.C.S.C., </em>251 F.Supp. 329, 330 [D.S.C. 1966].

Such invasion by an individual or the government may constitute an actionable tort; though public figures have less protection than private persons.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). This definition clearly implicates the tort of invasion of privacy stated in the Restatement. 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 652A (2) (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b193-7\"> See, e.g., W.

I disagree, however, with the analysis in part II. With respect to part II, namely, the application of the statutory phrase, \u201cinvasion of personal privacy,\u201d to the facts of this case, I reach the same result as does the majority, but by a different route.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The majority opinion essentially rests on four related arguments. First, because neither the statute nor our cases have articulated a comprehensive definition of the phrase, \u201cinvasion of personal privacy,\u201d as it is used in General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2), guidelines are needed to fill that gap so that claimants of the statutory exemption may know what they must show. Second, the majority suggests that the legislature, by using the phrase \u201cinvasion of personal privacy,\u201d intended the courts to construe that phrase according to its common-law meaning, by virtue of General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Third, the most persuasive common-law counterpart to the statutory phrase is the tort of invasion of privacy, particularly that strand of the tort defined by \u00a7 652D of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1977). Fourth, the Restatement definition of the tort of invasion of privacy is public disclosure of any matter that \u201c(a) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (b) is not of legitimate concern to the public.\u201d Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>according to the majority, those two elements define the meaning of \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d as used in \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">I agree with the majority to the extent that its first argument rests on the notion that some further judicial definition of the statutory phrase is needed. I disagree, however, that it is now necessary to arrive at a \u201ccomprehensive definition\u201d that will \u201cfill the gap\u201d purportedly encountered by claimants who wish to avail themselves of the privacy exemption in \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2). For the reasons stated below, I prefer to continue to carve out the meaning of the phrase on a case-by-case basis, as opposed to adopting a definition that is, in my view, not well adapted to the interests implicated in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). I also believe that such a gradual adjudicative process was what the legislature intended when it enacted the phrase in 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">I disagree with the suggestion of the majority that the legislature intended the phrase, \u201cinvasion of personal privacy,\u201d as used in \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2), to have the same meaning as \u00a7 652D of the Restatement. That phrase is not, as the majority suggests, a legal term of art that has acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, within the contemplation of \u00a7 1-1 (a). The phraseology used by the Restatement is not \u201cinvasion of personal privacy\u201d but \u201cone who invades <em>the right of privacy of another.\u201d </em>3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 652A (1977). Similarly, the phraseology used by our cases is \u201can invasion of privacy action.\u201d <em>Venturi </em>v. <em>Savitt, Inc., </em>191 Conn. 588, 591, 468 A.2d 933 (1983). While this may appear to be semantic quibbling, I suggest that semantic differences, albeit slight, do or should affect the determination of whether the legislature has, by using particular language, intended the language as a term of art that incorporates another body of law.</p>\n<p id=\"All\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>This is particularly apt here where, contrary to the majority assertion that there is no relevant legislative history, the legislative history suggests to the contrary. The quotation from Representative Robert B. August regarding the meaning of \u201cinvasion of personal privacy\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is like Sherlock Holmes\u2019 inference from the silence of a dog that usually howled: it is relevant for what it does not say.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the legislature had intended to incorporate, by virtue of the operation of \u00a7 1-1 (a), the common-law tort of invasion of privacy, as ultimately reflected in \u00a7 652D of the Restatement,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>1 would have thought that, when addressing the particular issue, someone would have said so, rather than saying something quite different. Instead, Representative August\u2019s statement is more plausibly understood as an invitation to the courts to develop our own interpretive gloss on the statutory phrase based, not on the common law of torts, but on the language and purposes of the FOIA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Moreover, my conclusion that \u201cinvasion of personal privacy\u201d is not a term of art within the meaning of \u00a7 1-1 (a) so as to invoke \u00a7 652D of the Restatement is buttressed by the fact that, as the majority recognizes, invasion of privacy has many different meanings in the law, all of which depend on the particular context and on the particular interests that are at stake. See majority opinion, footnote 15. Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s argument, \u201cinvasion of personal privacy\u201d is <em>not </em>a phrase that has \u201cacquired <em>a </em>peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law\u201d so as to require it to be \u201cconstrued and understood accordingly.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). Instead, it is a phrase that has acquired <em>a number </em>of meanings in the law, and absent some indication that the legislature intended it to have a particular one of those meanings, we cannot say that it was intended to have a particular \u201cpeculiar and appropriate meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">This brings me to another fundamental difference with the analysis employed by the majority. Section 652D of the Restatement addresses the question of the circumstances under which a tort action for invasion of the right to privacy exists. Like all tort law, it is concerned with who shall bear the loss\u2014whether the defendant should be required to compensate the plaintiff for harm caused by the disclosure of certain private facts. It addresses the question of whether, <em>the disclosure already having been made, </em>the courts ought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>to require money to change hands. Thus, it is concerned mainly with loss shifting interests, principally between private, not governmental, parties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This set of interests simply does not fit the quite different inquiry, required by \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2), of whether presumptive disclosure by the government is prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Furthermore, the standard in \u00a7 652D of the Restatement that the information \u201cis not of legitimate concern to the public,\u201d adopted by the majority as part of the meaning of \u201cinvasion of personal privacy,\u201d necessarily returns us to the balancing test that we explicitly rejected in <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 193, 585 A.2d 96 (1991), the disclaimer of the majority to the contrary notwithstanding. The language of the Restatement is derived from, and the commentary specifically invokes, <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>420 U.S. 469, 95 S. Ct. 1029, 43 L. Ed. 2d 328 (1975). See 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 652D, comment (d) (1977). In explaining that concept in <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp., </em>the United States Supreme Court indicated, implicitly at least, that a balancing test was involved. \u201cIf there are privacy interests to be protected in judicial proceedings, the States must respond by means which avoid public documentation or other exposure of private information. <em>Their political institutions must weigh the interests in privacy with the interests of the public to know and of the press to publish. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>supra, 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Once we embark, in the FOIA context, on determining whether the information sought is of \u201clegitimate concern to the public,\u201d it will be very difficult to avoid balancing the public\u2019s need to know with the individual\u2019s assertion of privacy. Notions of legitimacy are necessarily contextual and fact driven, and will end up in balancing, either explicitly, or implicitly without acknowledgment. Indeed, even the fourth amendment concept of a criminal defendant\u2019s \u201clegitimate expectation of privacy\u201d sometimes involves a balancing test. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>218 Conn. 85, 96, 588 A.2d 145, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 919, 112 S. Ct. 330, 116 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1991), <em>citing Hudson </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 527, 104 S. Ct. 3194, 82 L. Ed. 2d 393 (1984) (no legitimate expectation of privacy in prison cell because society\u2019s interest in security of penal institutions outweighs prisoner\u2019s interest in privacy within cell).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Moreover, even if we are somehow able to avoid a balancing test, the majority, by emphasizing that offensiveness and legitimacy are two separate prongs, both of which must be established independently, has nonetheless engrafted a new concept onto the language of \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2). That section provides only that certain records are exempt from disclosure if disclosure would constitute an invasion of personal privacy. It does not provide that the invasion must be accompanied by a lack of legitimate public need for disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">This conclusion is reinforced by \u00a7 1-19 (b) (l),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which explicitly mentions the public\u2019s interest in disclosure. The absence of any such language in subdivision (2) indicates that the legislature did not intend the public inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>est to be a factor under subdivision (2). See <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 200, in which we adopted the same reasoning in eschewing a balancing test in subdivision (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">I recognize that it is convenient to adopt the Restatement formulation of the tort of invasion of privacy, because it gives us an entire body of law and analytical framework, rather than having to struggle with the concept of invasion of personal privacy on a case-by-case basis, as we have been doing. I suggest, however, that that body of law and framework are simply not what the legislature meant, and were not designed to govern issues of disclosure under the FOIA. Indeed, that body of law may well give us more than we want, because in future cases we will inevitably be confronted with precedents under \u00a7 652D of the Restatement that will be pressed upon us, with considerable persuasive force, but that may well prove unsuited to the interests protected by the FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">What, then, would I substitute for the test adopted by the majority in this case? Although I agree with the majority that further guidance on the meaning of the statutory language is in order, I disagree that a comprehensive definition is now needed in order \u201cto fill this gap.\u201d I see no evidence, either in this record or in our cases under the FOIA generally, to suggest that the case-by-case adjudication method of defining the statutory meaning of \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d has hindered such claimants from securing their rights under the exemption, where warranted. Since we abandoned the balancing test in 1991; see <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra; this is only the second case that has called upon us to evaluate a claim that disclosure of material would constitute an \u201cinvasion of [the] personal privacy\u201d of the claimant. See <em>West Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>218 Conn. 256, 588 A.2d 1368 (1991) (although ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>an address is not a private fact, municipal retirees should be afforded opportunity to show that, by virtue of their significant efforts, they have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their addresses). It may be, as the majority suggests, that the absence of a comprehensive definition makes it more difficult for such claimants than would otherwise be the case, but that is simply the inevitable result of being required by the legislature to meet a standard that necessarily is broadly phrased and that requires a case-by-case treatment\u2014at least until there are sufficient cases decided that suggest, by their facts and reasoning, more definite contours.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">I would conclude, instead, that the statutory language does not warrant anything more than the adoption of a general objective standard of reasonableness under all of the circumstances, in the determination of whether disclosure would constitute such an invasion. I would continue to fill the gap by referring to what we said in <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, with further refinements required by the facts and claims in this case. In <em>Chairman, </em>we outlined several \u201csignificant factors in determining if disclosure would constitute an invasion of privacy.\u201d Id., 198. These were: (1) whether the claimant had a \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d in the material sought to be disclosed; id.; (2) the \u201cpotential for embarrassment\u201d; id.; (3) \u201cwhether the individual [whose privacy is at stake] originally gave the information to the government agency with the reasonable expectation that the material would be considered private\u201d; id.; (4) the interest of government officials \u201cin preserving the secrecy of matters that conceivably could subject them to annoyance or harassment in either their official or private lives\u201d; id., 199; and (5) whether disclosure would severely undermine a strong public policy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>such as \u201cthe need for full and frank exchange of information relating to the evaluation of public employees.\u201d Id., 204 <em>(Borden, J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s claims in this case warrant further explication of the first factor noted above, namely, whether the claimant had a <em>reasonable </em>expectation of privacy in the material. As with any elaboration of reasonableness, the standard must be applied in light of all of the circumstances of the case. In this respect, I agree with the majority that the language of comment (b) to \u00a7 652D of the Restatement is useful for that further explication\u2014not, however, because \u00a7 652D is suggested by \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2), but because that language is simply a very good description of what a reasonable expectation of privacy is and is not in this day and age.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">I would, therefore, add to the factors listed above the following additional guide to the application of the general standard of reasonableness: The protection afforded by the statutory language, \u201cinvasion of personal privacy,\u201d must be gauged in relation to the customs of the time and place, to the occupation of the claimant, including the fact that he may be a public employee rather than a private citizen,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and to the habits of his neighbors and fellow citizens. See 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 652D, comment (c) (1977). As the commentary to the Restatement states, \u201c[cjomplete privacy does not exist in this world except in a desert, and anyone who is not a hermit must expect and endure the ordinary incidents of the community life of which he is a part.\u201d Id. Even moderate annoyance is not sufficient to justify the statutory privacy exemption. Only when the disclosure would be such that a reasonable person would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>be justified in feeling seriously aggrieved by it does the statutory exemption apply. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Applying these factors, I have no difficulty concluding that, under the facts of this case, the plaintiff has not established her entitlement to the exemption. The specific information sought in this case was the number of sick days that the plaintiff had accumulated, the amount of money paid to her up to the date of the request, and the date on which she had last worked. Without belaboring the point, I would conclude that none of the factors listed above would justify the application of the statutory exemption to this information. Thus, I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that disclosure in this instance is required.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 provides in pertinent part: \u201cwords and phrases.

I also recognize that the majority\u2019s argument is not that the legislature intended in 1967 to adopt a standard that was not formulated until 1977, but that the legislature intended the phrase to be read in its common-law meaning, and that the most persuasive common-law counterpart to the statutory phrase is the tort of invasion of privacy, which is generally understood to be defined by \u00a7 652D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b202-9\"> Indeed, if the legislature had intended in 1967 simply to incorporate the common-law tort of invasion of privacy because the legislative phrase had acquired a peculiar and appropriate legal meaning, it is curious that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>until the majority\u2019s argument in this case, no one, including the freedom of information commission, which has been charged with enforcing the FOIA, has even suggested such an interpretation for the twenty-six years that the phrase has been employed under the FOIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b203-9\"> Indeed, the Restatement itself, as the majority recognizes, identifies four different types of \u201cinvasion of the right of privacy of another,\u201d none of which has much if anything to do with the other three. I do not agree that we can legitimately say that the legislature intended one of those four to define the contours of the legislative language simply because that one seems to deal with issues similar to the legislative language, albeit in a very different context and for very different purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b204-6\"> Indeed, under the FOIA it is the government that discloses, and, insofar as I know, there is no waiver of sovereign immunity for harm caused by such a disclosure. It is therefore anomalous to employ a standard of tort law that would not even apply to the party who makes the disclosure. In effect, the majority has substituted the administrative appeal process (assuming that the person whose privacy has purportedly been invaded appeals a freedom of information commission determination of disclosure) for what would otherwise have been a tort remedy against the disclosing agency for its past disclosure. That may be a rational public policy, but I cannot find it expressed anywhere in the FOIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 provides in pertinent part: \u201caccess to public RECORDS.
