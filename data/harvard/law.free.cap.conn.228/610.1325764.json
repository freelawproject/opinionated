The defendant was charged in a substitute information with eight counts of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> eight counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and one count of assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (l).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He was found guilty by a jury on all counts of sexual assault in the second degree and risk of injury to a child. He was acquitted of the assault charge. The trial court sentenced the defendant to a term of imprisonment of twenty-four years, execution suspended after twelve years, followed by five years probation. Thereafter, the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court. We transferred his appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. The defendant began to make sexual overtures to the victim, who was the daughter of a neighbor and a friend of his own daughter, sometime in 1982, when the victim was approximately eight years old and in the third grade. In response to the victim\u2019s protests, the defendant told her that he would leave her alone if she allowed him to take topless photographs of her. When the victim complied, however, the defendant persisted in his contact with her, threatening to show the photographs to her friends if she refused to see him. By the time the victim was in the fourth, grade, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>defendant had begun to molest her physically. At some point, while she was still in the fourth or fifth grade, the defendant began to have sexual intercourse with the victim. Even after she moved out of his neighborhood, the defendant continued on a regular basis to have sexual relations with the victim in his van at various locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">When the victim was in the tenth grade, she told the defendant that she wanted him to leave her alone and that she no longer cared what he did with photographs he had taken. At that time, the victim\u2019s parents were in the process of attempting to adopt a little girl. When the victim persisted in her refusal to see him, the defendant intimated to her that the adoption would not go through if the authorities were notified of their relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The sexual relationship between the defendant and the victim continued until March, 1989. At that time, the defendant, in an attempt to end a platonic friendship between the victim and a classmate named Marvin, told her to advise Marvin that she was pregnant and provided her with a falsified home pregnancy test that ostensibly displayed a positive result. Marvin promptly informed the victim\u2019s parents. When confronted by her mother, the victim broke down and told her of the nature of her relationship with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">On March 9,1989, the victim gave a statement to the police. The next day, the victim\u2019s mother took her for a medical examination that revealed that the victim was in fact pregnant. On March 22, 1989, the victim had an abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly admitted testimony of the probability of paternity percentage based on DNA testing. We agree and, on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>basis, reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Kevin McElfresh, the state\u2019s expert witness and the director of Identity Testing Laboratories of Lifecodes Corporation (Lifecodes), testified at trial regarding the defendant\u2019s paternity index. The paternity index is an odds ratio, based on DNA tests,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> measuring the likelihood that the defendant would produce a child with the same phenotypes<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as the fetus in question as compared to an unrelated random male. 1 C. McCormick, Evidence (4th Ed. 1992) \u00a7 211, pp. 963-64. The paternity index in this case was 3496,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> indicating that only one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>out of 3497 randomly selected males would have the phenotypes compatible with the fetus in question.* *******<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See R. Peterson, \u201cA New Things You Should Know About Paternity Tests (But Were Afraid to Ask),\u201d 22 Santa Clara L. Rev. 667, 684 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">McElfresh further testified that the paternity index could be converted into a statistic indicating the percentage of the defendant\u2019s probability of paternity. In the present case, he testified that he had made that conversion and that the percentage of probability that it was the defendant who had fathered the fetus was 99.97 percent. The usual method for calculating the probability of paternity, and the method that McElfresh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>used in the present case, is Bayes\u2019 Theorem.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>1 C. McCormick, supra, pp. 962-63. Bayes\u2019 Theorem, a mathematical formula in common use by statisticians, is used for the purpose of \u201cshowing the effect of . . . new [statistical] evidence on a previously [predicted] probability.\u201d Id.; I. Ellman &amp; D. Kaye, \u201cProbabilities and Proof: Can HLA and Blood Group Testing Prove Paternity?\u201d 54 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1131,1148 (1979). In the context of determining paternity, Bayes\u2019 Theorem postulates the multiplication of the paternity index, i.e., the new statistical evidence, by an assumed prior percentage of probability of paternity in order to obtain a new percentage of probability of paternity.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In order to assume a prior probability of paternity, however, it is also necessary to assume a prior probability of intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>In Bayes\u2019 Theorem, the prior probability of paternity is not cast as any particular figure. Generally, experts who testify in paternity proceedings choose a number to represent the prior probability. See I. Ellman &amp; D. Kaye, 54 N.Y.U. L. Rev., supra, p. 1149. Most experts, as did McElfresh here, set the prior probability at 50 percent, expressed as odds of one, i.e., fifty-fifty, reasoning that 50 percent is a neutral starting point because it assumes that it is just as likely that the defendant is not the father as it is that he is the father.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Spann, </em>130 N.J. 484, 493, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>617. A.2d 247 (1993); 1 C. McCormick, supra, p. 963; E. Reisner &amp; T. Bolk, \u201cA Layman\u2019s Guide to the Use of Blood Group Analysis in Paternity Testing,\u201d 20 J. Fam. L. 657, 674 (1981-82). By adopting a prior probability of paternity of 50 percent, the formula operates on the assumption that the defendant and a random male had intercourse with the mother, \u201cmaking them both equally likely to have fathered the child.\u201d R. Peterson, 22 Santa Clara L. Rev., supra, p. 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Our criminal justice system is built upon the premise that the prosecution must prove \u201c \u2018every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which [the defendant] is charged\u2019 beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Salz, </em>226 Conn. 20, 28, 627 A.2d 862 (1993), quoting <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>2d 368 (1970). The right to have one\u2019s guilt proven beyond a reasonable doubt is of constitutional dimension. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>214 Conn. 161, 179, 571 A.2d 79 (1990), citing <em>In re Winship, </em>supra, 362. In a sexual assault prosecution, sexual intercourse is an element that must be proven by the state beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The utilization of Bayes\u2019 Theorem by the prosecution, however, permitted the introduction of evidence predicated on an assumption that there was a fifty-fifty chance that sexual intercourse had occurred in order to prove that sexual intercourse had in fact occurred. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hartman, </em>145 Wis. 2d 1, 426 N.W.2d 320 (1988) (probability of paternity statistic inadmissible in a sexual assault case). The fifty-fifty assumption that sexual intercourse had occurred was not predicated on the evidence in the case but was simply an assumption made by the expert. In dicta in a civil paternity suit, we have said that \u201c[bjecause this probability calculation [is] based upon an assumption of sexual intercourse during the period of conception, its use in proving intercourse would be incorrect.\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>201 Conn. 16, 32-33, 513 A.2d 660 (1986); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hartman, </em>supra, 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Spann, </em>supra, in a somewhat complex opinion, the Supreme Court of New Jersey held that it was reversible error to admit expert testimony of the probability of paternity based on an assumption of a 50 percent prior probability of paternity in a sexual assault case without revealing this assumption to the jury. Because the defendant only objected to the implication that the adoption of a 50 percent prior probability was \u201cneutral,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the court concluded that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>probability of paternity opinion, if admissible at all, is only admissible if the expert states that the calculations leading to that statistic assume a prior probability of paternity of 50 percent.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Id., 499. The court noted that it was not confronted with the issue with which we are confronted: the admissibility of the probability of paternity statistic in a criminal case in which the defendant has not conceded the propriety of any prior probability of paternity. Id., 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Although the New Jersey intermediate appellate court had concluded that \u201cthe State cannot prove intercourse through a formula that assumes intercourse\u201d; id., 496; the Supreme Court stated that that conclusion was incorrect because \u201c[t]he .5 prior-probability assumption . . . says only that the chance that [the] defendant is the father is fifty-fifty, that it is just as likely that he is <em>not </em>the father as that he is . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 496. The court went on to say that the statistic assumes \u201ca substantial possibility, 50%, that he had intercourse with the victim, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>not that he positively did.\u201d Id., 497; see also D. Kaye, \u201cThe Probability of an Ultimate Issue: The Strange Cases of Paternity Testing,\u201d 75 Iowa L. Rev. 75, 105 n.153 (1989) (\u201c[ajlthough the use of the prior probability of 50% . . . does not assume that intercourse definitely took place, it does presuppose a substantial probability of intercourse between the defendant and the mother\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court concluded nonetheless that \u201c[ojpinions based on Bayes\u2019 Theorem . . . are far from universally accepted for forensic purposes, especially in criminal cases. . . . [W]e leave the determination of the admissibility of the probability of paternity opinion to the trial court after a full hearing on the matter.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spann, </em>supra, 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The assumption that there is a substantial possibility that the defendant had intercourse with the victim, however, raises serious concerns in sexual assault cases. It is antithetical to our criminal justice system to presume anything but innocence at the outset of a trial. It is not until the defendant has been convicted that the presumption of innocence disappears. <em>Herrera </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>506 U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 853, 860, 122 L. Ed. 2d 203, reh. denied, U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 1628, 123 L. Ed. 2d 186 (1993). \u201cThe defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence until proven guilty is an \u2018axiomatic and elementary\u2019 principle whose \u2018enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>205 Conn. 370, 376, 533 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>559 (1987), quoting <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>156 U.S. 432, 453, 15 S. Ct. 394, 39 L. Ed. 481 (1895). The presumption allocates the burden of proof in a criminal trial to the state. <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 533, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1979). \u201c[T]o implement that presumption, \u2018courts must be alert to factors that may undermine the fairness of the factfinding process. In the administration of criminal justice, courts must carefully guard against dilution of the principle that guilt is to be established by probative evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship, </em>[supra, 364].\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>201 Conn. 605, 613, 518 A.2d 1377 (1986); <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 503, 96 S. Ct. 1691, 48 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Without first assuming a prior probability of paternity, i.e., guilt, Bayes\u2019 Theorem cannot be applied, and the probability of paternity cannot be computed in sexual assault cases. R. Jonakait, \u201cWhen Blood Is Their Argument: Probabilities in Criminal Cases, Genetic Markers, and, Once Again, Bayes\u2019 Theorem,\u201d 1983 U. Ill. L. Rev. 369, 403 (1983). Because Bayes\u2019 Theorem requires the assumption of a prior probability of paternity, i.e., guilt, its use is inconsistent with the presumption of innocence in a criminal case such as this, in which Bayes\u2019 Theorem was used to establish the probability of paternity, i.e., that the defendant was the father of the product of conception of an alleged sexual assault. See id., pp. 406-408. Whether a prior probability of 50 percent is automatically used or whether the jury is instructed to adopt its own prior probability,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> when the probability of paternity statistic is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>introduced, an assumption is required to be made by the jury before it has heard all of the evidence\u2014that there is a quantifiable probability that the defendant committed the crime. In fact, if the presumption of innocence were factored into Bayes\u2019 Theorem, the probability of paternity statistic would be useless. If we assume that the presumption of innocence standard would require the prior probability of guilt to be zero, the probability of paternity in a criminal case would always be zero because Bayes\u2019 Theorem requires the paternity index to be multiplied by a positive prior probability in order to have any utility. Id., 406. \u201cIn other words, Bayes\u2019 Theorem can only work if the presumption of innocence disappears from consideration.\u201d Id., 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>We conclude that the trial court should not have admitted the expert testimony stating a probability of paternity statistic. Moreover, we cannot say with any degree of confidence that a probability of paternity statistic of 99.97 percent, as testified to by the state\u2019s expert, would not have influenced the jury\u2019s decision to convict the defendant of both sexual assault and risk of injury. Because the admissibility of the probability of paternity statistic involves a constitutional issue, and because we cannot say that the admission of that statistic here was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, a new trial is required. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>227 Conn. 231, 253, 630 A.2d 577 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Our resolution of the above issue disposes of the appeal. Because, however, \u201c[w]e ordinarily address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>legal issues likely to arise following a remand for further proceedings,\u201d we will address two of the defendant\u2019s additional claims. <em>Gaudet </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co., </em>219 Conn. 391, 400, 593 A.2d 1362 (1991). We find neither to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting the state, during the voir dire, to question venirepersons regarding their ability to decide the case impartially despite evidence that the victim had had an abortion. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">During the voir dire, the state questioned the venirepersons about their general feelings concerning abortion. It followed up by asking each venireperson if evidence that the victim had had an abortion would affect his or her ability to return a verdict of guilty, provided the defendant\u2019s guilt was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant claims that such questions were impermissible because they injected a \u201ccollateral fact\u201d into the voir dire and allowed prospective jurors to draw the inference that sexual intercourse had occurred between the defendant and the victim, thereby prejudicing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">\u201c \u2018The court has wide discretion in conducting the voir dire . . . and the exercise of that discretion will not constitute reversible error unless it has clearly been abused or harmful prejudice appears to have resulted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bleau </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>221 Conn. 331, 340, 603 A.2d 1147 (1992), quoting State v. <em>Dahlgren, </em>200 Conn. 586, 601, 512 A.2d 906 (1986). \u201c[I]n exercising its discretion, the court should grant such latitude as is reasonably necessary to accomplish the twofold purpose of voir dire: to permit the trial court to determine whether a prospective juror is qualified to serve, and to aid the parties in exercising their right to peremptory challenges.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>218 Conn. 309, 318, 589 A.2d 343 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>(1991). In conducting the voir dire examination, however, the trial court\u2019s discretion is not absolute. Voir dire should be limited to those questions \u201c \u2018which are pertinent and proper for testing the capacity and competency of the juror . . . and which are neither designed nor likely to plant prejudicial matter in [the jurors\u2019 minds].\u2019 <em>\u201d Bleauv. Ward, </em>supra, quoting <em>Duffy </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>137 Conn. 51, 57, 75 A.2d 33 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Abortion is a highly controversial topic. A juror\u2019s feelings on abortion quite possibly could affect his or her ability to remain impartial. The fact of the victim\u2019s abortion was foreseeably a part of the state\u2019s proof in the case. The state\u2019s questions were designed to probe the ability of each venireperson to render an unbiased verdict regardless of his or her sentiments concerning abortion and were essential to enable it to exercise its peremptory challenges intelligently.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018 \u201c[I]f there is any likelihood that some prejudice is in the juror\u2019s mind which will even subconsciously affect his decision of the case, the party who may be adversely affected should be permitted questions designed to uncover that prejudice.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>197 Conn. 314, 318, 497 A.2d 387 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>204 Conn. 156, 161, 527 A.2d 1157 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Higgs, </em>143 Conn. 138, 142, 120 A.2d 152 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Moreover, \u201c[t]he permissible content of the voir dire questions cannot be reduced to simplistic rules, but must be left fluid in order to accommodate the particular circumstances under which the trial is being con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>ducted. Thus, a particular question may be appropriate under some circumstances but not under other circumstances.\u201d <em>Bleau </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>supra, 345 <em>(Berdon, J., </em>concurring in part and dissenting in part). The trial court has broad discretion to determine the latitude and the nature of the questioning that is reasonably necessary to search out potential prejudices of the jurors. <em>See State v. Couture, </em>supra, 317-19; <em>State v. Cross, </em>72 Conn. 722, 730, 46 A. 148 (1900); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>26 Conn. App. 574, 578, 602 A.2d 618, cert. denied, 221 Conn. 923, 608 A.2d 688 (1992). We cannot say that the court abused its discretion in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The defendant also claims that his constitutional rights under the fourth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution were violated by the court\u2019s order of a visual inspection of his penis by a state employee who had no medical training.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The victim testified that she had observed, during their relationship, that the defendant\u2019s penis had white, pimple-like \u201cbumps\u201d underneath the head. As part of his defense, the defendant presented the testimony of Harry Anderson, a physician, who testified that he had examined the defendant\u2019s penis and found no such bumps. In making his observations, however, Anderson testified that he had not noticed whether the defendant was circumcised and had not physically pulled the defendant\u2019s foreskin back. The defendant concedes that he called Anderson not as a medical expert but as a witness to what he had observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The state, in order to test Anderson\u2019s observations, requested, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 776, that the defendant\u2019s penis be photographed or, in the alternative, that an agent of the state be permitted a visual inspection. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court ordered the defendant to submit to such an inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Thereafter, Richard Godwin, the victim\u2019s advocate in the Fairfield state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, viewed the defendant\u2019s penis, apparently in an anteroom off the courtroom, in the presence of counsel both for the state and for the defendant. He subsequently testified that he had observed three small white bumps that resembled pimples under the head of the defendant\u2019s penis. He stated that these bumps were not visible to an observer unless the foreskin of the defendant\u2019s uncircumcised penis was pulled back.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Section 776<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> authorizes a reasonably conducted procedure to obtain nontestimonial evidence if the judicial authority finds probable cause to believe that the evidence may be of material aid in determining whether the defendant committed the offense charged and that the evidence cannot practicably be obtained from other sources.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 778 (7) specifically authorizes \u201creasonable body surface examinations\u201d as part of a procedure to obtain nontestimonial evidence. The defendant argues that the examination of his penis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>ordered by the court was not reasonable because it was not performed by a physician.

The trial court noted that because Anderson had not testified as a medical expert, a layperson could logically view and report what he had seen.

Specifically, DNA was extracted from the victim\u2019s blood, the defendant\u2019s blood and from tissue from the product of conception. The DNA was then separated according to size by gel electrophoresis. The array of DNA fragments was arranged on a membrane and then exposed to polymorphic probes, which are used to observe the genetic differences between individuals. In the present case, six polymorphic probes, or genetic sys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>terns, were used. Each probe or genetic system represented a database of between 500 and 1500 randomly selected African-Americans.</p>\n<p id=\"AuQ\">The probes mark DNA fragments so that their lengths can be measured. The result is to give an image of dark bands, called an autoradiograph, that can be read like an X ray. The pattern of bands is called the DNA profile. A visual inspection was then made of the autoradiographs to determine if each included the defendant as a possible biological father based on the DNA profiles. In the present case, the six probes visually indicated inclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"AeMX\">Based on the number of genetic systems in which the defendant is included, the paternity index is statistically calculated by applying a theory of population genetics, specifically Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. A statistical analysis was done using four of the probes. Each probe result was individually compared to a database of African-Americans to predict the frequency with which each identifying DNA pattern occurs in that population. The results of each test were then multiplied together to determine the probability of finding all of the genetic markers together in one human being. The resulting number is referred to as the paternity index.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b637-14\"> Although the defendant asserts in his brief that there are 340 other individuals in Bridgeport who could have been the biological father based on the paternity index, we are unable to determine from the record how he arrived at that number.

In the present case, the paternity index of 3496 means that if 3497 random males were chosen, 3496 would not have a DNA profile compatible with the fetus in question and one would have a DNA profile compatible with producing the fetus in question. This does not mean, however, that the probability that <em>this </em>defendant is the father of the fetus in question is 3496 to 1, or 99.97 percent. At best, the paternity index permits the statement that of 3497 randomly selected males, 99.97 percent would not have the DNA profile compatible with producing the fetus in question and 0.03 percent would have profiles compatible with the fetus in question. It is the application of Bayes\u2019 Theorem that says that the likelihood that <em>this </em>defendant is the father of the fetus in question is 99.97 percent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Spann, </em>130 N.J. 484, 493, 617 A.2d 247 (1993) (stating that the probability of paternity \u201cis not intended to and does not mean that he is part of a small group who <em>might </em>be the father .... It means that even though there may be 1000 others who fit the bill, he <em>is </em>the father\u2014the odds are not 999 to 1 against the possibility of his being the father, but a 96.55% probability that he <em>is.\u201d </em>[Emphasis in original.]). It is the fact that Bayes\u2019 Theorem, and an assumption of a 50 percent prior probability of guilt, yields the statistical conclusion that there is a 99.97 percent probability that <em>this </em>defendant had intercourse with the victim that implicates the presumption of innocence.
