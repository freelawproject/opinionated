Finding a lack of aggrievement, the trial court dismissed the appeal of the plaintiffs, Girolamo Bencivenga and Ciro P. Bencivenga, Jr., challenging the Probate Court\u2019s appointment of Peter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Stark as administrator cum testamento annexo of their father\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The Appellate Court reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings to consider the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. <em>Appeal from Probate of Bencivenga, </em>30 Conn. App. 334, 620 A.2d 195 (1993). The Appellate Court concluded that the plaintiffs were aggrieved and thus had standing to appeal because General Statutes \u00a7 45a-290 (c)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> confers upon them a statutory right of appointment as successor executors upon the removal for cause of a court-appointed executor. Id., 338-39. The Appellate Court further concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 standing to contest the appointment of another person as executor was not impaired by the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 45a-331 (a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which confers discretion upon the Probate Court to proceed with the settlement of an estate that has been pending for more than ten years. Id., 339. We granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>petition for certification to appeal filed by the defendant, the city of Milford.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">After examining the record on appeal, and after considering the briefs and arguments of the parties, we conclude that the judgment of the Appellate Court must be affirmed. The issues on which we granted certification were properly resolved in the thoughtful and comprehensive opinion of the Appellate Court. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained.
