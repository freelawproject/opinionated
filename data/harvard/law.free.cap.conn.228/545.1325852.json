The plaintiff, John N. Adriani, Sr., appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court dismissing his claims of procedural irregularities during a hearing before the commission. He claims that the trial court: (1) incorrectly determined that the commission\u2019s investigator (investigator) had properly applied the standard of reasonable cause in his consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>ation of the plaintiffs complaint; and (2) improperly-refused to allow the plaintiff to elicit testimony from the investigator as to how he had applied the reasonable cause standard to particular factual disputes. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The facts of this case were previously set forth in <em>Adriani </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>220 Conn. 307, 309-14, 323-25, 596 A.2d 426 (1991). They are summarized briefly as follows: The plaintiff resigned from his position as a buyer for the defendant United Illuminating Company (United Illuminating), after he had been given the choice of resigning or being fired. The plaintiff subsequently filed a complaint with the commission alleging that United Illuminating had violated his rights under General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (l)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by discriminating against him on the basis of a physical disability. The commission dismissed his complaint without a hearing on the basis of its finding that there was no reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory practice had been committed by United Illuminating against the plaintiff. The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, which (1) denied the plaintiffs motion to supplement the administrative agency record by introducing testimony of the investigator in order to prove alleged procedural irregularities in the commission\u2019s disposition of his case, and (2) dismissed his complaint on the grounds that there was substantial evidence in the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>ord to support the investigator\u2019s finding, adopted by the commission, that there was no reasonable cause to believe that United Illuminating had committed a discriminatory act in violation of \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1). The plaintiff appealed to this court and, upon consideration of his claims, we remanded the case to the trial court with direction to conduct an evidentiary hearing to afford the plaintiff an opportunity to supplement the agency record with evidence of alleged procedural irregularities. Id., 329. Following our remand, the trial court determined that the investigator had understood and applied the standard of reasonable cause to the plaintiff\u2019s case correctly, and the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The plaintiff first claims that the investigator improperly applied the reasonable cause standard to his case. He argues that evidence introduced at the trial court hearing indicated that the investigator had applied a subjective test rather than an objective test to the facts of his case. The plaintiff further claims that since the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision does not contain a detailed explanation of its conclusion that the investigator had understood and properly applied the reasonable cause standard to his case, this court should review the decision of the trial court de novo. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Appellate review of fact bound rulings of the trial court is limited to a determination of whether there has been a clearly erroneous finding of fact. <em>Einbinder </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>217 Conn. 240, 242, 584 A.2d 1188 (1991); <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980); see also Practice Book \u00a7 4061.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe resolution of conflict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>ing factual claims falls within the province of the trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commissioner of Health Services </em>v. <em>Youth Challenge of Greater Hartford, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 657, 666, 594 A.2d 958 (1991). \u201cThis court cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Vesce </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>185 Conn. 328, 335, 441 A.2d 556 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">In <em>Adriani </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 315-17, we held that reasonable cause determinations made pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 46a-83 require an investigator to consider all reliable probative evidence, including evidence unfavorable to a complainant\u2019s claim. We further held that the term \u201creasonable cause\u201d as used in \u00a7 46a-83 is synonymous with the term \u201cprobable cause.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id., 316. \u201cProbable cause is a bona fide belief in the existence of facts essential under the law for the action <em>and such as would warrant a man of ordinary caution, prudence and judgment, under the circumstances, in entertaining it. . . . </em>Probable cause is a flexible common sense standard. ... It deals with probabilities, and the application of the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>sonable and prudent men act.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">At the evidentiary hearing before the trial court, the plaintiff elicited testimony from the investigator. The investigator testified repeatedly that he had understood the reasonable cause standard and had applied it to the facts of the plaintiff\u2019s case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court found that the investigator had \u201cfully understood the \u2018reasonable cause\u2019 standard\u201d as it has been interpreted by this court, and that that standard had been applied correctly by the investigator to the facts of the plaintiff\u2019s case. The plaintiff cites no authority for his invitation to review this finding of the trial court de novo. We have no reason, therefore, to disturb the trial court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The plaintiff also claims that the trial court abused its discretion when it prevented him from questioning the investigator about his mental process in applying the reasonable cause standard to the specific facts of the plaintiff\u2019s case. He argues that when an investigator has made a finding of no reasonable cause, an inquiry into the specific mental processes used by the investigator in reaching that decision is necessary to facilitate appellate review. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">In reviewing decisions made by an administrative agency, a reviewing court must sustain the agency\u2019s determination if \u201can examination of the record discloses evidence that supports any one of the reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>given. . . . The evidence, however, to support any such reason must be substantial . . . (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Agency, </em>226 Conn. 579, 588, 628 A.2d 1286 (1993). \u201c[A]n adjudicating official may not ordinarily be subjected to inquiry concerning the mental process used in reaching a decision.\u201d <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>202 Conn. 453, 459, 521 A.2d 1040 (1987); <em>Martone </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>215 Conn. 49, 54, 574 A.2d 803 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">The plaintiff urges us to allow inquiry into an investigator\u2019s subjective impressions of individual pieces of evidence. Such an inquiry, as a practical matter, would allow a litigant to challenge each factual determination of an investigator, and would require a reviewing court to conduct a de novo review of an administrative agency\u2019s findings. We have consistently held that de novo review is inappropriate for review of the factual findings of administrative agencies. <em>DeBeradinis </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>228 Conn. 187,199, 635 A.2d 1220 (1993); <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Agency, </em>supra, 587; <em>Calandro </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>176 Conn. 439, 440, 408 A.2d 229 (1979). Reasonable cause is determined upon a consideration of all of the evidence. See part I of this opinion. Reasonable cause determinations are not made as to individual facts. Accordingly, the plaintiff\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b569-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (1) provides: \u201cIt shall be a discriminatory practice in violation of this section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">\u201c(1) For an employer, by himself or his agent, except in the case of a bona fide occupational qualification or need, to refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge from employment any individual or to discriminate against him in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment because of the individual\u2019s race, color, religious creed, age, sex, marital status, national origin, ancestry, present or past history of mental disorder, mental retardation or physical disability, including, but not limited to, blindness.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b570-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4061 provides: \u201cThe court may reverse or modify the decision of the trial court if it determines that the factual findings are clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record, or that the decision is otherwise erroneous in law.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj3\">\u201cIf the court deems it necessary to the proper disposition of the cause, it may remand the case for a further articulation of the basis of the trial court\u2019s factual findings or decision.</p>\n<p id=\"AxHd\">\u201cIt is the responsibility of the appellant to provide an adequate record for review.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\"> As was noted in <em>Adriani </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>220 Conn. 307, 313 n.6, 596 A.2d 426 (1991), General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 46a-83 was amended by No. 89-332 of the 1989 Public Acts to provide a statutory definition of the \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard.
