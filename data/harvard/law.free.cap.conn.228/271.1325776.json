The plaintiffs appealed to the trial court, which dismissed their appeal for failure to meet their burden of proof under the \u201cinvasion of personal privacy\u201d exemption of General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The material facts are undisputed. On July 2, 1991, Kemper, a reporter working on a story for Northeast Magazine at the Hartford Courant, made a written request to the city\u2019s personnel department for copies of the initial employment applications and any subsequent employment applications used for promotions of thirteen named individuals, current and former employees of the city\u2019s public works department.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The city individually notified all those mentioned in Kemper\u2019s request of their right under General Statutes \u00a7 l-20a (a) through (c)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to object to the release of any information the disclosure of which, in their view, would invade their right to privacy. The letters informed each of the plaintiffs that they had four days in which to file their objection and that they could do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>so on an attached form.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because all nine individual plaintiffs filed timely objections to disclosure with the city, the city denied Kemper\u2019s request in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">On August 9,1991, the defendants filed a complaint with the FOIC to compel the release of the employment applications of twelve of the fourteen persons whose records had been the subject of the original request.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After evidentiary hearings before the FOIC on December 13, 1991, and January 2, 1992, during which the defendants withdrew their requests for two persons\u2019 employment applications,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the defendants narrowed the scope of their request by agreeing to a redaction of the applicants\u2019 home addresses, length of time at their current addresses, telephone numbers and salary information.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The FOIC undertook an in camera inspection of the requested records and then rendered its final decision ordering the city\u2019s personnel department to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>copies of the requested employment applications to the defendants with certain additional deletions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> With regard to the remaining items requested, the FOIC determined that, even though the plaintiffs believed that the employment applications would be confidential, their \u201cexpectationfs] of privacy with respect to the job applications [were] not reasonable.\u201d The FOIC noted that, for many years, it had treated such applications as public records subject to disclosure and that the city had not claimed an exemption under \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) in a prior FOIA case involving disclosure of similar job applications. It \u201cfound that for a reasonable man, disclosure of individual job qualifications as presented on the job applications ... is not in itself embarrassing because (a) it is widely accepted that formal training is not the only source of skill development and that education occurs on the job; (b) the job applications set forth an applicant\u2019s qualifications in the most positive light, and (c) the function of the application is to persuade an employer to hire or promote an applicant.\u201d The FOIC concluded, therefore, that the plaintiffs had not met their burden of proof of establishing their right to the invasion of privacy exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The plaintiffs filed a timely appeal to the trial court. After a hearing, the trial court dismissed the appeal. The court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) exemption applies whenever the objecting party could conceivably suffer embarrassment or other harm from disclosure. The court noted: \u201cIf the mere possibility of embarrassment of a government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>employee from disclosure of his personnel records were sufficient to constitute an invasion of privacy, virtually all such records would be exempt from disclosure unless the employee consented.\u201d The court, instead, applied a reasonable person standard, asking \u201cwhether a reasonable man in the situation of the particular employee involved, would be embarrassed by disclosure of such employee\u2019s job application as redacted.\u201d After a scrupulous search of the administrative record, the court upheld the FOIC\u2019s decision, concluding that the plaintiffs had failed to produce substantial evidence that the possibility of embarrassment from disclosure was so overwhelming that such disclosure would constitute an invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The court also held that the individual plaintiffs could not have entertained a reasonable expectation that the material in their employment applications would be considered private when they originally gave that information to the city. Again rejecting the use of a subjective standard to determine the reasonableness of an employee\u2019s reliance on representations of confidentiality, the court concluded that the FOIC was not required to give any weight to alleged representations of confidentiality unless such representations were valid and authorized at the time they were made and relied upon. In conclusion, the court stated, \u201c[t]o hold that erroneous representations of confidentiality by the city bars disclosure otherwise proper would make the city rather than the commission the arbiter of what items in a personnel file are subject to disclosure. The FOIA contains no provisions regulating the representations that a government agency may make concerning confidentiality. Conceivably such an agency might declare all of its personnel records to be confidential, even when the information sought could not possibly involve privacy. To circumvent this fox-guarding-the-hen-house scenario, the court concludes that <em>the commission cannot </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>be barred from ordering disclosure of information that it has otherwise properly found not to constitute an invasion of privacy simply because of the erroneous determination by a government agency that such information should be confidential and its representations to that effect.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In their appeal, the plaintiffs maintain that the trial court improperly upheld the FOIC\u2019s determination that the disclosure of their redacted employment applications would not constitute an invasion of personal privacy under \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">This case provides us with an opportunity to apply the \u201cinvasion of personal privacy\u201d exemption standard recently enunciated in <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>228 Conn. 158, 635 A.2d 783 (1993). In <em>Perkins, </em>we determined that \u201cthe invasion of personal privacy exception of \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) precludes disclosure . . . only when the information sought by the request does not pertain to legitimate matters of public concern and is highly offensive to a reasonable person.\u201d Id., 175. Only by proving both prongs of this standard by a preponderance of the evidence can a party establish a right to invoke the statutory exemption so as to preclude disclosure. As we explained in <em>Perkins, </em>this standard implements the underlying principle that disclosure is the general rule under the FOIA with \u201c \u2018exceptions to this rule being narrowly construed. The burden of establishing the applicability of an exemption clearly rests upon the party claiming the exemption.\u2019 <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>205 Conn. 767, 775, 535 A.2d 1297 (1988).\u201d <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 167.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>In our assessment of whether the plaintiffs have met their burden of proof, we are guided by the limitations that the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act imposes upon judicial review of the determinations of the FOIC.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201c[W]e must decide, in view of all the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily or illegally, or abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Ottochian </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 393, 397, 604 A.2d 351 (1992); <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 164. We conclude that the FOIC reasonably found that the plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of proof with regard to the information requested by the defendants.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The plaintiffs first claim that the FOIC incorrectly applied an objective person standard to determine if the records sought to be disclosed would be potentially embarrassing. They argue that the FOIC should determine \u201cwhether the [individual [ajppellants could suffer embarrassment or other injury if the subject records are released.\u201d The plaintiffs, in effect, argue for the application of a subjective standard to determine embarrassment or offensiveness, based upon the predisposition of each individual party whose records are sought to be disclosed. As we observed in <em>Perkins, </em>a subjective standard cannot be reconciled with the FOIA\u2019s primary objective of disclosure. Disclosure would be the exception and not the rule if government employees had the authority, at will, to preclude public access to information included in their personnel files. We thus reiterate the applicability of a reasonable person standard instead of a subjective standard. To invoke the statutory exemption, a public employee must demonstrate that disclosure of the sought after records would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The plaintiffs also claim that in determining whether reliance on representations that the employment applications would be considered confidential was reasonable, the FOIC and the trial court applied an improper standard. They argue, citing <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 193,198, 585 A.2d 96 (1991), that the proper test of what constitutes a reasonable expectation of privacy is procedural in nature and \u201cdepends on the circumstances which existed when the individual <em>originally gave </em>the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>ment agency the subject material,\u201d (emphasis in original) and \u201chow those documents have been treated by the employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The position advanced by the plaintiffs cannot be sustained, either factually or as a matter of law. As a matter of fact, the FOIC made no finding that the plaintiffs had received assurances from their governmental employer that their employment applications would be treated as confidential. Without such a finding, there is no factual predicate for the plaintiffs\u2019 argument. As a matter of law, the legitimacy of an expectation of privacy requires a substantive inquiry into the legitimacy of the governmental employee\u2019s expectations. No public agency can shield public records from disclosure merely by agreeing to keep such records confidential. As the trial court noted, to hold otherwise would allow \u201cthe city rather than the commission [to be] the arbiter of what items in a personnel file are subject to disclosure.\u201d Even if some or all of the plaintiffs had received representations of confidentiality from their governmental employer, the receipt of such representations would not establish their validity. The FOIC had the authority to decide that the public records sought in this case are of legitimate concern to the public and that their disclosure does not infringe upon the plaintiffs\u2019 reasonable expectation of privacy under \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">In this opinion Callahan, Berdon and Palmer, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-6\"> The Freedom of Information Act in its entirety is found in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-15, l-18a, 1-19 through l-19c, l-20a through l-21a, and l-21c through l-21k.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\"> Besides the named plaintiff, Gary Kureczka, the other individual plaintiffs are Steven Kardys, Angelo Musumeci, Harold Sandiford, Ted Polak, Steve Santilli, Douglas Gaboury, Paul Piezzo and Frank Abreu.
