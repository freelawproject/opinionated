A jury convicted the defendant, Charles Bellino, of manslaughter in the first degree, attempted assault in the first degree and carrying a pistol without a permit. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Bellino, </em>31 Conn. App. 385, 389-96, 625 A.2d 1381 (1993), the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s instructions on self-defense had not violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal the merits of this conclusion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\">After examining the record on appeal and after considering the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we have determined that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-9\"> We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-10\">\u201c1. Whether the Appellate Court properly held that the instructions on self-defense, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19, did not abuse the court\u2019s discretion, where it did not instruct on the statutory duty to retreat and the limitations on that duty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-11\">\u201c2. Whether the Appellate Court properly held that the instructions on self-defense, relative to the subjective-objective test employed by the jury in evaluating the degree of force used, were correct?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bellino, </em>226 Conn. 917, 628 A.2d 988 (1993).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
