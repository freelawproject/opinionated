Section 54-193a took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>effect after the offenses were allegedly committed, but before the expiration of the five year limitation period of General Statutes \u00a7 54-193 (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which originally had applied to such offenses. The trial court, <em>Ronan, J., </em>held that \u00a7 54-193a could not be applied retrospectively to the alleged offenses in light of this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>189 Conn. 346, 456 A.2d 305 (1983). Because the original five year limitation period had expired before the initiation of the prosecution of the defendant for the alleged offenses, the trial court dismissed the charges against the defendant. We affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The essential facts are undisputed. The defendant was arrested on November 18, 1991, on charges that he had sexually abused a young boy. The information filed by the state charged the defendant with: two counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (l);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> one count of criminal attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1) and General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> two counts of sexual assault in the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (l);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> one count of criminal attempt to commit sexual assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) and 53a-49; and three counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The state alleged that all of the offenses were committed between April and June, 1986, when the victim was five years old. The victim did not reveal that the alleged offenses had occurred until October, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The statute in effect at the time the alleged offenses were committed, \u00a7 54-193 (b), provided for a five year limitation period. That period expired even before the alleged victim came forward. Prior to the five year period expiring, however, the legislature enacted \u00a7 54-193a, which took effect on October 1, 1990. Section 54-193a provides a seven year limitation period for child sexual abuse offenses that are committed under circumstances like those of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">On July 29,1992, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him claiming that the prosecution was time barred because: (1) the original five year statute of limitations expired before prosecution of the alleged offenses commenced; and (2) the newer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>seven year statute of limitations could not be applied in view of <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra. The trial court agreed with the defendant and granted the motion to dismiss. The state appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 352-53, we held that \u201cstatutes of limitation in criminal cases are to be construed liberally in favor of the accused . . . [and] are not to be accorded retrospective effect absent language clearly necessitating such a construction . . . .\u2019\u2019The defendants in <em>Paradise </em>were arrested in 1981 on charges that they had committed a murder in 1974. The statute of limitations in effect at the time of the murder was five years. The legislature amended the statute in 1976 to eliminate the limitation period for the prosecution of murder and certain other felonies. Id., 347-48. These facts make clear that in <em>Paradise, </em>we considered the identical issue raised in this appeal, that is, whether a new statute of limitations may be applied to an offense committed prior to its effective date, where the new statute takes effect before the original statute of limitations expires.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The state concedes that the trial court was required, under <em>Paradise, </em>to dismiss the charges against the defendant because neither the language nor the legislative history of \u00a7 54-193a indicates that the legislature intended the statute to have a retrospective effect. The state claims, however, that <em>Paradise </em>was \u201cbased on the faulty premise that the newer statute of limitations was sought to be applied \u2018retroactively\u2019 \u201d and therefore should be overruled. The state claims alternatively that \u201cthe rules of statutory construction that underlie the holding in <em>Paradise </em>are inapplicable\u201d because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\u201c\u00a7 54-193a is a remedial statute that must be construed in favor of child sex abuse victims.\u201d We reject both of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The state first claims that <em>Paradise </em>was based on the faulty premise that a statute of limitations that extends a previous limitation period before that previous period has expired is \u201cretroactive.\u201d The state claims that the application of an extended statute of limitations is not retroactive as long as the original limitation period has not expired. The state claims that to be \u201cretroactive,\u201d a statute must affect a \u201cvested right\u201d that existed on the date it took effect. Because a defendant has no right to a statute of limitations defense while the original limitation period remains unexpired, a new statute of limitations that takes effect before the original limitations period has expired does not affect a vested right and therefore cannot be retroactive. Therefore, the state argues, the <em>Paradise </em>court\u2019s \u201creliance on rules of statutory construction pertaining to retroactivity is misplaced and should be reconsidered.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">We note, first, that this same \u201cvested right\u201d argument was made by the state in <em>Paradise </em>and rejected by this court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>Conn. Supreme Court Records &amp; Briefs, Dec. Term, 1982, Pt. 2, State\u2019s Brief pp. 5-8,13-14. Therefore, this is not a case like <em>State </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>224 Conn. 1, 615 A.2d 505 (1992), in which we overruled part of the holding of an earlier case. In <em>Welch, </em>we reviewed the briefs submitted in the earlier case and discovered that an issue underlying part of the holding in the case had not been independently briefed by the parties and considered by the court. Id., 5-6. We concluded, therefore, that this part of the holding had not \u201cresulted from a careful judicial consideration of competing values, honed by the thoughtful arguments of the litigants then before the court.\u201d Id., 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Unlike the situation in <em>Welch, </em>in <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, the state briefed the same argument it relies on in the present appeal. Further, we disagree with the state\u2019s claim that in <em>Paradise, </em>this court mistakenly relied on rules of statutory construction pertaining to retroactivity. In <em>Paradise, </em>we relied principally on the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>132 Conn. 682, 47 A.2d 185 (1946). The statute at issue in <em>Jones </em>required the court before which any case involving a certain type of offense was pending to order an examination of the defendant for venereal disease. Id., 684. The statute took effect one month after the defendant allegedly committed the offense, but nine months before he was arrested. Id., 683-84. Under the state\u2019s analysis, the statute in <em>Jones </em>would not be \u201cretroactive\u201d because the defendant did not acquire any \u201cvested right\u201d not to be examined before the statute took effect. Nevertheless, the court in <em>Jones </em>held that the statute could not be applied to a defendant whose offense was committed prior to the effective date of the statute, based on the principle that \u201cin a criminal case a retrospective construction of a statute should not be adopted unless its language clearly makes such a construction necessary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">After a thorough consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments in <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, and the reasoning behind that decision, we conclude that it should not be overruled. The holding in <em>Paradise </em>was based firmly on the principle that criminal statutes must be strictly construed; id., 352; not, as the state claims, on a technical misunderstanding of the nature of retroactivity. For this reason, we also reject the state\u2019s suggestion that our recent decision in <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Caton, </em>224 Conn. 483, 619 A.2d 844 (1993), undermines our holding in <em>Paradise. </em>In <em>Roberts, </em>we held that an extended <em>civil </em>statute of limitations could be applied to the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>suit even though the original limitations period expired before the extended statute took effect, rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim that he had a vested right in the lapsing of the original statute. Id., 492. <em>Roberts </em>is not inconsistent with <em>Paradise. </em>In <em>Paradise, </em>we specifically stated that \u201c[wjhile we affirm the continued vitality and utility of the principle that procedural statutes will be applied retrospectively absent a contrary legislative intent in the <em>civil </em>field, we recognize that the principle\u2019s application in the <em>criminal </em>realm is limited.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 351. Therefore, <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Caton, </em>supra, is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">We next consider the state\u2019s claim that the rules of statutory construction that underlie the holding in <em>Paradise </em>should not be applied to \u00a7 54-193a because this statute is remedial and must be construed in favor of child sex abuse victims. The state claims that \u00a7 54-193a is remedial in that \u201cit seeks to correct a deficiency in the prior law\u2014i.e., a limitation period that was not sufficiently long enough to enable society to redress certain wrongs perpetrated on its children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">We have long held that \u201c \u2018[cjriminal statutes are not to be read more broadly than their language plainly requires . . . <em>.\u2019 State v. McGann, </em>199 Conn. 163, 177, 506 A.2d 109 (1986); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>204 Conn. 410, 424, 528 A.2d 811 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>203 Conn. 506, 523, 525 A.2d 509 (1987). Moreover, \u2018[a] penal statute must be construed strictly against the state and liberally in favor of the accused. <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>189 Conn. 346, 352, 456 A.2d 305 (1983).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>206 Conn. 346, 355, 538 A.2d 185 (1988); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Bunkley, </em>202 Conn. 629, 641, 522 A.2d 795 (1987).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>218 Conn. 273, 277-78, 588 A.2d 1376 (1991). \u201c \u2018[A]mbiguities are ordinarily to be resolved in favor of the defendant.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>McGann, </em>[supra, 177]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>[supra, 277-78]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Whiteman, </em>204 Conn. 98, 101, 526 A.2d 869 (1987) (penal statutes should be strictly construed in favor of the accused).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 317, 630 A.2d 593 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">These general rules of construction for criminal statutes are further reinforced by the specific command of <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, that \u201ccriminal statutes [of limitations] are not to be accorded retrospective effect absent language clearly necessitating such a construction . . . .\u201d Id., 353. We presume that the legislature is aware of the judicial construction placed upon its enactments. <em>Cappellino </em>v. <em>Cheshire, </em>226 Conn. 569, 576, 628 A.2d 595 (1993); <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>223 Conn. 22, 30, 610 A.2d 1292 (1992). <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, put the legislature on notice that if it intends that a new criminal statute of limitations should apply retrospectively, it must make that intent clear. The state cannot point to anything in the language of the statute or in its legislative history that expresses such an intent. Therefore, we must interpret the legislature\u2019s silence to mean that \u00a7 54-193a was not intended to be applied retrospectively. The liberal construction urged by the state is therefore unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 54-193a provides: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 54-193, no person may be prosecuted for any offense involving sexual abuse, sexual exploitation or sexual assault of a minor except within two years from the date the victim attains the age of majority or seven years after the commission of the offense, whichever is less, provided in no event shall such period of time be less than five years after the commission of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Number 93-340, \u00a7 11, of the 1993 Public Acts, which took effect October 1, 1993, amended \u00a7 54-193a to provide: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 54-193, no person may be prosecuted for any offense involving sexual abuse, sexual exploitation or sexual assault of a minor except within two years from the date the victim attains the age of majority or within five years from the date the victim notifies any police officer or state\u2019s attorney acting in his official capacity of the commission of the offense, whichever is earlier, provided in no event shall such period of time be less than five years after the commission of the offense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b417-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-193 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person may be prosecuted for any offense, except a capital felony, a class A felony or a violation of section 53a-54d, for which the punishment is or may be imprisonment in excess of one year, except within five years next after the offense has been committed. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\"> Because of this disposition, we need not consider the defendant\u2019s alternative grounds for affirmance of the judgment of the trial court.
