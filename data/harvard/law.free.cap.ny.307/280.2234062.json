J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atx\">The petitioner-appellant, Betsy Wolf, mother of Frank Wolf, deceased, and one of two administratrices with the will annexed of the estate of the decedent, instituted this proceeding in Surrogate\u2019s Court, New York County, for a decree instructing her as to the legal basis for computing the share of the decedent\u2019s widow, Ethel Wolf, respondent herein and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>coadministratrix with the will annexed, who elected to take her intestate share against the decedent\u2019s will. By her answer, the respondent widow and coadministratrix, joins the petitioner in seeking instructions and a determination as to the correct application of the Decedent Estate Law (\u00a7 18, subd. 1, par [a]) in computing her intestate share of the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The decree by the Surrogate was affirmed by the Appellate Division, one Justice dissenting and voting to modify. The administratrix (mother of the decedent) has appealed as of right to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The will of the decedent Frank Wolf bears the date September 2, 1930, at which time he was unmarried and both his parents were living. By his will the testator made the following bequests: (1) to his father and mother, $2,000 \u201c to be donated by them to any Jewish Hospitals of the City of New York, as in their discretion they see fit * * * (2) to his father and mother, $50,000 to be divided equally between them or, if one should predecease the other, to the survivor; (3) to his executors, from the residuary of his estate, a sum not to exceed $10,000 to be held in trust for a nephew, Morton Schoenbach; (4) to his father and mother the residue, if any, of his estate to be divided equally between them. The will contained no direction with respect to the payment of taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">On March 15, 1942 \u2014 eleven years subsequent to the date of the decedent\u2019s will \u2014 the decedent married the respondent Ethel Wolf. He died ten years later, on March 22, 1952 \u2014 without having changed his will executed September 2, 1930 \u2014 leaving him surviving his wife, his mother and his nephew, Morton Schoenbach. No children were born of decedent\u2019s marriage with the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Included within the taxable gross estate is a sum amounting to $64,290.52 \u2014 the proceeds of insurance policies which directed that monthly payments be made therefrom to decedent\u2019s wife during her life with contingent remainders to his niece and his nephew.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">The appellant does not question the validity of the notice of election, filed and served by the respondent, to take her intestate share of decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>The computation<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> which the appellant claims conforms with all legal requirements for arriving at the widow\u2019s intestate share, gives effect to appellant\u2019s claim that, under applicable law, the widow\u2019s intestate share is computed by deducting from decedent\u2019s gross estate <em>all </em>the estate taxes due therefrom <em>before </em>arriving at the widow\u2019s intestate share as limited by the Decedent Estate Law (\u00a7 18, subd. 1, par. [a]). The appellant also contends that any estate tax attributable to the avails of life insurance policies shall be paid out of the life insurance fund thus created as allocated pursuant to section 124 of the Decedent Estate Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Opposed to the above formula by which the appellant would compute the respondent\u2019s intestate share of her husband\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>estate, the respondent asserts that in making such computation<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> to determine the amount of her intestate share under the statutory election she has made, no deduction may he made for any estate tax because she is entitled, under section 249-s (subd. 4, par. [a]) of the Tax Law to a \u201c marital deduction \u201d for any amounts passing to her by virtue of her right of election under the Decedent Estate Law (\u00a7 18, subd. 1, par. [a]). The respondent contends further that the tax attributable to the avails of life insurance policies should be paid from the fund so created and that no deduction should be made from the gross estate for the amount of estate taxes attributable to such insurance in determining her share by reason of her right of election.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Thus the question for decision is whether \u2014 as the appellant contends \u2014 the respondent takes her intestate share \u2014 as limited by the various provisions of section <em>18 </em>\u2014 \u2022after deducting all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>estate taxes; or \u2014 as claimed by the respondent \u2014 <em>before </em>estate taxes have been deducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The Surrogate\u2019s opinion \u2014 which is the basis for affirmance by the Appellate Division \u2014 favors the widow. The dissenting opinion at the Appellate Division favors the position taken by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">As to applicable statutes: the Decedent Estate Law (\u00a7 18, subd. 1) provides: \u201c Where a testator dies after August thirty-first, nineteen hundred and thirty, and leaves a will thereafter executed and leaves surviving a husband or wife, a personal right of election is given to the surviving spouse to take his or her share of the estate as in intestacy, subject to the limitations, conditions and exceptions contained in this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">We have seen that the decedent left no children but was survived by his wife and his mother. In those circumstances we turn to the Decedent Estate Law (\u00a7 83, subd. 3) which provides in part: <em>\u201c * </em>* * If the deceased leaves one parent surviving, and no child or descendant, and a surviving spouse, the surviving spouse shall take five thousand dollars and one-half of the residue, and the surviving parent shall take the balance; if there be no surviving spouse, the surviving parent shall take the whole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">However, in exercising the statutory right of election, the amount a widow is entitled to take is limited by the Decedent Estate Law (\u00a7 18, subd. 1, par. [a]) as follows: \u201c In exercising the right of election herein granted a surviving spouse shall in no event be entitled to take more than one-half of the net estate of the decedent, after the deduction of debts, funeral and administration expenses and any estate tax, and the words \u2018 intestate share \u2019 wherever used in this section shall in no event be construed to mean more than one-half of such net estate. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">Applying the statutes quoted above to the computation of the present respondent widow\u2019s intestate share of her husband\u2019s estate, the maximum or ceiling fixed by section 18 (subd. 1, par. [a]) serves to reduce the share she would otherwise take under section 83 (subd. 3). Thus \u2014 referring to the two proposed computations set forth <em>supra </em>in footnotes- \u2014 the decedent\u2019s net estate is tentatively computed to be $374,827.51. It is the respondent\u2019s contention that, although under section 83 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>(subd. 3) she would take $187,413.75 <em>plus $5,000, </em>she is limited by section 18 (subd. 1, par. [a]) to $187,413.75. However, the administratrix-appellant \u2014 disagreeing with the computation by the respondent \u2014 would deduct from the net estate computed at $374,827.51 the additional sum estimated at $4,193.58 for New York estate taxes and the estimated sum of $53,497.09 for Federal estate taxes, thus reducing the net estate subject to the respondent widow\u2019s election to $317,136.84, of which her maximum one half would be $158,568.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The enactment of section 18 of the Decedent Estate Law by chapter 229 of the Laws of 1929 was one of a number of legislative alterations affecting the Decedent Estate Law made upon the recommendation of the Commission to Investigate Defects in the Laws of Estates. By its terms, however, the new legislation did not become effective until September 1, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Prior to September 1, 1930, estate taxes were payable, primarily at least, out of the residuary estate, and were deducted therefrom prior to the determination of the shares payable to beneficiaries. <em>(Matter of Oakes, </em>248 N. Y. 280, 282; <em>Matter of Hamlin, </em>226 N. Y. 407, 416-419; <em>Matter of del Drago, </em>287 N. Y. 61, 69, 71, revd. on other grounds <em>sub nom. Riggs </em>v. <em>del Drago, </em>317 U. S. 95).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The Legislature changed that rule by the enactment of section 124 of the Decedent Estate Law (L. 1930, ch. 709), effective September 1,1930, which statute provided that, in the absence of a direction to the contrary by the testator, estate taxes shall be apportioned and prorated among those who share in the estate. Thus, in a case where section 124 is applicable, the share of each beneficiary is first determined and computed and then his prorata share of the tax is deducted therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">In a situation where taxes <em>are not to be apportioned, </em>the formula for determining a widow\u2019s intestate share under section 18 (subd. 1, par. [a]) is to deduct the total of estate taxes from the net estate and then give the widow one half the balance. (See <em>Matter of Ryan, </em>280 App. Div. 410.) Where, however, as here \u2014 under section 124 \u2014 the taxes <em>are to be apportioned, </em>the correct formula is to give the widow one half of the net estate before taxes and then deduct from her share any tax chargeable against that share (see <em>Matter of Peters, </em>275 App. Div. 950).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>In the present case, where the widow\u2019s share qualifies for the statutory marital deduction (Tax Law, \u00a7 249-s, subd. 4, par. [a]), then, of course, there is no tax to be deducted from her share. In this connection it should be noted that the Decedent Estate Law (\u00a7 124, subd. 3, par. [ii]) provides in part that \u2018 \u2018 any exemption or deduction allowed under the law imposing the tax by reason of the relationship of any person to the decedent or by reason of the fact that the property consists of life insurance proceeds * * * shall inure to the benefit of the person bearing such relationship or receiving such insurance proceeds * <em>* *.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The argument against employing the formula of <em>Matter of Peters (supra) </em>is that the Legislature of 1929, which enacted section 18 of the Decedent Estate Law, had no way of knowing that the Legislature of 1930 would adopt the rule of apportionment of taxes contained in section 124. Consequently, so the argument goes, the phrase \u201c any estate tax \u201d contained in section 18 must be read as though section 124 had never been enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">We cannot agree with that argument. The same commission that recommended section 18 also recommended section 124. Both statutes went into effect September 1, 1930, and were parts of the sweeping revision of the law of decedent estates that then became effective. Both statutes had the same object. Thus the purpose of section 18 was to increase the share of the surviving spouse in a decedent\u2019s estate. <em>(Matter of Byrnes, </em>260 N. Y. 465, 472.) The purpose of section 124 was also to increase the share of the surviving spouse \u2014 who, as the residuary legatee, formerly had to pay the entire estate tax \u2014 by requiring each legatee to pay the portion of the tax allocable to his own share. (Combined Reports of Commission to Investigate Defects in the Laws of Estates, 1928-1933 [Reprint ed.], p. 338). In our view, therefore, these statutes should be read together. Moreover, were we to decide otherwise, the formula which prevailed prior to the enactment of section 124 of the Decedent Estate Law would have to be used to determine the widow\u2019s intestate share and the apportionment formula of that statute in other calculations. Thus construed the statute would bring about needless complexity.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>One other consideration is to be noted: Should a testator make someone other than his spouse the beneficiary of a substantial life insurance policy and the estate tax on the proceeds thereof were deducted from the estate before the surviving spouse\u2019s maximum share was determined, it might occur that the entire testamentary estate \u2014 the sole source of the surviving spouse\u2019s share \u2014 would be exhausted by the payment of taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Our conclusion is that adoption of the formula advocated here by the respondent widow will serve better to carry out the intent of section 124 (subd. 3, par. [ii]), quoted above, by allowing her to have the full benefit of exemptions and deductions. Further, it will minimize the possibility that a widow\u2019s intestate share will be whittled away because the testator made valid <em>inter vivas </em>transfers of property which are nevertheless includible in his estate for estate tax purposes. This consideration is compelling since the Legislature has said, in adopting section 18, that its purpose was \u201c to increase the share of a surviving spouse in the estate of a deceased spouse, either in a case of intestacy or by an election against the terms of the will of the deceased spouse \u201d and has further directed that <em>1 \u2018 </em>such provisions shall be liberally construed to carry out such intention \u201d (L. 1929, ch. 229, \u00a7 20; and see <em>Matter of Byrnes, </em>260 N. Y. 465, 472; Combined Reports of Commission to Investigate Defects in the Laws of Estates, <em>supra, </em>p. 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In the circumstances thus disclosed, we think it clear that the preferred construction \u2014 the one more likely to carry out the intention of the Legislature \u2014 is that which enlarges, rather than decreases, the share of the surviving spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The order should be affirmed, with costs to both parties payable out of the estate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\"> The computation for which appellant contends is set forth in her petition as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">\u201c Gross Estate $478,772.11</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtT\">Less Insurance\u2014 (Not qualifying for Marital Deduction \u2014 terminable Interest\u2014 widow life tenant \u2014 no part of distributable estate) $64,290.52</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbW\">Joint property 2,394.70</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8x\">Adm.

The question is whether, where a widow takes her elective share against her husband\u2019s will pursuant to section 18 (subd. 1, par. [a]) of the Decedent Estate Law, she can receive more than half of the net estate after estate taxes. This section expressly states that this computation is to be made after \u201c any estate tax\u201d. There is a difference between what a widow inherits in case of intestacy of her husband, and what she receives as her <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>intestate share \u2019 \u2019 if she takes against a will. In case of intestacy, this decedent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>widow would have taken $5,000 and one half of the residue computed before estate taxes (Decedent Estate Law, \u00a7 83, subd. 3). In taking against the will, the widow\u2019s intestate share \u201c shall in no event be construed to mean more than one-half of such net estate \u201d computed \u201c <em>after * * * any estate tax </em>\u201d (italics supplied). The effect of the order appealed from is to disregard, as it seems to me, this limiting language in section 18 (subd. 1, par. [a]) and to construe it as though this section provided that the widow\u2019s share shall be computed before estate taxes as section 83 directs to be done where there is no will.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Section 124 of the Decedent Estate Law does not purport to eliminate this ceiling imposed on the widow\u2019s intestate share by section 18 (subd. 1, par. [a]). It merely apportions the estate taxes to the various beneficiaries in proportion to the amounts which they receive, unless the will otherwise directs. Here the will contains no contrary direction, but there is no part of the estate taxes to be apportioned against the widow\u2019s elective share for the reason that what she receives has not increased the estate taxes due to the recently enacted Federal and State tax exemptions. Nothing in my view of the case prevents the widow from obtaining complete estate tax exemption for her share in the estate, nor is she required by section 124 to bear any part of the estate taxes imposed upon the estate. Section 124 does not apply to her at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Nothing in the widow\u2019s tax exemptions nor in section 124 purports to change the language of section 18 (subd. 1, par. [a]) which creates the widow\u2019s right to take against the will, and defines the amount of her elective share by limiting it to one half of the decedent\u2019s net estate after any estate taxes. The amount of estate taxes to be deducted before dividing by two is materially less than it would have been if she had not exercised her election, and her half of the net estate is thereby increased, nor is her share required to assume any part of the estate taxes after it has been computed. Nevertheless it seems to me that there is no other method of arriving at the amount of her intestate share than by dividing the decedent\u2019s net estate by two after deducting the taxes as reduced by the widow\u2019s election. The estate taxes are not imposed by the tax laws on particular legacies, but on the estate as a whole. Section 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>(subd. 1, par. [a]) is not a taxing statute, as Mr. Justice Callahan pointed out at the Appellate Division. It provides a formula for determining the amount of the widow\u2019s intestate share. I do not understand how this formula can be changed except by amendment to the statute. The words 1 \u2018 after * * * any estate tax\u201d cannot be construed as meaning \u201cbefore any estate taxes \u201d except by legislative action. Unless they are thus altered, there is no way to apply the formula except by deducting the estate taxes before computing the widow\u2019s share. It was so held in <em>Matter of Ryan </em>(280 App. Div. 410). Whether the estate taxes to be deducted before computing the widow\u2019s intestate share shall be limited to such as accrue by reason of decedent\u2019s actual estate where the taxable estate includes <em>inter vivas </em>trusts, or similar items, is a different question which is not presented by the facts of this case that should be reserved for decision when it arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The order appealed from should be modified to accord with the method for computation of the widow\u2019s share set forth in the petition, as voted by Mr. Justice Callahan at the Appellate Division, with whose dissenting opinion I am in agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Conway, Desmond, Dye and Fuld, JJ., concur with Lewis, Ch. J.; Van Voobhis, J., dissents in opinion in which Froessel, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
