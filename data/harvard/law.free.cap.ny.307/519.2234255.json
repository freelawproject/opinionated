Congress, concerned with the danger of the use of the housing projects as a \u201c breeding ground\u201d or \u201ccell\u201d for the organization and activities of subversive groups, did not, in extending its bounty, act arbitrarily in withholding the benefits of occupancy from members of organizations determined by the Attorney General \u201c after appropriate consideration and determination \u201d to be subversive, an administrative hearing and a judicial remedy being available to an organization to contest any improper designation. (B<em>ailey </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>182 F. 2d 46; <em>Communications Assn. </em>v. <em>Douds, </em>339 U. S. 382.) III.

There was a reasonable relationship between the dangers apprehended by Congress and the condition imposed in appropriating funds for subsidized low-rent housing. It did not act arbitrarily in conditioning occupancy on nonmembership in subversive organizations. (Th<em>ompson </em>v. <em>Wallin, </em>301 N.

The use by Congress of a list of subversive organizations, designated by the Attorney General in determining whether the benefits of the Federally assisted housing program should be withheld, does not offend due process especially since an administrative remedy, as well as judicial review, is available to contest any improper designation. <em>(Garner </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Bd., </em>341 U.

S. Stat. 403) was a provision which has become known as the Gwinn Amendment. It directed, in part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\">\u201c no housing unit constructed under the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended, shall be occupied by a person who is a member of an organization designated as subversive by the Attorney General: <em>Provided </em>further, That the foregoing prohibition shall be enforced by the local housing authority \u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Several months after the enactment of the Amendment, respondent New York City Housing Authority, acting pursuant to regulations issued by the United States Public Housing Administration, adopted a resolution providing that \u201cNo applicant shall be admitted to, and no tenant shall. be permitted to continue to reside in * * * a federally-aided project \u201d, unless the applicant or tenant has signed a certificate to the effect that neither he nor any other occupant of the unit \u201c is a member of an organization designated as subversive by the Attorney General \u201d. And, shortly thereafter, on January 14,1953, the Authority sent a copy of the required certificate to petitioner Peters, who lives in the Williamsburg Houses Project, and requested her to sign it. The certificate, entitled \u201c Certification of Nonmembership in Subversive Organizations \u201d, in part, recited, \u201c I hereby certify that I am not a member of any of the organizations listed in the document entitled <em>\u2018 </em>Consolidated List, Dated November 10,1952, of Organizations Designated by the Attorney General of the United States As Within Executive Order No. 9835 \u2019, attached hereto \u201d. The list \u201c attached \u201d to the certificate sets forth the names of 194 organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">After the Authority had adopted the resolution, and after it had requested that the certificate be signed and advised that a nonsigning tenant would be evicted, petitioner commenced this article 78 proceeding \u2014 on behalf of herself and \u201c all others similarly situated who are members of the Williamsburg Community Association \u201d \u2014 to annul the resolution and enjoin its enforcement. The petition, in addition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>asserting that petitioner had refused to sign the certificate and was, therefore, threatened with eviction, alleges that the action of the Authority 6 \u00a3 violates the rights of the petitioner guaranteed by the Federal Constitution \u201d, in five enumerated respects, and that the Authority\u2019s action is \u00a3&lt; arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable.\u201d While the proceeding was pending at Special Term, appellants Serata, Dore and Feldman were permitted to intervene on allegations that they, too, are tenants of the Authority, residing in either the Bed Hook Housing Project or the Kingsboro Housing Project Unlike petitioner, who does not allege membership in any organization listed by the Attorney General, interveners assert that they are members of the International Workers Order, an organization on that official\u2019s list since November, 1947 (Code of Fed. Reg., tit. 5, Appendix A, pp. 200-201; 13 Federal Begister 1471).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">The court at Special Term, Kings County, sustained the petition and annulled the Authority\u2019s resolution on the ground that, in the compilation of the Attorney General\u2019s list, the requirements of due process had been violated. The Appellate Division modified the order and dismissed the proceeding, holding that, in view of later executive and administrative action, the defects noted at Special Term must be deemed cured.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">For the reasons set forth, we do not reach those questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">It is well settled that issues of constitutionality should not be decided before they need be. (See <em>Lynbrook Gardens </em>v. <em>Ullmann, </em>291 N. Y. 472, certiorari denied 322 U. S. 742; <em>Anti-Fascist Committee </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>341 U. S. 123, 136; <em>Rescue Army </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>331 U. S. 549, 569; <em>Ashwander </em>v. <em>Valley Authority, </em>297 U.

As the United States Supreme Court expressed it in the <em>Rescue Army </em>case <em>(supra, </em>331 U. S. 549, 569), \" constitutional issues affecting legislation will not be determined * * * in advance of the necessity of deciding them; in broader terms than are required by the precise facts to \"which the ruling is to be applied; if the record presents some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of; * * * or if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">So, here, since study of the record reveals at least two non-constitutional grounds upon which the case might be disposed of, we refrain at this stage from passing on the constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">As to the first ground. It may be that the Gwinn Amendment did not empower the Authority to seek or demand a certificate of nonmembership from petitioner or, indeed, from any other tenant or occupant of Williamsburg Houses. The Authority has applied the Amendment to every <em>\u201c federally-aided project </em>\u201d (Resolution of Authority, \u00a7 1), a term defined in section 4 of the resolution as <em>\u201c </em>any project of the Authority receiving financial assistance from the Federal Government or any project leased by the Authority from the Federal Government.\u201d However, the Amendment speaks only of housing units <em>\u201c constructed under </em>the United States Housing Act of 1937 \u201d. And it is not unlikely that Congress intended that the Amendment have only this limited application, for, in the course of Senate discussion of the measure, one of the Senators specifically called to the attention of his colleagues the fact that the Amendment \u201c applies to less than 5 percent of the total [federal] housing program \u201d (98 Congressional Record 8908, per Senator Maybank).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">While it is undisputed that Williamsburg Houses is a \u201c federally-aided project,\u201d as defined by the Authority, the record is devoid of any proof that it was \u201c constructed under \u201d the Housing Act of 1937. Petitioner does, it is true, allege that it <em>was </em>so constructed, hut her allegation, unsupported by any evidence, is offset by the affidavit of respondent\u2019s chairman which, flatly contradicting her, asserts that it was <em>not, </em>that, while it was leased to respondent by the United States Public Housing Administration, it was \" constructed * * * <em>apart from </em>the United States Housing Act of 1937\".<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">What motivated the parties, particularly petitioner, to take positions contrary to their seeming interest we do not know. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>We do know, and we do hold, however, that it is pointless and worse to determine whether the Authority may, consistent with the Constitution, evict petitioner for failure to sign the requested certificate, if neither the Gwinn Amendment nor any other statute empowered the Authority to require such a certificate from tenants or occupants of Williamsburg Houses. And, although the constitutionality of the Authority\u2019s resolution may be a question of considerable interest to petitioner, if it could have no impact upon her, nor under any circumstances affect her, the court may not, despite the allegations of her pleading, consider or pass upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The case should, therefore, be remitted to Special Term, so that the facts may be sifted and evaluated and the litigants given an opportunity to argue the applicable law. It may be that the Williamsburg Project is, in fact, encompassed by the Gwinn Amendment, or that, even if the Authority went beyond what was allowable under that statute, there was some other source of power for its action. In such event, if there be no other threshold obstacle, the constitutional questions would then be ripe for consideration and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">As to the second ground. It also appears that the Authority may have required petitioner and others to disavow membership in organizations other than those \u2014 to use the terms of the Gwinn Amendment \u2014 <em>\u201c </em>designated as subversive by the Attorney General \u201d. On July 5, 1952, when Congress enacted the Gwinn Amendment, the Attorney General had, for four and a half years (13 Federal Register 1471), been furnishing the Loyalty Review Board of the United States Civil Service Commission with a list of organizations, in accordance with Executive Order 9835 (Code of Fed. Reg., tit. 3, 1947 Supp., p. 129; 12 Federal Register 1935, 1938).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And, for almost four years, the Attorney General had, in compiling that list, broken it down into six classes or categories, only one of which was entitled <em>\u201c </em>subversive \u201d (Code of Fed. Reg., tit. 5, 1952 Supp., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>pp. 123, 126; 13 Federal Register 6135, 6137, 6138):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">1. \u201c Totalitarian \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">2. \u201c Fascist \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">3. <em>\u201c </em>Communist \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">4. \u201c Subversive \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">5. <em>\u201c </em>Organizations Which Have \u2018 Adopted a Policy of Advocating or Approving the Commission of Acts of Force and Violence to Deny Others Their Rights Under the Constitution of the United States.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">6. <em>\u201c </em>Organizations Which \u2018 Seek to Alter the Form of Government of the United States by Unconstitutional Means. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">Some organizations appeared in more than one class, a duplication made necessary by the fact that, in the view of the Attorney General, each category \u201c must be tak\u00e9n to be <em>independent and mutually exclusive of the others </em>\u201d (Code of Fed. Reg., tit. 5, Appendix A, p. 203; 13 Federal Register 6137). But, despite the duplication and although more than 190 different organizations appeared on the list, <em>only twelve </em>had been designated as \u201c subversive \u201d when the Gwinn Amendment was passed (Code of Fed. Reg., tit. 5, 1952 Supp., p. 126; 16 Federal Register 12214), and <em>only thirteen </em>had been so named by the time the Authority moved to enforce it (Code of Fed. Reg., tit. 5, 1952 Supp., p. 126; 17 Federal Register 6241).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-14\">Since the Attorney General\u2019s list was a matter of public and official record, Congress, in legislating with respect to organizations <em>\" </em>designated as subversive by the Attorney General, \u2019 \u2019 may, it is reasonable to assume, have intended to refer only to those specifically designated by the Attorney General as \u201c subversive \u201d. The record indicates, however, that the Authority, though presuming to act in accordance with the Gwinn Amendment, has insisted that petitioner and other tenants disaffirm membership, not in a mere twelve or thirteen organizations, but in any and every group appearing on the Attorney General\u2019s list, no matter what the category. The certificate furnished by the Authority \u2014 which petitioner was required to sign in its . existing form, without altering it or substituting another<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>recited that \u201c I hereby certify that I am not a member of any of the organizations listed in the document * * * <em>attached hereto.\u201d </em>And the \u201c attached\u201d document, entitled \u201c Consolidated List, Dated November 10, 1952, of Organizations Designated by the Attorney General of the United States As Within Executive Order No. 9835 \u201d, simply sets out in alphabetical order every one of the 194 organizations named by the Attorney General, without any indication as to whether they were labelled \u201csubversive,\u201d \u201cfascist,\u201d \u201ctotalitarian\u201d or something else. So far as the record discloses, therefore, there was no way by which a tenant, reading the list, could discern which were the organizations designated by the Attorney General as subversive and which were the many otherwise described.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Available data may reveal that the Authority did only what was allowed by the Gwinn Amendment. And, although the Authority, has disclaimed reliance on any other statute \u2014 asserting as it does in its answer that its action was solely under the Gwinn Amendment and \" not taken * * * pursuant to any statute of the State of New York or on its own initiative \u201d \u2014 it may be that here, too, some further source of power existed for its resolution and other action. However, these are questions that we cannot decide without more facts than those in the record before us. They are matters to be explored on remission, where the facts can be unraveled and the essential statutes, executive orders and administrative rulings analyzed and evaluated. Again, we decide merely that, until there is some showing that the Authority was empowered by the Gwinn Amendment to do what the record suggests it did, it would be improper and unwise to determine whether or not that statute or the action of the Authority, professedly taken under it, was constitutional and valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Petitioner, in seeking relief, has pleaded and relied almost exclusively on provisions of the Federal Constitution. In view of that, if, upon remission, the court at Special Term concludes that the Authority exceeded its statutory powers, it should also consider whether it might not be more appropriate to dismiss the petition than to grant the relief sought. And, in that event, it is for Special Term to consider, in the first instance, what effect a dismissal of the original petition would have upon the intervening petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the matter remitted to Special Term for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Lewis, Oh. J., Conway, Desmond, Dye, Fboessel and Van Yoobhis, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-10\">. And, on the affirmative side, there is authority for the conclusion that <em>\u201c </em>Williamsburg and Harlem River Houses were built under the NIRA program.\u201d (1953 Directory of Large Seale Rental Housing in New York City, published by the Citizens\u2019 Housing and Planning Council of New York, Inc., p. 23.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-6\">. Executive Order 10450 (Code of Fed. Reg. tit. 3, 1953 Supp., pp. 72, 76; 18 Federal Register 2489) revoked Executive Order 9835, but, by express incorporation of part of the revoked order, perpetuated the power of the Attorney General to list organizations which he deemed totalitarian, fascist, subversive, etc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b560-15\">. The resolution adopted by the Authority specifically states in section 1 (subd.
