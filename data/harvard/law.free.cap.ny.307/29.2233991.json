The income, the will provided, was to be divided among Bertha, Emily and Carl, and, upon the termination of the trust, its corpus was to go to Carl and his heirs <em>\u201c </em>absolutely and forever.\u201d If, however, Carl died before Bertha and Emily, or if all three predeceased the testatrix, the trust corpus or the residue of the estate, as the case might foe, was to be given to three charitable institutions, the appellants upon this appeal. The will, insofar as here relevant, reads in this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\"><em>\u201c </em>Upon the death of my cousin, Emily Seville Yah Hovehberg, and of my sister, Bertha Hofferberth, the said trust shall come to an end, and I do hereby give, devise and bequeath the principal or corpus thereof, and any accumulated income thereof, unto my nephew, Carl F. Hofferberth, for himself and his heirs, absolutely and forever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">\u201c In the event, however, that my nephew, Carl <em>* * * </em>should die before the death of my sister, Bertha * * * and my cousin, Emily * * * then upon the death * * * [of Bertha and Emily], I do hereby give, devise and bequeath the principal or corpus of the trust herein-above created, and any accumulated income thereof, share and share alike,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">to Manhattan Eye, Ear &amp; Throat Hospital, New Rochelle Hospital and Colburn Memorial Home.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">Emily predeceased the testatrix. Carl outlived both of them, but died before Bertha, survived by two young children. On Bertha\u2019s death in 1952, the trust came to an end, in accordance with the provision of the will. That precipitated a dispute, between the executors and trustees under Elisabeth Campbell\u2019s will and the administrator of Carl\u2019s estate, as to the disposition of the trust corpus. The former, in their petition for judicial settlement, took the view that the corpus should go to the three institutions, while the latter, respondent upon this appeal, maintained that Carl or, more precisely, his estate was entitled to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Simply put, the issue before us is whether Carl had to survive the termination of the trust \u2014 that is, outlive both Bertha and Emily \u2014 in order to be entitled to the remainder. Under applicable principles of testamentary construction, it is clear, no such requirement of survival was intended or imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The first paragraph quoted above indisputably gave Carl a vested interest which was not to be defeated by his death before the trust ended. \u201cUpon the death.of \u201d her sister and her cousin, the testatrix declared, the \u201c trust shall come to an end, and I do hereby give, devise and bequeath the principal * * * unto my nephew * * * for himself and his heirs, absolutely and forever.\u201d Had the will gone no further, the remainder to Carl \u2014 as a person \u2018\u2018 in being, who would have an immediate right to the possession of the property, on the determination of all the intermediate or precedent estates \u201d (Real Property Law, \u00a7 40; see, also, <em>Matter of Watson, </em>262 N. Y. 284, 299) \u2014 would hive been indefensibly vested. Such being the case, that clear and absolute grant could not be cut down by language contained in a later testamentary provision, unless \u201c that language [was] as clear and decisive as that which created the vested remainder.\u201d <em>(Matter of Krooss, </em>302 N. Y. 424, 428; see, also, <em>Matter of Rooker, </em>248 N. Y. 361, 364; <em>Herzog </em>v. <em>Title Guar. &amp; Trust Co., 177 N. Y. </em>86, 93; <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Coddington, </em>154 N. Y. 283, 286.) Moreover, the courts have long expressed a preference for a testamentary construction which results in an early indefeasibility, an early and final vesting of estates. Accordingly, a construction which renders a vested remainder defeasible will be restricted to the exact circumstances specified. (See, e.g., <em>Matter of Krooss, supra, </em>302 N. Y. 424, 428; 2 Powell on Real Property [1950], \u00a7 330, pp. 729, 730; 3 Restatement, Property, \u00a7 254.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The will\u2019s further language indicates that the condition under which Carl\u2019s remainder could be defeated was very narrowly circumscribed. \"When read literally \u2014 and it is a reasonable reading \u2014 it demonstrates that Carl\u2019s interest was subject to divestment only upon the happening of a single contingency \u2014 his death before that of the testatrix\u2019 sister \u201c and \u201d her cousin. The remainder was to be divested, not if he died after the death of one and before the death of the other or after the death of both, but only if he died before both of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The appellant charitable institutions, however, would have us read the \u201c and \u201d as <em>\u201c </em>or,\u201d for they argue that the language in question accomplishes a divestiture of Carl\u2019s remainder if he died before the death of the testatrix\u2019 cousin or sister or, to put it slightly differently, before their collective deaths. In effect, treating Carl\u2019s remainder as contingent upon his survival, appellants maintain that, since Carl was to receive the remainder only <em>\u201c </em>upon the death of \u201d the testatrix\u2019 sister and cousin, he was not entitled to it unless he survived them. The argument borders on verbal legerdemain, confusing as it does the time of enjoyment of the remainder with the time of its vesting in interest. The use of the phrase, <em>\u201c </em>upon the death of,\u201d as an adverbial expression of time has on innumerable occasions been interpreted to annex futurity only to possession and not to the substance of the gift. (See <em>Matter of Krooss, supra, </em>302 N. Y. 424, 431; <em>Staples </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>214 N. Y. 625, affg. 159 App. Div. 922, 152 App. Div. 745; <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>166 N. Y. 406; <em>Matter of Bates, </em>272 App. Div. 559, 562; <em>Matter of Bostwick, </em>203 App. Div. 158, 159.) In addition, words of \u201c present gift \u201d \u2014 in this case, \u201c I do hereby give, devise and bequeath the principal \u201d to Carl \u201c absolutely and forever \u201d \u2014 afford further proof that his remainder was vested. \u2018 \u2018 An explicit present gift of a future interest implies, in the absence of contrary indications, that the intervening estate * * * merely suspends the enjoyment of the interest and does not prevent the vesting thereof.\u201d (Powell, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 331, p. 735; see, also, Restatement, Property, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 257.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">We will not speculate on whether the testatrix had some reason for making a distinction betweeen Carl\u2019s death before the death of both Bertha and Emily and his death after the death of only one of them. It is enough that the testatrix declared that such was her desire. Beyond that, the <em>\u201c </em>constructional preference \u201d for \u201c favoring the blood of the testator rather than strangers \u201d <em>(Matter of Rooker, supra, </em>248 N. Y. 361, 364) and for early indefeasibility will not be disregarded unless the testamentary language employed makes such a, course mandatory. (See, e.g., <em>Matter of Krooss, supra, </em>302 N. Y. 424; Powell, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 330, p. 729.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>If Elisabeth Campbell had created a trust for the lives of her sister and cousin with a remainder to Carl, <em>if Tie be living </em>\u201e <em>at their deaths, </em>his interest would then have been conditioned upon his surviving the other two and would have become indefeasibly vested only if he were alive at the termination of the trust. (See, e.g., <em>Matter of Gates, </em>239 App. Div. 666, 671; 3 Jessup-Redfield on Surrogates\u2019 Law and Practice [Rev. ed., 1949], \u00a7 2434.) But the testatrix did not so provide, and Carl did not have to outlive both of the other life beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The situation is not too unlike that in <em>Matter of Krooss (supra, </em>302 N. Y. 424), however different the family relationships involved and the type of language employed. There, the testator gave his wife a life estate, remainder to his children Florence and John, but \u2014 the will proceeded \u2014 if either died before their mother, leaving descendants, the descendants were to take their parent\u2019s share. We there held that Florence, who died before her mother, without having had descendants, took a vested remainder subject to being divested only upon the happening of the exact conditions stipulated, namely, death before her mother, leaving descendants. Since both those conditions did not eventuate, her share remained vested and went to her next of kin upon the death of the life beneficiary. So, here, Carl\u2019s remainder was subject to divestiture only upon the happening of the one condition specified in the will, and, since it did not occur, his interest remained vested and passed to his estate when the trust ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Moreover, the type of <em>\u201c </em>supplanting limitation \u201d employed may well point the construction to be adopted. \u201c Supplanting limitations differ,\u201d writes Powell in his work on Real Property <em>(op. cit., </em>pp. 729-730), \u201c in that some provide a taker who is to become the substitute whenever the prior taker fails to survive, while others provide a taker who is to become the substitute only under some circumstances. In cases of the second type, the constructional preference for early indefeasibility causes the requirement of survival to be strictly construed, and to operate.only under the exact circumstances stipulated.\u201d (See, also, Restatement, Property, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 254.) In the case before us, the <em>\u201c </em>supplanting limitation \u201d in the will is of the second type, with the consequence that appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>became \u201c substitute \u201d takers only if Carl failed to survive both Bertha and Emily. When that \u2018 \u2018 exact \u201d event did not transpire, when, in other words, Carl, having survived the testatrix, outlived Emily, appellants could not possibly establish their right to the remainder over. Our conclusion must, of necessity, be that Carl\u2019s vested interest passed to his estate upon the termination of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs to all parties appearing separately and filing separate briefs, payable out of the estate.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b66-6\">Van Voorhis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXv\">(dissenting). In the construction of wills, presumptions are not indulged if the effect is to violate the intention of the testator as expressed in the instrument <em>(Matter of Tamargo, </em>220 N. Y. 225). That, it seems to me, is the consequence of applying to this will the presumption in favor of vesting applied in such cases as <em>Matter of Krooss </em>(302 N. Y. 424, 428) and <em>Matter of Watson </em>(262 N. Y. 284, 299).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The question is whether Carl F. Hofferberth\u2019s remainder was divested by his death before the termination of the trust. Such was clearly the intention of the testatrix, who made a substitutional gift of the remainder to charitable institutions in that event. The measuring lives were those of testatrix\u2019 cousin and sister. Her will states that \u201c Upon the death of my cousin, Emily Seville Yah Hovehberg, and of my sister, Bertha Hofferberth, the said trust shall come to an end,\u201d in which event the remainder is given to the nephew Carl. If that was all there were to it, Carl <em>would </em>have taken a vested remainder that would not have been subject to divestment in event of his death before the termination of the trust. The next paragraph, however, expressly states that in the event of Carl\u2019s death \u201c before the death of my sister, Bertha Hofferberth* and my cousin, Emily Seville Yah Hovehberg, then upon the death of my said sister, Bertha Hofferberth, and my cousin, Emily Seville Yah Hovehberg, I do hereby give, devise and bequeath the principal or corpus of the trust hereinabove created * * * unto * * * Mahhattah Eye, Ear &amp; Throat Hospital, of New York City, New Rochelle Hospital, of Gui\u00f3n Place, New Rochelle, New York, and Colburh Memorial Home, of New Rochelle, New York \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Having measured the trust in accordance with the rule against perpetuities by the lives of Emily and Bertha, the manifest intention'was to give the remainder to these charities instead of to Carl if Carl died before the trust ended when, if he were then living, it would have vested in interest in him. The meaning is that if Carl should die before Bertha and Emily were both dead, then Carl\u2019s remainder would be divested and would pass to the charitable institutions which are substituted in his place. It is a familiar canon of interpretation that the singular is to be read as the plural, and vice versa, where the wording and structure of the instrument or statute indicate that such was the intent (General Construction Law, \u00a7 35; <em>Culver </em>v. <em>Title Guar. &amp; Trust Co., </em>296 N. Y. 74; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>56 N. Y. 387, 392).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In this instance testatrix demonstrated in this very clause that when she said <em>\u201c </em>death \u201d she meant <em>\u201c </em>deaths \u201d, inasmuch as the will speaks of the <em>\u201c death </em>of my sister, Bertha Hopper-berth, <em>and </em>my cousin, Emily Seville Van Hovenberg,\u201d (italics supplied). In the previous paragraph she had also mentioned <em>61 </em>the death of my cousin, Emily * * * and of my sister, Bertha Hopperberth \u2019 \u2019. By referring to the death of two persons, testatrix obviously meant their deaths. It is equally plain that she intended the plural in using the singular where she divests Carl\u2019s remainder if he \u201c should die before the death of my sister, Bertha Hopperberth, and my cousin, Emily Seville Van Hovenberg \u201d. That signifies the deaths of both Bertha and Emily, and means that Carl\u2019s remainder is divested unless he survives them both. She plainly intended to give the remainder to the charities instead of to Carl unless he survived Bertha and Emily, whose joint lives measured the duration of the trust. He survived one but not the other, in which event the will, without ambiguity, gives the remainder to the three appellant charitable institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed and the remainder held to belong to appellants, with costs to parties appearing payable out of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Lewis, Ch. J., Conway, Desmond, Dye and Froessel, JJ., concur with Fuld, J.; Van Voorhis, J., dissents in opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
