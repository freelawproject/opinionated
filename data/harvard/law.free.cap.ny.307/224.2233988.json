In these American plan hotels, it is customary for guests to tip chambermaids. Claimant\u2019s compensation for caring for twenty-eight rooms, seven days a week, during* the period in question, consisted of $75 dollars a month paid by her employer, room and board furnished by him, and tips from guests which aggregated $400.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Under section 517 of the Labor Law, gratuities are deemed to be part of the <em>\u201c </em>remuneration \u201d paid an employee by his employer. Moreover, that section places upon the <em>commissioner </em>the <em>duty </em>to determine the amount of such gratuities. The pertinent language is as follows (subd. 1): \" Where gratuities are received by the employee in the course of his employment from a person other than his employer, <em>the value of such gratuities shall be determined by the commissioner </em>and be deemed and included as part of his remuneration paid by his employer.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The method adopted by the commissioner for determining the amount of chambermaids\u2019 tips is set forth in his rule 6, promulgated pursuant to power allegedly granted him by subdivision 1 of section 530 of the Labor Law. This rule, so far as it applies to this case, provides (subd. b) that the value of gratuities received by a chambermaid shall be equal to the amount certified by her in a signed statement to her employer, and, if no such statement has been submitted, such gratuities shall be deemed to be \u201cnil\u201d. Subdivision d of the same rule further provides that employers \u201c shall give notice to each of their hotel service employees \u201d of this \u201c privilege \u201d, and of the consequences for failing to submit such statement. It is undisputed that claimant\u2019s employer did not so notify her, thus avoiding payment of the tax thereon, and that she knew nothing about this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">When she applied for unemployment benefits in October, 1949, the referee determined that such gratuities may not be included as remuneration. The Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board reversed the referee, and was in turn reversed by the Appellate Division, which reinstated the referee\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">We are of the opinion that, in computing claimant\u2019s unemployment benefits, the Industrial Commissioner should have credited her with the $400 in gratuities. It is the commissioner\u2019s statutory duty to determine the value of an employee\u2019s gratuities (Labor Law, \u00a7 517). He has attempted to carry out this duty by promulgating rule 6. While this rule may be reasonable in the case of European plan hotels, where it is agreed gratuities are nil or very meager, and in which the majority of hotel chambermaids throughout the State are employed, there is no rational basis for presuming to be \u201c nil \u201d gratuities of the large number of chambermaids who work in American plan hotels, and whose earnings of that character are substantial. If the operation of this presumption is to reduce substantially a claimant\u2019s statutory unemployment benefits, simple fairness requires that she have the notice <em>prescribed by the commissioner </em>of her opportunity to declare gratuities and of the consequences for failing to do so. Otherwise, application of the rule may result in an unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious determination by the commissioner of the total amount of claimant\u2019s remunera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>tian \u2014 indeed in no determination at all. This would be in violation of the statute (\u00a7 517), and in contravention of the authority given him by subdivision 1 of section 530 to make rules <em>\u201c </em>to administer \u201d the statute, not to disregard it <em>(Matter of Federal Tel. &amp; Radio Corp. [Corsi], </em>301 N. Y. 95, 99).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The commissioner\u2019s argument that the notice requirement in paragraph d of rule 6 was \u201c merely a suggestion \u201d is without force, and his duty to determine the value of gratuities cannot be so easily satisfied. Under his own rule, it is only after the employee himself has been notified that the presumption may reasonably be invoked, and he has not met the fundamental demands of fairness by merely attempting to impose upon employers the duty of giving notice. This is especially so when one considers that the employer has a positive financial interest in neglecting to perform that duty. The employer gains when his employees fail to declare their gratuities, because, under the statute, it is he who is required to pay the additional payroll tax on whatever gratuities are declared. Moreover, it is the commissioner\u2019s duty to see that this tax.is paid (Labor Law, \u00a7\u00a7 570-573).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Thus, since claimant did not receive the notice prescribed by the commissioner in his own rule 6 (subd. d) that she must either declare her tips or forfeit unemployment benefits based thereon, the commissioner could not reasonably take advantage of his rule 6 presumption and deprive her of those benefits, in the face of his mandatory statutory duty under section 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, and the determination of the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board reinstated, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Lewis, Ch. J., Conway, Desmond, Dye and Fuld, JJ., concur; Van Voorhis, J., dissents and votes for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
