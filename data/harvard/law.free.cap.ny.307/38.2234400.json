The law\u2019s regulation of employment agencies and its prohibitions against the use of particular pre-employment procedures are reasonable exercises of the State\u2019s police power. <em>(Woollcott </em>v. <em>Shubert, </em>217 N.

S. 88.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b71-5\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5T\">Representing as it does the first instance of a litigated controversy, after a hearing, under the Law Against Discrimination (Executive Law, art. 15), this appeal is of more than passing significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Helena Holland, appellant herein, doing business as the Holland Vocational Service, operates an employment agency for secretaries and clerical workers in New York City. On September 18,1951, a young woman, Rue Lehds by name, went to the agency in response to a newspaper advertisement for a secretary. She was given an application to fill out which included, among other items, the question, \u201c Family Name or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Your Name ever Changed Legally or otherwise.\u201d Miss Lehds answered by noting that her family name had been \u201c Winston.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">After looking over the application as filled out, appellant proceeded to question Miss Lehds concerning the religion of one of her former employers, the maiden name of the latter\u2019s wife \u2014 \u201c What sort of name is that?\u201d \u2014 and the applicant\u2019s national origin, as reflected by her name and schooling. Although, according to Miss Lehds, there was some discussion of a prospective position \u2014 with an employer other than appellant \u2014 nothing further came of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Upon Miss Lehds\u2019 complaint, respondent, the State Commission Against Discrimination, conducted a preliminary investigation and then, after unsuccessful resort to the statutory procedure of \u2018 \u2018 conference, conciliation and persuasion \u2019 \u2019, held a hearing in accordance with the provisions of the Law Against Discrimination (Executive Law, \u00a7 297). Appellant made a statement in her behalf in the preliminary investigation and filed an answer to the complaint. At the hearing, however, she withdrew before any evidence was taken, electing to make no defense and to conduct no cross-examination of the witnesses who testified in support of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the commission decided that the question as to change of name in the application form and the oral inquiries violated subdivision 3 of section 296 of the statute. That subdivision (renum. by L. 1952, ch. 285, as \u00a7 296, subd. 1, par. [c]) declares it to be an unlawful practice for any employer or employment agency, as defined in the Law, <em>s( </em>to use any form of application for employment or to make any inquiry in connection with prospective employment, which expresses, directly or indirectly, any limitation, specification or discrimination as to race, creed, color or national origin, or any intent to make any such limitation, specification or discrimination, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">To enforce its determination, the commission issued an order directing appellant to <em>\u201c </em>cease and desist \u201d from making any inquiries respecting race, creed, color or national origin when interviewing, or receiving applications from, persons seeking employment; from giving consideration to such factors in making evaluations of applicants for referral to prospective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>employers; and from using an application form which includes any inquiry or reference concerning an applicant\u2019s change of name, unless first submitted to, and approved by, the commission. Appellant was further directed not to furnish any information to prospective employers as to an applicant\u2019s race, creed, color or national origin, and not to accept any job orders containing any limitation, specification or discrimination on that score. The order also required appellant to maintain and make available to the commission, for a period of one year, records of the action taken on all employment applications and employers\u2019 job orders, and to make available to the commission all other records relating to her business, until such time as the commission should determine that she was complying with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">It is worth noting\u2014 particularly in view of section 298 of the Executive Law \u2014 that no objection was urged before the commission as to any finding of fact, conclusion of law or requirement of the order, and no change or modification of such order was sought of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Shortly after the determination was made, proceedings were initiated both by the commission to compel compliance with its order and by appellant to review the commission\u2019s decision. The Supreme Court at Special Term granted the commission\u2019s application and denied appellant\u2019s petition. The Appellate Division affirmed by a divided court, the minority dissenting with respect to the direction that appellant maintain records of the action taken on employment applications and job orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">At the outset, we observe that the legislature created the Commission Against Discrimination to effectuate its declared policy of combating the practice of discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color or national origin, as a threat to our democratic institutions (Executive Law, \u00a7 290). Specified discriminatory practices in the field of employment were denominated \u201cunlawful employment practices,\u201d and the commission was empowered to take appropriate action to eliminate and prevent such practices (\u00a7\u00a7 290, 296, 297).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon complaint by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>\u201c Any person claiming to be aggrieved \u201d, the commission is authorized to conduct a hearing, after first attempting to eliminate the practice complained of \u201cby conference, conciliation and persuasion.\u201d If, upon all the evidence at the hearing, the commission finds that the respondent has engaged in an unlawful employment practice as defined in the statute, it is authorized to issue an order requiring the respondent to \u201c cease and desist from such unlawful employment practice and to take such affirmative action * * * as, in the judgment of the commission, will effectuate the purposes of this article \u201d (\u00a7\u25a0 297). Provisiones made for judicial review and enforcement of orders of the commission, the statute announcing that \u201c The findings of the commission as to the facts shall be conclusive if supported by sufficient evidence on the record considered as a whole \u201d (\u00a7 298).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Judicial review of findings made by an administrative agency such as this commission is, of course, limited to the question whether the findings are, upon the entire record, supported by evidence \u201c so substantial that from it an inference of the existence of the fact found may be drawn reasonably.\u201d <em>(Matter of Stork Restaurant </em>v. <em>Boland, </em>282 <em>N. </em>Y. 256, 273; see, also, <em>Matter of McCormack </em>v. <em>National City Bank, </em>303 N. Y. 5, 9; <em>Matter of Humphrey </em>v. <em>State Ins. Fund, </em>298 N. Y. 327, 332.) There can be no doubt that there was here present the requisite substantial evidence to support the commission\u2019s findings that appellant\u2019s inquiries \u201c expressed a [prohibited] limitation, specification or discrimination as to creed or national origin.\u201d In accordance with the statutory declaration (\u00a7 298), those findings are, therefore \u201c conclusive \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Appellant, however, argues that neither the inquiry as to change of name nor any of the questions put by her in the oral interview necessarily reflected a discriminatory purpose or design. And it is quite true, as the Appellate Division observed, that the inquiry as to change of name might, in another setting, \u201cbe entirely removed from any purpose of discrimination\u201d and might, under other circumstances, be regarded as \u201c quite appropriate \u201d (282 App. Div. 353, 359). Nevertheless, in this case, it was entirely reasonable for the commission to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>that appellant\u2019s inquiries, when considered as a whole and in context, contravened the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">One intent on violating the Law Against Discrimination cannot be expected to declare or announce his purpose. Far more, likely, is if; that he will pursue his discriminatory practices in, ways that are devious, by methods subtle and elusive \u2014 for we deal with an area in which <em>\u201c </em>subtleties of conduct * * * play no small part\u201d. (Cf. <em>Labor Bd. </em>v. <em>Express Pub. Co., </em>312 U. S. 426, 437.) All of which amply justifies the legislature\u2019s grant of broad power to the commission to appraise, correlate and evaluate the facts uncovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">In the proceedings before the commission, appellant challenged the agency\u2019s jurisdiction upon the ground that she had interviewed complainant for a position in her own office, and that, as an employer of less than six persons, she was not subject to the provisions of the statute (\u00a7 292, subd. 5). The commission found the fact to be otherwise; it expressly stated, in accordance with complainant\u2019s testimony, that the interview related to a position with an employer other than appellant. Appellant has apparently abandoned that contention on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">A further objection to jurisdiction, not presented to the commission, is, however, now advanced, the new claim being that the complainant could not be considered a person \u201c aggrieved \u201d within the meaning of the statute (\u00a7 297), since there is no evidence or finding that she was refused a referral because of discrimination on the part of appellant. But in view of the explicit statutory direction that \u201cHo objection that has not been urged before the commission shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances \u201d (\u00a7 298), and since there is not even a suggestion of such \u201c circumstances \u201d, the objection \u201c is not open for review by a court \u201d. <em>(Labor Bd. </em>v. <em>Cheney Lumber Co., </em>327 U. S. 385, 389; see, also, <em>May Stores Co. </em>v. <em>Labor Bd., </em>326 U. S. 376, 386, n. 5.) In the <em>Cheney Lumber </em>case <em>(supra, </em>327 U. S. 385), the Supreme Court explicitly ruled \u2014 under an identical provision of statute (Hational Labor Relations Act, \u00a7 10, subd. [e], U. S. Code, tit. 29, \u00a7 160, subd. [e]) \u2014 that an objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>not advanced until after the agency seeks judicial enforcement of its order \u201c came too late \u201d (p. 388). <em>\u201c </em>We can say \u201d, wrote the court (p. 389), \u201c that it <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> gives emphasis to the salutary policy adopted by \u00a7 10 (e) of affording the Board opportunity consider on the merits questions to be urged upon review, of its order.\u2019 * * * Justification of such an order, which necessarily involves consideration of the facts which are the foundation of the order, is not open for review by a court if no prior objection has been urged before the case gets into court and there is a total want of extraordinary circumstances to excuse \u2018 the failure or neglect to urge such objection * * *.\u2019 Congress desired that all controversies of fact, and the allowable inferences from the facts, be threshed out, certainly in the first instance, before the Board. That is what the Board is for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In any event, though, it is clear that the commission acted within its jurisdiction in entertaining the complaint here involved. It properly regarded the complaining witness as a person \u201c aggrieved \u201d by inquiries directed to her in violation of the statute, even though there may have been no actual refusal of a referral. The proscribed inquiry is thus itself declared an unlawful employment practice by the statute, whether or no the applicant be denied employment or referral.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The only other objection urged by appellant in this court concerns particular directives contained in the order issued by the commission. The Executive Law authorizes that body to devise remedies which it deems appropriate to \u201c effectuate \u201d the legislative policy against discrimination and to prevent future violations by a proven transgressor (\u00a7 297). The commission\u2014 as in the case of other agencies under comparable statutes \u2014 \u2018 \u2018 has wide discretion in its choice of a remedy deemed adequate to cope with the unlawful practices \u201d in question, <em>\u201c </em>and the courts will not interfere except where the remedy selected has no reasonable relation to the unlawful practices found to exist.\u201d <em>(Siegel Co. </em>v. <em>Trade Comm., </em>327 U. S. 608, 611, 612-613; see, also, <em>Labor Bd. </em>v. <em>Cheney Lumber Co., supra, </em>327 U. S. 385, 388; <em>Federal Trade Comm. </em>v. <em>Ruberoid Co., </em>343 U. S. 470, 473.) However, we do not consider whether any subdivision of the commission\u2019s order offends on that score. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>As already noted, the objection, not having been made until after the commission had gone into court to secure enforcement of its order, came too late. <em>(Supra, </em>pp. 45-46; see Executive Law, \u00a7 298; <em>Labor Bd. </em>v. <em>Cheney Lumber Co., supra, </em>327 U. S. 385, 388-389.) Decision on questions not now reviewable should await a case that presents them.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\">. Amendments enacted in 1952 (L. 1952, ehs. 284, 285), not applicable to this case, enlarged the scope of the statute and changed the description of the prohibited practices to \u201cunlawful discriminatory practices.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b77-6\">Froessel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWD\">(concurring). We concur for affirmance, and in large measure agree with Judge Fuld. This is not to say, however, that in another setting and under other circumstances we would approve in its entirety the order of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Using the form of application which includes the question whether applicant\u2019s name was \u201c ever Changed Legally or otherwise \u201d is not in itself objectionable. Women change their names by reason of marriage. An applicant may have been convicted of crime, adjudged a bankrupt or committed some act of misconduct which he may seek to conceal from an employer by a change of name. It may be noted that similar questions as to change of name are contained in applications for admission to practice in the Supreme Court of the United States, in applications of the Department of Civil Service of the State of New York, and in questionnaires employed by the Character Committee of the Appellate Division, established pursuant to section 90 of the Judiciary Law, rule 1 of the Rules of Civil Practice, and our own Rules VIII and IX for admission of attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">However, under the circumstances presented by this record, and in the absence of objection under section 298 of the Executive Law, we may not disturb the determination of the commission that the oral and written inquiries \u201ctaken together\u201d constituted an unlawful employment practice. Petitioner had every opportunity to present her evidence, contentions and objections to the commission, but she chose not to take full advantage of that opportunity. She may not now ask us to consider objections that have not been urged before the commission, unless her failure or neglect to urge them shall be excusable because of extraordinary circumstances, which are not present here <em>(Labor Bd. </em>v. <em>Cheney Lumber Co., </em>327 U. S. 385).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>As to the directives concerning affirmative action, had objection been timely made by petitioner, we would have grave doubt as to the propriety of subdivision e, which orders petitioner, and without a time limitation, to submit to the commission all job orders \u201cwhich raise a question\u201d whether there was a violation of section 296; and to subdivisions f and h only because they were not limited to a reasonable time as was done in subdivision g. In any event, and especially because of their penal aspects (\u00a7 299), such directives could not be unreasonably prolonged, in which event an article 78 proceeding would lie to compel appropriate action <em>(Bohling </em>v. <em>Corsi, </em>306 N. Y. 815).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Lewis, Ch. J., and Desmond, J., concur with Fuld, J.; Fbcessel, J., concurs for affirmance in a separate memorandum in which Conway, Dye and Van Voobhis, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
