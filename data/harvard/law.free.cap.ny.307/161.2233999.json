In March of 1948, while in the employ of appellant B &amp; A Construction, Inc., he slipped on a paint brush and caught his right leg on a step; again, in June, 1949, while employed by appellant A. L. Turner, a ladder which he was climbing broke and he struck and twisted the same leg. As a result of these injuries, his right knee, previously sound, acquired a pronounced tendency to \u201c lock,\u201d so that claimant, until he could <em>\u201c </em>shake \u201d it back into place, found himself \u2014 as he put it \u2014 \u201c paralyzed <em>* * * </em>from my knee to my hip,\u201d and deprived of all use and control of his right leg. From the report of a doctor, made after the second accident, it appears that <em>\u201c </em>even mild trauma such as that caused by stepping over a small stone on the road or a high place in the sidewalk * * * [created] the sensation of the <em>\u2018 </em>knee giving away.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Claimant suffered this locking, and the accompanying pain and paralysis, frequently, not only while walking but, indeed, whenever he put pressure on his knee. Driving an automobile became particularly hazardous; claimant himself testified that <em>\u201c </em>once or twice a week,\u201d in applying pressure to the brake, his knee slipped into such a position that \u201c he would have to stop and unlock it.\u201d Nevertheless, he continued to operate his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>On June 30,1950, a year after the second injury, claimant was hurt in an automobile accident, and it is solely from that accident that the present award stems. He was driving in the state of Maryland, at a speed of between forty and forty-five miles an hour, when \u201c something [went] haywire with \u201d the steering wheel; the tie rod, by which the front wheels are controlled, had, it subsequently appeared, broken. Although in the past claimant had always succeeded in stopping his car, on this occasion, when he tried to press down on the brake, nothing happened. His knee <em>\u201c </em>locked,\u201d it was \u201c paralyzed \u201d and useless, and the car, out of control, careened off the highway, into the woods, and struck a tree. Claimant lay unconscious for some time and, when taken to a local hospital, was found to have suffered a comminuted fracture of the right femur.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Having previously received an award for his earlier injuries, claimant now seeks compensation for the injuries sustained in the automobile accident. This latest mishap did not arise in the course of his employment, for, concededly, claimant was driving on his own personal business. An award is, therefore, warranted only if the automobile accident and the consequent injuries resulted directly and naturally from claimant\u2019s prior injuries and the disability thereby produced. (See, e.g., <em>Matter of Robbins </em>v. <em>Frohlich, </em>303 N. Y. 987; <em>Matter of Brown </em>v. <em>New York State Training School, </em>285 N. Y. 37; <em>Matter of Fischer </em>v. <em>Hoe &amp; Co., </em>224 App. Div. 335; <em>Yarbrough </em>v. <em>Polar Ice &amp; Fuel Co., 118 </em>Ind. App. 321; see, also, Larson on Workmen\u2019s Compensation [1952], \u00a7 13, pp. 183 <em>et seq; </em>cf. <em>Matter of Chiodo </em>v. <em>Newhall Co., </em>254 N. Y. 534; <em>Matter of Murray </em>v. <em>Interborough R. T. Co., </em>253 App. Div. 848, 249 App.' Div. 883.) If such injuries only remotely contributed to the accident on the road, then, claimant is not entitled to compensation. Or, to express it somewhat differently, if claimant is to recover, the disability occasioned by the earlier accidents must have been a proximate, not simply a \u201c but for,\u201d cause of his latest mishap.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Here, quite obviously, it was claimant\u2019s own temerity, not the physical handicap resulting from the industrial accidents, that was primarily responsible for the later, 1950, accident. Despite his serious infirmity and despite the obvious risk involved \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>to innocent passers-by as well as to himself \u2014 he persisted in operating a car, indeed, in driving* at what was, for him, the immoderate speed of over forty miles an hour. Even the simple precaution of adding an auxiliary hand or left-foot brake, such as those used by others who are disabled, was omitted. Eventually, the inevitable accident occurred. \"While the earlier injuries may have been a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the accident, they certainly did not constitute the requisite legal or proximate cause. When claimant ignored his locking knee and, without justification, continued to drive, responsibility for the accident and its consequences could no longer be ascribed to his employment-created disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Had claimant been ignorant of the extent of his disability, had his knee not previously locked while driving, the case might conceivably have been different. In the light of the record before us, however, it is indisputable that claimant\u2019s own act of driving, supervening between the industrial accidents \"and the car crash, broke the essential chain of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, the award of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board annulled and the claim dismissed, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division against respondent Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Lewis, Ch. J., Conway, Desmond, Dye, Froessel and Van Voorhis, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
