The defendant excepted to the indictment upon the ground that it was too vague and indefinite, 1. Because it did not state the act which constituted the offense alleged to have been committed. 2. Because it did not state the place, when, or circumstances under which, the offense was committed with sufficient certainty to enable the defendant to plead a judgment on it in bar of a second prosecution for the same offense. These exceptions were overruled, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>verdict guilty, and judgment, from which the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b549-4\"><em>X.

In the language of Chief Justice Roberts, in the case of John C. Moffit, charged with indecent exposure or exhibition of his person, and decided at this term, \u201c it is generally sufficient and proper in indictments of this character that the language of the statute should be followed\u2014nothing more- nor less.\u201d In Arkansas, under a statute in almost the precise language of ours, an indictment charging the offense as in the one before the court was held to be sufficient. (The State <em>v. </em>Hazle, 20 Ark., 186.) The court erred in sustaining the exceptions to the indictment, for which the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
