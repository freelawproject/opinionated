Camp.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-18\">On a night in April, 1875, about eleven o\u2019clock, Henry Smith, a colored man, went to the house of Bhoda Wills, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>three times called Amanda Killy, who, with Khoda Wills and George Bullard, (all colored,) were in the house. It was testified that at the same time Smith said to Amanda he would beat her brains out if she did not come out; that he then broke open the door and entered the room, in which, according to the witness, there was no light; he then told Amanda to \u201c get up,\u201d and walking to the fireplace, seized a \u2022 persimmon club, which was three feet long and about the size of the arm of one witness. With this weapon he \u201c started to strike\u201d Amanda, but on her saying \u201cHenry, do not strike me with that stick; you will kill me,\u201d desisted; Smith then ordered Amanda to leave the room, which she did; then turning to George Bullard, who was lying on a pallet, he struck him one blow on the head, saying as he did so, \u201cYou g\u2014d d\u2014d son of a b\u2014h.\u201d Henry Bullard died about nine o\u2019clock the next day. It was shown that about three weeks before this the accused and deceased had a difficulty, in which the former said to the latter he \u201c would make the buzzards pick his bones.\u201d One witness, who was in an adjoining room, went to the scene of the difficulty, and kindled a light after Smith had left. Blood was running from the mouth of Bullard, and in answer to an inquiry as to who had hurt him he said that it was Henry Smith. The morning after the blow was struck, the deceased said his \u201c brains were addled,\u201d and also, \u201c May God have mercy on the man who struck me.\u201d After striking the blow, Smith threatened to kill Bhoda Wills if she reported him, and gave as his reason for striking Bullard that Bullard had threatened on some former occasion to report Smith for creating a disturbance. It seems that Smith followed Amanda Killy to her home which was near, and while there informed her that he owed Bullard a lick, and now he had paid him. Ho physician testified as to the cause of the death. One negro said the \u201c skin looked green\u201d where the hair was clipped from the head of Bullard; and another testified, \u201c I am satisfied that lick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>was the cause of the death of deceased.\u201d The jury found the defendant guilty and assessed his punishment at death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-4\">A motion in arrest of judgment, which was overruled, was heard on alleged defects in the indictment, the character of which are stated in the opinion.

The jury found the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree and assessed the penalty of death. There was a motion in arrest of the judgment and motion for a new trial, both of which motions were overruled, and the defendant gave notice of an appeal. The motion in arrest of judgment is based on two grounds\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">1. Because the indictment charges the defendant with no offense greater than a misdemeanor, if with any offense at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>2. Because the indictment charges the defendant with no offense known to the penal laws of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The only ground of the motion for a new trial is, that the verdict was contrary to the law and the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The indictment charges, in substance, that Henry Smith, at the time and place stated in the indictment, made an assault on George Bullard, striking him a blow on the head with a large persimmon stick, a deadly weapon, inflicting a wound of which he died the next day, and charging that it was done willfully, feloniously, and with malice aforethought.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">It is urged in the brief of counsel for appellant that a description of the wound, its nature, and position, should be set forth in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The indictment must state in what part of the body the injury was inflicted, but it is not necessary to describe it by its length, breadth, and depth, though it was usually done in the common-law form of an indictment foamurder where the wound could be described. Formerly, when it was the practice to describe the wound, a distinction was made between a bruise and an incised wound. Where the death was caused by a bruise, a description of the wound was not necessary. (Whart. Am. Or. Law, sec. 1069.)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Before the passage of the English statute, which dispensed with the necessity of setting forth in the indictment the manner or the means by which the death of the deceased was caused, it was held that the length, breadth, and depth of the wound need not be stated. (Moseley\u2019s and Turner\u2019s Oases, 2 Arch. Cr. Plead., 207, and notes.)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Article 395 of the Code of Procedure, prescribing the requisites of a good indictment, requires nothing more in stating the offense than that it must be set forth in plain intelligible words.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">The indictment in this case shows that the wound was inflicted on the head of the deceased, and describes the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>strument with which it was done, and how it was done, and no further description of the injury was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">It is further insisted that a new trial should have been granted for the reason stated in appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">In support of the motion for a new trial it is said that no physician was called in to see the deceased; that no <em>post mortem </em>examination was made, and that there was no inquest over the body. It does not appear from the evidence whether these measures were taken or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">On questions of science and skill, experts on the particular subject are permitted to give their opinions to the jury. The opinions of medical men are received in evidence as to the cause of disease, or of death, or of the consequences of wounds, and in some instances a jury would not be able to make a proper investigation without such evidence. For example, where a dead body has been found and identified, but the cause of the death being unknown, this is attempted to be proved by circumstantial or presumptive evidence. In such a case physicians, examined as experts, may express their opinions as to the cause of the death, drawn from an examination of the body and from external appearances as a basis for the inference that the death was caused by violence and was not the result of natural causes, as disease, sudden illness, or of accident. Evidence of this kind is admitted as necessary to aid the jury in coming to a correct conclusion in their verdict. (1 Starkie on Ev., 68, 69; 1 Greenleaf\u2019s Ev., sec. 440; Bur rill on Cir. Ev., 119, 683.)</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">In the present case the cause of the death was shown without the aid of professional witnesses or aid of indirect evidence. The <em>corpus delicti </em>was established by the witnesses who were present at the time the mortal blow was given. The identity of the deceased as the person charged to have been slain was not questioned. The instrument with which the act was done, and the identity of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>ant as the guilty agent who struck the blow, were not the subjects of controversy in the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Body Wells or Body Wills, a witness for the State, testified on the trial that she saw the defendant strike George Bullard, the deceased, on the head with a persimmon stick while the deceased was lying on a pallet' before the fire; that the blow was struck about eleven o\u2019clock at night on the 9th of April, 1875, and that Bullard died about nine o\u2019clock the next night at the house of Amanda Perry. The stick is described as being about the size of the witness\u2019s arm and about three feet long, with a club at one end, and as being a large seasoned stick.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Amanda Perry, who was present, said she heard the blow when deceased was struck just as she got outside of the door, and heard some one groan, and that she also heard the defendant say ho owed the deceased a lick a\u00f1d that now he had paid him. This was said at the house of the witness on the night the assault was made, and soon after the occurrence. This witness further testified that she heard George Bullard say the next day that his brain ivas addled, and also heard him say, \u201cMay God help the man who struck me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Bob Wills testified that he was in an adjoining room, and that he heard the blow, and that the deceased said, in answer to his question, that the defendant struck him on the head. This witness testified that he was satisfied that the lick caused the death of Bullard.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Peter Brinston heard the defendant say, \u201c I knocked a man in the head out here.\u201d This witness stated that the blood was running out of the mouth of the deceased when he saw him after he was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">It is further urged in behalf of appellant that it was not shown that the homicide was committed with express malice or that it was of a higher grade than murder of the second degree, if the killing amounted to more than manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"ANo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>.It appears from the evidence that George Bullard, the deceased, with Amanda Perry and Bob Wills, was at the house of Body W\u00e9lls or Body Wills on the night of the homicide. It was shown that Amanda Perry lived about one hundred yards from the residence of Body Wills. It was not proved where the deceased or the defendant resided, or what relation, if any, existed between either of them and Amanda Perry.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">A relation is suggested in the brief of counsel, but the evidence is silent on the subject. For some reason not explained, and certainly without any authority so far as can be known from the record, the defendant went to the house of Body Wills, where these parties were, and after calling <em>\u201c </em>Manda,\u201d three times, and no one answering, as may be inferred, he broke open the door and told Manda to get up. He then walked to the fire-place and got the stick or club, and, as the witnesses say, started to strike Manda, but which was not done, and after ordering her to leave the house, he turned upon the deceased, who, as previously stated, was lying on the pallet before the fire, and with the club in his hand dealt the fatal stroke and slew his victim, who was unarmed, and made no resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The evidence shows that the defendant made the attack under circumstances of undue advantage and without justification or legal excuse. It was not a case where the parties attack each other upon equal terms and afterwards in the course of fight one of them in his passion snatches up a deadly weapon and kills the other with it. This is manslaughter, the other is murder. (Wharton\u2019s Am. Or. Law, sec. 988.)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">There was evidence of express malice. It was proved that the defendant and the deceased had a difficulty about three weeks before the homicide, when the defendant told the deceased that he, defendant, would make the buzzards pick his bones. On the night of the assault, and soon after it took place, the defendant was heard to say by one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>witnesses, \u201c I hit him a lick for threatening to report me for creating a disturbance; and I gave it to him, too.\u201d The assault was made at a late hour of the night. The door of the house was broken open and the dwelling was entered without the consent of the owner, and under circumstances evincing a lawless and reckless spirit. If the defendant\u2019s only object was to see the woman Amanda, that object was accomplished when he had found her, and when she \" was in the act of leaving the premises at his bidding.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">We have found nothing in the record to support the argument that appellant has not had a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The district j udge having the witnesses before him, and hearing them testify, had the means of forming an opinion as to the merits of the defense and the manner in which it was conducted, which this court has not other than that contained in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Eo sufficient reason, we think, has been shown for reversing the action of the court or that of the jury, and the judgment must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
