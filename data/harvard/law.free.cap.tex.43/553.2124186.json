C. H. Johnson v. S. B. McCutchings &amp; Co.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b563-6\">1. Writ of error\u2014Practice.\u2014A petition for writ of error is not on that account defective; the petition may be addressed to the clerk of the District Court, or to the Supreme Court.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b563-8\">2. Judgment by default against a garnishee.\u2014l\u00edo judgment by default can be rendered against a garnishee when the writ of garnishment fails to designate the cause in which the garnishee is called upon to answer, or when the affidavit for the writ omits to state that the garnishee resides in the county in which the original suit is brought.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-10\">Error from Busk. Tried below before the Hon. J. B. Williams.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b563-11\"><em>Martin Casey, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-12\">The garnishee could not learn from the writ or affidavit what he was to answer and from whom or against whom. The judgment against him could not be a protection to him against the defendant in the judgment for want of certainty, and there is no provision that he shall be discharged from the defendant on payment of the judgment against him as garnishee. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., p. 624, n. 875.) It does not appear from the proceedings where the garnishee resided; and if he resided out of Busk county the judgment was premature. In such case a commission should issue to take his answers. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 167.) Hence all the assignments are well taken.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b563-13\"><em>N. G.
