Stake decisis. The rule of <em>stare decisis </em>\"applies when a decision has been recognized as a law of property, and conflicting demands have been adjusted, and contracts made with reference to and on faith of it; but not to questions involving the construction and interpretation of the organic law, the structure of the government, and the limitations upon the legislative and executive power as safeguards against tyranny and oppression.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b52-5\">3. School-districts. The Constitution requires the State to be divided into convenient school-districts, and boards of school directors appointed for such districts, to whom important legislative powers may be intrusted; there is nothing tending to show that this power could be delegated to the superintendent of public instruction or other officers.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b52-6\">3. The superintendent op public instruction is an executive officer, and his duties belong to the executive character.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b52-7\">4. Nor can the Legislature deprive the superintendent of his constitutional power by requiring its exercise in conjunction with some other officer.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b52-8\">5. It is evident that the <em>school-districts </em>(formed by laying off the State into convenient districts) are the basis of the school-system contemplated in the Constitution. The local boards of directors and the superintendent of public instruction are intended to be the leading and essential factors in the school-system.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b52-9\">6. When the school-districts have been so formed, the legislative power allowed to be delegated to them must be really vested in them; it cannot be vested in some other tribunal.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b52-10\">7. The Legislature cannot delegate any of its powers unless authorized to do so by the Constitution; such delegation of power for the support and maintenance of public schools can only be made to the local boards; any other powers exerted to this end by the Legislature, must be exercised directly by it.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b52-11\">8. The Legislature could give the district boards legislative power to manage the accrued school-funds of the districts, and the question of how much deficiency was necessary for building- school-houses and supporting schools, and the levy of a tax for such deficiency by such boards as <em>quasi </em>corporations. ,</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"AMk\">9. The machinery of the district boards is necessary in ascertaining the wants of each district, and to that end, the Constitution provides for raising such sum by taxation in the several school-districts \u201c as will be \u201c necessary \u201d for school-purpbses.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b52-13\">10. The determination of the amount of the levy, within the maximum fixed by the Legislature, by the district boards, may be regarded as the exercise of legislative powers in regard to the school-fund of the district.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b52-14\">11. By the school-system adopted by the Legislature, April 34, 1871, the functions and duties of the superintendent and of the district boards are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>taken from them and conferred upon a board of education created by this law, consisting of the superintendent of public instruction, Governor, and attorney-general.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b53-4\">12. By the Constitution, the superintendent of public instruction has the supervision of the public free schools, is required to perform such other (executive) duties as the Legislature may require, to recommend needful amendments to the school-laws, and to report to each session of the Legislature the condition of the schools. By the statute, these powers are conferred on the board of education, besides <em>other </em>duties, such as forming rules for the government of schools, examination of teachers and their compensation, the studies to be pursued, and the authority to prescribe the manner of collecting and disbursing the one per cent, school-tax.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b53-5\">13. This statute, and the regulations of the board of education, confer the power of taxation and the mode of its collection nominally upon the district board of directors, but it is really retained and exercised by the board of education.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b53-6\">14.

The authority conferred by this statute upon the board of education, and the right to collect this tax, cannot be sanctioned unless authority be shown in a plain and unequivocal warrant in the Constitution granting these powers. \u201cThis,\u201d the court says, \u201ccannot be done.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b53-8\">16. <em>Held, </em>that neither the Governor nor attorney-general, consistently with the limitations and restrictions in the Constitution, can become members of the board of education, or discharge the duties pertaining thereto.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b53-9\">17. The members of the board of education, besides having legislative authority, are officers or hold agencies of public trust, and which cannot be held or exercised by such officers as are prohibited from holding two offices, agencies, etc., by the Constitution.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b53-10\">18. Powers of the board of education enumerated, which are held to be legislative, and which, while they may be transacted through other instrumentalities, cannot be delegated to officers in the executive department of the government.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b53-11\">19. The one per cent, school-tax was not levied by directors of such school-districts as was comtemplated by the Constitution.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b53-12\">20. The act of April 24, 1871, indicates the agencies for, and requires them to subdivide the State into convenient school districts, but these agents have not, in fact, exercised the legal discretion intrusted to them, but have acted altogether under the control of the board of education.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b53-13\">21. The supervisors appointed under this act either divided their territory, by designating each county as a school-district, or they adopted the division as made under the act of August 13,1870. This cannot be regarded as a legal subdivision of the State into convenient school-districts.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b53-14\">22. The act of August 13,1870, creating each county a school-district, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>modified by the act of 1871, providing that the supervisors should subdivide their territory. The amendments were not recognized or acted upon in this regard by the board of education.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b54-4\">23. Kinney <em>v. </em>Zimpleman, 36 Texas, 564, overruled.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-5\">P. J. Willis and Richard S. Willis, as partners under the firm-name of P. J. Willis &amp; Bro., filed their petition in the District Court, praying in their own behalf, and in behalf of others of like interests, for a writ of injunction, to restrain the sheriff of Galveston county, and the Board of Education, and the Board of School Directors of Galveston county from proceeding to collect from petitioners and others who might be permitted to become parties plaintiff, the school-tax of one per cent., the one-eighth of which was levied under the act entitled, \u201cAn Act to give effect to the several provisions of the \u201c Constitution, concerning taxes,\u201d of April 22, 1871, and the other seven-eighths being claimed under the act entitled, \u201c An \u201c Act to organize and maintain a system of public free schools \u201cin the State of Texas,\u201d of April 24, 1871. The District Judge, in his fiat granting the writ, refused to grant the writ against the collection of the first-named tax of one-eighth of one per cent., and granted the writ against the collection of the latter-named tax of seven-eighths of one per cent., upon condition that petitioners pay the tax of one-eighth of one per cent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-6\">The District Judge refused to grant the writ in favor of the petitioners and all others of like interest, and granted the writ in favor of the petitioners, P.

The sheriff of Galveston county- had given no bond for the faithful collection of this tax, and was not able to respond in damages to petitioners and others of like interests, for the collection of this tax. That the tax of seven-eighths of one per cent, claimed under the school-law of April 24, 1871, had never been assessed. That the sheriff had no authority for the collection of said tax, other than instructions from the Board of Education.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\">That the Board of Education is organized in contravention of Section 1, Article 2, and Section 30, Article 3, and Section 14, Article 4, of the Constitution. That the orders, rules, and regulations of this board are legislative in their character, and are illegal, and furnish no authority to the sheriff for the collection of said tax. That the county of Galveston has not been sub-divided into school-districts, and that the Legislature could not delegate to these boards, as organized, the power to levy the tax sued for. That the Board of Education, and not the Board of School Directors of Galveston county, have levied this tax, if any tax has been levied. That the school-law of April 24, 1871, was unconstitutional, and was not a law of the land, because not read on three several days in the House of Representatives while on its passage through the Legislature, and the constitutional rule was not dispensed with by any vote of the house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-7\">The defendants appeared, and moved to dissolve the injunction for want of equity in plaintiffs\u2019 petition.

The constitutionality of this law and the liability of the tax-payers for these taxes, has been sustained by this court in the cases of Kinney <em>v. </em>Zimpleman (36 Texas, 554; Bremond <em>v. </em>The State, 38 Texas, 116; Hall <em>v. </em>H. <em>&amp; </em>T. C. R. W. Co., 39 Texas, 286; Ireland <em>v. </em>Gordon, 39 Texas, 253), and perhaps in others in which the opinion of the court has not been published. It may, therefore, be thought that the question should not be regarded by us as now open for discussion,\u2014that whatever might be our views, in respect to it, upon the principal of <em>stare </em>decisis, we should hold it as definitely settled and concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">We cannot, however, regard the rule of <em>stare decisis </em>as having any just application to questions of the character involved in these cases. This doctrine grows out of the necessity for a uniform and settled rule of property, and definite basis for contracts and business transactions. If a decision is wrong, it is only when it has been so long the rule of action, as that time and its continued application as the rule of right between parties demands the sanction of its error. Because, when a decision has been recognized as the law of property, and conflicting demands have been adjusted, and contracts have been made with reference to and on faith of it, greater injustice would be done to individuals, and more injury result to society by a reversal of such decision, though erroneous, than to follow and observe it. But when a decision is not of this character, upon no sound principle do we feel at liberty to perpetuate an error, into which either our predecessors or ourselves may have unad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>vised!y fallen, merely upon the ground of such erroneous decision having been previously rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The questions to be considered in these cases have no application whatever to the title or transfer of property, or to matters of contract. They involve the construction and interpretation of the organic law, and present for consideration the structure of the government, the limitations upon legislative and executive power, as safeguards against tyranny and oppression. Certainly, it cannot be seriously insisted, that questions of this character can be disposed of by the doctrine of <em>stare </em>decisis. The former decisions of the court in such cases are unquestionably entitled to most respectful consideration, and should not be lightly disregarded or overruled. And in case of doubtful interpretation, a long-settled and well-recognized judicial interpretation, or even legislative or executive construction within the sphere of their respective functions, might be sufficient to turn the balanced scale. But In such case the former decision or previous construction is received and weighed merely as an' authority tending to convince the j udgment of the correctness of the particular conclusion, and not as a rule to be followed without inquiry into its correctness.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">An additional reason why we do not feel at liberty to dispose of these cases on the authority of the decisions to which we have referred in similar cases, is, that we do not think the most vital objection to the right to collect the tax in question has been discussed or passed upon by the court in any of these cases. Indeed, if all the points discussed in the previous opinions were conceded to be correctly decided, it is, in our view of the matter, susceptible of demonstration that the judgments are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">That our views in relation to the authority to levy and collect a school-tax may not be misunderstood, we deem it proper to say, that while we do not by any means con cm in all of the positions assumed in the opinions of the court in these cases, neither do we dissent from some of the most important of them. And while it is unnecessary for us at present to indicate particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>larly those with which we agree and those from which we dissent, we desire to be understood as expressing an opinion only in reference to those to which we may have occasion to make direct reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">It certainly cannot be doubted \u201c that the framers of our Con- \u201c stitution regarded it as one of the highest and most sacred \u201c duties incumbent on their body to make plenary provision e&lt; for a system of common schools, to be inaugurated throughout \u201c the State by the Legislature under wise and wholesome laws.\u201d\u2019 Hor can it be questioned, that the provisions made by the Convention for the support and maintenance of the system of public free schools so to be inaugurated, was as liberal and ample as the most ardent advocate of such schools could desire. But whether the school-system devised and inaugurated by the-Legislature, by the act approved April 24, 1871, heretofore referred to, was such as is authorized by the Constitution, or indeed whether the system inaugurated and put in operation by the Board of Education created by said act, was such as is provided for in the Constitution, or was warranted by said act, are altogether different questions. To answer them, it is necessary to contrast the provisions of the Constitution bearing upon the subject with the act of the Legislature in question, and the school-system inaugurated under it. <em>0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Without quoting them in full, we cite some of the constitutional provisions with which this act, and the school-system so inaugurated, are to a greater or less extent in conflict. Section 1, Article 2, of the Constitution, divides the powers of government into three distinct departments, executive, legislative, and judicial, and confides the duties of each of them to a separate body of magistracy, and absolutely forbids any person or collection of persons, being of one of these departments, exercising any power properly belonging to either of the others, unless expressly authorized in the Constitution. By Section 3, Article 3, the legislative power of the State is vested in two branches or bodies of magistracy, one styled the House of Bepresentatives, the other, the Senate, and both together the <em>\u201c </em>Leg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u201cislature of the State of Texas.\u201d Section 1, Article 4, provides that the executive department shall consist of a chief magistrate, styled the Governor, a lieutenant-governor, secretary of state, comptroller of public accounts, treasurer, commissioner ox the general land office, attorney-general, and superintendent of public instruction. The constitutional functions and duties of the Governor are indicated in the succeeding sections of this article, while Section 14 of it absolutely inhibits his holding any other office or commission. The constitutional functions and official duties of the attorney-general are also specified in Section 23 of the same article. Without undertaking to enumerate all of the powers and duties assigned to the office of governor and attorney-general in the Constitution, or those conferred by its authority, we may remark, that they seem to be altogether of a different character from those belonging to the office of superintendent of public instruction, which are enumerated in Section 3, of Article 9. And Section 30, of Article 3, declares that certain enumerated- officers, among them the attorney-general, nor any person holding a lucrative office under the United States, or this State, or any foreign government, shall at the same time hold or exercise any two offices, agencies, or appointments of trust or profit under this State, except in the particularly enumerated instances therein mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">That the character of the school-system contemplated and authoi\u2019ized by the Convention may more clearly be perceived, we will here insert at length Article 9 of the Constitution on the subject of public schools, viz.:</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\"><em>u </em>Section 1. It shall be the duty of the Legislature of this \u201c State to make suitable provisions for the support and main- \u201c tenance of a system of public free schools, for the gratuitous 56 instruction of all the inhabitants of this State, between the \u201c ages of six and eighteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">\u201c Section 2. There shall be a superintendent of public in- \u201c strnction, who after the first term of office shall he elected by \u201c the people; the first term of office shall be filled by appoint- \u201c ment of the Governor, by and with the advice and consent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\u201c the Senate. The superintendent shall hold his office for the \u201c term of four years. He shall receive an annual salary of \u201c two thousand five hundred dollars, until otherwise provided \u201c by law. In case of vacancy in the office of superintendent, \u201c it shall be filled by appointment of the Governor, until the \u201c next general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u201c Section 3. The superintendent shall have the supervision \u201c of the public free schools of the State, and shall perform \u201c such other duties concerning public instruction as the Legis- \u201c lature may direct. The Legislature may lay 06 the State \u201c into convenient school-districts, and provide for the forma- \u201c tion of a board of school-directors in each district. It. may \u201c <em>give </em>the district boards such legislative powers, in regard to the \u201c schools, school-houses and school-fund of the district, as may \u201c he deemed necessary and proper.

He shall at each session \u201c of the Legislature furnish that body with a complete report \u201c of all the free schools in the State, giving an account of the \u201c condition of the same, and the progress of education within \u201c the State.

The Legislature shall, at its first session (and \u00a3\u00a3 from time to time thereafter as may be found necessary), pro-1C vide all needful rules and regulations for the purpose of car- \u00a3! rying into effect the provisions of this article. It is made <em>\u201c </em>the imperative duty of the Legislature to see to it that all the \u201c children of the State within the scholastic age, are, without \u00a3\u00a3 delay, provided with ample means of education. The Legis- \u00a3\u00a3 lature shall annually appropriate for school-purposes, and to \u00a3\u00a3 be equally distributed among all the scholastic population of \u00a3\u00a3 the State, the interest accruing on the school-fund and the \u201c income derived from taxation for school-purposes, and shall \u00a3\u00a3 from time to time, as may be necessary, invest the principal <em>\u201c </em>of the school-fund in the bonds of the United States Govern- &lt;\u00a3 ment, and in no other security.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Among the marked features of the public school system intended to be created by the Convention, it is quite apparent from this article that it was intended, while sufficiently broad to afford the means of education to every child in the State within the scholastic age, to establish a system in respect to some of its most important and vital essentials, if not all of them, which should be local in its character. The State is to be divided into convenient school-districts, and boards of school directors appointed for such districts, to whom important legislative powers may be intrusted, while there is nothing in the slightest degree tending to warrant an inference that such or like powers may be delegated to the superintendent or other officers who may be created by the Legislature for the purpose of carrying into effect and securing the better maintenance of such system.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">To the superintendent, as the central head and executive officer of the system, is committed a general power of supervision over the schools throughout the State, with such duties concerning public education as may be intrusted to him by the Legislature. Such duties, from the fact of his being an officer of the executive department, must be of an executive character, while those conferred upon the boards of directors are legislative. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>cannot be insisted that because the Legislature may require the superintendent to discharge other duties concerning public instruction than those specifically mentioned, that there is no restriction as to their nature and character. To do so would violate the established canon of construction, that, in determining the true import of a given section or clause of the Constitution, like any other instrument, regard must be had to all its provisions, and that it must be interpreted so that all its parts may be in harmony and have effect. Hence, specific, clear, and direct grants or limitations of power, are not controlled or annulled by general provisions found in other parts of the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">It is also quite obvious that none of the constitutional powers or functions of the superintendent can be taken from him, absolutely or in a qualified manner, by requiring him to exercise them in conjunction with some other officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Bearing these observations in mind, let us look to some of the provisions of the act to organize and maintain a system of public free schools, approved April 24, 1871, and the act supplementary and amendatory of it, approved \u00a1November 29, 1871, and consider, in the same connection, the school-system actually organized and maintained under authority of these laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Section 2 of the first of these acts says: \u201c The superintend- \u201c ent of public instruction, with the approval of the Governor, \u201c shall appoint, for each judicial district of this State, one super- \u201c visor of education for such judicial district, who shall hold his \u201c office for four years, unless sooner removed. Each super- <em>\u201c </em>visor of education shall receive as compensation the sum of <em>u </em>five dollars per day for the time actually employed in attend- <em>\u201c </em>ing to the duties of his office, provided that the total to any \u201c supervisor, during any one year, shall not exceed the sum of <em>\u201c </em>twelve hundred dollars. The supervisor of education may be 61 removed by the superintendent of public instruction, on the \u201c approval of the Governor, for incompetency, malfeasance, or \u201c neglect of duty. The supervisors of education shall be em- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u201c powered to lay off and subdivide the counties of their respect- \u201c ive judicial districts into school-districts, and shall be em- \u201c powered to appoint five school directors for each school-dis- \u201c trict, but the authority of the supervisors in these respects \u201c shall be subject to the control and revision of the- superintend- \u201c ent of public instruction. It shall be the duty of the super- <em>\u201c </em>visors to enforce, in their respective districts, all the rules <em>\u201c </em>and regulations adopted by the board of education for the <em>'e </em>government of the public free schools in this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">By the first Section of the supplementary and amendatory act, approved November 29, 1871, this section of the act of April 24, 1871, was so amended as to read as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u201c <em>Clause Fvrst. </em>The Board of Education shall, upon the pas- <em>\u201c </em>sage of this act, proceed to apportion anew the. territory of <em>\u201c </em>this State into convenient educational districts, not to exceed <em>\u201c </em>twelve in number; provided that nothing in this clause shall \u201c be so construed as to prohibit said board hereafter from con- \u201c solidating or otherwise changing or altering the boundaries of <em>\u201c </em>said districts for educational purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\"><em>\u201c Clause Second. </em>And as soon as the educational districts <em>\u201c </em>contemplated in the foregoing clause shall be created, it shall \u201c be the duty of the superintendent of public instruction to \u201c retire or relieve each supervisor of education heretofore ap- \u201c pointed and commissioned as such; and the said superintend<em>ie </em>ent is hereby authorized to appoint, with the approval of the <em>\u201c </em>Governor, for each newly created district, one supervisor of <em>\u201c </em>education, who shall hold his office for the term of four years \u201c from the date of his commission, unless sooner removed by <em>\u201c </em>said superintendent for cause, on the approval of the Gov- \u201c ernor; and the supervisor may act as examiner of teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\"><em>\u201c Clause Third. </em>And each supervisor so appointed shall re- \u201c ceive for his services, out of any moneys belonging to the \u201c available school-fund not otherwise appropriated: first, a sala- \u201c ry of eighteen hundred dollars per annum; second, all ex- \u201c penses for postage; and third, all traveling expenses neces- \u201c sarily incurred while employed in the actual discharge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>\u201c duties of his office; provided, that the amount of the above- \u201c mentioned expenses shall not exceed the sum of two hundred <em>\u201c </em>dollars, on voucher to be approved by the superintendent of \u201c public instruction, during any one scholastic year.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u201c <em>Clause Fourth. </em>And the supervisors herein provided for, \u201c shall be empowered to lay off and subdivide the counties in \u201c the territory under their jurisdiction into convenient school- \u00a3\u00a3 <em>districts) </em>and they shall also appoint, on the approval of the \u201c superintendent of public instruction, five directors for each \u201c school-district; but the authority of the said supervisors in \u201c the management, control, and oversight of their respective \u201c districts, shall be subject to the control, direction, and revision of the said superintendent, and it shall be the further \u201c duty of the said supervisors to enforce in their respective \u00a3\u00a3 districts, all rules and regulations adopted by the Board of \u201c Education for the government of the public free schools in \u201c this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Beturning to the original act of April 2d, 1871, it is further enacted, as follows, to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">\u201c Section <em>8, </em>The superintendent of public instruction, with \u201c the Governor and the attorney-general, shall form a Board of \u201c Education for the State.

The Board of Education for the State shall \u201c report for action of the Legislature, from time to time, such \u201c amendments of the school-laws of this State as may be found <em>\u201c </em>necessary, stating in their report the facts and reasons which, \u201c in their opinion, render necessary such proposed amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><em>\u201c </em>Section 5. The available school-fund liable to appropriation \u201c for the support of public schools is hereby declared to be, all <em>\u201c </em>interest which has accrued, or may hereafter accrue, to the <em>\u201c </em>school-fund from railroads or otherwise, since the 30th day of \u201c March, 1870, one-fourth of all the <em>ad valorem </em>and occupation &lt;\u00a3 taxes assessed, since that date, and such other taxes as have \u201c been or may be provided by law for the support of public \u201c schools. Accounts against this available school-fund shall be 61 paid out of any part of it that may be in the treasury on ap- \u201c propriation therefor by the Legislature. The directors of <em>a </em>each school-district shall have authority to levy a tax of not \u201c exceeding one per cent., for the purpose of building sohool- \u201c houses and maintaining schools in their respective sehool- <em>\u201c </em>districts; and the manner of the collection and disbursement \u201c of this tax shall be prescribed by the Board of Education for \u201c the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Section 6, which provides for enforcing the attendance of the scholastic inhabitants of the State on the public or other schools, we need not quote.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Section 7. That all laws or parts of laws not consistent <em>\u201c </em>with this act be and the same are hereby repealed, and that <em>a </em>this act take effect and be in force from and after its pas- <em>\u201c </em>sage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Is the system of public free schools, for the organization and maintenance of which this act provides, such an one as is authorized by the Constitution ?</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The plain language of the Constitution compels us to say that it is not. Almost the only feature in which it can be plausibly insisted the two systems correspond, except in mere name and matters of form, is in respect to the provision in regard to the laying \u201c off the State into convenient school-dis- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>\u201c tricts.\u201d And the law in regard to this, as we shall hereafter see, was set at naught, and totally disregarded in the organization of the school-system put in operation, and maintained by the Board of Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The language of the Constitution authorizing the laying 06 the State into convenient school-districts is not, it is true, imperative. But it is evident from the entire article of the Constitution on this subject, that such districts are the basis of the system contemplated in the Constitution. The boards of school directors of these districts, and the superintendent of public instruction are evidently intended to be the leading and essential factors in the school-system to be supported and maintained by the Legislature. That it is the duty of the Legislature to provide for laying off the State into such districts, is manifest, and has been so recognized by its action in providing for it in each of the different laws which have been enacted for the purpose of organizing a system of public free schools. But conceding that the Legislature might properly discharge its constitutional duty of providing for the support and maintenance of a system of public free schools without laying off the State into school-districts, it certainly must be admitted where this has been done, the powers which may be delegated to the boards of directors of such districts cannot be merely nominally conferred upon them but, in fact, vested in some other tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">It is a legal axiom that the Legislature cannot delegate any of its powers unless authorized to do so by the Constitution. There is certainly nothing in this instrument giving the slightest countenance to the supposition that it may delegate any of its powers whatever, touching the discharge of its constitutional duty, \u201c to make suitable provisions for the support and main- \u201c tenance of a system of public free schools,\u201d except to the district boards <em>\u201c </em>in regard to the schools, school-houses, and school- <em>\u201c </em>funds of the district.\u201d Beyond such legislative power\u2019s, as to these matters, which the Legislature may deem necessary and proper to confide to these boards, its powers touching the subject can only be exercised directly by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>That ample means might be at the command of the Legislature for the performance of the duty of providing for the gratuitous instruction of all the scholastic inhabitants of the State, a most magnificent public school fund was provided as a permanent endowment. The principal of which, from time to time, as found necessary, is to be invested in the bonds of the United States, while the interest on the fund, and the income derived from taxation for school-puposes\u2014that is, one-fourth of the annual revenue received from general taxation, and the poll-tax of one dollar upon all male persons in the State between the ages of twenty-one and sixty\u2014shall be annually appropriated for school-purposes, to be equally distributed among the scholastic population of the State. By means of this annual appropriation and equal distribution it was evidently intended there should accrue a <em>\u201c </em>school-fund of the district,\u201d in regard to which the Legislature might give the district boards legislative powers. The annual appropriation and distribution of the amount accruing from these sources may not however constitute the entire school-fund of the district, for the Legislature may, in addition to the amount to be so distributed, <em>\u201c </em>pro- \u201c vide for the raising of such amount by taxation, in the several <em>\u201c </em>school-districts in the State, as will be necessary to provide \u201c the necessary school-houses in each district, and insure the edu- <em>\u201c </em>cation of all the scholastic inhabitants of the several districts.\u201d The amount so collected in each district, whether by a general and uniform levy and rate laid by the Legislature, or by a special assessment or levy, whichever it may be most appropriately termed, by the district boards, as <em>quasi </em>corporations, as may be provided by the Legislature, must also form a part of the fund of the district in which it is collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">We may, however, as well here say, that in our opinion, it was the purpose of this section of the Constitution to make provision to meet such deficiency as might be found to exist in the fund in each district, to be annually distributed among the districts in proportion to the scholastic population of the State. This must necessarily be a matter of local information. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>amount ample in one district would be altogether deficient in another. If the Legislature should require the same per cent, upon the taxable property in all the districts, it would impose an unnecessary burthen in some of them, while in others, it would not meet the necessity of the case. \u00a1Nor could it possibly fix the amount needed in each district; therefore it is said in the Constitution, that the Legislature <em>maj provide </em>for the raising of such amounts by taxation in the several school-districts \u201c in the State as will be necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In view of the purpose of this tax, we think this language sufficiently broad to -warrant the conclusion, that the Legislature may provide for raising the necessary amount by the delegation of authority to the board of directors of the districts to levy the tax for this purpose. At least, it cannot be maintained, when the Legislature has levied the tax by fixing its maximum rate, that it may not delegate authority to the district boards of school directors, as <em>quasi </em>corporations, to fix the amount to be collected in their district under such levy by the Legislature. The amount to be provided for, being so raised by taxation, when collected becomes, as we have said, a part of the school-fund of the district, and the fixing of the amount to be collected, we think, may be appropriately regarded as the exercise of legislative powers in regard to the school-fund of the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The school-system established by the law either directly or indirectly takes from the board of directors of the district, and the superintendent of public instruction, the official functions and duties which, in the system contemplated in the Constitution, are to be discharged by them, and confers them upon a board of education, created by this law; or, in respect to such of the duties of the superintendent as are not conferred upon the Board of Education, he is subject in their exercise to the dominant power and control of the Governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">By the Constitution, the superintendent shall have the supervision of public free schools, and perform such other duties concerning public instruction as the Legislature may direct. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>is made his duty to recommend to the Legislature such provisions of law as may be found necessary, in the progress of time, to the establishment and perfection of a complete system of education. At each session of the Legislature it is also his duty to furnish the Legislature with a complete report of all the free schools in the State, giving an account of their condition and the progress of education.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The law says the Board of Education shall report to the Legislature such amendments of the school-laws as may be found necessary, with the facts and reasons which in their opinion render them necessary. It is also made the duty of this board to adopt all necessary rules and regulations for the establishment and promotion of public schools; to provide for the examination of teachers, and to fix their compensation; to define the course of studies in the schools, and direct the class and kind of apparatus and hooks to be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">And in addition to this plain transfer of the constitutional functions of the superintendent of public instruction to the Board of Education, and the delegation of legislative power to said board, in regard to schools and school-houses\u2014for conferring of which by the Legislature upon any other officers than the board of school directors for each school-district, there is no color of authority in the Constitution\u2014the Board of Education is also given legislative authority to prescribe the manner of collecting and disbursing the tax' of one per cent.,which the directors of each school-district are nominally authorized to levy for the purpose of buiding school-houses, and maintaining schools in their respective school-districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">That the authority to levy this tax is intended only to be nominally conferred upon the directors of the school-districts, is obvious, when it is considered that though the Constitution says that the Legislature may lay off the State into convenient school-districts, which is plainly a duty calling for the exercise of legislative power, which cannot be parted with by that body, or deputed to any other\u2014though it may use subordinate instrumentalities to carrv into effect such discretion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>when exercised, yet to intrust it to the executive department would be as obviously unconstitutional as it would be for the Legislature to authorize the Governor to divide the State into appropriate judicial districts. Tet the law says the Board of Education shall apportion the territory of the State into educational districts; and for each of these districts, the superintendent of public instruction shall appoint, with the approval of the Governor, a supervisor of education, who may be removed at any time by the superintendent for cause, without specification of its nature or character, on the like approval of the Governor. And the supervisor thus appointed, and holding his office, in effect, at the will and pleasure of the superintendent and the Governor, is impowered to lay off and subdivide the counties in the territory under his jurisdiction into convenient school-districts, and to appoint, on the approval of the superintendent, five directors for each school-district. The authority, however, of the supervisors in the management, control, and oversight of their respective districts, is subject to the control, direction, and revision of the superintendent. And lest there might be some reason still to fear that these district boards, holding their offices at, it would appear, the mere will of the appointing power, might not be sufficiently subservient to the Board of Education, it is made the duty of the supervisors to enforce in their respective districts all rules and regulations adopted by said board for the government of the public free schools in the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">That it may the more clearly appear that the tax in question in these cases, and which we have said the directors of the school-districts were only nominally authorized to levy, was in fact levied by the Board of Education, without constitutional authority, and contrary to the letter of the law, but in conformity to its real spirit and import, and that the extent and general scope of the legislative powers claimed and exercised under this law by the Board of Education may be at least partially perceived, we will here insert an extract or two from the \u201c rules and regulations for the government of public free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>\u201c schools,\u201d adopted by the board, and from <em>\u201c </em>circulars \u201d issued by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><em>\u201c </em>Rule 7. Boards of directors of school-districts shall levy a <em>\u201c </em>tax of one per cent., as provided by Section 5 of \u00a3 an Act to <em>661 </em>organize and maintain a system of public free schools in the \u00a3\u00a3 \u00a3 State of Texas,\u2019 approved April 24, 1871; said levy to be <em>\u201cmade </em>on the assessment-rolls of the tax-assessors of their \u00a3\u00a3 respective districts, and collected and deposited as provided <em>\u201c </em>in rule No. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\"><em>\u201c </em>Rule 8. In counties where assessors have already levied <em>\u201c </em>the tax of one-eighth of one per cent, as prescribed by Sec- \u201c tion 8 of <em>\u2018 </em>an Act to give effect to the several provisions of <em>\u201c \u2018 </em>the Constitution concerning taxes,\u2019 approved April 22, 1871, <em>\u201c </em>school directors will levy a tax of seven-eighths of one per <em>\u201c </em>cent., under Section 5 of \u00a3 an Act to organize and maintain \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3a system of public free schools in the State of Texas,\u2019 ap- <em>\u201c </em>proved April 24,1871, so that the whole tax levied for school \u201c purposes shall be one per cent. One-fourth of the tax levied \u00a3\u00a3 by school directors to be collected on or before September 1, <em>\u201c </em>1871, and the balance in three equal amounts, within three, \u201c six, and nine months from September 1, 1871.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\"><em>\u201c Rule </em>9. The tax levied by the school directors of each \u201c school-district of the different counties shall be collected by \u201c the sheriff of each county, and by him deposited with the \u201c treasurer of the board of directors, subject to the order of \u201c the school directors in whose school-district the money may \u201c be collected, on approval of said order by the superintendent, <em>\u201c </em>and said money shall not be paid out by any treasurer except \u201c in accordance with the rules and regulations of the State \u201c Board of Education. But, should any person refuse or fail <em>\u201c to </em>pay the school-tax, the sheriff will proceed to enforce the \u00a3\u00a3 collection of the same, in the manner provided by Sections <em>\u201c </em>19, 20, 21, and 22, of \u00a3 An Act to give effect to the several \u201c \u00a3 provisions of the Constitution concerning Taxes,\u2019 approved \u201c April 22, 1871, except so much thereof as directs the return <em>\u201c </em>of a delinquent-list to be made to the comptroller of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>\u201c accounts. The delinquent-lists, instead of being returned to \u201c the comptroller, shall be forwarded to the superintendent of \u201c public instruction. Where the law is not specific, sheriffs \u201c will be governed by the instructions issued by the eomp- \u201c trailer of the State of Texas in regard to the collection of the \u201c taxes of the State, issued in conformity with said act. In \u201c case it may be necessary to bring suit for the collection of <em>\u201c </em>taxes, such suit shall be brought in the name of the State of <em>\u201c </em>Texas, for the use of the board of school directors of the <em>\u201c </em>district where such tax is due, and shall, when collected, be \u201c paid to the treasurer of said board. The fees to be allowed <em>\u201c </em>the officers for their services shall be the same as those allowed \u201c for similar services in collecting the taxes of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u201c <em>Rule </em>23. School directors will establish their own rules <em>\u201c </em>with reference to the time and place of their meeting, also \u201c the transaction of their general business, subject, however, to <em>\u201c </em>the approval of the supervisors of their respective districts.\u201d (See Rules and Regulations, etc., revised December, 1871, 20, 21, and 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u201cII. Should any board of directors fail or refuse to levy the <em>\u201c </em>tax as prescribed by Rule 26, Title 4, 1 Rules for the gov- \u201c <em>\u2018 </em>eminent of Public Schools,\u2019 and Rule 17, Title 3, <em>\u2018 </em>Boards \u201c \u2018 of Directors,\u2019 the fact will be reported to this office.\u201d (See Circular of Superintendent of Public Instruction, August 21, 1871.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The rules cited in the circular are substantially the same as those which we have just quoted, though differently arranged and numbered in their subsequent revision:</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">\u201c I. Sheriffs are hereby directed to turn over monthly, to the <em>\u201c </em>treasurers of the boards of directors of their respective \u201c counties, moneys collected by them of the one per cent, levy \u201c made by school directors of their counties, and report to the \u201c superintendent of public instruction the amount so collected <em>\u201c </em>and transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\"><em>\u201c </em>II. Treasurers of the boards of school directors will make \u201c to the office of the superintendent of public instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>\u201c monthly reports of moneys received by them from the sher- \u201c iffs of their respective counties, and the amount expended \u201c by them.\u201d (Circular, Board of Education, September 11, 1871.)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u201c Information having been received at this office that District \u201c Judges have enjoined the collection of the school-tax in some \u201c individual cases, and that some sheriffs have taken such in- \u201c junction as an excuse from attempts to collect the tax from \u201c other persons liable to pay it, it has therefore been found <em>\u201c </em>necessary to say that sheriffs will continue to collect the \u201c school-tax in accordance with the rules and regulations \u201c adopted by the Board of Education of the State of Texas, or \u201c subject themselves to the penalty of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u201c When a District Judge grants an injunction in any partic- \u201c ular case, the sheriff of the county and district attorney of \u201c the district must at once appeal from such interlocutory judg- <em>\u201c </em>ment, as authorized by the act approved <em>November </em>1, 1871, \u201c and, in the mean time, the sheriff must proceed to collect the \u201c tax from all other persons, requiring each individual to pay \u201c his tax, or to take out a separate writ of injunction.\u201d (Circular, Board of Education, December 11, 1871.)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Other extracts from the \u201cRules and Regulations,\u201d the \u201cCirculars,\u201d and \u201cInstructions,\u201d emanating from this board, might be given, showing the, extent of the executive and judicial powers claimed and exercised by it, in the organization and maintenance of the school-system authorized by this law, in regard not only to \u201c schools, school-houses, and the school- \u201c fund,\u201d but also as to all matters in any way connected with such school-system. It is, however, unnecessary to do so. When it is remembered that this board was authorized and actually did impose upon the people of the State a much heavier burthen as a school-tax than has ever been levied by the Legislature for general purposes of revenue, and that this tax, amounting, in the aggregate, to certainly over two millions of dollars, was to be collected, and, together with the interest from the permanent school-fund, the one-fourth of the annual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>revenue derivable from general taxation, and the poll-tax, was to be disbursed as it might provide; that there was conferred by this law directly and indirectly upon the board an. official patronage with an extent of following far greater than that of the entire executive department of the State; that the salaries of many of the subordinate officers, as well as the tenure of office as to nearly all of them, was dependent on its will and pleasure\u2014it cannot be imagined that such immense and unprecedented powers, without check or responsibility of any kind could, with due regard to the public interest, have been intrusted to any three individuals for any length of time. It is, indeed, hardly possible to conceive that authority to do this would have been sanctioned, in the organization of the government, by a people jealous of their rights and deeply impressed with traditional antipathy against irresponsible power.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The authority conferred upon the Board of Education by this law, and the collection of the tax in question, in these cases, cannot be sanctioned or justified unless there can be shown a plain and unequivocal warrant in the Constitution for the granting of these powers to the Board of Education ; but which has not been and evidently cannot be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Aside from the want of constitutional authority to confer upon the Board of Education the powers given in this law, we are of opinion that neither the Governor nor the attorney-general could, consistently with the limitations and restrictions in the Constitution, become members of said board, or discharge the duties pertaining thereto. We do not question that duties not inconsistent with their constitutional functions may be superadded to the duties of these offices. But it is quite obvious that the Legislature cannot, under color of enlarging the duties of a constitutional officer, confer upon him the functions and powers of another and altogether different office. The duties of the Board of Education, aside from those which are of a legislative character, to which we have referred, are almost if not entirely such as properly and exclusively belong to the superintendent of public instruction. They seem to us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>scarcely consistent with the constitutional functions of the Governor, and certainly are not with those of the attorney-general.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The answer given to this objection to the law, in the former decisions of the court which we have cited, seems to be mainly, that the members of the Board of Education do not, as such, exercise the functions, or discharge the duties of an office, or if so, that it is only such offices, agencies, or appointments as have salaries, emoluments or perquisites attached to them, to which the constitutional inhibition against holding two offices at the same time attaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">We are not prepared to concede the correctness of either branch of this proposition. The language of the Constitution is, that the attorney-general, and certain other enumerated officers, shall not at the same time hold or exercise any two offices, agencies, or appointments of trust or profit, unless one of them should be one of those specially mentioned in the Constitution. And the Governor is prohibited, without any qualification or exception whatever, from holding any other office or commission, civil or military. Can it be supposed for a moment that the Governor could hold the office of a clerk of one of the courts, or the attorney-general that of secretary of the Senate, because they were willing to discharge the duties of these offices gratuitously <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">The comments heretofore made as to- the powers conferred upon the Board of Education obviate the necessity of our doing so for the purpose of showing that its members exercise and discharge the functions and duties of an office, agency, or appointment. Certainly, we think it cannot be denied, that those who are charged with the administration of a general law of the great public importance of this act for the organization and maintenance of a system of public free schools, and whose appointees and subordinates are officers by the very terms of the law, with good salaries and of no mean grade, must be regarded as exercising and discharging the powers and duties of an office, although there is neither salary nor perquisites attached thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>These are not the only constitutional provisions violated by delegating to the Governor, attorney-general and superintendent, the functions intrusted to them as a Board of Education by this law: to lay off the State into convenient school-districts ; to levy taxes so as to raise in the several school-districts an amount in addition to that derived from the public school fund; to prescribe the manner of collecting and disbursing the money raised by this law; to frame all necessary rules and regulations for the establishment and promotion of public schools; to prescribe the qualifications of the great bulk of the employees or officers necessary to establish and maintain said system, define their duties and fix their compensation, all which this Board is authorized to do directly or indirectly through subordinates appointed by and and holding their offices at its pleasure, unquestionably require and could only be effected by the exercise of legislative powers. And though it should be conceded that the Legislature was not absolutely required to effect these objects by its immediate and direct action, but might do so by appropriate instrumentalities, to whom it might delegate the necessary authority to this end, still it is most obvious, whether these objects are attained by the direct or indirect action of the Legislature, that they are effected by the exercise of power properly belonging to the legislative department, which cannot be delegated to or exercised by one person or collection of persons belonging to the executive department, unless there was an express warrant for it in the Constitution. Certainly it cannot be insisted that there is any color of such authority as regards either the Governor or attorney-general.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">But if the law was in all respects unobjectionable, and the levy of the tax complained of was, in fact, the act of the directors of the several school-districts by whom it purports to have been levied, instead of that of the Board of Education, as in reality, we think, it is; still, in our opinion, the conclusion is inevitable, that it was not levied by the directors of such school-districts as are required by the law, and to whom the disere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>tionary power of requiring the collection of a tax of not less than one per cent, in their respective school-districts is conferred by the act under which it is claimed the tax in question has been rightfully levied.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Granting that it is not an imperative duty of the Legislature to lay off the State into convenient school-districts, or granting, also, if desiring it to be thus laid off, that it may do so by' means of the Board of Education, or supervisors appointed by it, unquestionably when the Legislature indicates its purpose that the State shall be laid off in a particular manner, and has directed those to whom it has intrusted this duty, to do it in the particular and prescribed manner, such agents cannot disregard the directions of the Legislature, and substitute in lieu thereof districts laid off in accordance with their own judgment and discretion. If this is attempted to be done, the act of the officer or agent to whom this duty has been intrusted is without authority. If the school-district laid off by him is not such a district as authorized by the law, the board of directors of such district cannot certainly exercise the legislative function of levying a tax, delegated to the directors of .such districts as in the judgment of the Legislature could with propriety be intrusted with this power.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The law in plain and unmistakable language empowers the supervisors of education <em>\u201c </em>To lay off and <em>subdivide the coun- </em>\u201c <em>ties </em>in their territory into convenient school-districts.\u201d It is the directors of these convenient districts into which the counties have been subdivided to whom the authority is given to levy this tax and have it collected. That the supervisors of education ever laid off and subdivided the counties in their territory into school-districts is not pretended. It is a fact apparent from the records before us as well as a matter of general notoriety, that the officers intrusted with this duty, in disregard of the plain language of the statute, either divided their territory by laying \"off each county into a school-district, or simply adopted this division as made by the School-Law of 1870, notwithstanding the fact of its having been super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>seded by that of 1871, under which the tax in question is claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In the case of Kinney <em>v. </em>Zimpleman, no notice seems to have been taken by the court of this objection. While in the cases of The State v. Bremond, and Hall <em>v. </em>H. &amp; T. C. R. W. Co., after referring to the provisions of the acts of August 13,1870, April 24, 1871, and November 29, 1871, bearing upon the point, it is summarily disposed of by the court, in the first case, by the sweeping declaration, that <em>\u201c </em>We are unable to find <em>\u201c </em>wherein these provisions of the law have been violated in a \u201c manner to render the collection of the tax illegal.\u201d And in the latter one, as follows: <em>\u201c </em>Bnder this legislation, it does not \u201c become material for us to inquire whether the counties were <em>\u201c </em>subdivided into districts or not; and the error of the court in <em>\u201c </em>instructing the jury that the county must have been divided <em>\u201c </em>into sub-districts is apparent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">We are constrained to say that we cannot concur in the opinion of the court, nor are the grounds upon which its conclusion is founded by any means apparent to us. The most reasonable inference which occurs to our minds as inducing their conclusion, is, that the court either supposed that each organized county of the State was a school-district by reason of the law of August 13, 1870, and so continued until their territory should be otherwise divided by the supervisors, under the authority conferred upon them by the act of April 24, 1871; or, since, under the law of August 13, 1870, it was matter of discretion with the County Court, who were <em>ex officio </em>boards of school directors for their respective counties, whether or not their counties should be divided into sub-districts, it was to be inferred that it was also a matter of discretion with the supervisors of education under the law of April 24, 1871, whether the counties in their territory should be subdivided into different districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">To the first of these suggestions, we respond that it was the evident purpose of the Legislature, by the adoption of the act of April 24, 1871, to supersede the school-system contemplated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>in the act of August 13,1870. The provisions of the two acts, in regard to the matter of laying off the State into convenient school-districts, are in direct and manifest conflict. Those contained in the first of these laws are abrogated and annulled by the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The legislative sense in respect to the proper division of the State into convenient school-districts is expressed in the act of August 13, 1870, by declaring each organized county a school-district, with the delegation of power, lest such districts might be inconvenient by reason of their size, to the boards of directors of their respective counties, to subdivide them if found necessary for public convenience. The provisions of the law of 1871, upon the subject, are altogether different. Time and experience seems to have satisfied the legislative mind that the constitutional requirement for laying off the State into convenient districts was not complied with by making each organized county a school-district, with a discretionary power in the boards of directors for their subdivision. Hence, in the act of 1871, while no districts are directly laid off, the duty of doing this is committed to the supervisors of education, with the emphatic declaration that they <em>\u201c </em>shall be empowered to lay \u201c off and subdivide the counties of their territory into conven- <em>\u201c lent </em>school-districts.\u201d Aside from the authority given in this clause, there is nothing in the law creating or laying off any school-district whatever, or to authorize its being done. Looking to the law, we think it cannot be questioned that it clearly appears to have been the intention of the Legislature, that the convenient districts into which the State was to be divided, should be subdivisions of the counties. And any division of it into districts otherwise laid off is without authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The fact that the directors of the districts, as laid off by the Legislature in the former law, were given the discretionary power to subdivide their districts, affords no reason for supposing that an unlimited discretion was given to the supervisors, in the subsequent law superseding it, to lay off the counties in the territory into school-districts, contrary to the plain language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>of the act under which they derive their authority in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The court being of the opinion, for the reasons stated, that the tax in controversy in these cases has not been levied in manner prescribed, or under authority of law, and that the same is an illegal and wrongful charge against those persons from whom it is demanded, it is ordered and adjudged that the judgment in each of the following of the said above-entitled cases, to wit, J. P. Willis <em>&amp; </em>Brother <em>v. </em>Joseph A. Owen, sheriff, <em>et al., </em>No. 123, appeal from Galveston; M. Kennedy v. John McClane, sheriff, No. 231, appeal from Nueces; M. Kennedy <em>et al. v. </em>William Scanlin, sheriff, No. 232, appeal from Cameron ; T. H. Clark <em>et al. v. </em>John McClane, sheriff, No. 249, appeal from Nueces, be and the same is hereby reversed. And it is further ordered and adjudged that judgment be here rendered by this court in each of said cases in favor of said appellants; and that the appellees be and they are hereby perpetually enjoined and restrained from collecting of and from said appellants said tax levied by said boards of directors in their respective school-districts, as prayed for in their several petitions. And it is further ordered and adjudged that the judgment in the cases of A. W. &amp; E. P. Clegg <em>v. </em>The State of Texas, No. 287, appeal from Galveston; Edward T. Austin <em>v. </em>The State of Texas, No. 338, appeal from Galveston; and Galveston, Harrisburg, and San Antonio Railway Company <em>v. </em>The State of Texas, No. 421, error from Harris, be reversed, and said causes be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">(Justice Reeves did not sit in this case.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
