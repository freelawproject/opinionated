The power of the mayor and aldermen of an incorporated city to grant to private parties a franchise to erect a toll bridge across a river flowing through the city, was predicated on the following clauses in the charter of incorporation, viz. : \u201c The mayor and aldermen shall have the power to enact and enforce \u201c such ordinances and regulations as they may deem necessary for the \u201c government of said town; provided the same do not conflict with the <em>\u201c </em>Constitution and Laws of the Republic,\u201d and \u201c shall have entire police \u201cof said town.\u201d <em>Meld, </em>1.

Tried below before the Hon. D. D. Claiborne.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-12\">Davidson and others claimed to be owners of an iron bridge which spans the Guadalupe river at the town of Victoria. The town tract, consisting of four square leagues, lies in nearly, equal parts upon each side of the river; while the town proper, one mile square, lies upon the east side. Between the blocks and lots of the town proper and the river\u2019s edge, there is a reservation seventy-five varas wide for public uses, and called the levee; and on the opposite side there is a like reservation, between the river and the farm lots lying opposite the town proper. The bridge abuts on this reservation on each side, and connects with the town by a short road or approach, that has been made across the levee, and which strikes obliquely on \u25a0 the streets of the town proper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-13\">The plaintiffs alleged themselves to be residents of the town tract, on the west side, or residents of the town proper, owning and cultivating land on the west side, and they brought this suit to enjoin the defendants from charging them toll for crossing the bridge, and to compel the defendants to allow a free passage across it to the plaintiffs, their families, and teams, and to all other residents of the town tract of Victoria. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>The petition of the plaintiffs set out that they sue for them selves, and all other inhabitants of the town tract. They alleged that the bridge is situated at the foot of Bustamente street, and in a highway of the town ; that it touches the west bank of the river, where the roads from Goliad and other places cross it, and is therefore part of the public highway leading into the town from the west; that the land upon which the bridge stands is the property of the town, held in trust for the benefit of the inhabitants; that the defendants demand toll of the plaintiffs and other citizens of the town tract, at half rates for ordinary crossing, and at full rates when engaged in transporting merchandise, etc.; that defendants claim the right to keep the bridge and demand toll, under a contract made by the town with J. O. Wheeler, in 1865, which contract was sold by Wheeler\u2019s administrator after his death, and now belongs to defendants ; that under the contract with Wheeler, he was to have the exclusive right to keep a toll bridge for fifteen years; he was to erect a wooden bridge and keep it in repair, and rebuild it if destroyed; he was to have the privilege of obstructing the fords of the river up the town tract, and keeping them obstructed, and was to allow the people of the county to pass free over the bridge in their ordinary crossing, but not when driving stock, transporting merchandise, etc. It was also stipulated that the town would not keep or authorize any other bridge or ferry, and that at the end of fifteen years the bridge should become the property of the town. The petition further alleged, that after Wheeler\u2019s death, the bridge was destroyed by high water, and the contract or franchise was sold; that afterward, modifications of the contract were made, first by agreement of the town council with the first purchasers, and afterward with the defendants, by which agreements it was attempted to confirm to the defendants all the rights held by Wheeler, with the modifications that the term should be extended for ten years longer; that the defendants should build an iron bridge; that they should pay over to the town twenty-five per cent, of the net income; that the free crossing should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>be abolished, and that the inhabitants of the town and county should be charged toll at half rates for their ordinary crossing, and full rate when transporting merchandise, etc. The petition further alleged that the County Court of Victoria county had fixed the rates of toll for the bridge, but had not authorized the defendants to erect a toll bridge; that the defendants were not incorporated, and that no authority to erect a toll bridge had been granted to them by the Legislature of the' State. That, in 1865, there was a good ford across the river about three hundred yards above the site of the bridge ; that Wheeler obstructed this ford, and that the defendants had kept up the obstructions, and that the municipal government of the town had acquiesced in these obstructions under the contract, and had abstained from establishing other fords, ferries or bridges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-5\">The relief prayed for was, that the defendants might be \u201c perpetually enjoined from demanding or receiving toll for \u201cthe passage of any residents of the town of Victoria, or of the \u201c property of such residents, over the bridge of defendants here- \u201c in described; or over any bridge they, under their said con- \u201c tracts, may erect in place of the present, should the same be \u201c destroyed ; or over any ferry that the defendants may use in \u201cplace of said bridge, should the same be destroyed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-6\">By amendment, the plaintiffs afterward alleged that Bustamente street, by a deflection, crossed the levee and reached the bridge, and that the highway from the west crossed the levee to the bridge on the west side. They also alleged that their land, on the west side of the river, was depreciated in value, because they had to pay toll on the bridge in hauling the products to market.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-7\">By further amendment, they excepted the Hon. T. 0. Barden (the judge of the court) from the inhabitants of Victoria, for whom they sued, and for whom they prayed the relief above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-8\">The defendants .excepted to this petition, on the ground that the matters and things alleged in it, did not entitle the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>tiffs to the relief they asked, nor to any relief that could be granted under their prayer for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-4\">The court overruled these exceptions, and this ruling was assigned for error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-5\">The defendants answered. In addition to a general denial, they set up special defenses, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-6\">\u201c <em>First. </em>They admitted that they owned an iron bridge, \u201c which they had erected at great expense, under a contract with \u201c the town of Victoria, and that they charged toll from the \u201c plaintiffs and others, whenever they chose to cross the bridge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-7\"><em>\u201c Second. </em>They set up the contract made by the town with \u201cWheeler, April 17, 1865, which they alleged was made as a \u201c substitute for and in extension of a previous contract, made <em>\u201c </em>by the town with Owens &amp; Sutton, in 1849, and of which \u201c Wheeler had become the owner. They also set up the mod- \u201c ideations of the contact of 1865, made by agreement between \u201c the defendants and the town council. They insisted that \u201c the town of Victoria had the legal right and power to make \u201c the contracts, and to make the modifications of them; that \u201c the town of Victoria had always had and exercised the right \u201c and power to establish ferries or toll bridges across the Gua- <em>\u201c </em>dalupe within her limits; that she derived this power from \u201c her organization under the colonization laws of Ooahuila and \u201c Texas, and also from the provisions of her charter granted by <em>\u201c </em>the Republic of Texas, on the 5th of February, 1840.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-8\">\u201c <em>Third. </em>That the town of Victoria had for more than thirty \u201c years claimed and exercised the exclusive right to establish \u201c and keep either a ferry or a toll bridge across the-Guadalupe \u201c river, within the town tact; and for the same length of time \u201c had claimed and exercised the right to grant, by contract, to \u201c individuals, the exclusive privilege of keeping either a ferry \u201c or a bridge, as the case might be, and that this claim and \u201c right of the town had been recognized, for the same length \u201c of time, by the County Court of Victoria county; that this \u201c right was recognized by said court by granting license to the <em>\u201c </em>town to keep a public ferry\u2014which license was granted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>\u201c </em>1810, and afterward, till the first bridge was finished in 1851, \u201c and was granted thereafter whenever a resort to a ferry be- <em>\u201c </em>came necessary by reason of the destruction of the bridge; <em>\u201c </em>that said court recognized the right of the town to grant the <em>\u201c </em>exclusive privilege of keeping a toll bridge; for that in 1819, <em>\u201c </em>after the town had, by contract, granted to Owens <em>&amp; </em>Sutton \u201c the exclusive right to keep a toll bridge for a term of twenty \u201c years, the said court, by order, granted license to said Owens <em>\u201c </em>&amp; Sutton to keep such toll bridge for twenty years from first <em>\u201c of </em>January, 1850\u2014the court binding itself to renew the li- <em>\u201c </em>cense annually, if necessary; and that said court had further \u201c recognized this right, by making orders, from time to time, \u201c to establish and regulate rates of toll upon the bridge erected \u201c by' Owens <em>&amp; </em>Sutton, upon the several bridges erected by \u201c Wheeler, and upon the iron bridge erected by the defend- \u201c ants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-5\">\u201c <em>Fourth. </em>The answer further stated that the bridge built <em>\u201c </em>by Owens <em>&amp; </em>Sutton was washed away; that J. O. Wheeler be- \u201c came the owner of their con tract, and that he erected a new \u201c bridge at a new place, some one hundred and fifty yards fur- \u201c ther down the river; and that this bridge was destroyed by high <em>\u201c </em>water dming the war. That in April, 1865, the town of Yic- \u201c toria and said Wheeler made a new contract, the old contract \u201c then having about five years to run. By this new contract, \u201c Wheeler agreed to build a new bridge, with the privilege of \u201c keeping the same as a toll bridge for fifteen years from that \u201c date. That Wheeler erected the bridge called for by his eon- \u201c tract, but-that after his death, and in 1869, it was destroyed \u201c by high water; that the contract or franchise was sold by his <em>\u201c </em>administrator, and afterwards became vested in the defend- \u201c ants; that it had been several times modified, by consent of \u201c the town and defendants, and that under the contract, as \u201c modified, these defendants had erected an iron bridge, at the \u201c site of the Wheeler bridge, and at a cost of more than fifteen \u201c thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-6\"><em>\u201cFifth. </em>The defendants denied that they had demanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>\u201c of the plaintiffs, or others, any tolls, except as they were en- \u201c titled to demand the same under the contract with the town, \u201c and according to the rates established by the County Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-5\">\u201c <em>Sixth. </em>The defendants denied that their bridge stands in \u201c Bustamente street, or any other street, and denied that it \u201c forms part of any highway, or is in the line of any highway \u201c except such highways as have been made, or changed, for the \u201c purpose of reaching the bridge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-6\">\u201c <em>Seventh. </em>They denied that they have placed or kept any \u201c obstructions in the ford mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-7\">\u201c <em>Eighth. </em>The defendants alleged that the town of Victoria <em>\u201c </em>had for more than thirty years claimed and exercised the right <em>\u201c </em>of granting by contract the exclusive privilege of maintaining \u201c a ferry or keeping a toll bridge across the Guadalupe river, <em>\u201c </em>within her limits; and that the \u00a1Republic of Texas, during its \u201c continuance, and the State of Texas, from its organization, in <em>\u201c </em>1846, to the present time, had acquiesced in the exercise of <em>\u201c </em>that right by the town. That, in 1849, the town exercised \u201c that right by granting to Owens &amp; Sutton the exclusive priv- \u201c ilege of keeping a toll bridge; that it exercised it again, in \u201c 1865, by renewing and extending that privilege to J. O. \u201c Wheeler; and exercised it repeatedly since, by the several \u201c modifications of the Wheeler contract, made by agreement \u201c with the purchasers and holders thereof; and that on all \u201c these occasions, and on all others, the exercise of this right \u201c by the town was acquiesced in by the State of Texas, by the \u201c County Court of Victoria county, and by the inhabitants of \u201c the town and county. Wherefore the defendants said, that <em>\u2018e </em>if the right of the town to grant such exclusive privilege was <em>\u201c </em>not originally conferred by law, it had become vested by the <em>\u201c </em>long use and exercise of the same, and the long acquiescence <em>\u201c </em>aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-10\"><em>\u201c Ni/nth. </em>The defendants further say, that under the exclu11 sive privilege granted to Owens &amp; Sutton, continued and \u201c regranted to Wheeler, and now held by the defendants, there \u201c has been continually kept and maintained a toll bridge across <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>\u201c the Guadalupe river, at the town of Victoria, from the year \u201c 1850 until the present time, excepting only the intervals when l&lt; the bridge having been swept away by high water, had not \u201c yet been rebuilt, in which intervals the place of a bridge was \u201c supplied by a ferry, maintained by the holders of the bridge \u201c franchise, and operated under contract with the town. Where- \u201c fore the defendants say that they, and those whose right they \u201c hold, have for more than twenty years used, exercised, and \u201cenjoyed, the peaceable, adverse, and uninterrupted right of \u201c keeping a toll bridge across the Guadalupe river, at the town \u201c of Victoria. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-5\">\u201c <em>Tenth. </em>The defendants further say, that besides the labor \u201c and expense of building the bridge they are bound by their \u201c contract, under penalty of forfeiture, to keep it in repair, and \u201c to rebuild it if destroyed, to pay over quarterly one-fourth \u201c of the net income to the town, and, at the expiration of the \u201c term, to turn over the bridge itself, as the property of the \u201c town; and that, meanwhile, the town retains its jurisdiction \u201c over the bridge, and has, by the contract, the right to super- \u201c vise its condition and compel repairs to be made upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-6\">\u201c <em>Eleventh. </em>The defendants further allege, that the bridge is \u201c necessary for the convenience of the inhabitants of the town; \u201c that the town was not able to build it by its own resources, \u201c and that the expense and risk were so great that the bridge \u201c could only be built by granting the exclusive privilege of \u201c keeping it as a toll bridge for a term of years; that the bridge \u201c erected by defendants is a great public benefit, and that it \u201c affords to the plaintiffs, and all others, a passage across the \u201c river,' safer, more convenient, and cheaper, than could be \u201c provided by any other means, if the bridge were removed; \u201c and that it yields a large revenue to the town, and thereby \u201c greatly lessens the burden of taxation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-7\">The plaintiffs filed exceptions to all the special matters of defense set up by the defendants. The court sustained all the exceptions; and this ruling was assigned for error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-8\">At the trial the judge peremptorily instructed the jury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>the defendants had shown no legal right to demand or receive toll upon their bridge; that the town of Victoria could not confer such right, and that they should find for the plaintiffs,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABF\">A verdict having been rendered for the plaintiffs in accordance with this instruction, the court entered a decree, perpetually enjoining the defendants from demanding toll of the plaintiffs, or of any other permanent resident of the town (except Hon. T. 0. Barden), for the passage of themselves, families, employees, animals or vehicles, over the iron bridge of defendants, or over any bridge or ferry they might erect or keep in its place; and also decreeing that the plaintiffs and all other permanent residents of the town (except said Barden) have a free passage for themselves, families, employees, animals, and vehicles, across the bridge of the defendants, so long as it is maintained and operated in its present location, under the contracts referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-6\">The defendants moved the court to correct the decree, so as to confine it to the plaintiffs named in the petition; but this motion was overruled; and this ruling was assigned as error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-7\">The evidence disclosed that at the time the bridge of appellants was erected, the contract between appellants and the town of Victoria provided that the inhabitants of the town should have free crossing over the bridge while engaged in their ordinary occupations ; that by the contract under which the appellants claimed, Wheeler was <em>\u201c </em>authorized and empow- <em>\u201c </em>ered to obstruct, so as to prevent the use of the same, all the \u201c fords, present or future, on the Guadalupe river within the \u201c limits of the town tract of Victoria upon public highways, or <em>\u201c </em>used now or hereafter as public highways, and to keep the <em>\u201c </em>same so obstructed so long as the said Wheeler shall provide \u201c a bridge or ferry for the passage of persons and property \u201c across said river, in accordance with this contract; \u201d that, after granting to Wheeler the right to construct the bridge, the following provision was incorporated in the contract: \u201c And <em>\u201c </em>the said parties of the first part do hereby bind themselves \u201c and their successors in office not to build or keep a bridge or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>\u201c ferry across the said river, on said town tract, or authorize it \u201c to be done, until after the termination of the said period of \u201c fifteen years; \u201d that the rights of Wheeler, under his contracts with the town, were all vested in the appellants, by the several contracts made between the town and the appellants, with an extension of ten years\u2019 time. The contract of the appellants with the town will expire in the year 1890.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-4\">The evidence shows that for the last forty years the highways leading from the west have crossed the Guadalupe river near and at the place where the bridge now stands; that they have all entered upon the reservation at or a short distance above where the bridge now stands, as the means of crossing the river demanded; that it has in effect been the same road at all times; and that there was no other public road leading into the town of Victoria from the west; that the four leagues of land over which the town has jurisdiction embrace a water front on each side of the Guadalupe river, six miles in length; that Bustamente (Bridge) street extends to the river, and did so prior to Wheeler\u2019s contract; that the bridge built by Owens and Sutton was built in 1851, and stood about one year, and, during the existence of that contract, no fords were obstructed; that the tolls charged against the appellees from the 16th of July, 1872, to September 8, 1873, amounted to more than one thousand dollars; that lands on the west side of the river were diminished in value by the closing of the ford and establishment of the toll bridge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b20-5\"><em>Glass &amp; </em>Callender, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad\">The charter of the town granted by the Bepublic of Texas, February 5, 1840, contains, among others, two grants of power, either of which we take to be sufficient to authorize the town to erect and keep a toll bridge, or to contract with individuals to erect and keep it. The first grant of power to which we refer is in the 6th Section, and authorizes the town council \u201c to enact and enforce such or- <em>\u201c </em>dinances and regulations as they may deem necessary for the <em>\u201c </em>government of said town; provided the same do not conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u201c with the Constitution and laws of this Bepublic.\u201d This is the power of local legislation, which, it has often been held, the State might well confer upon a municipal corporation, and which, as was well said by the Supreme Court of New Jersey, <em>\u201c </em>is, so far as it extends, a grant of sovereignty.\u201d (State <em>v. </em>Clark, 1 Dutch., 54; and Cooley on Cons. Lim., p. 191, and authorities there cited.) The jurisdiction of the town extended over the four leagues which constituted the town tract (Charter, Section 2), and, within that territory, the power of legislation conferred upon the Town Council was limited only by the restriction that their ordinances should \u201c not conflict with the Constitution and \u201c laws of the Bepublic.\u201d Did an ordinance which authorized the erection of a toll bridge across the Guadalupe, within the town tract, conflict with that Constitution or those laws ? If so, how and where ? It is not pretended that there was any provision of law which forbade the town of Victoria to erect a toll bridge, nor that there was any such prohibition upon the towns of the State generally. Ordinances and regulations that did not conflict with the Constitution and laws of the Be-public must mean all such local legislation as the Bepublic herself might have enacted without violating her Constitution or conflicting with her general laws; it follows that the town might grant it under the authority of local legislation conferred by the Bepublic and continued by the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-6\">There is nothing in the history of the country to give countenance to the idea that a free bridge was expected. It is not usual for bridges over such streams as the Guadalupe, at Victoria, to be free bridges; and it would have been absurd, in 1840, when the charter was granted, for any one to expect the erection \u00f3f a free bridge, across such a river, in a region of so little population and wealth as the region of Victoria, and Victoria county, then was. Free bridges were no more to be expected than free ferries, and no sane man expected to find either.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-7\">We conclude then that the authority to erect this toll bridge is necessarily implied in the power of local legislation conferred by the charter; for if the Bepublic herself\u2014without making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>any change in her Constitution or her general laws\u2014could have authorized the erection of a toll bridge, by a direct grant of a franchise, then it was not in conflict with that Constitution or those laws for the town to grant that franchise, under the powers of local government which the charter had conferred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-5\">But the authority of the town to erect a toll bridge is, as we understand it, also implied and conferred by another clause of the same section of the charter. It is there declared that the town council <em>\u201c </em>shall have entire control of the police of said \u201ctown.\u201d What is implied and comprehended in this grant of power ? Surely it does not mean merely the control of the constabulary force\u2014the marshals and constables. This is but one, and an insignificant department of police. The Congress of the Republic had doubtless reference to police power in the sense in which jurists and legislators generally understand it; as the power which extends to and controls all internal regulations of the local community\u2014which controls the intercourse of the inhabitants, and has special reference to all the means and avenues of inter-communication\u2014providing and controlling all roads, and streets, and ferries, and bridges, by which the citizens may pass from one part of the town to the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-6\">A brief reference to the authorities will show that we have not misstated the proper scope of police power. Jeremy Bentham distributes it into eight branches, and of these he designates the fifth as the \u201c Police of Interior Communications.\u201d (See Edin. edit, of works, Pt. 9, 157, and cited by Cooley, Cons. Lim., note 1, 572.) Chief Justice Shaw, of Massachusetts, described the police power, as \u201c the power vested in the \u201c Legislature by the Constitution, to make, ordain, and estab- \u201c lish all manner of wholesome and reasonable laws, statutes \u201c and ordinances, either with penalties or without, not repug- \u201c nant to the Constitution, as they shall judge to be for the \u201cgood and welfare of the commonwealth, and of the subjects \u201c of the same.\u201d (Com. <em>v. </em>Alger, 7 Cush., 84.) And Chief Justice Redfield, of Vermont (in Thorpe <em>v. </em>Rut. and Bur. R. R. Co., 27 Vt., 149), declared that \u201cby this general police power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u201c of the State, persons and property are subjected to all kinds <em>\u201c </em>of restraints and burdens, in order to secure the general eom- <em>\u201c </em>fort, health and prosperity of the State.\u201d (See Cooley on Cons. Lim., 573, 574.) And it has been repeatedly held that the construction of bridges over navigable streams, as well as other streams, is a proper exercise of the police power of the State. (Ibid., 592; Dill, on Corp., Section 97.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-6\">bTor were the authorities of the town restricted to any particular mode in which they might establish a bridge. They might, if they had thought fit, have raised by taxation the fund necessary to build the bridge, and might have made the tolls a perpetual revenue for the town, like the rent of stalls in a market-house ; or they might have made it free, either immediately or after a term of years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-7\">If the bridge had even been erected in a highway already established, it would not, for that reason, have been free for the use of the public, without the owner\u2019s consent. This point was virtually decided in the case of the Jersey City and Bergen Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Jersey City and Hoboken Horse Railroad Company (20 N. J., 61). In that case it was held that the rails of a horse railway, laid down in the street of a city, were not abandoned to the public or the city, or to other railway companies; and that it was <em>\u201c </em>not competent for any person, nat- \u201c ural or corporate, at his mere will, to appropriate the track \u201c of a horse railway company to his own use and convenience, \u201c by adapting his carriage to such use for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-8\">In the case above mentioned, the court decided that <em>\u201c </em>the \u201c Legislature have the right, which is generally delegated to <em>\u201c </em>the municipal government, to regulate the manner in which a \u201c road or street shall be formed and used.\u201d * * \u201c That \u201c the State, or those to whom it has delegated the authority, \u201c has the right to set apart a proper portion of the street for a \u201c street railroad, if that railroad is to accommodate the public \u201c travel, for which the street was designed.\u201d * * * <em>\u201c </em>And \u201c that it makes no difference that the road is constructed and <em>\u201c </em>operated by an incorporated company for their own gain.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Such an appropriation of a portion of a public street has been sustained by the courts in other cases.

He had extended a wharf one hundred and ninety feet, to the navigable part of the river, and the question was whether this was a nuisance, which the city authorities could abate under their power to establish wharf lines, etc. The court concede, in their opinion, that as the lot was probably a part of the public lands of the United States, the title of Yates was limited to the margin of the stream; and then proceed to declare:</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-7\">\u201c But whether the title of the owner of such a lot extends \u201c beyond dry land or not, he is certainly entitled to the rights \u201c of a riparian proprietor whose land is bounded by a navigable \u201c stream; and among these rights are access to the navigable \u201c part of the river from the front of his lot.; the right to make \u201c a landing, wharf, or pier, for his own use, or for the use of \u201c the public, subject to such general rules and regulations as \u201c the Legislature may see proper to impose for the protection \u201c of the rights of the public, whatever those rights may be.\u201d * * * \u25a0 &lt;\u00a3 TMS riparian right is property, and is valuable, \u201c and though it must be enjoyed in due subjection to the rights \u201c of the public, it cannot be arbitrarily or capriciously destroyed \u201c or impaired.\u201d (Ibid., 504; and see Pipkin <em>v. </em>Wynn, 2 Dev.

By the weight \u00a3&lt; of authority, as well as the preponderance of opinion, it may <em>\u201c </em>be stated as the general rule of American law, that such an &lt;l enjoyment of an incorporeal hereditament affords a eonelu- &lt;\u00a3 sive presumption of a grant, or a right, as the case may be, \u201c which is to be applied as a <em>prcesumptio juris et de </em>jure, &lt;\u00a3 wherever a possibility by right may be acquired in any man\u20ac\u00a3nev known to the law.\u201d (2 Green. Ev., Section 539). As to ferry rights by prescription, see Harrison <em>v. </em>Young, 9 Geo., 363 ; Pipkin <em>v. </em>Wynn, 2 Dev. (Law), 406 ; Bowman <em>v. </em>Wathen, 1 How. (U.

In the case thatis usually cited to show that usage cannot confer a right on a town (Hood <em>v. </em>Lynn, 1 Allen, 103), it was admitted that the usage may be good, if it is of \u201c long continuance,\u2019\u2019 and is \u201c necessary to the ex- \u201c ercise of some corporate power, or the enjoyment of somecor- &lt;\u00a3 porate right, or which contributes essentially to the necessities &lt;\u00a3 of and convenience of the inhabitants.\u201d And the usage in the case at bar is of this character.

(Dillon on Municipal Corporations, Section 55; Miller <em>v. </em>Burch, 32 Texas, 210.) The rule is well expressed by Mr. Justice Kelson, in the case of Minturn <em>v. </em>Larue (23 Howard, 430), in the following language : \u201c It is a well-settled rule of construction of grants by \u201cthe Legislature to corporations, whether public or private, \u201cthat only such powers and rights can be exercised under them \u201c as are clearly comprehended within the words of the act or \u201c derived therefrom by necessary implication, regard being had \u201c to the object of the grant. Any ambiguity or doubt arising \u201c out of the terms used by the Legislature must be resolved in \u201c favor of the public. The principle has been so often applied \u201cin the construction of corporate powers, that we need not \u201c stop to refer to authorities.\u201d In Pennsylvania R. R. Co., <em>v. </em>Canal Commissioners (21 Penn. State 22), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania used the following language : \u201c When a State \u201c means to clothe a corporate body with a portion of her own \u201c sovereignty, and to disarm herself to that extent of the pow- \u201c er that belongs to her, it is so easy to say so, that we will \u201c never believe it to be meant where it is not said.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-7\">Before considering the powers of the town of Victoria itself, under its charter, another question may be properly considered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>which is: If the town by its charter had the power to construct and operate a toll bridge at the <em>locus in </em>quo, could the town delegate that right to the appellants ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-6\">The powers conferred upon the town of Victoria were conferred upon it for a public purpose, and as a public trust, and are delegated powers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-7\">The Legislature, in conferring corporate powers upon the town, \u201c have selected the depositary of the powers which they 11 designed should be exercised, and in confiding it to such de- <em>\u201c </em>positary have impliedly prohibited its being' exercised by any <em>\u201c </em>other agency. A trust created for any public purpose can- <em>\u201c </em>not be delegated at the will of the trustee.\u201d (Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations, 205; Clark v. Washington, 12 Wheaton, 54; Dillon on Municipal Corporations, Section 60.) Judge Cooley, in his work on Constitutional Limitations (page 204), says: \u201cAnother and very important limitation which rests <em>\u201c </em>upon municipal powers is, that they shall be executed by the <em>\u201c </em>municipality itself, or by such agencies or officers as the <em>\u201c </em>statute has pointed out.\u201d Judge Dillon, in his work on Municipal Corporations (Section 60), says : \u201c The principle is a <em>\u201c </em>plain one, that the public powers or trusts devolved by law \u00a3\u00a3 or charter upon the council or governing body, to be exer- \u201c cised by it when and in such manner as it shall judge best, \u201c cannot be delegated to others.\u201d (Oakland <em>v. </em>Carpentier, 13 Cal., 540 ; Whyte <em>v. </em>Nashville, 2 Swan, 364; Smith <em>v. </em>Morse, 2 Cal., 524.) In the absence of a provision in the charter authorizing the town to delegate the powers which it might itself exercise, it must follow that the appellants cannot claim anything by virtue of the contracts relied upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-8\">Judge Dillon, in his work on Municipal Corporations (Section 61), says: \u201c Powers are conferred upon municipal corpora- <em>\u201c </em>tions for public purposes, and as their legislative powers <em>\u201c </em>cannot, as we have just seen, be delegated, so they cannot be \u00a3\u00a3 bargained or bartered away. Such corporations may make \u00a3e authorized contracts, but they have no power, as a party, to <em>\u201c </em>make contracts or pass by-laws which shall cede away, control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>\u201c or embarrass their legislative or governmental powers, or \u201c which shall disable them from performing their public duties. <em>\u201c </em>The cases cited illustrate this salutary principle in a great \u201c variety of circumstances, and, for the protection of the citi- \u201c zen, it is of the first importance that it shall be maintained by \u201c the courts in its full scope and vigor.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-5\">In illustration of the principle, see Milhau <em>v. </em>Sharp, 27 New York, 618; 5 Cowen, 540; State <em>v. </em>Graves, 19 Maryland, 352; Dingman <em>v. </em>The People, 51 Illinois, 277; Davis v.

Ho legislative body can so part with its powers \u201c by any proceeding as not to be able to continue the exercise \u201c of them. It can, and should exercise them again and again, \u201c as often as the public interests require.

To this we answer, that all of the power which it could exercise over these matters, was a governmental power, which it could exercise only as the agent of the State, through the legislative powers conferred upon its Common Council, and that it was intrusted with such powers as it possesses for the welfare of the local community, as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>as for the general public good; such powers as it had, it could neither surrender nor delegate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-6\">\"Under such powers, and with means for the execution of the same, could the municipal government contract with the appellants, that for a period of twenty-five years, or for any period of time, that there should be no other means of crossing the Guadalupe for the distance of six miles, except such bridge or ferry as the appellants might erect; and that they should have for their own exclusive benefit, to the prejudice of all other people, the right during such time to obstruct all fords then in existence, over which the people could cross during the greater portion of the year without expense; that there should be but one means of exit from the town westward, and that that should be strictly guarded by the toll-gate of the appellants ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-7\">We think that no greater abuse or rather usurpation of corporate powers was ever attempted, and that the contracts in every part, for the reasons here stated, even if the town had the power itself to erect and operate a toll bridge, are void. (27 New York, 618; 3 Duer, 119; 5 Cowen, 538.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-8\">A municipal corporation cannot lease or alienate any franchise or property necessary to enable it to perform its duties to the State, without an express legislative permission so to do. (The York, etc., R. Co. <em>v. </em>Winans, 17 How., U. S., 39; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Smith, 10 Allen, 449; Richards v. Sibley, 11 Allen, 66.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-9\">The next question is: Could the town of Victoria, under its charter, legally construct and operate a toll bridge at any point within the corporate limits <em>% </em>Under the sixth section of the charter, it is probably true that the town could legally have erected a free bridge at such point or points on the river as was necessary to the public good. (19 Iowa, 145.) The charter gave ample means to raise such funds as would have been necessary for that purpose. The charter does not in express terms confer the right, nor is it necessarily or fairly implied in or incident to the powers expressly granted, nor is it essential to the declared objects and purposes of the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-10\">If it was necessary to build a bridge or bridges, free struc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>tures would have supplied the necessity as fully as a toll bridge or bridges.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-4\">Then it cannot be said, that power to build a toll bridge was essential to the declared objects and purposes of the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-5\">The exercise of such a power may have been deemed convenient, but that it is convenient, in the absence of an express grant, is not sufficient to raise the power by implication; before such power will be implied, it must appear that the exercise of such power is indespensable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-6\">In the case of Clark <em>v. </em>Des Moines (10 Iowa, 223) it was held that the city of Des Moines, under its charter, which in express terms gave it power to \u201cimprove sidewalks, alleys, and \u201c streets ; to make by-laws necessary and proper for the good \u201c regulation, safety, and health of the city,\u201d had no power to erect a toll bridge. (See Bell <em>v. </em>Foucth, 21 Iowa, 119; Diveley <em>v. </em>The City of Cedar Falls, 27 Iowa, 231. See also Colton <em>et al. v. </em>Hanchett <em>et al., 13 </em>Ill.; Dillon on Mun.

(Dillon on Mun. Cor., Section 106.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-10\">The town has no powers derived from the colonization laws which would empower it to confer upon the appellants the risrhts which thev claim. Under the instructions to coraraisO v sioners, referred to by appellants (Paschal\u2019s Digest, 631, 632), it is evident that it was the intention thereby to impose upon the towns a duty, rather than to confer a right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-13\">As riparian owner, the town held no property which it did not hold for a public purpose. In fact, under the ninth section of its charter, it held no property, whatever, which it did not hold as a public trust. (Bass <em>v. </em>Fauntleroy, 11 Texas, 698 ; The People <em>v. </em>Vanderbilt, 26 New York, 287; Dillon on Municipal Corporations, Section 40; Darlington <em>v. </em>Mayor, etc., 31 New York, 164, 193, 205.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>But if it be admitted that the town was a riparian owner in a private sense, it will not better the position of the appellants; for, as we have already seen, a mere riparian ownership will not authorize the owner, without a legislative grant, to erect and operate a toll bridge. (Dillon on Municipal Corporations, Sections 72-74; see also the opinion of Judge Dillon in Prosser <em>v. </em>Wapello county, 18 Iowa, 332, 333, and the decisions of the several State and Federal Courts referred to in the same for a full discussion of this question.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-6\">Can the appellants claim any rights under prescription ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-7\">As a first reason why they cannot, their pleadings nowhere aver that the State ever granted such a franchise as appellants claim, even to the town itself. (Taylor v. Watkins, 26 Texas, 299.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-8\">If the town could claim such a right as is claimed in this case, in any event, the facts pleaded are not sufficient; for it appears that the town, when operating a ferry, did so under the general law regulating the subject, and not by virtue of any right otherwise obtained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-9\">During all of the time that Wheeler operated the bridge, not only were the inhabitants of the town given free passage over the same, but the like privilege was extended to the people of the county in their- ordinary travel; and this privilege was continued to the inhabitants of the town under the contract made between the town and the appellants, under which the present bridge was built, until the 22d day of May, 1872, at which time, under the changed contract, the appellants for the first .time set up their claim to demand toll from the inhabitants of the town.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-10\">If these facts existed they do not confer the prescriptive right claimed. For, \u201c when a corporation is found to exist by \u201c prescription, the same rule, as to construction of powers, we \u201c apprehend, would apply as in other cases. The presumption \u201c as to the powers granted, would be limited by the proof of the <em>\u201c </em>usage, and nothing could be taken by intendment which the \u201c usage did not warrant.\u201d (Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations, 198.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>When we consider that in this case the appellants claim to exercise one of the highest prerogatives of the government, and that the written law of the land, which first called, into existence the corporation through whom the right in this cause is claimed, is still in existence, whereby the powers which the State conferred upon it may be easily known, we very much question if the appellants, if the facts would ordinarily warrant it, could set up the right claimed by prescription.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-4\">Such an assertion of right is an assertion of right against the State, and it would seem that the maxim \u201c <em>nullwm temjpus occwrrit </em>regi\u201d shall apply; this is especially true in all countries where corporations are created and their powers defined by a written law which may at any time be seen. In his work on Municipal Corporations, Section 56, Judge Dillon says : \u201c A usage to give a right must, however, be long estab- <em>\u201c </em>lished, and forty years\u2019 duration was not considered, of itself, \u201c to be sufficient for this purpose. But usage in this country \u201c has a much more limited operation.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-6\">In the case of Hood <em>v. </em>Lynn (1 Allen), 103, Chief Justice Bigelow says: <em>\u201c </em>Usage cannot alter the case. An unlawful \u201c expenditure of money cannot be rendered valid by usage, \u201c however long continued. Abuses of power and violations of \u201c right derive no sanction from time or custom.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-8\">The tribunal to which the power to authorize the construction of toll bridges was granted, was composed of the \u201ccounty \u201c commissioners, the justices of the peace, and the chief justice \u201c of the County Court.\u201d (1 Laws, 145.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-9\">This tribunal was abolished by the Constitution of 1845, and the Legislature empowered to organize inferior courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-10\">If the town, by its charter by the colonization law, nor by prescription had the right claimed, with the power to delegate, it must follow\u2014the appellants having created a bridge in the public highway\u2014that it is in their hands a free structure, just as it would have been had the town itself erected it, and this without reference to the fact that the appellants are holding under a contract under which the free ford was obstructed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>It is said by appellants that whatever the Legislature might do, the municipal corporation might do. We do not so understand the law. The power of the Legislature, subject only to the limitations placed upon it by the Constitutions of the State and of the United States, is supreme. Not so with the powers of a municipal government. Its charter is not only its constitution, but it alone enables it to exercise any power whatever, and it has no power except such as the State has thereby conferred upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-6\">That the Legislature has power to confer upon a municipal corporation, with power to delegate them, such powers as are claimed for the town in this case, we do not question; but that the Legislature has not done so in this case we think beyond question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-7\">Nor do we question, if the appellants had a charter empowering them to erect a toll bridge at the <em>locus in </em>quo, that the town would have the power to permit the use of the ground upon which it stands for that purpose; for, in that case, there would be an implied grant of power to the town, which it might exercise for or without a consideration, as it deemed best.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-8\">Nor do we question the power of the Legislature, by an express grant, to have conferred upon the appellants the right to use any part of the land held in trust by the town, for the purpose even of erecting thereon a toll bridge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-9\">The appellees simply ask that the appellants be not permitted to do what the town could not legally have done; <em>i. e., </em>that they be not permitted to erect upon the public highway a tollgate, and that the appellees be permitted to use their bridge, which they have made a part of the highway, just as they can use any other part of the street.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-10\">The judgment gives this right, so long as the bridge of appellants stands where it does, under no authority other than the appellants have under the contracts on which they rely.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-11\">The appellants claim that the contracts are inviolable, because they are executed, and it would be unjust to them now to give a free crossing to the appellees after they have expended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>money in the erection of their bridge. To this we answer, that at the time the bridge was erected the contract contemplated a free crossing to the inhabitants of the town, and the bridge was erected with that express understanding upon the part of the appellants, which they now seek to violate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-4\">It is immaterial whether the roads and streets leading to the bridge were opened before it was constructed or not; for they are now the only avenues of ingress or egress for a distance of six miles, and without which the bridge would be valueless.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-5\">The evidence, however, shows conclusively, that for the last forty years the highways on the west side of the river have all entered upon the reservation, which is itself a public way, at or near the place where it now strikes the bridge\u2014that the highway has been essentially the same during that time. It is said by the appellants that the decree \u201cgives a free pass to probably five thousand persons, and to unknown numbers of wagons, cattle, horses, and other animals.\u201d That this is true, well illustrates the magnitude of the burden which the appellants have, in conjunction with the municipal authorities, attempted to impose upon the inhabitants of the town, for the purpose of enriching the appellants. From July, 1872, to September, 1873, according to the pleadings of the appellants (Bee., 68, 69), the charges of the appellants against the appellees (twenty-six in number) for toll, amounted to more than one thousand dollars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-6\">At the same ratio, for all the inhabitants of the town, the money received in one year would build many such bridges as the appellants own; yet they deem it a hardship that the inhabitants complain of this incubus, and they now ask that the same remain until the year 1890.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b38-7\">Roberts, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AN\">Appellees obtained a decree, enjoining appellants from charging them toll upon a toll bridge across the Guadalupe Biver, in the city of Victoria, from which an appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">The questions in this case are:</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>First. </em>Is the toll-gate kept on the bridge which prevents persons from crossing the river on it a nuisance ?</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\"><em>Second. </em>Have the defendants in error (who are the plaintiffs below) sustained such special damages thereby, and have they such a common right as corporators as entitles them, for themselves and on behalf of their fellow-citizens of the city of Victoria, to maintain this suit to enjoin the defendants below (who are the plaintiffs in error) from obstructing their free passage over the bridge without paying the toll?</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The first question depends upon two propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\"><em>First. </em>That the bridge is in and part of a public highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\"><em>Second. </em>That the defendants are keeping up thereon a tollgate, and charging toll for passage over the bridge, and thereby exercising a public franchise, without any lawful authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Plaintiffs allege that the bridge was a part of the highway at the time the suit was brought, and ever since the iron bridge was put in operation, which was several years before the suit was brought. They allege that there was no other passage across the river within the town tract of four leagues square extending on both sides of the river ; that there was no public road on the west side of the river, or street on the east side, in the city proper, provided and kept up by the public authorities of the city or county of Victoria, to cross at any other place than at the bridge; that the ford which the road formerly led to had been obstructed by the previous proprietor of (what was'termed) the bridge franchise granted by the city, and such obstruction had been acquiesced in by the city and county j that the public road on the west side had been changed so as to come to the bridge, after it was built, and laid out and worked by the authority of the County Court; that the streets of the city led to the open levee, an open space of seventy-five varas in width out from the river bank (on both sides), dedicated by the city, and kept open, upon which the abutments of the bridge rested; that the County Court recognized this bridge as being on and part of the highway by fixing the amount of toll that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>should be charged; that the City Council procured it to be erected across the river, under a contract previously made with the original proprietor in 1865, and repeatedly confirmed to his successors, permitting all the other crossings to be obstructed, and binding the city to establish no other ferry or bridge during the continuance of the contract, which, under the extension granted, ends in 1890; that it is by virtue of this authority from the mayor and aldermen of the city alone, and by no grant from the County Court, or from the Legislature of the State, that defendants have erected and keep the toll bridge across the Guadalupe River, within the city limits of Victoria, one-fourth of the net proceeds of which are paid to the city, and three-fourths to the defendants; that said mayor and aldermen have no right to grant such a franchise to defendants, and that they have no such right from any source whatever; that the plaintiffs are corporators within the city limits, some of them residing on one side and some on the other of said river, and own land on the west side of the river, which is diminished in value by the charging of toll on said bridge, by which they sustain a special damage, and are also damaged by the payment of toll in passing to and from the city proper in the ordinary pursuit of their business, and that as corporators of said city, they have in common with all other corporators, for whom also they, sue, a right to the free use and passage over the highways, levee and streets of said city, in which they are prevented by the toll-gate and charge of toll in passing over the bridge; by which it is a nuisance, from which they are entitled to be freed by the equitable powers of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Tire defendants excepted <em>to </em>this petition generally and specially, which exceptions were overruled by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Supposing it to be a nuisance in and part of the public highway of the city, as alleged, the plaintiffs stated facts which put them in a position to entitle them to bring a suit for equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">(Green <em>et al. v. </em>Oakes, 17 Ill. Rep., 249; Inhabitants of M st. <em>v. </em>City of New Orleans, 14 An. La. R., 455; Colton <em>et al. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number><em>v. </em>Hanchett, 13 Ill. E., 615 ; 2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., 924a,; Story\u2019s Pleading, 102 to 118; 13 Howard, US. S., 564.)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">It may not be improper to remark that plaintiffs might not have been entitled, under their allegations, to all of the relief which they obtained by the decree of the court unconditionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">For, if the City Council had been made parties to the bill, as it would seem most proper to be done, the injunction might have been made to cease upon the highway being opened to the ford as formerly, and a means of crossing furnished to the citizens without being compelled to pass over the bridge. That would have restored them to their original rights and obviated any complaint, or at least right of complaint, as it would now seem to us, from the view we have of the case. And another reason\" why it is particularly appropriate to make the city a party in this suit, in order to do full equity to all of the parties, is, that if it be determined that the defendants have no authority to erect a toll bridge, they should have the right to claim compensation from the city for building a free bridge, or else be allowed to take away the materials of their bridge, as the law and the facts might be found to be in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The most important question, however, in this case, is, as to whether or not the court erred in sustaining the exceptions of plaintiffs to the defendants\u2019 special answers, in which they set up the facts upon which they claimed the right to exercise the franchise of keeping the toll bridge and charging toll thereat, as they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">This, indeed, is the great question in the case, not only as it concerns the parties litigant, but the public in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The defendants, in their special answers, base their right mainly on the power of the mayor and aldermen of the city to grant to them this franchise.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">The answers in support of the right of the City Council to grant this franchise represent that, previous to 1836, in the foundation of the town, the commissioner of the colony was authorized by law to have a ferry established, the net proceeds of which were to be \u00e1 part of the public fund. The charter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>granted to the city in 1840 invested it with the ordinary powers of municipal government and police, without any reference to a ferry franchise. \u00a1Notwithstanding these, the City Council, as alleged in the answer, obtained from the County Court of Victoria county a license for a ferry.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">In 1859 the City Council contracted for the building of a toll bridge, and, from that time to the bringing of this suit, the City Council assumed to grant the franchise of a toll bridge, or of a ferry in the absence of a bridge, two of them having been destroyed previous to the building of the iron bridge, and said franchise was sold from one person to another, and the transfer was recognized, and the terms of the franchise changed from time to time. During all this time the County Court of Victoria county recognized the bridges built so far as to stipulate the amount of the toll to be charged, but never did directly grant, or assume to grant, the franchise. All these, with other merely incidental facts, being alleged in the special answer, the right of the City Council to grant the franchise of the toll bridge as it existed at the time this suit was brought, was sought to be deduced from them on the following grounds: ,</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\"><em>First. </em>As derived from the rights conferred upon the city by the colonization.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">It is sufficient to say that these laws had no application to the condition of the city or its government after the change of government in 1836, and, at most, provided for the establishment of a public ferry through the agency of the commissioner of the colony.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Second. As derived from the rights of the city as riparian owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The riparian owner may be given a preference in the application for the right to exercise a franchise, but his position in that respect does not of itself confer the franchise. (Prosser <em>v. </em>Wapello County, Justice Dillon, 18 Iowa Rep., 333; Paschal\u2019s Digest, Article 3841.)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\"><em>Third. </em>As vested in the city by prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>A prescription presupposes a grant, which is not even alleged to have been made, otherwise than as contained in the colonization laws of Coahuila and Texas previously referred to, and as implied in the city charter of 1840 under the Eepublic of Texas. Ever since the claim of this right to grant the public franchise to build a toll bridge in 1859, and long previously, the mode of granting the franchise of a toll bridge has been by a notorious public act, such as an act of the Congress of the Eepublic, and afterward by act of the Legislature, or by the act of the County Court, which in both eases are evidenced by the public records of the country. Under such circumstances, the claim established by usage alone for twenty or thirty years would hardly be sufficient ground upon which to presume a grant, especially where there was no complaint of a loss or destruction of such records.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">But then the usage itself has been qualified by continually getting the aid to the claim of the County Court in fixing the rates of toll, which is itself inconsistent with the claim' of absolute right to the franchise.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\"><em>Fourth. </em>As conferred by the city charter in 1840.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">This is the substantial ground of claim set up in the answer, and is predicated upon two clauses of the charter, as follows, to wit; \u201c The Mayor and Aldermen shall have the power to <em>\u201c </em>enact and enforce such ordinances and regulations as they \u201c may deem necessary for the government of said <em>town; </em>pro- <em>\u201c </em>vided the same do not conflict with the Constitution and <em>\u201c </em>laws of the Eepublic,\u201d and \u201c shall have entire police of said <em>\u201c </em>town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">It is contended, that as it is alleged that the river is within the corporate limits of the city, that the power is derived by implication from the above-expressed provisions to grant a franchise in a toll bridge constructed across the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Those above recited are the ordinary powers granted to towns and cities for the exercise of their municipal authority. The rule of construction is stated to be, that \u201c a municipal cor- \u201c poration possesses and can exercise the following powers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>\u201c </em>none others : <em>first, </em>those granted in express words ; <em>second, \u201c </em>those necessarily or fairly implied in, or incident to the \u201c powers expressly granted; <em>third, </em>those essential to the objects and purposes of the corporation, not simply convenient \u201c but indispensable. Any fair, reasonable doubt concerning \u201c the existence of the power, is resolved by the courts against \u201c the corporation. Of every municipal corporation the charter <em>\u201c </em>or statute by which it. is created is its organic act. \u00a1Neither \u201c can the corporation do any act, or make any contract not au- \u201c thorized thereby. All acts beyond the scope of the powers \u201c granted are void.\u201d (Dillon on Corporations, Section 55, 101, 102; Minturn <em>v. </em>Larue, 23 Howard,\"430. See opinion of Justice Bradley in The Mayor <em>v. </em>Ray, 19 Wallace, United States Rep., 475 ; Citizens S. &amp; L. Ass. of Cleveland <em>v. </em>City of Topeka, Supreme Court United States, October Term, 1874; Penn. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Canal Commiss., 21 Penn. State R., 22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">The general powers of municipal government granted to a city or town cannot be delegated, nor can they be bargained away, and they are to be exercised for public and not for private purposes. (Dillon on Corp., Sections 60, 61, 108-110.) Under these well-established rules, the extent of the authority fairly to be implied from such general powers of municipal government and police as contained in the charter, may be deduced from the general purposes and objects for which towns and cities are incorporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">Those purposes and objects being peculiar to towns and cities define generally the limits of municipal authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">So far as it relates to the execution of the general laws of the land, there is no more necessity for an incorporation in a town or city, than in the country. \u00a1Nor does the incorporation exclude within its boundaries the operation of the general laws as applicable to the whole country. But when people are placed in close contact in a town, or city, the safety of property and person there, the facility of transacting their business, the preservation of their health, and the comforts and decencies of good society in their midst, require a great many minor, though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>important regulations too minute and varied for general laws, and which are peculiar to their condition. These regulations are to be made in subordination, and not contrary to the general laws, still they go far beyond the general laws in prescribing the civil conduct of persons in relation to their personal conduct and property. In order to make these additional regulations binding, the charter must be put in operation by an organization, or by the action of officers under it. An act incorporating a town or city, therefore, is a law of the State, and more than an ordinary law ; for it constitutes, when acted on, a sort of organic law, a constitution for a local self-government, within its territorial limits, extending in its scope to the extra regulations required for the good government of the city or town, to be enacted and carried into effect by its municipal officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Such are the peculiar powers granted to a city or town, in the general terms of government and police, as contained in the Charter of the city of Victoria; and thus is the extent of its implied municipal authority to be determined and limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">It is none the less so because the inhabitants may be and are subject to the general laws, and some of its municipal officers may be invested by law with the authority to execute the general laws of the land, while at the same time they are executing those extra regulations that constitute the laws of the corporation, the municipal government. From this view it is obvious that the general power of government and police, granted by the State government to the city of Victoria, in its charter of incorporation, would not embrace, by fair implication, the high governmental power of granting a franchise of a toll bridge to individuals. That conclusion is strengthened by the fact, that from the terms of the charter the city limits extended both sides of the Guadalupe River, which must have been had in view by the Congress grantingit, and still they made no express grant of such power. It is further strengthened by the fact that in 1836 the Congress of the Republic passed a law authorizing the County Courts to grant and regulate the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>this franchise of erecting and keeping a toll hri dge on streams within the body of their respective counties, which, while it was in force, furnished an easy mode of granting toll bridge privileges, and which provision, however, is not found in the latter acts regulating the powers of the County Court, and which has not for many years past been acted on as a subsisting law. (Paschal\u2019s Digest, 5244-6. See also Act of 1848, as to ferries and bridges, Article 1229.)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">It is strengthened also by the fact that this has been generally regarded as so high a power of government, that charters for toll bridges and turnpikes have been generally, if not universally, granted by the direct legislation of the government in each instance.</p>\n<p id=\"ABj\">Other objections to this attempted grant of a franchise by the Mayor and Aldermen of the city of Victoria, are found in their attempt to barter away their power of municipal government, and in embracing a private in a public enterprise. For the sum and substance of the whole transaction is, that they took in a partner to make a toll bridge for profit, as well as convenience of travel; they on their part furnishing the ground as riparian owners, and protection to the use of it as a toll bridge by their municipal authority, and allowing the fords to be obstructed and allowing them to remain so, and binding themselves not to make or grant permission to any other crossing of the river; the other partners, the bridge builders, were to furnish the capital, build the bridge, keep it in repair, collect the tolls, and divide the net proceeds, one-fourth to the city, and three-fourths to themselves, until 1890, when the bridge is to belong entirely to the city. But if this were decided to he legal, it might be, as it might have been, extended to 1980, as well as to 1890.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Notwithstanding the incalculable benefits to the State of such municipal governments, the generality of- the powers granted, often from want of attention in framing their charters, and their liability to perversion to the accomplishment of private ends, admonish courts, as has been well said by a distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>guished author, \u201c to require of corporations, in all cases, to show et a plain and clear grant for the authority they assume to exer- \u201c eise.\u201d (Dillon on Municipal Corporations, 25.) And when a power is claimed to grant a franchise to individuals, such as a toll bridge, which is usually granted directly by the Legislature in this State, and that power is not expressed, but sought to be implied from the general powers of municipal government and police that are expressly granted, if this be conceded, it might be difficult to see what limit there is to the creation and perpetuation of private monopolies, in the hands of favored individuals. This would be certain to introduce into city governments the wiles and struggles for power and influence, to be used for private aggrandizement under pretense of advaneingthe public good.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">If the building and preservation of this bridge is necessary for/the convenience, and conducive to the general interests of the inhabitants of the city, just as the opening and repair of its streets are, the city may have the right to build it as a free bridge, to be paid for in a way clearly within the scope of its municipal authority, by taxation, but not as a toll bridge, to be paid for by unequal burdens in the way of tolls, and resulting in embarking the city in a private partnership enterprise with individuals for profit, under the cover of exercising its municipal authority for the accomplishment of a public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">(Mullarky, Adm., <em>v. </em>The Town of Cedar Falls, 19 Iowa, 23 ; Divley <em>v. </em>The City of Cedar Falls, 27 Iowa, 231; Dillon on Mun. Cor., Sections 580, 552, and Section 106; Colton <em>et al. v. </em>Hactchet <em>et al., </em>13 Ill. R., 615 ; Clark <em>v. </em>The City of Des-Moines, 19 Iowa R., 224; Bell <em>v. </em>Foutch, 21 Iowa R., 130 ; Citizens, etc., <em>v. </em>The City of Topeka, Sup. Co. U. S., October Term, 1874.)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">We are of opinion that the special answers of the defendants did not set jip any facts entitling them to exercise this important franchise of keeping a toll bridge on the Guadalupe river at Victoria, and that therefore the court did not err in sustaining plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions to said special answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Upon this ruling being had, the defendants obtained leave to amend, and filed a general denial, and went to trial, thereby imposing on the plaintiffs the burden of proving the material facts in his petition, affirmatively alleged, to wit, that the bridge at the time of bringing the suit was in and part of the public highway, as alleged, and that plaintiffs were corporators of the city, and were so situated, with reference to their business and property, as alleged, that they sustained special damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Upon the trial under this issue, all the facts as to the defendants\u2019 right were adduced before the jury in evidence, by the plaintiffs or defendants, notwithstanding the special answers had been dismissed. The statement of facts shows that there was brought before the jury, in addition to the written evidence and copies of records, witnesses who gave a full history o\u00ed the different bridges, ferries, roads, and fords upon the river, and gave evidence as to the special damage to plaintiffs, and other matters involved in the issue there presented, and in which evidence there was considerable conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The court charged the jury as follows: \u201c It is admitted by <em>\u201c </em>the defendants that the plaintiffs\u2019 residences and possessions \u201c are as stated in their petition, and that they, the defendants, \u201c erected, own, and charge the tolls for crossing the bridge, as \u201c alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u201c The defendants have not shown any legal right to collect <em>\u201c </em>said tolls from plaintiffs, they not being the riparian pro- \u201c prietors of the banks of the river, without which proprietor- \u201c ship they have no right to demand or receive tolls for cross- \u201c ing passengers or freights over their bridge across the Gua- \u201c dalupe river, in the town of Victoria; nor had the corporate \u201c authorities of said town any authority of law to confer such \u201c right upon them. The jury will therefore find for the \u201c plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">There are several objections to this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\"><em>First. </em>It assumes facts which, so far as they were material, it was incumbent on the plaintiffs to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number><em>/Second. </em>The facts assumed as a predicate for the verdict, were not sufficient, in and of themselves to shave, ustained the verdict if they had been proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\"><em>Third. </em>The shape of the charge is such as to dispense with the services of the jury entirely in their appropriate duty of finding the facts under the issue, according to the evidence adduced before them, in support of the material allegations of the plaintiffs\u2019 petition : the only province left them was to write the verdict as directed by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">In a ease in which there was no written evidence for the court to construe, but in which the proof was plainly in favor of the defendant, the court instructed the jury to find for the defendant. The Supreme Court of this State reversed the judgment on that account, and in the opinion say, \u201c He direct-<em>a </em>ed the jury to find a verdict for the defendant. It was \u201c going too far. It is doubtless what the jury ought to have \u201c done, from the previous part of his charge on the law of the \u201c case. It was his duty only to declare the law; this he had \u201c done, and that correctly. He had no right to tell them that \u201c they must find a verdict for either plaintiff or defendant.\u201d (Reynolds <em>v. </em>Wiliams, 1 Texas, 313.)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Where the court, in charging the jury, must declare the legal effect of admitted facts, or of records or other written evidence, to such an extent as to substantially decide the whole case, such a direct charge would not be error. (Mitchell <em>v. </em>De Witt, 20 Texas, 299; Reid <em>v. </em>Reid, 11 Texas, 593.) To go further would be a denial of the right of trial by a jury of the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">The case now under consideration did not admit of such a charge, however plainly the facts in evidence may be deemed to be in favor of the plaintiffs. This follows from the nature of the facts, and the evidence offered in support of them, which were necessary to support the material allegations of the petition under the issue formed by a general denial pleaded by the defendants below.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Under the issue, it was incumbent on the plaintiffs to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>such facts as would establish the bridge to be in and part of the public highway at the time the suit was brought; such affirmative facts as would establish, <em>prima facie </em>at least, that the defendants had no legal right to erect a gate and charge toll for crossing the bridge, not having a franchise therefor; and such facts as showed a common right as corporator^ and a special damage. These facts were not admitted, nor were they or could they have been established by record or written evidence, to such an extent as to have justified this direct - charge in favor of the plaintiffs below.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">For this error the case should be reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">It is unnecessary to express any opinion as to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the allegations of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">It is contended by the defendants that they have in good faith erected this bridge at great expense, under a contract with the mayor and aldermen, and that it is a great public benefit to the city, and that they will sustain great loss if this suit is allowed to prevail. In consideration of those facts, and in justice to them, it may not be improper to suggest.that the mayor and aldermen should be made parties to this suit, so that the defendants may have their remedy against the city for compensation if they can show themselves legally entitled to demand the same for a beneficial public work made by them at the instance and for the benefit of the city, the use of which the city continues to enjoy. Or, as said in another part of the opinion, the city may re-open and make fit for use the ford and roads to it, so as to obviate the complaint of plaintiffs, leaving defendants and the State to settle the matter of continuing the exercise of such a public franchise. Or, if not these, some other means may be lawfully found, so as to do justice to all the parties concerned. These suggestions are made, of course, without indicating any positive direction, or opinion given in advance, as to the legality of any alternative course. The great learning and ability displayed in the arguments and briefs on both sides, give promise that the real equity of the case may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>reached, upon some such mode of proceeding, upon another trial, so that whatever wrong there may be, may be rectified with as little injury as practicable to any of the parties concerned, which should be the leading object in all courts, and especially in a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
