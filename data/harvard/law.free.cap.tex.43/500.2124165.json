We affirm that the use of \u201c possion\u201d for \u201cpossession\u201d is equivalent to the omission of the word \u201c possession\u201d altogether, and that the reasoning in the cases here cited is equally applicable to the one at bar. The statute does not say that the meaning of the pleader in criminal cases shall be clearly deducible from the language attempted to be used, but that the \u201c indictment\u201d shall be in \u201cplain and intelligible words.\u201d P. D., 2863. Possion is certainly \u201cplain.\u201d Is it intelligible? If not, has the court the right to make it so by the insertion of a syllable? If yea, why cannot the court insert syllables wherever the necessities of the State require it ? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>For instance, if the indictment should, by pretended inadvertence, say \u201c with the consent of the owner,\u201d would the court append \u201c out\u201d to \u201c with,\u201d in behalf of the pleader? If it can do this, what can it not do? It is not usual to inquire into the reason of plain statutes as to criminal pleading, and a rule will not be established for the accommodation of prosecutors which would leave in an open sea, without a rudder or compass, all pleading as to <em>uautrefois acquit \u201d </em>or \u201c <em>autrefois convict,\u201d </em>or actions for malicious prosecutions\u2014indeed, all pleading, <em>pro </em>or <em>con, </em>in which the technical accuracy of an indictment could be made available for either party. Ueither reason nor authority will furnish an argument against the action of the court below on the motion in arrest, and the motion was properly sustained. We cite The State <em>v. </em>Huston, 12 Tex., 245; The State <em>v. </em>Williams, 14 Tex., 126; The State <em>v. </em>Hutchinson, 26 Tex., 111; The State <em>v. </em>Daugherty, 30 Tex., 360; Sparks v. The State, 35 Tex., 349; The State <em>v. </em>Davidson, 36 Tex., 325; Castello <em>v. </em>State, 35 Tex., 324; Garner <em>v. </em>State, 35 Tex., 693.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b511-6\">Reeves, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Azh\">The indictment charges the defendant Williamson with the theft of two work oxen, and being convicted he moved the court for a new trial, and also moved to arrest the judgment. The motion for a new trial was overruled, and defendant gave notice of appeal. The motion in arrest of the judgment was sustained, and the District Attorney excepted and appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Defendant, in the first ground of his motion for a new trial, complains of the action of the court in overruling his application for a continuance of the case. There being no bill of exceptions to the ruling of the court found in the record, the refusal of the court to grant the continuance will not be revised.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The other ground of the motion, in which defendant complains of the verdict of the jury, is not supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>the evidence. No error is perceived in the charge of the court, and none is pointed out in the brief for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The court sustained the motion in arrest of the judgment, on the ground that the indictment does not aver that the oxen were taken from the possession of R. S. Rogers, the owner, or from the possession of any one.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The indictment charges that the defendant \u201cdid then and there fraudulently and feloniously take, steal, and carry away from the <em>possion </em>of the owner, without the consent of the owner, with intent to deprive the owner of the value of the same,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab7\">The word \u201cpossion\u201d in the indictment, as will be seen, is formed by the omission of the letters \u201cses\u201d in the word possession, and though it wants the proper combination of letters to express the word in full, when the context and subject-matter are taken into consideration, the word intended to be used cannot be misunderstood. An objection of this character should be interposed before the trial, and should not be made a ground for the arrest of the judgment. By an express provision of the code \u201cno judgment shall be arrested for want of form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">In the case of The State <em>v. </em>Huston, 12 Tex., 245, where the word \u201cat\u201d was omitted before the words \u201ca certain public house,\u201d the indictment was quashed on motion; so in The State <em>v. </em>Hutchinson, 26 Tex., 112, the indictment, which omitted the word \u201cdid\u201d in charging the unlawful killing of an animal, was quashed on the defendant\u2019s motion. The same word \u201cdid\u201d was omitted in the indictment in the case of The State <em>v. </em>Daugherty, 80 Tex., 860, and the defect was fatal to the indictment on a motion to quash. There are other cases in which it has been held that the indictment was bad when a word essential to the validity of the charge had been omitted. Sparks <em>v. </em>The State, 35 Tex., 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">It cannot be doubted that the indictment must aver that the property was taken from the possession of the owner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>We are of opinion that such possession is averred with sufficient certainty to support the verdict in this case, and the motion in arrest of the judgment should have been overruled. Had there been no allegation of possession, or had the word possession been omitted altogether, the case would be different, and the authorities cited in the brief of appellant\u2019s counsel would be in point and decisive of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The order of the court arresting the judgment is set aside, leaving the judgment of conviction to be executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
