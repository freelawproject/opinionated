The defendant, William R Gracie, was the mortgagee, but he had assigned the mortgage, with a guarantee. He demurred to the bill. His counsel, Mr. Rockwell, took the ground that the bill did not allege that the amount due on the mortgage had ever been demanded of the mortgagor before suit brought, nor was any excuse shown upon the face of the pleading for not having demanded it; and he referred to <em>The Mechanics\u2019 Fire Ins. Company </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>1 Wendell\u2019s R. 137 ; <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Wadsworth, </em>11 Ib. 100.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-12\">Mr. <em>D. S.
