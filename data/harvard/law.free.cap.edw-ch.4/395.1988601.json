Between Francis B. Winthrop, executor of the last will and testament of Thomas Marston, late of the city of New York, gentleman, deceased, of the first part and Isaac L.

Whereas the said Thomas Marston in his lifetime and at the time of his death, being possessed of a certain leasehold estate of and in a certain dwelling house and lot of ground situate, lying and being in the first ward of the city of New York at the corner of Reade and Chapel streets, did, in and by a certain instrument or deed poll bearing date the twenty-sixth day of February in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eleven, give, grant and confirm the said dwelling house and lot of ground to the said party to these presents of the first part, for the remainder of the term for which the said Thomas Marston held the same, in trust to receive and apply the rents and profits thereof to the support and maintenance of Hannah Currie during her natural life, and after her decease to convey the said house and lot to his natural daughter the said Mary Bunn Marston. And whereas the said party of the first part having refused to execute the said trust, the said Hannah Currie (she being a feme covert) and the said Mary Bunn Marston (she being an infant under the age of twenty-one years) by their next friend William Bunn filed their bill in the court of chancery for the purpose of obtaining the effect of the said instrument; and such proceedings were thereupon had that on the sixteenth day of January eighteen hundred and fifteen, it was adjudged and decreed, among other things by this court, that the said party of the first part should execute and deliver to the said assistant register some proper release and assignment of all his right and interest in the said house and lot of ground, to be prepared under the direction of one of the masters of the said court\u2014to be held by the said assistant register and his sue<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>cessors in office to the uses and upon the trusts contained in the said deed poll.

That said Krucher being a French subject, said intermarriage was celebrated before the consul-general of France in the city of New York, according to and under the provisions of the code civil of France, and that prior thereto an ante-nuptial contract was duly executed between them and is now duly registered in the chancery of said consulate in the city of New York. That by the provisions of said marriage settlement all the property, real and personal, of the said Maty, the wife of the said Augustus, became vested in him absolutely on her death as survivor. The petition further alleged that under the said deed or indenture of the said Thomas Marston the interest of the said Mary Bunn .Marston was fully vested in her on me execution of said deed\u2014the enjoyment only being post<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>poned until the death of the said Hannah Currie and that upon the decease of the said Mary her title fully survived to her said husband the said Augustus Krucher and became perfect in him after the decease of the said Hannah. That the said Hannah Currie died in the month of January 1841.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-8\">The petition further showed that on the 8th June 1842, the said Augustus Krucher, being a man of wealth and desirous that the property of his said wife should go to some one of her own relations, conveyed the said unexpired term to the petitioner, the above named Caroline, a cousin of the said Mary Bunn Marston, by a deed or indenture of that date, now in the possession of the petitioners and ready to be produced, as this honorable court might direct. The petitioner, therefore, insisted that, by reason of the premises, they were entitled to a conveyance of said premises from the said Hiram Walworth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-9\">They further showed that at the time of the decease of the said Hannah Currie, who being the aunt of the petitioner the said Caroline and for a long time before, the petitioner and her mother Matilda Nicoll, the sister of the said Hannah Currie, were in the occupancy of the said premises and the said Hiram Walworth shortly thereafter commenced an action of ejectment against them without the authority of this court, as they were informed and believed, and upon the strength of the strict legal title in him under the proceedings aforesaid, had ejected them from the said premises: the superior court, before which court said suit was pending, having decided in his favor on that ground alone. The petition further showed that since the said decision they had requested the said Hiram Walworth to-make a proper conveyance of said premises to the petitioners and to surrender the possession thereof to them -as the rightful proprietors which he had refused and still refuses to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-10\">The petition, therefore, prayed that the said Hiram Walworth, the said assistant register, might be directed to make proper conveyance of the said premises and the said unexpired term to the petitioners or to the petitioner, the said Caroline, in such form as the law might require and to account with the petitioners for all rents and profits of said premises received by him since the death of the said Han<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>nah Currie or for such other order in the premises for the promotion of justice and the preservation of the rights of the petitioners as might seem meet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-6\">This petition was referred to a master to inquire and report as to the truth of statements and whether the petitioners were entitled to such transfer and conveyance as was prayed for; and the master was to give notice of his proceedings to Hiram Walworth, Esquire, the assistant register.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-7\">The case now came before the court on the petition and master\u2019s report, the latter embracing testimony which sustained the allegations and facts set forth in the former.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-8\">Mr. <em>Anthon, </em>for the petitioners, argued from the following .points:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-9\">1. The conveyance from Thomas Marston to his daughter Mary Bunn Marston, of the unexpired term of years in the leasehold premises in question, to commence at the time of Hannah Currie\u2019s death, was a good lease to her <em>in futuro : </em>4 Com. Dig. 86, a. g. and notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-10\">2. She had in her immediately <em>inter esse termini </em>and had full and perfect right to grant it to another. Ib. p. 96, c. 14.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-11\">3. By the 8th article of the marriage contract between L. A. Krucher and Miss Marston, it is expressly agreed that by a <em>donatio inter </em>vivos, the survivor shall take all the property moveable and immoveable which may belong to the deceased on the day of his or her death. Mr. Krucher then became possessed of all the right of his wife in the chattel interest in question by survivorship.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-12\">4. L. A. Krucher, after the death of his wife, by indenture dated 8th June 1842, conveyed said unexpired term to Caroline Matilda Green, the wife of the petitioner Edw. B. Leefe. And she had entered and taken full possession of the premises and is the proper owner thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-13\">5. Krucher was a citizen at the time of the marriage or at the time the title to the unexpired term vested in him and had, therefore, full power to convey : <em>Nolle </em>v. Fenwick, 4 Rand. 588. Facts and circumstances after long interval good proof of naturalization.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-14\">6. With regard to the acquisition of leasehold premises, it is of no moment whetherthe party acquiring the same isciti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>zen or alien; the right equally vests and is accompanied with full power to convey, until office found. The title of an alien friend to land purchased, is good against every body but the state; and his right can only be divested by office found : <em>McCreary </em>v. <em>Allender, </em>4 Harris &amp; McHenry, 409 ; Ib. 411 ; <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Leslie, </em>3 Wheat. 589 ; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Adams, 7 </em>Wend. 367. And until the land is seized by the state, the alien has full dominion over it and may convey it to a purchaser or maintain an action to recover it <em>: Bradstret </em>v. <em>Supervisors, &amp;c. </em>13 Wend. 546 <em>; Scalan v. Wright, </em>13 Pick. 523.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-8\">7. The petitioners are, therefore, in every point of view, clearly entitled to a conveyance of the premises from the trustee, conceding such conveyance to be necessary for their title.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b415-9\">Mr. <em>M. Hoffman, </em>for the assistant register.</attorneys>\n<otherdate data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"Arf\"><em>April </em>22.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b415-10\">The Vice-Chancellor :</author>\n<p id=\"ADD\">Although the legal title to the leasehold property in question is vested in the assistant register <em>ex officio, </em>yet, he can claim no beneficial interest or ownership in the property for himself. He is merely a trustee ; and during the life of Mrs. Currie she was <em>cestui que use </em>and enjoyed the property. At her death, it would have gone to Mary Bunn Marston, had she lived ; and the assistant register must have conveyed it to her absolutely and, thus, would have terminated the trust. Mary Bunn Marston had married, however, and died before her mother, Mrs. Currie, leaving no issue, but leaving her husband surviving.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">To whom, then, did the property belong ? Did the gift lapse or fail for want of a person to take or did her surviving husband become entitled to the property ?</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">The remainder in the term or lease, after the life estate for Mrs. Currie was carved out of it, was clearly a vested remainder, vested in interest, although not in possession. As such, it was assignable, transmissible, descendible. The trust did not cover the gift to the daughter. By the original Marston deed, the gift was directly to her\u2014not to a trustee for her. The language of the instrument is: \u201c after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>death of Hannah Currie, I give, grant and convey the house, &amp;c. to my natural daughter Mary Bunn Marston, her heirs and assigns.\u201d This was a gift <em>in present\u00ed </em>and vested her with the title and estate at the same time that the gift to the mother took effect, although it was not to be enjoyed as a thing in possession of the daughter until the death of the mother: on this subject see 1 Roper on Legacies, 392, 394 and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">If the daughter\u2014dying, as she did, in the year one thousand eight hundred and eighteen\u2014had died unmarried, it is certain that the property, being a chattel interest, would have gone to her personal representative, subject, of course, to her mother\u2019s use of it for life. But, having married, it is equally certain that the law gave it to her husband, unless, by the contract of marriage, the husband deprived himself of his marital right or, by being an alien, was prevented from taking. The ante-nuptial contract which, it appears, the parties entered into, could not deprive him of the property, except in the event of her surviving him, when it was still to have been her estate ; but, in the event which has happened, it became his property absolutely by survivorship. True, a husband, by marriage, acquires only a qualified right or interest in the outstanding personal property of his wife. If he does not reduce it into possession during her lifetime, he may be obliged to take out letters of administration as upon her estate, in order to recover it; but when so recovered, the property will belong to him, subject to the payment of any debts of the wife contracted <em>dum sola. </em>And if he omits to administer and dies with-without obtaining the possession, then, the property will go to the wife\u2019s and not to the husband\u2019s representative and next of kin : Williams on Executors, 438, 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">I am of opinion, however, that the right of property in this case, as between this husband and wife, is governed by the ante-nuptial contract made between them and not by the rules of the common law. They have regulated the devolution, as they were at liberty to do, by contract; and have not left the husband to stand upon his strict legal marital right. According to the contract, the husband became entitled by survivorship. All her right, by that event, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>passed to him by force of the contract and not by operation of law resulting merely from the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"Az-\">But, it is said, the husband was an alien and could not take and hold an interest in lands. The evidence fails to prove that he was ever naturalized, although he took an incipient step towards becoming a citizen. At common law, however, an alien may take real estate by purchase\u2014not by descent or mere operation of law\u2014and hold the same against every body, except the state; and if disseized or disposessed by any other than the government, he may maintain.his action or writ of right : <em>Bradstreet </em>v. <em>Supervisors of </em>Oneida, 13 Wend. R. 546. There is one exception to an alien\u2019s taking by purchase, <em>i. e. </em>he cannot take by devise (a species of purchase) and which is now prohibited by statute : 2 R. S. 57, \u00a7 4. I find no other statutory prohibition to an alien\u2019s taking by purchase, unless, indeed, the proviso introduced into the act of 1825, enabling resident aliens to take and hold lands, provided they do certain things, was intended to prevent any alien from taking by-conveyance as well as by descent or devise. That proviso is incorporated into the revised statutes, 1 R. S. 820, \u00a7 15, 16, 17 and the proviso alluded to forms \u00a7 17. It seems to me that the legislature could, hardly, have intended to abolish entirely the common law right to take by purchase\u2014by inserting these provisions\u2014or it would have been more clearly expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">But, suppose the \u00a7 17 produces a disqualification to take as well as to hold lands, unless the alien becomes a resident and files an affidavit of his intention always to reside in the United States and to become a citizen thereof. Who can take advantage of the disability so as to divest the alien or his grantee of the possession acquired under his-purchase ? Most certainly none but the government. It is an affair of the government alone. A grant to an alien is good against the grantor and his heirs. So is a devise good against the heir of the devisor. The title passes out <em>m </em>the grantor or devisor by his own act; but, instead of \u00absting in the alien grantee or devisee absolutely, it reverts <em>mynstanti to </em>the state by escheat. This seems to be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>doctrine recognized by our supreme court in the recent case of <em>The People </em>v. Conklin, <em>2 </em>Hill\u2019s R. 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">It follows, from this view of the subject, that the assistant register of this court can have no right to interfere with or to question the title which was acquired by the husband of Mary Bunn Marston by purchase\u2014for such it was\u2014under their marriage contract, much less to disturb the possession of him and his grantee the present petitioner. Upon what ground, even at law, he could have been allowed to recover judgment in the action of ejectment spoken of in the petition, I am not informed. In equity he can have no such right. If the petitioners have not a valid title under the deed from the surviving husband of Mary Bunn Marston, by reason of his alienism, it is not for the officer of this court to interpose the objection and seek to dispossess them; The attorney-general is the person to act in behalf of the state; and the petitioners can only be called upon to defend their title and possession against the claim of the government. In the meantime, this court is bound to order the assistant register to desist from further proceedings against the property and to execute a release, if necessary, to quiet them in the possession against any claims he may suppose himself to have.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
