And an affidavit was read (made by the solicitor for the defendants) showing, among other things, the following: \u201c This deponent has carefully examined the .petition and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>schedules in bankruptcy and there is not, therein, any item for the costs in this suit or for his liability for the same ; nor was any notice given to the defendants to show cause against his,\u201d Robinson\u2019s \u201c discharge. Deponent further saith that said Robinson was declared bankrupt in April, 1842 ; but this deponent saith that, after the said decree of bankruptcy, this suit was still prosecuted by E. W. Chester, Esquire, the solicitor of said Robinson in this suit and for the account of the said Robinson; and that the general assignee in bankruptcy, W. C. H. Waddell, Esquire, disavowed, under his official. certificate and signature, all agency or interest in the suit and refusal to have any thing to do with it. That, nevertheless, the said suit was prosecuted with the full knowledge of said Robinson, by his solicitor aforesaid. And the said Robinson, during the examination of witnesses, on the part of the complainant in this cause in July last, attended the examination, at least, once personally ; and that a great part of the costs in this suit have accrued since the first decree in bankruptcy declaring said Robinson a bankrupt.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-8\">Mr. <em>E.

Staples, </em>for the defendants and in oppositioh to the application to discharge the <em>fi. fa. </em>made the following points:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-10\">1. Where a party having commenced a suit, afterwards obtains a discharge under the act and then a judgment as in case of non-suit is rendered against him for not going to trial, his discharge is <em>no bar </em>to an action to recover the costs on such judgment : <em>Stebbins </em>v. <em>Willson, </em>14 John. 403. See also <em>Buel </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>6 Johns. R. 126.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-11\">2. A discharge under the act of a defendant who had signed a bond as surety for a deputy sheriff, is not a good plea in bar, as the damages sustained in consequence of the breaches of the condition of the bond were not then ascertained : <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Waring, </em>20 John. R. 153. See 2 Wend. 248.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-12\">3. As a general rule a discharge under an insolvent law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>or under the English bankrupt act does not discharge a debtor from claims that are unliquidated or entirely contingent and not capable of being ascertained, as is the present case.</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b301-11\"><em>Sept. </em>26.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b301-4\">The Vice-Chancellor :</author>\n<p id=\"ANH\">The decree and discharge in bankruptcy exonerates the complainant Robinson from liability for the costs of this suit. The provisions of the bankrupt act are broader and go further towards discharging uncertain demands and contingent liabilities than our state insolvent laws.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The writ of <em>fi. fa. </em>for the costs of this suit and the levy by the sheriff, so far as it affects the complainant Robinson and his goods, must, therefore, be set aside ; but, under the circumstances, without costs of this motion\u2014each of the parties being left to bear his own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Order accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b301-12\"> And see <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Ambrose, </em>3 Maule &amp; S. 326.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
