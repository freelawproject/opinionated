Bloodgood and John Bloodgood : the ground comprised in the said mortgage having, at all times, been more than adequate security for the mortgage held by him. He further saith that, upon being applied to for the payment of the loss, the said company directed a letter to be delivered to the said Isaac L.

D. 1834 between Anson Blake and John Bloodgood, the premises mortgaged were sold by the former to the latter, which sale was afterwards consummated by the due execution of the deeds. Under these circumstances, the company are advised that, as between them and Mr. Blake and Mr. Bloodgood, the premises were at the risk of the latter gentleman and not under the protection of their insurance at the time of their destruction; and that you can only claim on the ground of holding the policy as collateral to the mortgage. While they are willing to meet such claim, so far as you are in fact interested, they cannot submit to have the money applied in prejudice to them to the exoneration of the land from a charge which Mr. Bloodgood (at whose risk the property was) ought to bear.. They, therefore, inform you, that they are willing to pay the amount of the loss into your hands : upon your giving them the benefit of your mortgage for their reimbursement, after the balance of the amount of your mortgage shall be paid, to be collectedby the companyat their own expense and risk without any act on your part to defeat or impair their rights. Or they are willing to pay you the amount of your bond and mortgage, on taking an assignment thereof by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>they will be enabled to test the claim made for the benefit of Mr. Bloodgood by proceedings with him directly. Or if you are desirous of keeping the money invested, according to the present terms of the investment, they will take \"such assignment and give you, in return for it, the bond of the company, payable at the same periods and with the same interest as that you hold of Mr. Blake, secured by other securities of bond and mortgage equal in value, in your own judgment, to the property now held by you as security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-4\">Should none of these propositions be accepted, the company will be bound to conclude that your claim is put forward simply for the benefit of Mr. Bloodgood, to seek a payment to which, in his own name, he is not entitled, and will deem themselves justified in proceeding against you in chancery for the defence of what'they deem their equitable rights and shall, in each case, hope to have the expenses of such proceedings charged upon you in case their rights shall be allowed by that court.

The insurers of Blake and Kip are, upon payment of the loss, entitled to be subrogated to all the rights for reimbursement which they possessed at the time of the loss; and among these to be substituted on Blake\u2019s claim on his contracts of December 31st, 1834 and 20th January 1835 against Bloodgood.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-10\">6th.

Having refused this condition he must, if he now is admitted to recover the insurance, pay costs and submit to account for the value of what could have been- recovered if the substitution had been admitted on the sixteenth day of December one thousand eight hundred and thirty-five.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AsY\">The Vice-Chancellor :</author>\n<p id=\"ADB\">By the policy of insurance in question, the Mutual Insurance Company insured Blake against loss and damage by fire\u2014he being the owner of the premises at the time of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">By an assignment of the policy to Kip, the mortgagee of Blake, made with the consent of the company, it enured to the benefit\" of the former as collateral security for the payment of his mortgage debt. This was the only object of the assignment to Kip. In case of loss, he was to receive payment on the policy and then, as between himself and Blake, he was to apply the money towards liquidating the mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>gage\u2014or if Blake should, himself, pay off the mortgage, he would be entitled to a return or re-assignment of the policy from Kip and could then receive the insurance money himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">But to entitle Blake to the benefit of the policy in case of loss, either for the purpose of liquidating his mortgage-debt or for his own indemnification after he should have paid off that debt and entitled himself to a return of the policy, it was essential that he should remain the owner of the premises insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The sale of the property by Blake to Bloodgood put an end to the contract of insurance as between Blake and the company, except so far as Kip\u2019s right to it extended by way of collateral security as before mentioned. That right no act of Blake\u2019s or of the company could divest without Kip\u2019s consent. He might still claim to hold the policy for the benefit of his security, which was all that remained of the contract after Blake had parted with all his interest in the property ; and if the company were obliged to pay Kip for a loss of the property insured, they, standing in the relation of sureties to him for so much of the mortgage debt, would be entitled, by subrogation, to the benefit of the mortgage for their reimbursement as sureties, after Kip should be paid in full. This would not be so if the contract of insurance still remained in force for the benefit of Blake. But it did not \u2014his sale, as before observed, terminated it. Bloodgood, by becoming the purchaser, acquired no right to the policy of insurance or the benefit of it, unless Blake had assigned his reversionary interest in it to Bloodgood and the company had assented, thereby becoming, in effect, insurers to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The company never contracted to insure Bloodgood as the owner and they could not be made to do so by assignment from Blake or from Kip without their consent. These views appear to me to be sustained by the principle established in the case of <em>The \u00c6tna Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>16 Wend. 285 and <em>The Traders Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Robert, </em>9 Wend. 404 ; S. C. in Error, 17 Ib. 631. Mr. Blood-good became the owner of the premises before the loss by fire occurred, although the deed of conveyance appears not to have been actually delivered until after the fire. Still,\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>he had an insurable interest as owner from the time of his contract of purchase. He however, took no measures to insure himself by virtue of the policy in question. And although this application is made confessedly on his behalf and for his benefit in the name of Kip, the mortgagee, yet he can have no better or more extensive right or equity than Kip could claim. If he was before the court on his own account claipiing the dividend which the receivers are enabled to make among the creditors of this insolvent company, he would be obliged to give them an interest in the mortgage for and towards their reimbursement. The present application appearing to be prosecuted for the benefit of Bloodgood and upon a bond of indemnity to Kip for the costs, must be denied with costs to be taxed and to be paid by Bloodgood \u2022 the ostensible party to it. And if Mr. Kip has any apprehension of an insufficiency of his mortgage security to pay his debt so as to deem it worth while to claim and receive a dividend upon the amount of the policy on the terms suggested, viz. admitting the receivers to take an interest in the mortgage for and towards their reimbursement out of the money to be derived from a foreclosure of the mortgage after Mr. Kip shall be paid and satisfied, he must be left to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
