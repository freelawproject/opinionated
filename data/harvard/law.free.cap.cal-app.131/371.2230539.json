Hollander, brought this action against defendant Oakland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Association, a corporation, also known as the Oakland Base Ball Club, to.recover the sum of $1500 as the alleged reasonable value of the services of plaintiff\u2019s assignor in negotiating the \u201csale\u201d for the sum of $15,000 of \u201cBuzz\u201d Arlett, a baseball player under contract with defendant, to the Philadelphia national league club. Prom a judgment in favor of plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">In examining appellant\u2019s opening brief we find that there are no headings \u201cshowing the nature of the question to be presented or the point to be made\u201d as required by section 2 of Rule VIII of the Rules for the Supreme Court and District Courts of Appeal. The only headings are \u201cStatement of the ease\u201d, \u201cArgument\u201d, \u201cThe law\u201d, \u201cEvidence\u201d, \u201cSummary of evidence\u201d and \u201cConclusion\u201d. These headings are insufficient to comply with the rule and we again call attention to the penalties which may be imposed for failure to meet the requirements. (Sec. 4 of said Rule VIII; <em>Herlihy </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>129 Cal. App. 434 [18 Pac. (2d) 992]; <em>Landa </em>v. <em>Steinberg, </em>126 Cal. App. 324 [14 Pac.

(2d) 59].)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">We have, however, examined the briefs and the record herein. It appears that plaintiff\u2019s assignor had been a professional baseball player, having played with the Oakland Club and certain clubs in the eastern states, and that he thereafter acted as agent for the St. Louis national club on the Pacific coast. In 1930 he had an oral agreement with the defendant, confirmed by letter, whereby he was to receive from defendant the sum of $350 for any player recommended to defendant by him provided the player \u201cmade good\u201d with defendant. In January of 1931, Carl Zamloch, the playing manager of defendant, went to plaintiff\u2019s assignor and told him that the defendant club had been trying to sell Arlett and had \u201cexhausted all efforts to sell him to major league clubs\u201d. He stated that they had been offered $5,000 by the San Francisco club, but that they did not desire to sell him to any club in the Pacific coast league \u201cfor if they did and he made good, he would make a goat out of them\u201d. Zamloch asked plaintiff\u2019s assignor if he knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>any club that might be interested and received an affirmative reply. Plaintiff\u2019s assignor refused to disclose any information in this regard unless authorized to sell Arlett, whereupon Zamloeh said, \u201cYou have the authorization right now\u201d. Plaintiff\u2019s assignor then assured Zamloeh that he would \u201cget busy\u201d and a series of telegrams thereafter passed between plaintiff\u2019s assignor and the Philadelphia national league baseball club. The telegrams sent by plaintiff\u2019s assignor contained information requested by the Philadelphia club, which information was furnished to plaintiff\u2019s assignor by Zamloeh and also contained information regarding price and terms of the proposed sale. On January 26, 1931, the manager of the Philadelphia club wired to the defendant referring to the negotiations with plaintiff\u2019s assignor who \u201csays he is authorized by manager Zamloeh to do business\u201d and stating, \u201cIf this is an order we hereby accept proposition. Wire confirmation.\u201d To this telegram defendant replied' by wire the same day, \u201cTerms for Arlett accepted.\u201d Thereafter the sale was consummated and defendant received the sum of $15,000 as agreed. It is undisputed that the entire negotiations were handled by plaintiff\u2019s assignor. The president of the defendant corporation testified on cross-examination, \u201cWe did nothing in as much as you were handling it.\u201d Referring to the sending of the final telegram this witness stated, \u201cThat is all we did. We left everything to you.\u201d The word \u201cyou\u201d found in the foregoing testimony referred to plaintiff\u2019s assignor, who was then conducting the cross-examination of the witness. After certain preliminary questions qualifying plaintiff\u2019s assignor to give his opinion regarding the reasonable value of the services rendered, he testified that the reasonable value thereof was $1500. No testimony to the contrary was offered on the subject of the reasonable value of said services.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">It appears from appellant\u2019s briefs that the attack is directed at the alleged insufficiency of the evidence but in our opinion the foregoing evidence amply supports the findings and judgment. Upon the trial, appellant contended that Zamloeh was merely the \u201cplaying manager\u201d or \u201cfield manager\u201d of defendant and not the \u201cmanager\u201d and further contended that said Zamloeh had no authority to bind appellant. The trial court so. found, but further found upon competent evidence that appellant \u201cwith full knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the facts and circumstances, ratified and confirmed the acts and conduct of said William H. Hollander and the authority delegated to him by said Carl Zamloch\u201d and \u2018\u2018subsequently thereto accepted the benefits of said transaction ...\u201d Appellants also call our attention to certain testimony in the record tending to support appellant\u2019s further claims as follows : First, that respondent\u2019s assignor was not authorized by Zamloch to send any telegrams; second, that in a subsequent telephone conversation during the negotiations, Zamloch told respondent\u2019s assignor, \u201cIf this deal should happen to go through, there is nothing in it for you\u201d; and third, that it was not the custom of minor league clubs to compensate agents for sales of players. All that need be said regarding these claims is that there was a direct conflict in the evidence concerning each of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">We find no error in the record and accordingly the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Sturtevant, J., and Goodell, J., <em>pro tern., </em>concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
