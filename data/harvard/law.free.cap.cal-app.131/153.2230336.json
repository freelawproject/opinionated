Laws), providing a proceeding or method for determining the boundary lines of cities, towns and counties which may be indefinite or uncertain from any cause. This act furnishes a full and complete remedy to cities, and by its provisions allows a full and complete investigation as to indefinite or uncertain boundaries; allows the introduction of testimony and maps, and gives a direct method of determining the true boundaries of cities, towns and counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Under such circumstances, where a complete remedy is afforded, the court is of the opinion that a proceeding in <em>mandamus </em>should not be entertained where the boundary lines of cities are sought to be determined, when such boundary lines are really a collateral issue. Besides, the real questions involved require the taking of testimony which may more properly be taken and introduced in the trial courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Being of the opinion that the alternative writ in this prpceeding was inadvertently issued, it is hereby ordered that the same be, and it is hereby dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
