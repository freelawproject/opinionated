EYLER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">This case turns on the interpretation of dispute resolution provisions in a subcontract relating to federal procurement. The contract relates to the construction of a biomedical re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>search facility (\u201cthe project\u201d), on property owned by FSK Land Corporation (\u201cFSK\u201d), located on the Johns Hopkins University Bayview campus, and leased to the National Institutes of Health of the federal Department of Health and Human Services. (\u201cNIH\u201d). On December 31, 2001, FSK entered into a contract, entitled the Development Management Services Agreement (\u201cDMSA\u201d), with Smith Management Construction, Inc. (\u201cSMCI\u201d), an appellee, pursuant to which SMCI agreed to serve as \u201cDevelopment Manager\u201d for the project. BRC Lease Co., LLC (\u201cBRC\u201d), another appellee, was formed for the sole purpose of entering into a long term lease with NIH. FSK assigned its interests under the lease and the DMSA to BRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">On May 20, 2004, SMCI entered into a contract with Skanska USA Building, Inc. (\u201cSkanksa\u201d), appellant, pursuant to which appellant agreed to serve as construction manager for the project. The contract consisted of an \u201cAgreement for Construction Services\u201d (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d) and a \u201cSupplement to the Agreement for Construction Services\u201d (\u201cSupplement\u201d) (collectively, \u201cthe Contract\u201d). Section 7.6.1 of the Supplement expressly incorporated, along with other documents, the lease with NIH and the DMSA, expressly including the dispute resolution provisions contained in the DMSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Appellant asserts that, after it began work, SMCI made substantial changes in the project for which appellant was not adequately compensated. Ultimately, on August 30, 2007, appellant filed suit against appellees in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">SMCI and BRC filed motions to dismiss, asserting primarily that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The circuit court, by order and memorandum opinion dated February 6, 2008, granted, without prejudice, SMCI\u2019s motion to dismiss, and by order dated March 14, 2008, granted, without prejudice, BRC\u2019s motion to dismiss, on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Appellant filed a motion to alter or amend judgment. The court denied it, and appellant noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The resolution of this case turns on the interpretation of the Contract and DMSA, specifically, the dispute resolution provisions. The issue is whether appellant is required to pursue its claims under the procedure applicable to federal procurement contracts, specifically, the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-613 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (\u201cFAR\u201d) \u00a7 52.233-1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or whether appellant can proceed in this civil action. The circuit court held that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, directed the parties to proceed under the Contract Disputes Act, and dismissed the complaint without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">We agree with the circuit court that appellant may not pursue its claims in this action at this time, but conclude that the court erred in dismissing the complaint. We shall vacate the orders dismissing the complaint and remand the case to circuit court with the direction that the circuit court enter an order staying any further proceedings on the merits pending the completion of proceedings under the Contract Disputes Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We see no need to address the remaining contentions of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">In its complaint, appellant alleged that, pursuant to the Contract, it was to be paid costs plus a fee, the total not to exceed the guaranteed maximum price (\u201cGMP\u201d) in the amount of $168,276,652.00, as adjusted by various events, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>approved changes in the work. The adjusted figure was designated the \u201cContract Sum.\u201d Changes in the project were reflected by \u201cconstruction change directives\u201d (\u201cCCDs\u201d), and \u201cchange orders\u201d (\u201cCO\u201d). Appellant alleged that it complied with CCDs and CCs but did not receive a time extension or increase in the Contract Sum. Appellant alleged 20 specific instances in which SMCI breached the Contract and engaged in grossly negligent and intentional conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Appellant included counts for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, promissory estoppel/detrimental reliance, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment against SMCI. Appellant expressly alleged that all non-contract counts were pled as alternatives to the contract count. Appellant also included counts for quantum meruit and unjust enrichment against BRC. Appellant requested monetary damages, interest, costs, attorney\u2019s fees, and an extension of the completion date under the Contract through the date of actual substantial completion. The Contract, a CCD log, and pending COs were filed as exhibits to the complaint and incorporated therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The Agreement provides that SMCI serves in the capacity of \u201cowner\u201d of the project but recognizes that it is not the true owner, reciting that FSK/BRC is the owner and lessor and NIH is the lessee. The Agreement further provides that SMCI serves as the contractor, responsible for all construction services necessary to fulfill SMCI\u2019s obligations under the DMSA. Section 7.6.1 of the Supplement provides, in part: \u201cFor disputes involving NIH or Lessor [BRC], Contractor [SMCI] shall adhere to the dispute resolution provisions contained in the DMSA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Section 10.2 of the DMSA provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">10.2 <em>Disputes. </em>All claims, disputes or other matters in controversy between Lessor<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> and Development Manager<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> relating to or arising out of the performance of this Agreement and the Project (\u201cDisputes\u201d) and not resolved pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>ant to the ADR Procedures shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">(a) <em>Disputes Involving NIH. </em>Disputes for which Lessor or Development Manager contend that the NIH may be responsible (the \u201cGovernment Disputes\u201d) shall be resolved pursuant to the Disputes Clause, FAR [Federal Acquisition Regulations] \u00a7 52.233-1. Both Lessor and Development Manager agree to cooperate in the presentation and prosecution or defense of Government Disputes. If Development Manager requests an extension of time or additional compensation and alleges that the event causing the delay or additional compensation is the responsibility of the Government, then Lessor will cooperate with and assist Development Manager in timely presenting a request for an extension of time or additional compensation to the Government, including sponsoring a claim against the Government. Such assistance may include, with Lessor\u2019s consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and to the extent permitted by applicable law, permitting Development Manager to present and negotiate the proposal directly with NIH. In the event that the proposal for adjustment fails to result in a satisfactory resolution or Lessor does not consent to Development Manager\u2019s direct negotiation with NIH, Lessor shall sponsor a claim by Development Manager for the relief denied in the proposal for adjustment. Sponsoring a claim shall mean that Lessor shall permit Development Manager to bring a claim in Lessor\u2019s name, pursue it in Lessor\u2019s name through the full appeals process permitted by the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-613, and to the extent (in Lessor\u2019s sole discretion) such claim does not otherwise affect Lessor or Development Manager, Development Manager shall be solely responsible for presenting and directing the course of proceedings (including consideration of settlement). To the extent deemed possible by Lessor in its sole discretion, the proposals for adjustment and claims sponsored by Lessor for Development Manager shall be presented separately from any other claims presented to NIH by Lessor. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>event Lessor fails to cooperate with the Development Manager in presenting a claim to the Government, then Development Manager shall have the right to proceed with such claim against the Government in the name of the Lessor to the extent permitted by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-4\">3. Development Manager and Lessor agree to stay the prosecution of any claim, including without limitation any claim against the performance or payment bond, they may have relating to this Project and to waive the benefit of the continued running of any applicable statute of limitation during the period of such stay so long as the claim relates in whole or in part to a claim being asserted against the Government by Lessor and Lessor is presenting Development Manager\u2019s claim diligently and in good faith. Development Manager and Lessor agree to the issuance of a stay order by a court having jurisdiction to effectuate the intent of this subparagraph. If the Government is found to be at fault, Development Manager agrees to accept the monetary and temporal relief awarded for its claims in full satisfaction of those claims following appeal, or expiration of the time for appeal. Development Manager will cause all its subconsultant contracts to contain a provision binding its subconsultants to stay any claims and accept resolution of those claims in accordance with Section 10.2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">(b) <em>Disputes Not Involving NIH. </em>All disputes other than Government Disputes shall, after Section 10.1 ADR Procedures have been utilized and have failed to resolve the matter, be resolved in accordance with this Paragraph 10.2.2 (\u201cNon-Government Disputes\u201d). All Non-Government Disputes shall be resolved by litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Maryland. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with Non-Government Disputes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>On October 25, 2007, SMCI filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. SMCI contended that disputes, including those for which SMCI or BRC contend that NIH may be responsible, had to proceed as pass-through claims pursuant to the dispute resolution provisions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Contracts Disputes Act, and implementing regulations. Accordingly, according to SMCI, the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and/or venue. SMCI also contended that appellant failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because appellant failed to comply with the Contract\u2019s mandatory dispute resolution provisions; failed to exhaust administrative remedies under the Contract Disputes Act; failed to join NIH, a necessary party; failed to adhere to the Contract\u2019s forum selection; and finally, that the breach of fiduciary duty count and the quasi-contractual counts failed to contain legally cognizable causes of action. SMCI attached the DMSA, an affidavit by a vice president of SMCI, and various letters as exhibits to its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">On October 24, 2007, BRC filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. In essence, BRC made the same contentions as SMCI with respect to the dispute resolution provisions and also contended the quasi-contract claims were barred as a matter of law. BRC attached the DMSA, an amendment to the DMSA dated May 20, 2004, and an affidavit by the president of BRC as exhibits to its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Appellant filed an opposition to each motion and attached a supplemental affidavit and letters. SMCI filed a reply and attached a supplemental affidavit and letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">By order and memorandum opinion dated February 6, 2008, the court granted SMCI\u2019s motion and dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint without prejudice on the ground that the Contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Disputes Act preempted subject matter jurisdiction. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-4\">The contract between Skanska [appellant] and SMCI expressly incorporates the DMSA which provides that any dispute for which SMCI contends NIH may be responsible shall be resolved pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which requires that resolution of disputes under the CDA<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark> and with exclusive jurisdiction in the United States Court of Federal Claims or the relevant Federal agency Board of Contract Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">Therefore, under the plain language of the parties governing agreement, SMCI need only <em>contend </em>that NIH <em>may </em>be responsible to place this dispute within the purview of the CDA. Although the court finds that language overly broad, this court finds that \u00a7 10.2(a) of the DMSA nevertheless controls the issue associated with the extant motions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">This court does not find merit in Skanska\u2019s [appellant\u2019s] argument that a \u201ccertified\u201d claim must be submitted in order for the claim to be characterized as a \u201cgovernment dispute.\u201d If the parties intended to define a \u201cgovernment dispute\u201d as those for which a \u201ccertified\u201d claim has been submitted to NIH, the DMSA or other document would have expressly included that requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">Accordingly, this court finds that the CDA preempts subject matter jurisdiction in this court. In that context, the plain language of the DMSA compels a finding that SMCI\u2019s contention that NIH may be responsible is sufficient to find that subject matter jurisdiction does not properly vest in this court. As a result, SMCI\u2019s motion to dismiss is hereby granted without prejudice, and the parties are directed to proceed under the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-613, and its implementing regulations, Federal Acquisition Regulation \u00a7 52.233-1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">On February 25, 2008, appellant filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, reasserting its earlier position, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>emphasizing that, absent a revision in the court\u2019s opinion relating to the interpretation of the relevant documents, the action should be stayed and not dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">On March 14, 2008, the court granted BRC\u2019s motion and dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint as to it \u201c[f]or the reasons stated in this Court\u2019s opinion dated February 6, 2008 ...\u201d and also denied appellant\u2019s motion to alter or amend. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Ordinarily, when a motion to dismiss based on failure to state a claim is filed, and matters outside of the pleadings are attached to the motion and/or other pleadings in opposition to or in support of such a motion, the motion is converted to a motion for summary judgment. Maryland Rule 2-322(c). Nevertheless, with respect to failure to state a claim, it is clear that the circuit court based its ruling on the Contract and the DMSA, which were incorporated into the complaint, determined that they were unambiguous, and ruled as a matter of law. Thus, the court did not rely on matters outside of the complaint, and neither shall we. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 2 \u2014 303(d); <em>Samuels v. Tschechtelin, </em>135 Md.App. 483, 521, 763 A.2d 209 (2000) (documents incorporated by reference in a complaint are part of the complaint).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">As we recently stated in <em>Zimmer-Rubert v. Board of Education of Baltimore County, </em>179 Md.App. 589, 947 A.2d 135 (2008),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">in reviewing a motion to dismiss, \u2018we accept all well-pled facts in the complaint, and reasonable inferences drawn from them, in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u2019 <em>Converge Servs. Group, LLC v. Curran, </em>383 Md. 462, 475, 860 A.2d 871 (2004). We will only find that dismissal was proper \u2018if the alleged facts and permissible inferences, so viewed, would, if proven, nonetheless fail to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>afford relief to the plaintiff.\u2019 <em>Sprenger v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Maryland, </em>400 Md. 1, 21, 926 A.2d 238 (2007). Thus, our task is confined to determining whether the trial court was legally correct in its decision to dismiss. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atm\"><em>Zimmer-Rubert, </em>179 Md.App. at 593, 947 A.2d 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">\n<em>Appellant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Appellant contends that the court erred in concluding that a Government Dispute existed, within the meaning of the Contract. Appellant argues the mere contention by appellees that NIH may be responsible is insufficient, and in order to have a Government Dispute, SMCI and BRC had to present a certified claim to the NIH contracting officer. Appellant points out that it sought damages caused by <em>SMCI\u2019s </em>negligent and intentional conduct and breach of contract, itemizing approximately 20 specific instances. Appellant\u2019s position is that what is required to constitute a Government Dispute under the Contract is the same as that required to invoke jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act, i.e., the filing of a certified claim. Appellant also observes that if a mere contention that NIH may be liable is sufficient to constitute a Government Dispute, it would render meaningless the provisions in the Contract permitting appellant to sue SMCI in Maryland courts with respect to disputes between the parties herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">Appellant argues that this case is governed by \u00a7\u00a7 7.6.3 and 7.8.1 of the Supplement. Section 7.6.3 provides that SMCI shall be liable for its own gross negligence, intentional misconduct and material breach of contract. Section 7.8.1 of the Supplement provides that, except as set forth in \u00a7 7.6.1, disputes between appellant and SMCI shall be subject to mediation and, if necessary, litigation. In the event of litigation, the section further provides that appellant and SMCI consent to jurisdiction and venue in the courts of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">Second, appellant contends that, even if a Government Dispute existed, the court erred in concluding that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction because (1) the Contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Disputes Act does not extend to disputes between parties who do not have a contract with the federal government, and (2) parties cannot by contract change the scope of a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. Appellant argues that BRC is the contractor under the Contract Disputes Act and, thus, is the only party that can assert a viable claim against the NIH.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Third, in the alternative, appellant contends that the court erred in dismissing the complaint rather than staying the action pending the outcome under the federal procurement procedures, thus enabling the court to resolve any remaining claims. Appellant explains that neither the Board of Contract Appeals nor the Court of Federal Claims will resolve any disputes between the parties that are independent of NIH\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">As to BRC, appellant contends that the court erred by basing its decision on the Contract because BRC is not a party to the Contract. Thus, according to appellant, BRC is not entitled to the benefits or defenses of the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Lastly, appellant contends the court erred in denying its motion to alter or amend judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">\n<em>SMCI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">SMCI\u2019s position, in essence, is that the relevant documents are clear and unambiguous and because SMCI contends that NIH may be responsible for appellant\u2019s claims, the Government Dispute provisions apply. SMCI also observes that, in addition to the mere contention by SMCI that NIH may be liable for appellant\u2019s claims, the claims clearly fall within the realm of matters subject to NIH\u2019s control. SMCI points to the structure of the contractual arrangements, specifically the pass-through mechanism for handling government claims and the reasons for that mechanism. SMCI also points out, relying on several provisions in the documents, that NIH controlled all aspects of the design and construction of the project. Material changes were subject to NIH approval, including the contract price, consisting of costs plus SMCI\u2019s fee, any increase in the \u201cguaranteed Maximum Price\u201d (\u201cGAP\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>as defined in the Contract, and any changes in the project schedule, including dates of substantial and final completion. As to the provisions in the documents providing for judicial actions, i.e., DMSA, \u00a7 10.2(b), quoted above, SMCI argues that those provisions only apply to Government Disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Next, SMCI contends that, prior to this litigation and in reference to other matters involving this project, appellant (1) utilized the pass-through federal forum procedures, (2) after the circuit court\u2019s ruling in this case, filed a certified claim to begin the federal forum process with respect to the claims asserted in this litigation, and (3) took a position in pending federal litigation<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> with respect to the applicability of the federal forum process that is inconsistent with the position taken in this case. Thus, according to SMCI, appellant is estopped from asserting the non-applicability of dispute resolution provisions requiring the parties to proceed administratively, at least initially, in a federal forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">With respect to the remedy of dismissal, SMCI argues that appellant first requested a stay in its motion to alter or amend, and at oral argument in circuit court, expressly stated that it did not want a stay. SMCI points out that the court\u2019s ruling on the motion to alter or amend is reviewable on an abuse of discretion standard, and argues that the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">\n<em>BRC</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">BRC, observing that the claims against it are quasi-contractual in nature, contends that we can affirm for any lawful reason and that a subcontractor, such as appellant, cannot pursue quasi-contract claims against it because express contracts govern the relationships between the parties. Specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>cally, the Contract governs as between appellant and SMCI, and the DMSA governs as between SMCI and BRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In addition, BRC adopts the contentions made by SMCI \u25a0with respect to the existence of a Government Dispute and the requirement that it be pursued in a federal forum, pointing out provisions in the documents in addition to those relied on by SMCI, establishing the degree to which NIH controlled the project. BRC adds that it is a third party beneficiary of the Contract, primarily relying on a provision in Exhibit Q to the Agreement and, as third party beneficiary, is entitled to enforce the Contract. Exhibit Q is entitled \u201cConsent and Agreement of [appellant]\u201d and provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellant consents to the assignment by FSK to BRC of its interest in the Contract and acknowledges that FSK is a \u201cdirect third party beneficiary\u201d of the Contract.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Finally, BRC contends that, if this Court does not affirm the dismissal of the claims against BRC and, in addition, determines that the circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction, this Court should stay further proceedings pending the ultimate resolution of administrative proceedings in a federal forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">The Contract Disputes Act, enacted in 1978 and effective as to government contracts entered into in early 1979 and thereafter, applies to contracts entered into by federal agencies to procure goods and services, including construction services. 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 602. A contractor is defined as a party to such a contract, other than the government itself. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 601(4). All claims by a contractor relating to a contract must be in writing and must be submitted to the appropriate contracting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>officer for a decision. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 605(a). If the claim is for more than $100,000, the contractor must certify that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH_\">the claim is made in good faith, that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of his knowledge and belief, that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the contractor believes the government is liable, and that the certifier is duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf on the contractor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 605(c)(1). A contractor may appeal an adverse ruling by the contracting officer to the appropriate board of contract appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 606. Subject to exceptions that are not relevant here, a contractor may, in lieu of appealing the decision of the contracting officer to a board, bring an action in the United States Court of Federal Claims. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Appellant observes that the Contract Disputes Act governs claims by a contractor against the government, and appellant\u2019s claim is against another non-governmental contracting party. Thus, appellant concludes that the circuit court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction. We agree with that argument, but only to the extent that nongovernmental claims are involved, and conclude that the Contract binds appellant to first pursue the federal remedy, over which the circuit court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Maryland follows the objective law of contracts. When faced with an issue of contract interpretation, the first question is whether the contract is ambiguous. <em>County Comm\u2019rs for Carroll County v. Forty West Builders, </em>178 Md.App. 328, 376-377, 941 A.2d 1181 (2008). That question is one of law. <em>Id. </em>If unambiguous, the court simply interprets the contract. <em>Id. </em>Words must be read in context. <em>Atlantic Contracting &amp; Material Co. v. Ulico Cas. Co., </em>380 Md. 285, 301, 844 A.2d 460 (2004). If ambiguous, extrinsic evidence may be introduced to determine the intention of the parties. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Our reading of the contract documents lead us to the conclusion that, with respect to the issues before us, the documents are clear and unambiguous and require appellant to pursue remedies under the Contract Disputes Act prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>litigation in State court. We base this conclusion on the plain language, considering the documents as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Article 7 of the Supplement addresses \u201cchanges, claims and disputes.\u201d The Article indicates that changes in the work are reflected in \u201cchange orders\u201d and \u201cconstruction change directives,\u201d approved as required by the Contract. Changes initiated by appellant must be in accordance with subparagraph 7.3 of the Supplement and require a notice followed by a proposal. Subparagraph 7.5 and its subsections address changes in the GMP and project timeline. According to the Supplement, subparagraph 7.3.1, the procedures are mandatory and prohibit appellant from suing SMCI if appellant \u201chas not adhered to the requirements contained in this Article 7.\u201d Pursuant to the Supplement, subparagraph 7.6, if appellant has a claim arising from the delay, act or omission of a party other than appellant or SMCI, appellant is entitled to relief from SMCI only to the extent SMCI is able to recover relief from the third party. Under that same subparagraph, NIH is expressly considered a third party. The Supplement, subparagraph 7.6.1, provides that \u201c[f]or disputes involving NIH or [BRC],\u201d appellant \u201cshall adhere to the dispute resolution provisions\u201d contained in the DMSA. According to subparagraph 7.8.1, except as set forth in subparagraph 7.6.1, disputes between appellant and SMCI shall be subject to mediation and, if necessary, litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The DMSA, Article X, incorporated into the Contract, expressly provides a mechanism for the resolution of disputes. Subparagraph 10.1 sets forth mediation procedures. Subparagraph 10.2, quoted above, provides that disputes arising out of the Contract and not resolved by mediation shall be resolved in accordance with the subparagraph. Subparagraph 10.2(a) governs disputes involving NIH (\u201cGovernment Disputes\u201d), and subparagraph 10.2(b) governs disputes not involving NIH (\u201cNon-Government Disputes\u201d). Under subparagraph 10.2(a), Government Disputes are those for which BRC or SMCI \u201ccontend that the NIH may be responsible.... \u201d Government Disputes shall be resolved pursuant to the Disputes Clause, FAR \u00a7 52.233-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>NIH is not a party to the Contract, which is between appellant and SMCI, and not a party to the DMSA, which is between BRC and SMCI. Recognizing the legal difficulty resulting from the lack of contractual privity between a subcontractor and a federal agency, and the probable inability to bring a direct action against the agency under the Contract Disputes Act, the relevant documents contain pass-through or sponsorship provisions. Pursuant to Supplement, subparagraph 7.6.1, the claimant, appellant in the case before us, certifies a claim and submits it to SMCI. Pursuant to the same provision, SMCI sponsors the claim and submits it to BRC, and pursuant to DMSA, subparagraph 10.2(a), BRC sponsors the claim and submits it to NIH. Pursuant to DMSA, subparagraph 10.2, the parties agreed to cooperate in the presentation of Government Disputes, with BRC being the ultimate presenter. Because of problems associated with lack of privity and preemption by the Contract Disputes Act, the pass-through procedure is commonly utilized when federal government procurement contracts are involved. <em>See, e.g., Eastern Inc. v. Shelly\u2019s of Delaware, Inc., </em>721 F.Supp. 649, 651-652 (D.N.J.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">The first question is whether the claims come within the Government Dispute provisions. The parties, in their briefs, discuss the ability of parties to agree to alternative dispute resolution procedures and to agree to an appropriate forum. That is really not the issue, however. The parties do not dispute how Government Disputes and non-government disputes are to be handled. They disagree as to whether this is a Government Dispute and the procedure to be employed, given that disagreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">First, under the plain language of the Contract, the claims come within the Government Dispute provisions because appellees asserted below that NIH may be responsible for the claims. Because there is no contention to the contrary, we assume that all of the parties before us are proceeding in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Second, consistent with appellees\u2019 contention that NIH maybe responsible, we note that all of appellant\u2019s allegations relate to an increase in the Contract Sum and an extension of the project schedule, matters subject to control and approval by NIH. In its complaint, appellant seeks compensation under the terms of the Contract and an extension of time under the Contract, matters generally subject to NIH\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Ultimately, it may be determined that NIH is not responsible, in whole or in part, and that, due to its own conduct, SMCI is responsible for some of all of the claimed compensation and for appellant\u2019s need for an extension of time. Nevertheless, under the relevant documents, wherein appellant agreed to a dispute resolution procedure, that procedure must be employed in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The second question is whether Maryland courts have subject matter jurisdiction. Maryland courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction and cannot adjudicate whether some, none, or all of the claims are claims for which NIH is responsible. That has to be adjudicated in a federal forum. Maryland courts do have jurisdiction over a dispute between private parties such as the parties herein, and Maryland courts can enforce their contractual undertakings, including an agreement as to remedies. Generally, unless otherwise unlawful, parties are free to contract as to their remedies in the event of a breach, <em>James Julian, Inc., v. State Highway Administration, </em>63 Md.App. 74, 76, 492 A.2d 308 (1985), including the sequencing of remedies. <em>Id., passim. See Seal &amp; Company, Incorporated v. AS. McGaughan Company, </em>907 F.2d 450, 454-455 (4th Cir.1990); <em>Norment Security Group, Inc. v. Travelers Casualty and Insurance Company, </em>505 F.Supp.2d 97, 105 (D.D.C.2007). There is nothing in the Contract relating to the procedure to be employed that is unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Appellant relies heavily on <em>Riley Electric Co. v. American District Telegraph Co., </em>715 F.Supp. 813 (W.D.Ky.1989). That case, and other similar cases, are not on point, however. <em>Riley </em>involved a federal procurement contract. The subcon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>tract in question provided that a claim by the subcontractor against the contractor would be submitted to the federal agency contracting officer for resolution. The court did not enforce that provision, concluding that, in enacting the Contract Disputes Act, Congress did not intend agency contracting officers to decide non-governmental disputes between contractors. In other words, the court regarded the dispute as a non-governmental dispute. As we have seen, the parties in this case clearly understood and differentiated between governmental and non-governmental disputes. There is no contention in this case that a federal agency contracting officer should decide private disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">Because of our inability to determine the extent of liability of NIH, the underlying question before us is one of priority of remedy, i.e., must appellant proceed in the federal forum before it can proceed in the State forum. We have already determined how the parties answered that question. Looking at the Contract in context, the parties\u2019 agreement is reasonable. We appreciate that appellant may not be privy to what has transpired between SMCI, BRC, and NIH but it obviously has knowledge of the nature and extent of its claims, if not the identity of the responsible party. It can, therefore, certify its claims, and SMCI and BRC have an obligation to cooperate in the development and presentation of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The relationships of the participants in the project are pass-through relationships from subcontractors of appellant to SMCI to BRC to NIH. Pursuing claims against the government first is more likely to produce a just result because the extent of liability of the ultimate responsible party will be known. Such claims can only be pursued in a federal forum-not Maryland courts. If this case proceeds now, the government\u2019s liability is unknown and not susceptible to determination in this case. It would be very difficult, without knowing or being able to determine the government\u2019s position, the nature and extent of SMCI\u2019s liability. By proceeding in the federal forum first, if and when State proceedings are necessary, the degree to which the government is liable will be known, and the liability for any remaining claims can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>determined. At the very least, the federal proceedings will clarify the issues between the parties herein. This sequencing, to which the parties agreed, is least likely to produce inconsistent results.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Our inability to determine the extent of liability of NIH was anticipated by the parties. Consistent with the clear agreement of the parties, we shall direct the circuit court to stay further proceedings on the merits pending a final determination in a federal forum. The agreement to stay appears in subparagraph 10.2(a)3., and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">[SMCI] and [BRC] agree to stay the prosecution of any claim ... they may have relating to this Project ... so long as the claim relates in whole or in part to a claim being asserted against the Government by [BRC] and [BRC] is presenting [SMCI\u2019s] claim diligently and in good faith____ [SMCI] will cause all its subconsultant contracts to contain a provision binding its subconsultants to stay any claims and accept resolution of those claims in accordance with Section 10.2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">With respect to a stay of this action, we do not read the transcript of the hearing in circuit court in the same manner as SMCI. The question of staying the action was discussed. Clearly, appellant wanted the action to proceed and did not want it either dismissed or stayed, but just as clearly, appellant never stated that the case should be dismissed if not permitted to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">On January 28, 2009, appellees filed a motion requesting leave to correct and supplement the record with a stipulation signed by all parties. The stipulation provides that (1) on October 28, 2008, appellant submitted a certified claim to SMCI, (2) on December 11, 2008, SMCI certified appellant\u2019s claim to BRC, and (3) on January 12, 2009, BRC certified appellant\u2019s claim to NIH. We shall grant the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">CONSENT MOTION FOR CORRECTION OF RECORD GRANTED. JUDGMENTS REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY WITH THE DIRECTION TO ENTER AN ORDER <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>STAYING FURTHER PROCEEDINGS ON THE MERITS PENDING COMPLETION OF PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE CONTRACT DISPUTES ACT.

In circuit court, SMCI asserted that venue was improper in Baltimore City, even for claims, if any, not governed by the Contract Disputes Act.

As discussed more fully below, the pass-through (or sponsorship) claims procedure in the Contract is commonly used to avoid the defense of lack of contractual privity between a government agency and a subcontractor and because the Contract Disputes Act prohibits, or may prohibit, a direct action against the government by the subcontractor. The question whether the Contracts Disputes Act prohibits all direct actions by a subcontractor against the government is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[6]\">\n<p id=\"b713-9\">6.
