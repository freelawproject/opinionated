At the request of the appellees (who will be identified infra.), the Circuit Court for Cecil County, on November 2, 2007, granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting Governor O\u2019Malley and the State of Maryland from enforcing or carrying out the terms of the executive order. Governor O\u2019Malley and the State filed a timely appeal along with a motion for a stay of the injunction. Because the circuit court did not act on the motion for a stay in a timely manner, the appellants sought a stay in this court. We granted that stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">The Executive Order here at issue concerns Maryland\u2019s Purchase of Care Program (\u201cPOC Program\u201d). The POC Program is designed to allow the State to give financial support to working families in Maryland who have child care expenses. The POC Program is administered by the local departments of social services. COMAR 13A.14.06.06 A-B 11 H. All participation is voluntary. Once a child care center or family child care provider elects to participate in the program, it must abide by the rules and regulations of the program, which are determined by the Maryland State Department of Education. These rules and regulations establish a reimbursement rate. That rate is set according to the family\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>income, the family size, and the geographic area of the state. <em>See </em>COMAR 13A.14.06.03. The POC Program regulations also establish the terms and conditions of reimbursement. For example, a provider is only paid for a fixed number of vacation days and for a prescribed number of days after a family gives notice that it is leaving the child care center or family child care provider. COMAR 13A.14.06.11H.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The POC Program regulations set a \u201cco-pay\u201d for each family, based upon the family\u2019s size and income level. If, however, the child care center or the family child care provider charges more than the reimbursement rate plus the co-pay established by the State, it is allowed to charge the parents that additional amount. Thus, the relationship between the family child care provider and the State is essentially a contractual relationship, in that the provider may choose to accept (or reject) the terms and conditions that are set by the State. Likewise, the relationship between the family child care provider who elects to participate in the POC Program and the parents is essentially contractual in nature. The family uses the POC Program voucher as a partial payment for the family\u2019s child care expense, and the family child care provider accepts that voucher, subject to the rules and regulations of the POC Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">In addition to providing funding for the children of working parents in licensed child care centers and with licensed family child care providers, the POC Program also provides funding for what is called \u201cinformal care,\u201d i.e., care provided by relatives of the children for whom care is given. These \u201cinformal care\u201d providers are generally not required to be licensed by the State, so long as they are only caring for children who are their relatives. \u201cInformal care\u201d providers are reimbursed at a much lower rate than family child care providers. <em>See </em>COMAR 13A.14.06.06.C and 11A-G.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">The Executive Order</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">The Executive Order here at issue reads in material part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>A. The State shall recognize a provider organization designated by a majority of the registered and registration exempt family child care providers who participate in the State\u2019s Child Care Subsidy Program known as the [POC], voting in a mail ballot election, as the representative of the POC providers in the State. A provider organization may petition for certification by submitting a petition for representation to the official or officials designated by the Governor to administer this Order. The petition must be accompanied by a showing of interest supported by 30 percent of the providers in the appropriate unit indicating their desire to be represented by the petitioner for the purpose of collective bargaining ... Any interested organization that wishes to intervene must submit a petition of intervention which must be accompanied by a showing of interest supported by 10 percent of the providers in the appropriate bargaining unit indicating their desire to be exclusively represented by the intervener for the purpose of collective bargaining, which petition must be filed within 15 days of notice of the pending election petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">B. Certification of a provider majority bargaining representative shall continue so long as such organization satisfies the criteria of this Order and subsequent guidelines applicable to certification. A petition to decertify an existing majority bargaining representative may be filed in the same manner as a petition for certification, as provided in Section A of this Order, except that no \u25a0 decertification petition may be filed for any bargaining unit if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">1) A majority bargaining representative for that bargaining unit has been certified within the preceding 2 years; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">2) The bargaining unit has in effect a valid memorandum of understanding that, by its terms, does not exceed 8 years in duration; provided that the limitation imposed by this paragraph shall not bar the filing of a decertification petition within the 80-day period immediately preceding the expiration of such memorandum of understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>C. The State, through the Governor, shall designate appropriate representatives to meet and confer with the provider representative concerning the terms and conditions of the participation of family child care providers in the POC Program, including reimbursement rates under the POC Program, payment procedures, and benefits. Any agreement reached shall be reduced to writing. If any of the provisions of the agreement require legislative action, the parties will jointly seek the enactment of such legislation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">D. Nothing in this Order shall in any way diminish or infringe on any rights, responsibilities, power or duties conferred by the Constitution of the State of Maryland and the Annotated Code of Maryland. The designation of representatives by the Department under this Order does not prevent the designated provider organization or any other organization or individual from communicating with any State official on matters of interest, including appearing before or making proposals to the Department at a public meeting or hearing or at any other Department forum. This Order does not mandate participation by any child care provider.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">After issuance of the Order quoted above, only one candidate, the Service Employees International Union (\u201cSEIU\u201d), through its affiliate Kids First Maryland, SEIU Local 500, petitioned to be certified as the negotiating representative of POC providers. On August 20, 2007, SEIU Local 500 supplied the requisite documentation of support (at least 30% of all POC providers), whereupon the Secretary of the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulations (\u201cDLLR\u201d) notified the MSFCCA (Maryland State Family Child Care Association) and other provider organizations of SEIU\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No other organization sought to intervene in the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Beginning on September 7, 2007, DLLR administered an election to designate a certified bargaining representative for POC providers. The election was held at the expense of the SEIU and was overseen by the American Arbitration Association. Votes were due on September 24, 2007. Immediately after the election the American Arbitration Association certified to the Secretary of DLLR that SEIU had received 1,357 votes out of 1,694 cast. The SEIU local was therefore selected as the certified, non-exclusive representative of POC providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Meanwhile, on September 20, 2007, the MSFCCA filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Cecil County to prevent the designation of a rival labor organization as the representative of POC providers under the Executive Order. The MSFCCA was joined as a plaintiff in the complaint by nine of its members, along with Delegate Michael D. Smigiel, Sr. and Senator Allan H. Kittleman, two members of the Maryland General Assembly. The plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d), a preliminary injunction against implementation of the Executive Order, as well as a judgment declaring that the Executive Order was \u201cvoid <em>ab initio </em>and unenforceable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The Circuit Court for Cecil County held a hearing on October 4 and 5, 2007, concerning the issue of whether a preliminary injunction should be granted. At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court took the matter under advisement and, on November 2, 2007, granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction prohibiting the enforcement of the Executive Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The circuit court found that the Executive Order constituted a regulation as defined in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). <em>See </em>Md.Code (2004 Repl.Vol.), sections 10-101 <em>et. seq. </em>of the State Government Article. Relying on <em>Delmarva Power &amp; Light Comp. v. Public Service Comm., </em>370 Md. 1, 803 A.2d 460 (2002), the circuit court opined that the Executive Order at issue was invalid and should have \u201cno force or effect\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>because it had not been enacted in compliance with the APA. The court concluded its written opinion with these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">This court has been called upon to grant or not grant a preliminary injunction in this matter pending a trial on a complaint for declaratory judgment. For the reasons already stated it appears that the plaintiffs would have a real probability of prevailing in such an action. It would also appear that since [the plaintiffs] would prevail, the Executive Order at issue would be void <em>ab initio. </em>In weighing the likely injuries to the parties it appears that no injury would occur to the defendants by granting the injunction. If the court\u2019s findings in this case are overturned on appeal or simply not followed by the declaratory judgment court, the process set out in the Executive Order could begin anew with elections held and an exclusive bargaining representative concerning procedures and policies would most likely be void and their having already been wrongly implemented could adversely affect some of the POC providers not in agreement with those procedures and/or policies. POC providers adversely affected by such wrongly implemented policies and procedures or those whose voices were not heard due to the implementation of the Executive Order could suffer irreversible economic injury. Additionally, an injury can almost be presumed if an agency of the state is operating on an Executive Order which is of no force or effect but with which POC providers are expected to comply-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">This in no way implies that the stated objective of the Executive Order is \u201cwrongful.\u201d On its face it appears to be a very rational, logical approach to deal with the POC providers scattered all over the state and something with which either the executive or legislative branch, or both, should be concerned. The \u201cwrongfulness\u201d simply applies to the method by which implementation was attempted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">Finally, the public interest is best served when representatives and agencies of the state are operating under lawful orders and by lawful means. The public interest is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>served when a state agency or unit operates, at least in part, pursuant to an invalid rule or order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The circuit court, in a footnote to its opinion and order, provided the following comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">What really seems to be of concern is the following. Plaintiff MSFCCA views this Executive Order as a way for those in the executive branch to require representation by the [SEIU], thereby seriously weakening the power of [the MSFCCA] in representing its members. Testimony was also presented which indicated the SEIU and AFSCME (American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees) had divided up the states for representation in these types of matters with SEIU having Maryland. Plaintiff MSFCCA believes that there will be a negative effect in the short and long run that as members of the SEIU they will have to pay union dues, will have to compete internally with relative providers receiving payment vouchers, and will have to have the issue of medical insurance to providers adequately handled. They believe that their voice will not be heard and/or considered by the executive branch. <em>In many ways this seems to really be a battle between the plaintiff MSFCCA and the SEIU, i.e., between two unions OR, between two organizations OR, between one union and one organization, however, one cares to categorize these units.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">As phrased by the Governor, the question raised in this appeal is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">Did the circuit court err when it issued a preliminary injunction barring the Governor from implementing his preferred mechanism for selecting a non-exclusive negotiating partner, where the record did not reveal any legally cognizable injury to Appellees as a result of the challenged Executive Order, the Executive Order is within the Governor\u2019s constitutional and statutory authority, and the Executive Order furthers both important governmental interests and the public interest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>We shall answer that question in the affirmative and reverse the circuit court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The appellees in this case are the MSFCCA, nine of its members, Delegate Michael Smigiel, Sr. and Senator Allan Kittleman. The appellants are Governor Martin O\u2019Malley and the State of Maryland. Seiu, as an <em>amicus curiae, </em>has filed a brief in support of appellants\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">In order to preliminarily enjoin the Governor\u2019s chosen approach to obtain the input of child care providers concerning the POC Program, it was necessary to find that the plaintiffs met four requirements: 1) plaintiffs had a \u201creal probability of prevailing on the merits, not merely a remote possibility of doing so\u201d; 2) lesser injury would be done to the Governor by granting the injunction than would result to plaintiffs by denying it; 3) that plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction was granted; and 4) that the public interest favored an injunction. <em>Fogle v. H &amp; G Rest., Inc., </em>337 Md. 441, 455-56, 654 A.2d 449 (1995). The burden of proving facts sufficient to satisfy each of those factors rested on the plaintiffs, and the \u201cfailure to prove the existence of even one of the four factors will preclude the grant of preliminary [injunctive] relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 456, 654 A.2d 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Likelihood of Success</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">The circuit court, as mentioned <em>supra, </em>ruled that the appellees had a \u201creal probability\u201d of obtaining a permanent injunction because, in the court\u2019s view, the executive order issued by the Governor constituted a \u201cregulation\u201d within the meaning of the APA, yet the Governor had not complied with the requirements of the APA. The APA\u2019s definition of a regulation is set forth in S.G. section 10-101(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">Section 10-101(g) reads: (1) \u201cRegulation\u201d means a statement or an amendment or repeal of a statement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>(1) has general application;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">(ii) has future effect;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">(iii) <em>is adopted by a unit to:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">1. detail or carry out a law that the unit administers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">2. govern organization of the unit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">3. govern the procedure of the unit; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">4. <em>govern practice before the unit; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">(iv) is in any form, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">1. a guideline;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">2. a rule;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-13\">3. a standard;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-14\">4. a statement of interpretation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-15\">5. a statement of policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-16\">(2) \u201cRegulation\u201d does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-17\">(i) a statement that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-18\">1. concerns only internal management of the unit; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-19\">2. does not affect directly the rights of the public or the procedures available to the public;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-20\">(ii) a response of the unit to a petition for adoption of a regulation, under \u00a7 10-123 if this subtitle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-21\">(iii) a declaratory ruling of the unit as to a regulation, order, or statute, under Subtitle 3 of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-22\">(3) \u201cRegulation\u201d, as used in \u00a7\u00a7 10-110 and 10-111.1, means all or any portion of a regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-23\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-24\">Important for our purposes is the part of the above definition that states that to be a regulation within the meaning of the APA, the statement must be \u201cadopted by a unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-25\">Appellants contend that the executive order was not \u201cadopted by a unit\u201d and therefore it was not 1) a \u201cregulation\u201d and 2) because it was not a regulation, the Governor did not have to abide by the rule-making requirements of the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-26\">Section 10 \u2014 101(i) of the State Government Article provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>(i) <em>Unit </em>\u2014 \u201cUnit\u201d means an officer or unit authorized by law to adopt regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The parts of the APA dealing with rule-making are set forth in S.G. (2004 RepLVol.), sections 10-101-189 (hereinafter \u201csubtitle 1\u201d). Section 10-102 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, this subtitle applies to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">(1) each unit <em>in the Executive Branch </em>of the State government; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">(2) each unit that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">(i) is created by public general law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">(ii) operates in at least 2 counties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">(b) <em>Exclusions. </em>\u2014 This subtitle does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\">(1) a unit in the Legislative Branch of the State government;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-13\">(2) a unit in the Judicial Branch of the State government;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-14\">(3) the Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-15\">(4) a board of license commissioners; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-16\">(5) the Rural Maryland Council.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-17\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-18\">Appellees contend that the sections of the APA that deal with rule-making (S.G. \u00a7 \u00a7 10-101-139) all apply to the Governor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If appellees are right, then several significant conditions and requirements would have had to be met before Executive Order 01.01.2007.14 could become effective.

The <em>agency </em>must publish the proposed regulation in the Maryland Register and may adopt the regulation 45 days later. \u00a7 10-111(a)(1). For 30 out of the 45 days, the <em>agency </em>must accept public comment on the proposed regulation. \u00a7 10-111(a)(3). The AELR Committee may delay adoption of the regulation to allow more time for review. \u00a7 10-lll(a)(2)(i). The AELR Committee considers whether the regulation is in conformity with the statutory authority of the <em>agency </em>and the legislative intent of the statute under which the regulation is promulgated. \u00a7 10-lll.l(b). If the AELR Committee votes to oppose adoption of the regulation, the <em>agency </em>may withdraw or modify the regulation, or submit it to the Governor for approval. \u00a7 10-lll.l(c)(2).

That statute was designed to ensure that \u201ccertain basic principles of common sense, justice and fairness,\u201d including notice to interested parties, are applied in administrative procedures, <em>id., </em>\u201cwithout unduly restricting the agencies in the performance of their various tasks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8; <em>see also </em>Maryland Code (1995 Repl.Vol., 1995 Supp.) \u00a7 10-201 of the State Government Article (declaration of policy); Commission to Revise the Administrative Procedure Act, Initial Report on Subtitles 2 and 4 of the APA 2 (1992).

The Governor is not authorized by law to issue regulations as defined in section 10 \u2014 101(g) regarding the POC Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">As the appellees point out, there are sections of the Maryland Code that state that the Governor is allowed to issue \u201cregulations\u201d under certain limited circumstances. The \u201cregulation\u201d to which appellees direct our attention appears in the Public Safety Article of the Maryland Code. Those sections are: Section 13-211(a)(1) and (2) (the Governor may adopt regulations concerning issuance of service medals of appropriate designs to officers and enlisted individuals in the organized militia who have completed 5 years or more of continuance service); Section 13-213(a) (\u201cThe Governor may adopt regulations that provide for the retirement of officers and enlisted individuals\u201d in the State militia); Section 13-502(a)(l) (\u201cthe Governor may adopt regulations to carry out this Title govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>ing the enlistment, organization, administration, equipment, maintenance, training, and discipline of the Maryland Defense Force\u201d). Although referred to as \u201cregulations\u201d in the Public Safety Article, the \u201cregulations\u201d to which appellees refer are not \u201cregulations\u201d as defined in subtitle 1 of the APA. As noted earlier, the APA defines regulations so as not to include statements that concern only internal management of the unit that do not affect directly the rights of the public or procedure available to the public. <em>See </em>SG, \u00a7 10 \u2014 101(g)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The legislative history of the APA gives no indication that the rule-making sections of the APA were intended to apply to the Governor, as opposed to agencies under his or her control. <em>See Chimes, </em>343 Md. 336, 681 A.2d 484 (1996). And, as will be demonstrated, when other sections of subtitle 1 of the APA are read in tandem with the pertinent definition section (section 10-101(g) and (i)), of the APA, it becomes clear that subtitle 1 of the APA does not apply to the Governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Although there are other procedural steps necessary to pass a rule under the APA, some of the most important ones are set forth in SG \u00a7 10-111.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">That section, as well as section 10-111 of the State Government Article, deal with the relationship between the \u201cPromulgating unit\u201d and the Joint Committee on Administrative, Executive and Legislative Review (\u201cthe Committee\u201d), which is made up of members of the Maryland House of Delegates and the Senate.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u00a7 10-111.1.

Read literally, this would mean that the Governor would have to send a letter to himself justifying his actions. Then the Governor would be required to either consult with the Committee or send himself a letter instructing himself to either withdraw or modify the regulation. Alternatively, the Governor could approve the adoption of his own regulation. This would all amount to a total waste of time and effort because no Governor would disapprove a regulation he (or she) proposed. Such a reading of the statute would produce an absurd result that must be avoided. <em>Chesapeake Charter, Inc. v. Anne Arundel County Bd. of Educ., </em>358 Md. 129, 135, 747 A.2d 625 (2000). In short, the language of section 10-111.1 shows that the \u201cPromulgating unit\u201d and the \u201cGovernor\u201d can never be one and the same. This strongly suggests that the legislature did not intend the Governor to be covered by subtitle 1 of the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Other sections of subtitle 1 of the APA likewise indicate that the rule-making sections of the APA were not intended to cover the Governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Section 10-133 of the State Government Article reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVx\">Executive Order for review and evaluation of regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">(a) <em>Duty of Governor to issue. </em>\u2014 Based on the schedules submitted by the adopting authorities under \u00a7 10-132.1 of this subtitle, the Governor shall, by an Executive Order consistent with this part, provide <em>for the review and evaluation of the regulations of each unit in accordance with this part.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">(b) <em>Review and evaluation every 8 years. </em>\u2014 The Executive Order shall provide that a <em>review and evaluation of the regulations of all units be undertaken every 8 years, </em>begin-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>rung on July 1, 1995 and is repeated during each 8-year period thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">(c) <em>Scheduling of evaluations. </em>\u2014 The Executive Order under subsection (b) of this section shall schedule the evaluations in such a manner that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">(1) a deadline is established for each unit to complete its evaluation;

Once again, this would make no sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>SG Art. Sec. 3-403 allows the Governor to set the effective date of his executive orders. SG Art. Sec. 10-117 sets the effective date of regulations at 10 days after notice of its adoption is published. These provisions would clash if an executive order had to be adopted as a regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">For all the above reasons, we hold that within the meaning of subtitle 1 of .the APA, the Governor is not a \u201cunit.\u201d Therefore, any statement contained in his Executive Order is not a regulation, because it was not a statement \u201cadopted by a unit.\u201d <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 10-101(g)(l)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Because we hold that subtitle 1 of the APA does not apply to the Governor, we conclude that the circuit court erred when it opined that the Executive Order was void because it was not issued in compliance with the requirements of the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Appellees claim that even if the Governor did not have to follow the dictates of the APA, the Executive Order was nevertheless defective because it has no foundation in the Maryland Constitution or in any statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">SG \u00a7\u00a7 3-401-06 authorizes the Governor to issue Executive Orders under certain circumstances. An Executive Order is defined in SG \u00a7 3-401. as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">In this subtitle, \u201cExecutive Order\u201d means an order or an amendment or rescission of an order that, over the signature of the Governor:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">(1) proclaims or ends a state of emergency or exercises the authority of the Governor during an emergency, under Title 14, Subtitle 3 of the Public Safety Article or any other provision of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-12\">(2) adopts guidelines, rules of conduct, or rules of procedure for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-13\">(i) State employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-14\">(ii) units of the State government; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-15\">(iii) persons who are under the jurisdiction of those employees or units or who deal with them;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>(3) establishes a unit, including an advisory unit, study unit, or task force; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\">(4) changes the organization of the Executive Branch of the State government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Section 3-302 of the State Government article provides: \u201cThe Governor is the head of the Executive Branch of the State government and, except as otherwise provided by law, shall supervise and direct the officers and units in that Branch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">When the Governor issued Executive Order 01.01.2007.14, he said in the \u201cpromulgation clause\u201d that the Order was issued \u201cby virtue of the authority vested in [the Governor] by the Constitution and laws of Maryland.\u201d <em>See Dept. of Public Safety and Correctional Services v. Beard, </em>142 Md.App. 283, 297, 790 A.2d 57 (2002) (upholding the constitutional authority of the Governor to issue an Executive Order based on language in the promulgation clause coupled with the broad constitutional mandate granted to the Governor); <em>see also Lomax v. Warden, Maryland Correctional Training Center, </em>120 Md.App. 314, 333 n. 8, 707 A.2d 395 (1998) (Executive Orders promulgated pursuant to Art. II, section 24 of the Maryland Constitution have the \u201cforce of law\u201d) (citing 64 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 180 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The Executive Order here at issue fits squarely within the ambit of SG \u00a7 3-401(2)(i) and (iii). The Order provides guidelines for State employees (\u00a7 3-401(2)\u00a9) in that it directs that any agreement reached between the Governor\u2019s designees and the representative of the designated provider organization be in writing. The Executive Order also \u201cadopts ... rules of procedure\u201d for persons \u201cwho deal with\u201d State employees. SG, \u00a7 3-401(2)(iii). POC providers \u201cdeal with\u201d the Office of Child Care when they are paid and are regulated under the POC program. <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 3-401(2)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">POC providers are subject to State rules addressing matters including: who may provide care (COMAR 13A.14.06.06C), where the care may be provided (COMAR 13A.14.06.06C), the rate of compensation for child care (CO-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>MAR 13A.14.06.06C and 11A-G), what days are paid for (COMAR 13A.14.06.11H(9)-(12)), the method for transmitting payments (COMAR 13A.14.06.06E, .11H(1), and .111), the number of children who may be cared for by a given provider (COMAR 13A.14.06.06C), and what a POC provider must submit in order to be paid under the program (COMAR 13A.14.06.06D(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">When an Executive Order is issued, the Governor (and others) are required to meet procedural requirements far less onerous than those set forth in the APA. Insofar as Executive Orders are concerned, the major requirements set forth in the State Government Article are that: 1) the Governor deliver to the Secretary of State and to the State Archives a certified copy of the Executive Order (\u00a7 3-404); 2) the Secretary of State in turn must deliver to the Administrator of the Division of State Documents and to the Department of Legislative Services two copies of the Executive Order (\u00a7 3-405); and 3) the Executive Order must be published in the Code of Public General Laws (\u00a7 3-406). But an Executive Order, unlike a regulation issued pursuant to subtitle 1 of the APA, does not have to undergo the often lengthy review process by the Joint Committee on Administration, Executive and Legislative review.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Appellees contend that by creating both a \u201cbargaining unit\u201d of private family child care providers and a procedure by which the \u201cbargaining unit\u201d chooses a single representative, the Executive Order \u201cgoes well beyond the areas of narrowly protected Gubernatorial activity\u201d that other cases have allowed. Based on <em>McCulloch v. Glendening, </em>347 Md. 272, 701 A.2d 99 (1997), we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">In <em>McCulloch, </em>the issue presented was whether the Governor had the authority (constitutional or statutory) to issue Executive Order No. 01.01.1996.13 (entitled \u201cProcedures for Labor-Management Relations in the Executive Branch of State Government\u201d). About seven years later, in <em>Ehrlich v. State Employees Union, </em>382 Md. 597, 599-600, 856 A.2d 669 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>(2004), the court summarized the pertinent facts in <em>McCulloch </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">That Executive Order recognized the right of the Executive Branch employees to form or join employee organizations, bargain collectively, and engage in other concerted activities and, in furtherance of those rights, provided for the creation of appropriate bargaining units and the election and certification of exclusive bargaining representatives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">The only substantive provision regarding actual collective bargaining was in the section that defined the term \u201ccollective bargaining.\u201d That provision required the \u201cemployer\u201d and the employee exclusive bargaining organization to negotiate in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. It stated further that, upon completion of negotiations, the parties \u201cshall execute a written memorandum of understanding incorporating the terms of any agreement reached, and, to the extent they require legislative approval or the appropriation of funds, such terms shall be recommended to the Legislature for approval or the appropriation of funds, as may be necessary.\u201d The term \u201cemployer\u201d was not defined in the Executive Order. The order stated that the exclusive bargaining representative were entitled to meet and negotiate with the Governor or the Governor\u2019s designee in an effort to reach an agreement subject to the Governor\u2019s approval, and it enjoined \u201cmanagerial and supervisory employees\u201d from refusing to bargain collectively with the exclusive bargaining representatives. It did not, however, specify who, in particular was to sign any MOU [Memorandum of Understanding] on behalf of the State or any State agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In <em>McCulloch, </em>the validity of the Executive Order was challenged on several grounds, one of which was that there existed no legislative authorization for it. This challenge was rejected. 347 Md. at 287, 701 A.2d 99. The <em>McCulloch </em>Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8M\">In this case, as we did in <em>[Maryland Classified Employees Ass\u2019n v.] Schaefer, </em>[325 Md. 19 (1991) ] we agree with the trial court that \u201cExecutive Order .01.01.1996.13 meets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Maryland constitutional and statutory requirements and is not in violation of the separation of powers.\u201d The Governor\u2019s broad authority, under Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights as well as sections <em>3-302 </em>and 3-401 of the State Government Article, to issue Executive Orders <em>for the guidance and direction of units and employees of .the Executive Branch necessarily permits the promulgation </em>of an Executive Order authorizing the limited collective-bargaining rights for Executive Branch employees contained in the subject Order. This act is an exercise of executive function, not a usurpation of legislative function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Part of the Executive Order at issue in this case, like the one at issue in <em>McCulloch, </em>deals with the direction by the Governor to officers who serve under him as to whom they should meet with and confer. Paragraph A of the Order here at issue directs the Secretary of the DLLR to receive petitions and conduct a representation election. Paragraph C contemplates the designation of executive branch officers to meet and confer with the elected provider representative. Like the order upheld in <em>McCulloch, </em>the Order here is within the Governor\u2019s authority with respect to the POC program to direct his own officers, by requiring them to identify a majority POC representative with whom the Governor\u2019s designees may meet and confer.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The Executive Order approved in McCulloch was far more comprehensive than the one here at issue. Executive Order 01.01.2007.14 does not set POC rates, it simply establishes a procedure by which POC representatives can organize and meet with the Governor\u2019s staff. But, by the explicit terms of the Order, no one else is prohibited from meeting with the Governor or his staff to discuss POC issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">We hold that, like the Executive Order at issue in <em>McCulloch, </em>the Governor, in issuing Executive Order 01.01.2007.14, was simply exercising his executive prerogative and not usurping a legislative function.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Anti Trust Act</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The MSFCCA claims that the Executive Order is invalid because it creates an illegal mechanism for fixing the prices independent child care providers can charge. According to the MSFCCA, the Executive Order violates federal antitrust law because \u201cit permits independent child care providers to agree on the prices they would accept for their services.\u201d The circuit court rejected that argument, as do we. The fact that the POC program sets <em>reimbursement rates </em>in no way controls how much a provider can or will charge. Nothing in the program or in the Executive Order prevents any provider from charging customers more than the reimbursement rate. The Executive Order simply allows the bargaining unit to discuss with the Governor how much that reimbursement rate will be. Neither the Governor nor the bargaining unit sets the price for child care. Instead <em>if </em>the Governor and the bargaining unit reach an agreement, and <em>if </em>the General Assembly approves that rate, then the reimbursement rate is set. But not a single child care provider in Maryland is obliged to charge a customer the reimbursement rate. The Executive Order does not encourage or permit providers to \u201cagree on price they would accept\u201d and therefore the order does not violate the federal antitrust law.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Like the Executive Order discussed in <em>McCulloch, </em>the Order issued in this case was issued pursuant to the Governor\u2019s constitutional and statutory authority. The Governor did not violate subtitle 1 of the APA when he issued the Executive Order because those provisions do not apply to the Governor. Therefore, the case shall be remanded to the Circuit Court for Cecil County. Upon remand, the court shall issue a declaratory judgment in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion. Additionally, the court should deny the permanent injunction sought by appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CECIL COUNTY WITH INSTRUCTION TO ISSUE A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VIEWS EXPRESSED HEREIN; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\">.

State, </em>396 Md. 256, 330, 914 A.2d 25 (2006) (\"[W]e are dealing here with three agencies \u2014 the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS), ... the [Department of Corrections], which is a unit within the DPSCS ..., and the Inmate Grievance Office (IGO), a unit that is also within DPSCS\u201d); <em>Horridge v. St. Mary\u2019s County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>382 Md. 170, 174, 854 A.2d 1232 (2004) (describing a local department of social services as \"a unit of the State Department of Human Resources and therefore a State agency\u201d); <em>State v. Maryland Bd. of Contract Appeals, </em>364 Md. 446, 456, 773 A.2d 504 (2001) (explaining that \"[administrative agencies like the Board of Contract Appeals ... are not inferior tribunals in relation to the circuit courts; rather they are independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>units of the executive branch of state government\u201d). Op. at 456, 966 A.2d at 510.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b485-6\">. In a footnote to the Court\u2019s unanimous opinion in the <em>Legislative Redistricting Cases, </em>331 Md. 574, 629 A.2d 646 (1993), the Court of Appeals rejected the argument that the Governor\u2019s Redistricting Advisory Committee (\"GRAC\u201d) was compelled to follow the dictates of the APA. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">[Petitioners] both assert that the GRAC was compelled to follow the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Maryland Code (1984, 1993 Repl.Vol.) 10-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government Article, which specifies that notice must be published in the Maryland Register. This assertion is incorrect, because the APA applies only to Executive Branch \"units,\u201d defined as \"officer[s] or unit[s] authorized by law to adopt regulations.\u201d \u00a7 10-101(g). <em>Here, even assuming the redistricting plan was a \u201cregulation, \u201d neither the GRAC nor the Governor was a \u201cunit,\u201d for neither was authorized by law to adopt the plan; </em>rather, the plan became law only upon the General Assembly's inaction. Also, as the State points out, a statute such as the APA cannot control a constitutional gubernatorial function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">331 Md. at 574, 587 n. 11 (1993) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">The above quoted <em>dicta </em>suggests that in cases where the Governor is not authorized to pass a regulation (as opposed to an Executive Order), the Governor is not to be considered a \"unit\u201d of the Executive Branch.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
