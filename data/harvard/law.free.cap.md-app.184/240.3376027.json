Thomas, formerly worked for the Maryland State Police (\u201cMSP\u201d). In response to Thomas\u2019s failure to properly perform his duties, the MSP initiated disciplinary proceedings against him in 2001. As a result, Thomas sank into a state of depression that worsened over time and eventually led him to retire due to disability in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">The State Retirement and Pension System of Maryland (\u201cSRPS\u201d), appellee, permitted Thomas to take a disability retirement and receive normal disability benefits. But, Thomas also sought enhanced \u201cspecial disability benefits\u201d because he alleged that his disabling depression was attributable to his duties with the MSP. In order to qualify for special disability benefits, the retiree must show that he is \u201ctotally and permanently incapacitated for duty arising out of or in the course of the actual performance of duty <em>without willful negligence by the [retiree]\u201d </em>Maryland Code (1993, 2004 Repl.Vol.), State Personnel and Pensions Article (\u201cSPP\u201d), \u00a7 29 \u2014 111(b)(1) (emphasis added). After several administrative hearings, SRPS denied Thomas\u2019s application for special disability benefits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The SRPS ruled that Thomas\u2019s willful misconduct was clearly a contributing factor that led to his depression, and denied his claim for special disability benefits because he had not proved that his condition arose \u201cwithout willful negligence\u201d on his part, as required by SPP \u00a7 29 \u2014 111(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Thomas petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, which determined that there was substantial evidence to support the agency\u2019s ruling and affirmed the decision of the SRPS. Thomas then appealed to this Court, and asserts that the SRPS erred in ruling that the disability arose from his own willful negligence. We agree with the circuit court\u2019s decision to affirm the ruling of the SRPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Thomas began working as a State trooper for the Maryland State Police in 1971. After he suffered a series of panic attacks while on the road from 1978 to 1980, he was transferred to the MSP\u2019s Automotive Safety Enforcement Division (\u201cASED\u201d), after which the panic attacks ceased. Within the ASED, Thomas\u2019s job was to audit Maryland\u2019s authorized vehicle inspection stations.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">In January 2000, the MSP issued Special Order 23-001, which established new, uniform ASED procedures for the auditing of vehicle inspection stations. It is undisputed that Thomas was aware of the new procedures and failed to comply with them. After his superiors discovered that Thomas was not conducting thorough audits and that he was submitting false reports regarding his audits, the MSP initiated disciplinary proceedings against him by serving Thomas with an official Notification of Complaint on March 13, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The receipt of the Notification caused Thomas to experience feelings of depression, anxiety, anger, and agitation, interfering with his job performance. Accordingly, the MSP referred Thomas to Caren DeBernardo, Psy.D., H.S.P.P., a licensed psychologist, for treatment. Thomas had his first therapy visit with Dr. DeBernardo on September 6, 2001. Dr. DeBernardo later testified that, at this first meeting, Thomas was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u201cfeeling depressed. He was upset about the situation at work and that he had been reprimanded and was feeling anxious and agitated at the time.\u201d Dr. DeBernardo noted that Thomas \u201cbasically was productive and working well up until\u201d the time he came in for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In October 2001, Thomas and his counsel purportedly negotiated a settlement agreement with the MSP, according to which Thomas would receive a thirty-day suspension without pay but remain in ASED. The parties dispute how firmly MSP committed to this settlement agreement. But the MSP informed Thomas in November 2001 that there would be no settlement, and that the charges against him would be adjudicated. Thomas contends that when the MSP reneged on the settlement agreement, that traumatic incident exacerbated his pre-existing depression, insomnia, anger, and obsession over the disciplinary proceedings against him. As a result of Thomas\u2019s condition progressing to a more serious depressive disorder, Thomas stopped working and went on sick leave at the end of November 2001, and he never returned to active duty. In January 2002, Bruce Leopold, M.D., a psychiatrist, diagnosed Thomas with a Major Depressive Illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">On March 1, 2002, the MSP Administrative Hearing Board found Thomas guilty of neglect of duty, submitting inaccurate reports, and submitting false reports. The Hearing Board recommended a combined sanction of sixty days of suspension without pay, a one-year demotion from Trooper First Class to Trooper, and transfer out of ASED. Following the adjudication, Thomas\u2019s condition further deteriorated, and, in October 2002, Daniel C. Gutkir, Ph.D., diagnosed Thomas with Major Depressive Disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The Superintendent of the MSP adopted the Hearing Board\u2019s findings and sanctions. Thomas petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. In January 2003, the circuit court remanded the case for additional fact-finding in relation to the sanctions. Pursuant to additional findings by the Board, the MSP again imposed the same sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>On April 15, 2003, Thomas applied to the SRPS for special disability retirement benefits, as opposed to the less generous ordinary disability retirement benefits. In order for a retired member of the SRPS to be eligible for ordinary disability benefits, the Medical Board must certify that he \u201cis mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of the normal duties of the member\u2019s position.\u201d SPP \u00a7 29 \u2014 105(2)(i). To qualify for special disability benefits, an MSP retiree must be \u201ctotally and permanently incapacitated for duty arising out of or in the course of the actual performance of duty without willful negligence by the member.\u201d SPP \u00a7 29 \u2014 111(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">On June 26, 2003, the SRPS Medical Board recommended approving ordinary disability benefits but denying special disability benefits, on the ground that Thomas\u2019s disability did not arise out of or in the course of the actual performance of duty. In response to Thomas\u2019s request for reconsideration, the Medical Board affirmed its previous recommendation, which the SRPS accepted on July 22, 2003. On August 4, 2003, Thomas, again requested reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Sometime in 2003, Dr. DeBernardo\u2019s diagnosis changed to Major Depressive Disorder, due to Thomas\u2019s worsening symptoms. In a letter dated October 23, 2003, to Thomas\u2019s attorney, Dr. DeBernardo summarized the progression of Thomas\u2019s symptoms, and stated: \u201c[Thomas] reported that these symptoms began immediately following charges brought against him by his employer \u2014 the Maryland State Police.\u201d Dr. DeBernardo\u2019s letter of October 23, 2003, continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">Mr. Thomas was initially diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder with Depressed and Anxious Mood. (309.28). However, since symptoms worsened over time and continued for over two years, his diagnosis was changed to Major Depressive Disorder (296.23).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">Prior to the allegations of misconduct, there was no reason to believe that Mr. Thomas would not continue to be an effective employee. In addition, his depression began immediately following the allegations and worsened with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>increased stress associated with the disciplinary actions, hearing, appeal, and pending retirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Thomas retired on November 1, 2003. The next year, on August 5, 2004, the Medical Board reaffirmed its recommendation that Thomas receive ordinary disability benefits, which recommendation the SRPS adopted on August 17, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">On September 8, 2004, Thomas appealed to the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d). Both Thomas and the SRPS filed motions for summary judgment. On November 2, 2005, the presiding Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), Gus Avery, issued a proposed decision, ruling that Thomas\u2019s medical condition did arise out of the performance of duty\u2014 namely, participation in the disciplinary procedure against him \u2014 but that it resulted from his willful negligence in failing to comply with the new ASED procedures. Accordingly, ALJ Avery recommended that the SRPS deny Thomas\u2019s claim for special disability benefits under SPP \u00a7 29 \u2014 111(b)(1). Thomas noted exceptions to the proposed decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">On February 21, 2006, the SRPS held an exceptions hearing. On March 21, 2006, SRPS remanded the case to the OAH for an ALJ to conduct \u201ca full evidentiary hearing.\u201d The order for remand instructed the ALJ to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">Did the Claimant\u2019s depression disorder with anxiety, for which he has been determined to be totally and permanently incapacitated for duty, arise out of or in the course of the actual performance of duty without willful negligence by the claimant?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">In addition, the Board asked that the ALJ \u201cmake findings of fact on the issue of willful negligence and whether the Claimant is free from willful negligence with respect to work-related event(s) or activity which the Claimant argues is the cause of his permanent psychiatric disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">On August 9, 2006, ALJ Stephen Nichols conducted the remand hearing. Among the witnesses who testified at the administrative hearing on August 9, 2006, was Thomas\u2019s psychologist, Dr. DeBernardo, who testified as an expert in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>field of psychology and psychotherapy. Describing her first day of treating Thomas, she testified: \u201cMr. Thomas presented feeling depressed. He was upset about the situation at work and that he had been reprimanded and was feeling anxious and agitated at the time.\u201d When asked if she had \u201can opinion as to the root or the cause of\u2019 Thomas\u2019s major depressive disorder, she testified: \u201cWell my opinion would be that he was feeling depressed and upset and his symptoms manifested immediately following the disciplinary issues that were placed upon him instantly and his reaction to that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">On October 5, 2006, ALJ Nichols issued his proposed decision, portions of which were adopted in the Final Decision of the SRPS that is the subject of this appeal. Among other findings of fact, ALJ Nichols made the following critical finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">36. The Claimant is totally and permanently incapacitated for duty as a result of depressive disorder with anxiety. The Claimant\u2019s Major Depressive Disorder was caused by the stress he experienced as a result of the official Notification of Complaint, the MSP rescinding of the settlement of the administrative charges and the adjudication of the administrative charges by the State Police Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">ALJ Nichols agreed with ALJ Avery\u2019s recommendation to deny Thomas\u2019s application for special disability benefits. ALJ Nichols found that the disabling condition did not occur \u201cwithout willful negligence\u201d on the part of Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">ALJ Nichols summarized the events that led to charges being filed by the MSP against Thomas, including an investigation that involved a meeting between Thomas and his supervisors to review discrepancies in his inspection reports. After that meeting, Thomas\u2019s supervisors began re-inspecting his assigned stations, and turned up evidence of improper inspections and false reports. ALJ Nichols concluded: \u201cFrom these facts, it is reasonable and permissible to infer that the Claimant Thomas,] intentionally disregarded the requirements of MSP Special Order 23-0001 ... [and] was disciplined for his noncompliance.\u201d Accordingly, the ALJ concluded: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>\u201cThe Claimant\u2019s incapacity for duty arose, ultimately, from his intentional disregard of the requirements of his duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Rejecting Thomas\u2019s argument that his willful neglect of duty was not a direct cause of his incapacitating disability, ALJ Nichols concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">The Claimant argues that whatever his misconduct, he did not willfully or intentionally create the mental disorder that he now suffers from. The Claimant further argues that whatever his misconduct, he was not recklessly indifferent to a risk that he would develop a mental disorder because that could not have been foreseen. In effect, the Claimant contends that although his misconduct may have been a willful disregard of the requirements of his duties resulting in the MSP disciplinary process, it was not willful or reckless as to the mental disorder he developed. The SRPS counters this argument by pointing out the simple fact that the Claimant is seeking to benefit from his own willful misconduct. The Claimant\u2019s argument is a bit too clever. The ALJ agrees with the SRPS that the phrase \u201cwithout willful negligence\u201d was intended by the Legislature to prevent an award that arises from an intentional disregard by a State trooper to the requirements of his/her duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">Accordingly, the Claimant\u2019s incapacity for duty is not without \u201cwillful negligence\u201d and he is not entitled to a special disability retirement allowance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">On April 17, 2007, the SRPS held another exceptions hearing and, on that same day, issued its Final Decision, in which the SRPS adopted ALJ Nichols\u2019s findings of fact and his conclusion that Thomas\u2019s willful negligence disqualified him from receiving special disability benefits. (The SRPS expressly stated that it neither adopted nor rejected ALJ Nichols\u2019s conclusion that Thomas\u2019s depression \u201carose out of or in the course of\u2019 his performance of duty.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Thomas sought judicial review of the SRPS\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Following a hearing, the circuit court affirmed the agency\u2019s decision, explaining: \u201cI do believe that there is substantial ... evidence in this record to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>support the ALJ\u2019s findings that the Petitioner\u2019s mental illness arose from the adverse disciplinary actions pending against him, which ... were instituted because of Petitioner\u2019s willful negligence.\u201d Thomas then noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The Court of Appeals recently summarized the principles governing appellate review of the ruling of administrative agencies as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">When reviewing the decision of an administrative agency, ... we review the agency\u2019s decision directly, not the decision of the circuit court. <em>Anderson v. General Casualty, </em>402 Md. 236, 244, 935 A.2d 746, 751 (2007). A reviewing court will affirm the decision of the [agency] when it is supported by substantial evidence appearing in the record and it is not erroneous as a matter of law. <em>Comptroller v. Blanton, </em>390 Md. 528, 535, 890 A.2d 279, 283 (2006); <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 834, 490 A.2d 1296, 1300-01 (1985). Because an agency\u2019s decision is presumed <em>prima facie </em>correct, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the agency. <em>Comptroller v. Citicorp, </em>389 Md. 156, 163, 884 A.2d 112, 116 (2005). Indeed, \u201cit is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence and where inconsistent inferences can be drawn from the same evidence it is for the agency to draw the inferences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163-64, 884 A.2d at 116 (quoting <em>Ramsay, </em>302 Md. at 835, 490 A.2d at 1301). When we review an agency decision that is a mixed question of law and fact, we apply \u201cthe substantial evidence test, that is, the same standard of review [we] would apply to an agency factual finding.\u201d <em>Longshore v. State, </em>399 Md. 486, 522 n. 8, 924 A.2d 1\u00cd29, 1149 n. 8 (2007).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-7\"><em>Comptroller v. Science Applications, </em>405 Md. 185, 192-93, 950 A.2d 766 (2008). We review an agency\u2019s statutory interpretation <em>de novo. Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 563, 576, 870 A.2d 186 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>In this case, we review the SRPS\u2019s interpretation and application of SPP Section 29 \u2014 111(b)(1). Regarding questions of statutory interpretation, the Court of Appeals has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">The overarching rule is that, in construing statutes, \u201cour primary goal is always \u2018to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision ...\u2019\u201d <em>Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 172, 935 A.2d 699, 708 (2007), citing <em>Dep\u2019t of Health v. Kelly, </em>397 Md. 399, 419-20, 918 A.2d 470, 482 (2007), and <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Seay, </em>388 Md. 341, 352, 879 A.2d 1049, 1055 (2005). If the language is clear and unambiguous, we ordinarily \u201cneed not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends.\u201d <em>Barbre, supra, </em>402 Md. at 173, 935 A.2d at 709.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">If, upon this preliminary analysis, however, we conclude that \u201cthe language is subject to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous, and we resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Barbre, supra, </em>402 Md. at 173, 935 A.2d at 709; <em>Patterson Park v. Teachers Union, </em>399 Md. 174, 198, 923 A.2d 60, 74 (2007). To the extent relevant, we look as well to \u201cthe statute\u2019s structure, including the title, and how the statute relates to other laws.\u201d <em>Stouffer v. Pearson, </em>390 Md. 36, 46, 887 A.2d 623, 629 (2005).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\"><em>Opert v. Criminal Injuries, </em>403 Md. 587, 593, 943 A.2d 1229 (2008). \u201cFurther, an interpretation should be given to the statutory provisions that does not lead to absurd consequences.\u201d <em>Anderson v. The Gables, </em>404 Md. 560, 571-72, 948 A.2d 11 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">SPP \u00a7 29-lll(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">(b) <em>Eligibility. </em>\u2014 The Board of Trustees shall grant a special disability retirement allowance to a member if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">(1) the member is totally and permanently incapacitated for duty arising out of or in the course of the actual performance of duty without willful negligence by the member ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Although the ALJ expended considerable effort in analyzing whether Thomas\u2019s disability was one \u201carising out of or in the course of the actual performance of duty,\u201d as required by \u00a7 29 \u2014 111(b)(1), the Final Decision of the SRPS expressly avoided taking any position on whether Thomas met that aspect of the qualifying statute. The SRPS focused instead on the language in \u00a7 29 \u2014 111(b)(1) that requires the retiree to establish that the incapacity is \u201cwithout willful negligence by the member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Upon review of the record, we agree with SRPS that there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion of ALJ Nichols that Thomas\u2019s depression arose out of not just the disciplinary proceedings against him, but also Thomas\u2019s willfully negligent auditing of the inspection stations he was assigned to review. Thomas\u2019s willfully negligent conduct led directly to the disciplinary proceedings. The disciplinary proceedings against Thomas, and the attendant emotional harm he suffered, were the natural and proximate results of Thomas\u2019s willful failure to perform his job properly and adequately. Therefore, as the ALJ and the SRPS agreed, Thomas\u2019s depression and his \u201cincapacity for duty arose, ultimately, from his intentional disregard of the requirements of his duty.\u201d \u201cAccordingly, [Thomas\u2019s] incapacity for duty is not without \u2018willful negligence\u2019 and he is not entitled to a special disability retirement allowance\u201d under \u00a7 29 \u2014 111(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Thomas contends that we should treat the disciplinary process against him as the sole cause of his Major Depression Disorder, wholly separate from his willfully negligent auditing. He argues that the MSP\u2019s alleged withdrawal from the negotiated settlement agreement was the origin of his incapacitating disability, noting that he had continued working until that incident. But ALJ Nichols found, to the contrary, that the origins of Thomas\u2019s depression lay in the very beginning of the disciplinary proceedings against him, and Dr. DeBernardo\u2019s testimony and her letter to Thomas\u2019s attorney, both quoted above, constituted substantial evidence supporting that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Thomas cites <em>Baltimore County v. Penn, </em>66 Md.App. 199, 503 A.2d 257 (1986), as supporting his argument that the agency must, as a matter of law, treat disciplinary proceedings as the standalone cause of any resulting mental stress inflicted upon a retiree, regardless of whether the retiree is being disciplined for his own willful negligence. But Thomas misconstrues the case. In <em>Penn, </em>this Court held that, under the Baltimore County Code, two retired county policemen were entitled to disability benefits for hypertension that may have been caused by, or exacerbated by, disciplinary proceedings against them, notwithstanding their alleged (but never proved) willful negligence. In the <em>Penn </em>case, however, the statutory disqualification for willful negligence applied only to disabilities stemming from accidents. Accordingly, we held there that the retirees\u2019 alleged willful misconduct was of no import because the disciplinary proceedings did not constitute an accident. <em>Id. </em>at 213, 503 A.2d 257. Consequently, <em>Penn </em>does not support Thomas\u2019s claim under \u00a7 29-lll(b). Under the plain language of \u00a7 29 \u2014 111(b), willful negligence disqualifies a retiree from receiving special disability benefits if the willful misconduct is an underlying cause of the disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">To apply \u00a7 29 \u2014 111(b)(1) as Thomas asks, by focusing on the emotional impact of the disciplinary proceedings while ignoring what led to them, would lead to an absurd result: Thomas would end up benefitting from his own willful negligence in the performance of his duty. That would be contrary to the plain language of the statute, which requires the incapacity to occur \u201cwithout willful negligence by the member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Thomas argues, alternatively, that his misconduct did not constitute the sort of willful negligence that \u00a7 29 \u2014 111(b)(1) contemplates. He contends that a retiree must act with the intent to incapacitate himself (or at least with reckless indifference toward that result) in order to be disqualified under the willful negligence clause. But Thomas\u2019s interpretation is contrary to the plain words of the statute. Whether we read the disqualifying language in the statute more narrowly to say that the retiree\u2019s \u201cactual performance of duty\u201d must be \u201cwithout willful negligence,\u201d or read the disqualifying language in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the statute more broadly to say that the retiree must be \u201cincapacitated ...- without willful negligence by the member,\u201d Thomas would be disqualified from receiving special benefits in either event because the AL J found that Thomas\u2019s incapacity arose from his own willfully negligent conduct in the performance of duty. There was substantial evidence to support that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.
