Following a trial in May 2007, a jury sitting in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Sparkman of first-degree murder, as well as use of a handgun in a crime of violence, and wearing or carrying a handgun.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">On appeal, Sparkman poses the following two questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">1. Did the court below err by admitting into evidence a letter purportedly written by Appellant?</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">2. Was the evidence legally insufficient to sustain Appellant\u2019s convictions?</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">A. The Suppression Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">Prior to trial, Sparkman moved to suppress a letter purportedly written by him while he was in pretrial custody. The letter was sent from jail, but it was seized when it was returned to the institution with a label marked \u201cRETURN TO SENDER,\u201d \u201cINSUFFICIENT ADDRESS,\u201d and \u201cUNABLE TO FORWARD.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-13\">Corporal Monique Mitchell, a correctional officer in the Intelligence Unit of the Division of Pretrial Detention, Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, was the sole witness at the suppression hearing. As of the hearing, she had worked for Pretrial Services for eleven years, the last five of which were in the Intelligence Unit. She stated that her unit\u2019s mission is to acquire information about inmates\u2019 involvement in \u201ccriminal activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-14\">On June 25, 2006, some eighteen months after Pritchett\u2019s murder, Mitchell received an envelope from the mailroom at the Baltimore City Detention Center, addressed to Tamira Sparkman. The envelope, which measured 3/\u00bf by <em>&amp;k </em>inches, contained a yellow label, apparently applied by the U.S. Postal Service, stating \u201cRETURN TO SENDER,\u201d \u201cINSUFFI<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>CIENT ADDRESS,\u201d and \u201cUNABLE TO FORWARD.\u201d The return address on the letter included appellant\u2019s name, his inmate number, and the address of the detention center.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Mitchell opened the envelope. It contained two sheets of lined, letter-sized paper, which were folded repeatedly. It also contained a separate sheet of paper, which was also folded, with a photograph inside of it. The separate sheet appeared to be a copy of an autopsy photograph, which Mitchell found \u201csuspicious\u201d and \u201cnot ordinary mail.\u201d She then opened the lined sheets and saw a handwritten letter. At the bottom of the second page she saw the following sentence: \u201c1 picture is of my victim &amp; the other 1 is my mother!\u201d The letter also contained the statement: \u201cI went to prison at a young age <em>&amp; </em>back I am.\u201d Because Mitchell thought that the envelope\u2019s contents indicated \u201csome kind of criminal activity,\u201d she did not return it to appellant (which she normally would have done, having found no contraband). Instead, it went to the detective assigned to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">When asked why she opened the mail, Mitchell said: \u201cBecause it was return to sender\u201d and \u201cthe thickness of the envelope ... it could be something inside the envelope.\u201d Mitchell explained that the institution\u2019s policy provided for the opening and perusal of all \u201csuspicious\u201d mail, and the thickness of the envelope prompted her suspicion that it might contain contraband. Mitchell added that she had to unfold the papers because they could have contained drugs. In addition, Mitchell stated that incoming mail is inspected for contraband and, as a matter of policy, \u201call return to sender mail\u201d is opened, as it is regarded as \u201cincoming mail.\u201d According to Mitchell, inmates sometimes attempt to circumvent the policy barring inmate-to-inmate correspondence by sending a letter to a bogus address and writing the other inmate\u2019s name as the return addressee.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">As to the policy of opening mail that is marked \u201creturn to sender,\u201d Mitchell elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">That\u2019s the policy because we open it to make sure nothing is coming back inside the institution, they may try to send it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>out or something \u2014 sometimes inmates send out mail or send mail to each other, that is not permitted, not permitted mail to each other, mail or correspondence to one another. So in that case, we do check return to sender mail just to make sure they are not trying to get it to another party inside the institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The State introduced as an exhibit a document governing Mailroom Operations, dated April 15, 2003.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It included the statement, in section VI.C, that \u201cDPDS inmates shall be prohibited from mailing correspondence to each other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">On cross-examination, Mitchell acknowledged that State\u2019s Motion Exhibit 3, a page from the inmates\u2019 handbook, said nothing about the institution\u2019s policy of opening returned mail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But, she pointed out that it stated that incoming mail is opened prior to delivery and inspected for contraband or money orders. The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABa\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: For incoming inmate mail, and tell me if I\u2019m right, this ICU, that is your group, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0V\">[MITCHELL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: May search an inmate\u2019s incoming mail when there is a reasonable suspicion that inmate is engaged in criminal activity or any action which may jeopardize public safety, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">[MITCHELL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And then it says ICU will document that reasonable suspicion of inmate engaging in activity, including document knowledge that form[s] the basis for reasonable suspicion. Now, are you telling us that upon receiving this matter, return [to] sender that you had reasonable suspicion to believe that Mr. Sparkman was engaged in illegal activity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>[MITCHELL]: Well, sir, when it is return to sender, again we do open it because we do believe, that sometime[s] it\u2019s inmate to inmate correspon[d]ence and something being done to bring the mail back in, we have to make sure there is no type of contraband, and we search it entering the institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. How, first of all, if it is sent out and return[ed] to sender, how is that being sent, how would that be mail sent to another inmate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">[MITCHELL]: Because that\u2019s what they do----They put them as the person to send out in order to receive it. I\u2019m trying to say this correctly? When he writes the letter, so that the other party receives it what they do is give a bogus address that\u2019s somewhere that they know they are going to send it back to the person that\u2019s going to receive it; does that make sense?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">The following exchange is also relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, my question to you is, what contraband was inside that envelope that allowed you to turn it over to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office? [MITCHELL]: Well, the letter \u2014 picture itself, it\u2019s a morgue, a picture of someone having an autopsy. I thought, that is suspicious. That\u2019s not everyday mail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But a photo copy is not a contraband, is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-11\">[MITCHELL]: No, it\u2019s not contraband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">According to Mitchell, the letter \u201cseem[ed] to be criminal activity that involved some type of criminal activity. I found it to be.\u201d The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: You thought that a photo copy was criminal activity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-14\">[MITCHELL]: Once I perused it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So you did read the letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvB\">[MITCHELL]: I perused the letter. Once I saw the picture, I perused it at the bottom and saw a statement that was made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Following argument by counsel, the court issued an oral ruling denying the motion. It stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-4\">The Court believes and holds that it was proper for the corporal to inspect the letter. There is no question that the Court of Appeals has held that there is no absolute right of expectation, but rather diminished right of expectation [of privacy] pursuant to Fourth Amendment. And that the rule indicated that the institution has to be reasonable. This was a returned letter, therefore, mak[ing] it incoming mail. The rules in the institution are that any incoming mail that is believed that there is a reasonable suspicion that may involve public safety, there inside the institution or inside or out of the institution, may be inspected. And certainly as the Court of Appeals has said in the Thompson [sic]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> case, smuggling money, drugs and weapons, other contraband, all too common in the institution; therefore, inspection of the letters that are in this case, two [sic] fat to just be a single letter, warranted her opening the envelope. Once she opens the envelope and saw a picture, an autopsy picture, this Court holds that she then had the authority then, based on that suspicion, now she has that suspicion, in an effect of exacerbated it by the presence of the autopsy picture, she had a right to read the letter, and when she discovers that the letter indicated that, in fact, the Defendant was admitting that this was the victim of his crime, then [she] had the responsibility to turn that over to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office. So I will deny the motion for those reasons, and allow the State to introduce the letter....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">B. The Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The prosecution presented five witnesses at trial, including two eyewitnesses to the shooting who identified appellant\u2019s photo in an array and identified appellant at trial. The defense did not present any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Frank Gilliam testified that at about 10:00 <em>p.m. on </em>January 14, 2005, while he was talking with a friend near an apartment complex he called \u201cTarget City,\u201d a \u201cguy came up and shot several times, shot at this guy named Wes about seven times.\u201d At the time, Wes was on the sidewalk, near Madison Street. Gilliam was about twenty to twenty-two feet away from the victim, but could not estimate how far he was from the shooter. The shooter came from \u201clike Bond Street, across Madison.\u201d Gilliam said: \u201cI saw, saw who it was, I ran.\u201d He described the assailant as a \u201cblack male, approximately six foot, dark skinned, short hair cut, black hoodie.\u201d Gilliam later identified appellant in court as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Gilliam was arrested in the early morning of January 15, 2005, and charged with heroin possession. He told a patrol officer about the shooting. On February 4, 2005, he spoke with Detective Arthur Brummer, who showed him a photo array. He picked out the photo of appellant, whom he called \u201cLittle Ronald,\u201d as the person who shot Wes. He stated that he knew appellant from living in the same neighborhood and seeing him \u201cmostly every day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Ernest Minor testified that on January 14, 2005, he was with his friend, Ralph \u201cWes\u201d Pritchett, in the area of Monument Street and Broadway in Baltimore. As the pair walked through a \u201ccut\u201d between apartment buildings, a man in dark clothing and a dark hat walked toward them and began shooting. Minor saw an \u201cobject\u201d in the man\u2019s hand, and then \u201cthe fire\u201d of muzzle flashes. After the first flash, Minor ran around the block. When he returned, he saw his \u201cbuddy lying on the ground dead.\u201d He did not \u201cknow\u201d the shooter, but he \u201cknew of\u2019 him, having seen him once or twice previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Minor did not report what he had seen until April 2005, when he was arrested on unrelated charges and asked to speak to the police. He told Detective Brummer what had happened. Brummer showed Minor a photo array, from which Minor picked appellant\u2019s photo as the assailant. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>also identified appellant in court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Brummer testified that at 10:19 p.m. on January 14, 2005, he responded to an emergency call for a shooting. Five .38 caliber shell casings and two bullet fragments were recovered from the scene. He spoke with Gilliam on January 15, 2005, and again on February 4, 2005, when he showed him the photo array. He spoke with Minor on April 12, 2005. He identified State\u2019s Exhibit 4 as a photograph of the \u201csplit between Madison and Monument Streets,\u201d where the shooting occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Dr. Carol Allen, of the Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, performed the autopsy on the victim. She was accepted as an expert in the field of medical and forensic pathology. Dr. Allen explained that the victim suffered five separate gunshot wounds, including three to the back and two to the forearm. One of the bullets penetrated the large intestine, heart, and right lung, fatally injuring the victim. Three \u201clarge caliber projectiles\u201d were recovered from the body. Two of the gunshot wounds were \u201cthrough and through,\u201d i.e., they entered and exited the victim\u2019s body. Those bullets were not recovered. The parties stipulated that a firearms and ballistics expert would have testified that bullets recovered from the victim were all fired from the same .38 caliber weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Corporal Mitchell was the State\u2019s final witness. Her trial testimony was generally consistent with the testimony she provided at the suppression hearing. She stated that on June 25, 2006, she received an envelope from the mailroom at the detention facility, which had a yellow sticker on it that said, \u201cRETURN TO SENDER.\u201d The envelope was addressed to \u201cTamira Sparkman, 615 N. Ellwood Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202.\u201d The sender\u2019s name appeared as \u201cRonald Spark-man,\u201d with a return address of 401 E. Eager St. in Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>City, the location of the Baltimore City Detention Center. Corporal Mitchell recounted that she opened the envelope \u201cjust to make sure it didn\u2019t have a contraband money order, or cash, sometimes mail comes inside the mail.\u201d She saw two handwritten pages and two photographs, one of which appeared to be an autopsy photo. She noted: \u201c[W]e don\u2019t get pictures of that sort in the mail____\u201d Upon seeing the autopsy photo, Mitchell \u201cperused the letter.\u201d It said: \u201cOne picture of my victim and the other one is my mother and father.\u201d The letter was admitted into evidence over objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">After the prosecution rested its case, defense counsel made a motion for judgment of acquittal, stating: \u201cI would make a motion for judgment on all four counts.\u201d The court denied the motion. The defense rested and then renewed its motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">Appellant argues that the court erred by admitting the letter purportedly written by him. He asserts that, despite his status as a pretrial detainee, the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution afforded him \u201ca reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the envelope bearing his name.\u201d In appellant\u2019s view, the \u201cactions of the correctional officer in opening the envelope, inspecting its contents, and reading the letter, violated [his] right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures of his personal papers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">According to appellant, \u201cOpening the envelope, which was returned in the same condition it was mailed, was unreasonable under the circumstances of this case.\u201d He maintains that \u201cthe envelope was not fat enough to support reasonable suspicion that it contained contraband,\u201d and the copy of the autopsy photograph did not constitute evidence \u201cthat Appellant was engaged in any criminal activity while in the detention facility.\u201d Moreover, he posits that, even if Mitchell was entitled \u201cto open and inspect the contents of the envelope,\u201d once the inspection revealed no contraband and no indication of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>criminal activity, Corporal Mitchell should not have read the letter. Instead, she should have returned it to appellant. In addition, appellant contends that he \u201cwas not notified that mail marked \u2018return to sender\u2019 would be opened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The State disagrees, asserting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\">The short answer to Sparkman\u2019s complaint regarding the opening and reading of the letter returned to him, which was treated by the correctional authorities as incoming mail, is that whatever expectation of privacy Sparkman had with respect to the letter that expectation was trumped by the \u201clegitimate security needs\u201d of the correctional facility where he was housed awaiting trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">According to the State, \u201cthere was ample evidence ... that institutional policy on incoming mail, even mail stamped \u2018Returned [sic] to Sender,\u2019 mandated that it be opened for security purposes.\u201d In its view, once Mitchell opened the letter and saw the autopsy photograph, it was not unreasonable for her \u201cto skim the letter,\u201d because she \u201creasonably suspected that it contained evidence of on-going criminal activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">As noted, the circuit court determined that Mitchell properly opened the envelope and inspected its contents for possible contraband because it was tantamount to incoming mail and because it was \u201ctoo fat to be just a single letter.\u201d It reasoned that when Mitchell saw the autopsy photograph, she reasonably became suspicious and reviewed the letter. At that time, she saw appellant\u2019s inculpatory statement and properly turned the envelope and its contents over to the State. We agree with the circuit court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-4\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or things to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Under the Fourth Amendment, pretrial detainees may retain some expectation of privacy, although, if they do, it is \u201cdiminished\u201d when compared with persons who are not incarcerated. <em>See Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 557, 558-59, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979); <em>Thomas v. State, </em>285 Md. 458, 463, 404 A.2d 257 (1979). <em>Thomas </em>is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">In <em>Thomas, </em>the defendant, a pretrial detainee, had written a letter to a fellow inmate, sealed it, and handed it to a correctional officer for delivery within the institution. 285 Md. at 459, 404 A.2d 257. A detention center official opened and read the letter. <em>Id. </em>Because it contained an inculpatory statement, it was turned over to the prosecutor. <em>Id. </em>The appellant moved to suppress the letter. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">The warden testified at the suppression hearing that the regulation governing mail at the detention center \u201cdid not cover correspondence from one inmate to another, and that the inmates were not apprised that a letter in a sealed envelope from one to another would be read by institution officials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460, 404 A.2d 257. But, the regulation provided for the opening of all incoming mail, and also imposed certain restrictions on \u201coutgoing\u201d correspondence. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court denied the motion to suppress, and the defendant was subsequently convicted of rape and battery. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 459, 404 A.2d 257. On appeal to this Court, we were of the view that mail from one inmate to another constituted \u201cincoming mail\u201d with respect to the inmate who was the addressee. <em>Id. </em>at 461, 404 A.2d 257. On that basis, the Court concluded that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy, and affirmed the convictions. <em>See Thomas v. State, </em>39 Md.App. 217, 229, 384 A.2d 772 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">The Court of Appeals granted certiorari to consider whether reading the letter and introducing it into evidence violated the appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. <em>Thomas, </em>285 Md. at 459, 404 A.2d 257. The Court found no violation of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Notably, the Court of Appeals did not regard inmate-to-inmate mail as tantamount to incoming mail. It said, <em>id. </em>at 461-62, 404 A.2d 257:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">Preliminarily, we ... disagree with the Court of Special Appeals, regarding the scope of the detention center\u2019s regulation. By use of the terms \u201cmail,\u201d \u201cincoming\u201d and \u201coutgoing,\u201d it would seem that the regulation was designed to deal with correspondence sent from inmates, via the United States Postal Service, to persons outside of the institution, and correspondence sent from persons outside of the institution, via the Postal Service, to inmates. This is confirmed by references in the regulation to the addresses of the parties, and the provision for the return to the sender of inappropriate \u201cincoming mail.\u201d It is further confirmed by the distinction drawn between the two types of mail, with outgoing mail being allowed to be sealed, whereas all incoming mail is subject to inspection before delivery to the inmate. Moreover, this is the view of the warden, who promulgated the regulation. Consequently, we do not believe that the defendant knew or should have known, based on the regulation, that the envelope given to a guard for hand delivery to another inmate was subject to being opened and the contents read. Rather, the case must be treated as one where there was no regulation or practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>made known to the inmates regarding correspondence between inmates in the institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Nevertheless, the Court recognized that, \u201cas a general matter, lawful detention or imprisonment \u2018necessarily makes unavailable many rights and privileges of the ordinary citizen,\u2019 but \u2018though his rights may be diminished by the needs and exigencies of the institutional environment, a prisoner is not wholly stripped of constitutional protections.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, 404 A.2d 257 (quoting <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 555, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974)). Indeed, the Court acknowledged that \u201csome courts have taken the position that persons incarcerated in jails and prisons retain a measure of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Yet, with respect to the Fourth Amendment, the Court observed, <em>id.: </em>\u201c[I]t is not at all clear whether the protections of that amendment extend to pre-trial detainees or convicted prisoners in a detention center or correctional institution.\u201d It pointed to the Supreme Court\u2019s then-recent observation in <em>Bell v. Wolfish, supra, </em>441 U.S. at 556-57, 99 S.Ct. 1861, that \u201can argument can be made \u2018that a person confined in a detention facility has no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to his room or cell and that therefore the Fourth Amendment provides no protection for such a person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>And, quoting <em>Lanza v. New York, </em>370 U.S. 139, 143, 82 S.Ct. 1218, 8 L.Ed.2d 384 (1962), the Court observed, <em>id., </em>that \u201c \u2018surveillance has traditionally been the order of the day\u2019 \u201d in penal institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Mindful that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has not decided the question,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 464, 404 A.2d 257, the <em>Thomas </em>Court \u201csimilarly assume[d], without deciding, that a pretrial detainee ... retains some reasonable expectation of privacy and thus a degree of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But, the Court admonished: \u201c[Mjerely because inmates may retain a degree of Fourth Amendment protection with respect to some matters, it does not necessarily follow that the defendant in the present case had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the contents of the sealed envelope handed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>correctional officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Relying on <em>Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-5\">In that part of the <em>Bell v. Wolfish </em>opinion relating to the Fourth Amendment claims of pre-trial detainees, the Supreme Court seemed to be saying that, even assuming the presence of some reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the subject of a search, resulting in the Fourth Amendment being implicated, if the type of search is justified by institutional security considerations, no \u201clevel of cause\u201d for any specific search is required for compliance with the Fourth Amendment. Instead, the \u201csignificant and legitimate security interests\u201d of the detention facility may outweigh the privacy interests of the pre-trial detainees, thereby rendering the searches \u201creasonable\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">Applying these principles to the case before us, it would seem apparent that no Fourth Amendment right of the defendant was violated. <em>Assuming that [Thomas] had some reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to the envelope because of the absence of notice informing him that the contents would be inspected, </em>under <em>Bell v. Wolfish, supra, </em>no \u201cprobable cause\u201d or \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that the envelope contained contraband, escape plans, etc., need be shown. Rather, <em>the question is whether this type of search is justified by the institution\u2019s legitimate concern for security. There can be little doubt that it is so justified. A detention center or correctional institution clearly has a reasonable security interest in knowing what one inmate is communicating or sending to another.

The court determined that, under both federal and Pennsylvania law, which are coextensive, the defendant did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the mail. <em>Id. </em>at 1099, 1102.

In <em>Stroud, </em>the Supreme Court held that interception by prison officials, and subsequent use in prosecution, of letters written by an inmate did not violate the prisoner\u2019s fourth amendment rights. Modern cases have limited <em>Stroud </em>to situations in which prison officials have seized outgoing letters in the exercise of legitimate government interests. <em>See United States v.

There, the author reviews the historically distinct treatment of inmate claims for protection of incoming and outgoing mail under the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of freedom of speech.

Mitchell testified as to the institutional policy of routinely inspecting incoming mail for contraband. Moreover, she explained that the envelope in issue was unusually thick and could have contained \u201csome type of drugs.\u201d She also testified that her action was motivated by official policy that deems returned mail as incoming mail; the policy barring correspondence between inmates; and the practice of some inmates in sending mail to other inmates by using bogus mailing addresses in combination with the return address of the intended recipient.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>The question remains whether the court had sufficient grounds for finding that Mitchell acted reasonably when she <em>read </em>the letter after she opened it.

Here, likewise, the institution had a need to read the letter to investigate the possibility, established by Mitchell\u2019s testimony, that the letter was an improper communication between inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Second, Mitchell reasonably perceived the autopsy photograph as unusual and \u201csuspicious.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant argues that the photograph \u201cwas not evidence that Appellant was engaged in any criminal activity while in the detention facility,\u201d and that he could have received the copy legitimately from his attorney. But, Mitchell was not required to ignore the photo on that basis. It was not unreasonable for Mitchell to suspect that the envelope may have contained information relating to his continuing criminal activity. Mitchell\u2019s suspicion, prompted by the photo, entitled her to read the letter, which led to the discovery of appellant\u2019s statement that the photo depicted his \u201cvictim.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">Appellant argues that the evidence was legally insufficient to support his convictions \u201cbecause the testimony of the two eyewitnesses was unreliable and because no tangible evidence linked him to the shooting.\u201d A threshold problem afflicts appellant\u2019s argument. On two occasions, defense counsel moved for judgment of acquittal. But, neither time did defense counsel state any grounds for the motion. In <em>McIntyre v.

Thus, he reasons that another inmate might have written the letter and tried to send it to him in this devious way. The hypothetical possibility that another inmate, posing as appellant, wrote the admission was not raised below. In any event, it would not defeat the eyewitness testimony that appellant was the murderer.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.

The court sentenced appellant to life in prison for the murder, and to a consecutive 20-year term for use of a handgun (the first five years to be served without parole).

Minor\u2019s charges in Baltimore City were resolved and he was placed on probation.

In <em>Rush v. State, </em>403 Md. 68, 939 A.2d 689 (2008), the Court reiterated the applicable standard of review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-10\">In reviewing a circuit court's grant or denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we ordinarily consider only the evidence contained in the record of the suppression hearing. The factual findings of the suppression court and its conclusions regarding the credibility of testimony are accepted unless clearly erroneous. We review the evidence and the inferences that may be reasonably drawn in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. We \"undertake our own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>independent constitutional appraisal of the record by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the present case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 82-83, 939 A.2d 689 (internal citations omitted). <em>See also Bost v.
