This is one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">This litigation began in August of 2004, when appellant Joel Abramson filed a breach of contract action against appellee Ronald Wildman in the District Court for Howard County. Abramson sought to recover more than $13,000 in unpaid legal fees due under a retainer agreement entered into by the parties. In turn, in February 2005, Wildman filed a Counterclaim, alleging, among other things, that Abramson breached a contract to represent him in a \u201cprofessionally responsive\u201d manner, primarily in connection with the law firm\u2019s handling of a custody dispute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wildman sought the return of $24,525 in legal fees he had paid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant had also previously prayed a jury trial, which led to the cases being transferred to the circuit court. There, answers were filed to the complaint and counterclaim and Abramson propounded interrogatories and made a request for production of documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In April 2005, Abramson\u2019s counsel made a written demand for arbitration of the claims of both parties pursuant to a provision in the retainer agreement. This was followed the next month by the filing of a Petition to Compel Arbitration and Motion to Stay Proceedings, which were denied after a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>hearing. The cases went to trial before a jury in September 2007. The jury rejected Abramson\u2019s fee claim and sided with Wildman on his counterclaim, awarding him the $24,525 he prayed. Post-trial motions were denied and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">For reasons set forth below, we affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Appellant has presented these questions for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">I. Did the trial court err in denying Abramson\u2019s Petition to Compel Arbitration?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">II. Did Wildman fail to make a <em>prima facie </em>case of breach of contract against Abramson in proving the alleged breach of the subject contract?</p>\n<p id=\"AiA\">III. Did the trial court err in providing the jury with a jury instruction concerning competence?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">IV. Did the trial court improperly admit evidence of Abramson\u2019s competency at the trial in this matter?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">V. Did Wildman fail to make a <em>prima facie </em>case of damages against Abramson in relation to Abramson\u2019s alleged breach of the contract, or otherwise cause the jury to speculate as to damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">The March 26, 2003 retainer agreement, written in letter form to Wildman and signed by both parties, is the starting point for our resolution of these issues. It begins:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-15\">Thank you for expressing the desire for our firm and the attorneys herein, to represent you with reference to your marital difficulties. <em>You may expect our firm to be both sensitive and professionally responsive to your situation. </em>(Emphasis added.).<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>After detailing billing and compensation requirements, the agreement stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">If in the course of our representation, if you believe that our advice, conduct or ethics is not satisfactory, you agree to communicate to us in writing promptly so we can attempt if appropriate to rectify the problem.<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The agreement also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">Should you decide to terminate our representation in this matter, such termination must be in writing. Until such written termination is received, you will continue to be responsible for all fees and expenses incurred as set forth above. We have no obligation to represent you on any appeal unless a fee arrangement for same is reduced to writing. <em>Client is aware that we make no warranties or representations concerning the success of your claim or the favorable outcome of any legal action that may follow. </em>Nor do we make any representations as to the cost of representation as to [sic ] there are many unknown factors such as the efforts of any opposing party. (Emphasis added.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">With respect to remedies and dispute resolution, the agreement stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">Should we have to bring suit to collect any monies, which are due, and owing to us under this Agreement, it is agreed that if the Court should rule in our favor, you shall pay an additional 15 percent of any said judgment for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in prosecution of said case. <em>You agree in the event you have any complaint or controversy regarding our representation, either in terms of monies due and owing by you or the nature or competency of our representation, you agree to submit such issues to binding unappealable arbitration </em>with the American Arbitration Association. You understand by agreeing to same you are waiving <em>your </em>rights to file suit and have a trial, jury and otherwise, to litigate and resolve these issues. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The arbitration issue was presented early in the litigation with Wildman arguing, among other things, that the right to arbitration had been waived by Abramson\u2019s participation in judicial proceedings. In rejecting appellant\u2019s contentions, the circuit court set forth two grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">That <em>contract can not be in derogation of public policy. </em>I think it is patently unfair for an attorney who has that advantage in training and in practice, to write such a one sided fee agreement and have someone who is coming in looking for representation to sign it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">I can sue you but you can\u2019t sue me. If I sue you you\u2019re going to have to pay attorney fees. You\u2019re going to have to do this, you\u2019re going to have to do that but, you\u2019re waiving your right to litigate and resolve these issues. I, I just think, besides <em>I don\u2019t reach a waiver issue but I think that there is also a waiver. </em>(Emphasis added.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Throughout the litigation, Abramson challenged Wildman\u2019s breach of contract theory as a disguised attempt to press a legal malpractice tort. Not only was this defense advanced in an attempt to defeat appellee\u2019s breach of contract claim, it was raised to challenge the court\u2019s jury instructions on lawyer competence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It also surfaced in Abramson\u2019s attack on the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence with respect to the lawyer\u2019s competence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The contract/competency issue also affected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>damage claim as Wildman claimed he was entitled to contract damages equal to the previously-paid attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In essence, the five questions raised by Abramson can be distilled into two: whether arbitration was precluded or waived and whether appellee properly asserted a breach of contract action. The two reasons given by the circuit court for rejecting arbitration were that the arbitration clause in the retainer agreement was so one-sided as to violate public policy and that appellant had waived arbitration by his actions in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>judicial forum.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">A. PUBLIC POLICY VIOLATION</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The \u201cpublic policy\u201d argument was not made before the circuit judge who ruled on the Petition to Compel Arbitration. Nor is it pressed with great force in this Court. It is possible that the circuit court was simply responding to appellee\u2019s contention (made both in the circuit court and here) that the agreement\u2019s provision for access to or denial of judicial remedies was so one-sided as to lack mutuality.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Courts across the country have reached differing- results with respect to challenges to the validity or enforceability of mandatory arbitrary provisions in lawyer retainer agreements, particularly with respect to the arbitration of lawyer malpractice claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Compare Kamaratos v. Palias, </em>360 N.J.Super. 76, 821 A.2d 531, 535 (2003)(citing <em>Restatement (Third) on the Law Governing Lawyers </em>(2000) at \u00a7 42, comment b(iv), for the proposition that \u201cthere is nothing inherently improper about a lawyer and a client agreeing to arbitrate a fee dispute ... \u201d); <em>McGuire, Cornwell &amp; Blakey v. Grider, </em>765 F.Supp. 1048, 1051 (D.Colo.l991)(\u201cThe arbitration provisions here do not prospectively limit lawyer liability to the client. Rather, they merely shift determination of the malpractice claim to a different forum.\u201d); <em>Powers v. Dickson, Carlson &amp; Campillo, </em>54 Cal.App.4th 1102, 63 Cal.Rptr.2d 261, 266 (2nd Dist.l997)(Arbitration clause in retainer agreement was not a contract of adhesion.); and <em>Derfner &amp; Mahler, LLP v. Rhoades, </em>257 A.D.2d 431, 683 N.Y.S.2d 509, 510 (1999)(On its face, arbitration agreement did not violate rules of ethics), <em>with In re Godt, </em>28 S.W.3d 732, 739 (Tex.App.2000) (Arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>tion provision was not enforceable because the client did not act on the advice of independent counsel and independent counsel did not sign the agreement.);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Thornton v. Haggins, </em>2003 WL 23010100 (Ohio App.2003)(\u201cWe are persuaded by the cases finding such agreements unenforceable with regard to the malpractice disputes. [W]e agree that the best interests of the client require consultation with an independent attorney ... \u201d); <em>Larrison v. Scarola Reavis &amp; Parent LLP, </em>11 Misc.3d 572, 812 N.Y.S.2d 243, 248 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.2005)(A \u201cone-sided\u201d arbitration clause in a retainer agreement violated public policy and was unenforceable.); and <em>Kamaratos v. Palias, supra, </em>821 A.2d at 539-540 (Fuentes, J. concurring)(\u201cThe insertion of a commercial arbitration clause in a retainer agreement inherently violates [the trust between a lawyer and his client] by pitting the lawyer\u2019s interest against the client\u2019s. The terms and features of an arbitration clause are designed, not for the client\u2019s benefit, but to protect and advance the lawyer\u2019s interest in a forum of his or her own choosing.\u201d). <em>See also </em>Annot. Validity and construction of agreement between attorney and client to arbitrate disputes arising between them. 26 A.L.R. 5th 107 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The circuit court\u2019s conclusion that the arbitration clause violated public policy differs from the situation presented in these cases in that it focused on the agreement\u2019s apparent unfairness in allowing the lawyer to go to court to sue for his fees, while denying the client any resort to a judicial forum.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellant argues that although under the agreement there is an initial difference between the parties in access to judicial remedies, once appellee pressed his counterclaim, it forced both the fee dispute and the later breach of contract claim into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>arbitration. Thus, Abramson contends that the agreement is neither one-sided nor unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">As interesting as this question is, it is one we need not resolve, because we find that the circuit court was correct in its alternative holding that appellant waived his right to arbitration by his participation in the judicial forum.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">B. WAIVER OF ARBITRATION</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">A contracting party may intentionally relinquish his or her right to arbitrate. <em>Brendsel v. Winchester Construction Co., </em>162 Md.App. 558, 574, 875 A.2d 789 (2005). A finding of such a waiver is highly factual and a decision by the circuit court premised on those facts will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">On a number of occasions, Maryland appellate courts have addressed the issue of whether the right to arbitrate has been waived by participation in litigation that is inconsistent with an intent to insist upon enforcing arbitration. Participation in a judicial proceeding that results in a final judgment may, in certain circumstances, waive the right to arbitrate. <em>Charles J. Frank, Inc. v. Associated Jewish Charities of Baltimore, Inc., </em>294 Md. 443, 450 A.2d 1304 (1982). Some \u201climited participation\u201d in judicial proceedings does not constitute a waiver. <em>Harris v. Bridgford, </em>153 Md.App. 193, 206, 835 A.2d 253 (2003). Whether an answer directed to the merits is filed is a factor. <em>Brendsel, supra, </em>162 Md.App. at 576, 875 A.2d 789. Participation in \u201cextensive\u201d discovery is a factor in determining waiver. <em>Commonwealth Equity Servs. Inc. v. Messick, </em>152 Md.App. 381, 400, 831 A.2d 1144 (2003). However, also relevant is whether a party utilized discovery devices that would not have been available in arbitration. <em>Id. </em>at 401, 831 A.2d 1144. Delay in attempting to compel arbitration, by itself, may not be conclusive, <em>id. </em>at 397-98, 831 A.2d 1144, although coupled with prejudice to the other party can support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>a finding of waiver. <em>Id. </em>The filing of suit can be a \u201csignificant act in a waiver calculus, and in some instances it perhaps could be depositive.\u201d <em>Harris, supra, </em>153 Md.App. at 206, 835 A.2d 253. Nevertheless, if there is a legitimate reason for participating in litigation, it will not be deemed a waiver. <em>See, e.g., Charles J. Frank, Inc., supra, </em>294 Md. at 454, 450 A.2d 1304 (Litigation of an unrelated claim does not constitute a waiver of the right to arbitrate other claims.); and <em>Harris, </em>153 Md.App. at 207-08, 835 A.2d 253 (Filing suit after party withdrew from arbitration is not a waiver.) <em>See also </em>Annot. Defendant\u2019s participation in action as waiver of right to arbitration of dispute involved therein, 98 A.L.R.3d 767 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Balancing the relevant factors contained in the record, the circuit court was not clearly erroneous in its finding that appellant had waived his right to arbitrate. Although appellant can point to the retainer agreement itself as expressly authorizing his right to sue, and excusing the arbitration of his claim for fees, this does not neutralize this factor. The agreement required Wildman to arbitrate any fee \u201ccontroversy.\u201d Even an Answer by appellee (or a Notice of Intention to Defend) contesting fee liability should have triggered a response by appellant that arbitration was required.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We believe that the circuit court could reasonably have concluded that appellant\u2019s failure to initiate arbitration at that point was a factor favoring appellee\u2019s opposition to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Abramson filed a Notice of Intention to Defend and later an Answer to Wildman\u2019s Counterclaim. Then, more than a month before petitioning to compel arbitration, appellant served on Wildman interrogatories and a Request for Production of Documents.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This discovery, although not \u201cextensive\u201d, was information that appellant could not have obtained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>arbitration. <em>Commonwealth Equity Services, Inc., supra, </em>152 Md.App. at 401, 831 A.2d 1144. Nearly four months passed between Wildman\u2019s filing of his Counterclaim and Abramson\u2019s filing of his Petition to Compel Arbitration. Wildman was unable to obtain discovery during this period and not until the circuit court in August, 2005 rejected the Petition to Compel Arbitration.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Finally, unlike those cases where a party\u2019s involvement in some phase of litigation was legitimately explainable and thus, not inconsistent with an intent to arbitrate, <em>see </em>p. 10, <em>supra, </em>appellant has given no reason for persisting in the litigation. The belated insistence on arbitration has all the markings of a simple strategic decision to deny appellee a judicial forum and a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">For all of these reasons, we are unable to conclude that the circuit court was clearly erroneous in its finding that appellant had waived his right to arbitration by litigative actions inconsistent with an intent to enforce arbitration.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">C. BREACH OF CONTRACT</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Abramson concedes that the retainer agreement contains \u201cexpress contractual obligations\u201d that Wildman \u201cmay expect our firm to be both sensitive and professionally responsible to your situation.\u201d He also concedes, as he must, that he has a duty to provide competent legal advice and representation. <em>See </em>n. 6, <em>supra. </em>However, appellant contends that this specif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ic duty is not found in the retainer agreement and that the breach of such a duty can be remedied only by a tort action for legal malpractice.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In our view, this is not an accurate statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">In <em>Baker, Watts &amp; Co. v. Miles &amp; Stockbridge, </em>95 Md.App. 145, 189, n. 11, 620 A.2d 356 (1993), this Court said that \u201can action against an attorney for malpractice may be brought in contract or in tort.\u201d <em>Baker, Watts </em>relied on <em>Flaherty v. Weinberg, </em>303 Md. 116, 134, 492 A.2d 618 (1985), where the Court of Appeals said that it has classified an action for malpractice as \u201cbeing one in contract,\u201d whose \u201cgravamen is the negligent breach of the contractual duty.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This also appears to be the <em>Restatement\u2019s </em>position. <em>See Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers </em>(2000) at \u00a7 55, comment c. (\u201cOrdinarily, a plaintiff may cast a legal-malpractice claim as a tort claim, a contract claim, or both ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Before these pronouncements in <em>Baker, Watts and Flaherty, </em>this Court in <em>Fishow v. Simpson, </em>55 Md.App. 312, 318, 462 A.2d 540 (1983), expressed doubt with respect to the proposition that \u201clegal malpractice is a breach of contract in every case.\u201d In <em>Fishow, </em>a disappointed litigant asserted that her lawyer breached his contract with her by failing \u201cto act adequately\u201d in pursuing a particular theory in presenting her claim. <em>Id. </em>at 317, 462 A.2d 540. There, the client apparently premised her case on an implied contractual duty to exercise ordinary skill and knowledge in the rendition of professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>services. <em>Id. </em>In affirming a summary judgment for the lawyer, this Court said, <em>id. </em>at 318, 462 A.2d 540:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\">We agree that legal malpractice may give rise to an action for breach of contract in cases involving employment of an attorney to perform a specific service in accordance with clearly stated instructions from the client-employer. The present case, however, does not fall within that class of cases, and the court below properly so ruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Appellant appears to regard this language in <em>Fishow </em>as limiting a contract action for legal malpractice only to a suit for a violation of client instructions. However, this is only one type of lawyer malpractice that can be asserted in a contract action. <em>Mallen &amp; Smith\u2019s </em>Legal Malpractice treatise recognizes contract actions for: 1) breach of an express contract; 2) breach of an implied contract; 3) unsuccessful guarantee of a specific result;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> 4) and violation of a client\u2019s instructions. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 8:6-8:9. <em>See also Restatement, supra, </em>at \u00a7 55, comment c (distinguishing between a suit for disobeying a client\u2019s instructions and other contract actions against a lawyer.).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In any event, we need not assess the limits of <em>Fishow </em>or its consistency with later cases. It was an <em>implied </em>contract case, not one involving an <em>express </em>promise of professional responsibility, such as that found here.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>concedes that this was an express contractual obligation. As a \u201cspecific promise,\u201d it was enforceable in a breach of contract action. <em>See Mallen &amp; Smith, supra, </em>\u00a7 8:6. For these reasons, we see no merit to appellant\u2019s contention that Wildman\u2019s claim could only be brought as a legal malpractice tort and not as a breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">D. JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Appellant contends that the jury should not have been instructed regarding lawyer competence. However, liability for a breach of an asserted express contract of lawyer competence is no different than liability for a legal malpractice tort. <em>See Baker, Watts &amp; Co. v. Miles &amp; Stockbridge, supra, </em>95 Md.App. at 189, n. 11, 620 A.2d 356; and 26 Am.Jur.2d <em>Proof of Facts </em>\u00a7 26-703 (1981) (\u201cBecause the attorney\u2019s contract for professional services creates the relationship giving rise to his duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances in that undertaking, his negligence constitutes a breach of contract as well as a tort. In either case, the attorney\u2019s litigation is based on negligence and is governed by the duty to exercise reasonable care.\u201d). In a case such as this, the court was required to instruct the jury regarding lawyer competence. The definition given to the jury based on the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (Rule 1.1) was undoubtedly a correct one.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">E. ADMISSION OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">In a similar vein, Abramson objects to the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence regarding appellant\u2019s competency. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>However, as noted above, because Maryland caselaw allows a lawyer malpractice claim to be brought as a breach of contract action under the circumstances present here, evidence regarding competency would be relevant to the case, if not necessary for appellee to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">F. DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Appellant challenges the jury award of $24,525, the amount of attorney\u2019s fees paid by appellee. He contends that Wildman showed no damages resulting from the breach of the agreement, that the award was speculative and that the jury was confused.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">We have already concluded that it was permissible for Wildman to bring a legal malpractice claim as an action for breach of contract. It is not unusual for a successful party in a legal malpractice claim to recover fees previously paid. <em>See Lockhart v. Cade, </em>728 A.2d 65, 69-70 (D.C.1999)(\u201cA client who has advanced sums to an attorney to cover litigation costs and expenses is frequently allowed to recover those sums, as compensatory damages, in a subsequent malpractice action against the attorney.\u201d)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">According to <em>Mallen &amp; Smith, supra, </em>\u00a7 21.6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">Of course, unearned fees or costs, which were advanced, can be recovered. The legal fees and expenses paid by the client, however, may be the only damages sustained, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>recovery of which may be the sole or one of the objectives of the legal malpractice suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-4\">Similarly, 7 Am.Jur.2d <em>Attorneys at Law </em>\u00a7 262 (2007) notes: As a matter of policy, a lawyer should be regarded as \u201cearning\u201d his or her fee only when he or she provides legal services to his or her client in a manner consistent with his or her professional duties; consequently, a lawyer\u2019s improper conduct can reduce or eliminate the fee that the lawyer may reasonably charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Under this theory, Wildman\u2019s damages were far from speculative.

At trial, appellee\u2019s counsel gave the following explanation of his damage theory to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-27\">The contract is clear. My duty is to pay him. His duty is to do a good job and take care of me. And we\u2019re alleging Mr. Abramson did not do a good job and did not take care of him. In fact, didn't particularly care for this case. And as a result, he\u2019s spent $25,000 he didn\u2019t need to spend. You want his damages? They're $24,525. Every single penny he paid Mr. Abramson\u2019s office between March of 2003 and March of 2004.

Appellant argues that the latter issue was not the basis of the circuit court decision. However, despite some ambiguity on the point, the court\u2019s opinion discloses that the last word on the subject was \"I think there is also a waiver.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b244-9\">. Appellant took the position in the circuit court that the arbitration agreement\u2019s reference to complaints regarding \"competency of our representation\u201d meant that lawyer malpractice disputes were subject to arbitration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b245-6\">.

Appellee\u2019s filing of a Notice of Intention to Defend in the district court on January 19, 2005, did not deter appellant from his litigative course.

In light of this holding, we do not reach appellee\u2019s argument that the arbitration agreement lacked mutuality of obligation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b249-6\">. Appellant couches this issue as a failure \"to make a <em>prima facie </em>case of breach of contract.\" However, his argument does not focus on whether there was sufficient evidence of a breach of a contractual obligation, but on whether, as a matter of law, a contractual obligation existed at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\">. <em>Flaherty </em>also notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">[RJegardless of whether a plaintiff brings an attorney malpractice action in contract or tort, he must allege and prove the existence of a duty between the plaintiff and the defendant in the first instance.

A contract action for lawyer malpractice is of ancient vintage. In <em>Wilcox v.

An alternative theory for an \"express\u201d contract to exercise ordinary care and diligence in providing client advice and representation might be found in the \"law of the place\u201d doctrine. Under this rule, \"subsisting laws\" enter into and form part of a contract as if \"expressly\u201d referred to or incorporated in its terms. <em>State v.

In his brief, appellant argues that \"[i]t became abundantly clear that Wildman was not satisfied with the advice of Abramson, but rather than quantify any economic damages, the court allowed him to express his wrath in form of a malpractice action influencing and confusing the jury to Abramson's prejudice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b252-11\">.
