KARWACKI, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ap7\">(Ret., specially assigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">In July 2005, the Maryland Comptroller of the Treasury, appellee, issued Notices of Income Tax Assessment to David S. Antzis and Judith W. Antzis (\u201cthe Antzises\u201d), Timothy A. Frey and Mary S. Frey (\u201cthe Freys\u201d), and Rudolph Garcia and Randi E. Pastor-Garcia (\u201cthe Garcias\u201d), appellants, with respect to each of their joint Maryland Nonresident Tax Returns for the year ended December 31, 2004. Following an informal hearing before a hearing officer, the Antzises, Freys, and Garcias each received a Notice of Final Determination assessing them for failure to calculate the Special Nonresident Tax on their tax returns. Appellants were also assessed penalties and interest. They appealed to the Maryland Tax Court, where the cases were consolidated. The Tax Court affirmed the assessments but abated the penalties. Appellants petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The circuit court affirmed the assessment of the Special Nonresident Tax against appellants, but remanded the case to the Maryland Tax Court for consideration of abatement of interest. Appellants noted a timely appeal to this Court and present the following issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-10\">I. Whether the Special Nonresident Tax violates the Interstate Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>II. Whether the Special Nonresident Tax violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">III. Whether the Special Nonresident Tax violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">IV. Whether the Special Nonresident Tax violates the Maryland Constitution and Declaration of Rights because it is discriminatory against a special class of taxpayer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">V. Whether there is reasonable cause for the waiver of both penalties and interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">Appellee noted a cross-appeal and raises one issue:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-9\">I. Whether the Tax Court has discretionary authority to reduce or abate interest on the assessments against appellants when the interest is assessed by statute and no statute gives the Tax Court authority to reduce or modify the interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">For the reasons stated below, we hold that the Special Nonresident Tax does not violate the United States Constitution, Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights, or the Maryland Constitution. We also hold that the Tax Court has authority to consider the abatement of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">In 2004, appellants, three married couples, resided in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and paid Pennsylvania income taxes and various local taxes to its subdivisions. They did not own property in the State of Maryland and had no children enrolled in Maryland schools, but each couple filed a joint nonresident income tax return in Maryland because the husband was a partner in Saul Ewing, LLP (\u201cthe law firm\u201d or \u201cthe partnership\u201d), a multi-state law firm with offices in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Washington, D.C., New York, and New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">During the 2004 calendar year, Mr. Antzis conducted his legal practice at his office in Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania; Mr. Frey\u2019s office was located in Wilmington, Delaware; and Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Garcia\u2019s office was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Messrs. Antzis, Frey, and Garcia each paid Maryland State income taxes with respect to their allocable share of the profit from the law firm. The law firm apportions its income among the states in which it does business, which, under Md.Code (2004), \u00a7 10-210 of the Tax-General Article (\u201cT.G.\u201d), creates Maryland taxable income for appellants. There is also a withholding obligation for the law firm under T.G. \u00a7 10-102.1. These taxes are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In 2004, the General Assembly enacted a Special Nonresident Tax (\u201cSNRT\u201d), which applied to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003. 2004 Md. Laws 1915, 1928. The SNRT was imposed on an individual subject to Maryland State income tax, but not subject to the county or local income tax.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> T.G. \u00a7 10-106.1(a). The tax rate of the SNRT \u201cshall be equal to the lowest county income tax rate set by any Maryland county[.]\u201d T.G. \u00a7 10-106.1(b). Appellants did not pay the amount required by T.G. \u00a7 10-106.1 and thus were assessed by appellee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants requested an informal hearing, which was held before a hearing officer on September 19, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">On September 26, 2005, appellee issued Notices of Final Determination to each of the appellants. In the Notices, the hearing officer summarized appellants\u2019 positions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">Mr. Harry Shapiro, Esq. appeared on behalf of the Taxpayers [appellants]. He argued that the assessment against the Taxpayers is improper because the special nonresident tax violates the Interstate Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, as well as the Maryland Constitution. The basis for this claim is that the special nonresident tax places a tax burden on nonresidents that is not imposed on residents. Mr. Shapiro stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>the special nonresident tax is distinguishable from the local tax imposed on Maryland residents because the tax revenue from the special nonresident tax goes to the State of Maryland, while the tax revenue from the resident local tax goes to the Maryland counties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The hearing officer then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">Mr. Shapiro\u2019s constitutional challenges to the special nonresident tax exceed the scope of this hearing. Based upon the information provided, I find that the assessment was issued in accordance with Tax-General Article \u00a7 10-106.1. Therefore, the assessment is affirmed in the amounts stated above, which include additional interest accrued to date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The assessments, as affirmed by the hearing officer, for each couple were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">Appellant Tax Interest to Date Penalty Total</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHp\">Antzises $579.96 $37.77 $58.00 $675.73</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACB\">Freys $308.33 $20.08 $30.83 $359.24</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHC\">Garcias $1,607.73 $104.72 $160.77 $1,873.22</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">On October 24, 2005, appellants each filed a Petition of Appeal to the Maryland Tax Court. On February 15, 2006, by Order of the Tax Court, the cases were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">On May 10, 2006, a hearing was held before the Tax Court. No testimony was presented as the parties entered into a stipulation, but the court heard oral argument. By Order dated June 22, 2006, the Tax Court affirmed the assessments levied by appellee, but abated the penalty assessments. In its written opinion, the Tax Court commented that appellants had argued that T.G. \u00a7 10-106.1 \u201cexpressly discriminates against nonresidents by levying a tax on nonresident income which has no direct corollary with respect to residents.\u201d The Tax Court agreed that, \u201c[a]t first blush, \u00a7 10-106.1. does indeed appear to discriminate against the out-of-state taxpayer, arguably interfering with the free flow of commerce mandated by the Commerce Clause, as well as violating the privileges and immunities guaranteed by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d The Tax Court further noted that \u201c[t]his appearance of discrimination on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>surface ... does not end the inquiry\u201d because under <em>Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, </em>516 U.S. 325, 116 S.Ct. 848, 133 L.Ed.2d 796 (1996), the government may \u201covercome the presumption of invalidity \u2018by showing that the statute is a \u201ccompensatory tax\u201d designed simply to make interstate commerce bear a burden already borne by intrastate commerce.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 331, 116 S.Ct. 848 (citations omitted).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The Tax Court went on to apply the three-pronged test in <em>Fulton. </em>Under the first prong, which requires the State to identify the intrastate tax burden for which the State is attempting to compensate, <em>Fulton, </em>516 U.S. at 332, 116 S.Ct. 848, the Tax Court commented that local governmental benefits, such as \u201cpolice and fire protection, waste disposal, water and sewer services, and the myriad of other local governmental activities on behalf of people within each local jurisdiction, ... accrue both directly and indirectly to nonresidents while they are present or doing business in a jurisdiction.\u201d The Tax Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">Obviously, both residents and nonresidents receive these local governmental benefits by mere virtue of their physical presence within a jurisdiction, either in person or as part of a business entity doing business within the jurisdiction. It seems perfectly reasonable, therefore, for the State to seek compensation for these services from non-residents through the tax system. Although there is no direct mechanism to allocate the special non-resident tax revenue to a particular county, the General Fund of Maryland exists to provide funding for the benefit of all Maryland Counties and Baltimore City, selectively, through legislation and through the legislative budgeting process. In this regard, the evidence is clear that the burden on intrastate commerce for which \u00a7 10-106.1., is compensating, is the burden of providing local governmental services, directly or indirectly, to all persons or entities situate or doing business within its local borders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">When considering the second prong under <em>Fulton, </em>the Tax Court concluded that the SNRT \u201croughly approximates, but does not exceed the amount of the tax burden imposed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>residents.\u201d <em>See Fulton, </em>516 U.S. at 332, 116 S.Ct. 848 (\u201cSecond, \u2018the tax on interstate commerce must be shown roughly to approximate \u2014 but not exceed \u2014 the amount of the tax on intrastate commerce.\u2019 \u201d) The Tax Court stated: \u201cIt is clear from the language of the statute, coupled with the existence of county income taxes paid by residents, that non-residents pay no more, and in most cases less, than their resident counterparts.\u201d The Tax Court commented that although <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Blanton, </em>390 Md. 528, 890 A.2d 279 (2006), made \u201cclear that the County income taxes are not just an element of the State income tax, but are rather separate and distinct taxes[,]\u201d that \u201cdistinction does little to answer the question of whether \u00a7 10-106.1., as applied, is unconstitutional.\u201d The Tax Court found that \u201cthe distinction between the state and county income taxes to be irrelevant to the constitutional issue.\u201d The Tax Court added: \u201cThe facts reveal that the non-resident taxpayers are paying the same rate overall as the resident taxpayers, based on their Maryland income. Viewing this from a federal perspective, the burden on each class of taxpayer is the same overall.\u201d The Tax Court stated: \u201c\u00a7 10-106.1. ensures that non-residents pay Maryland income taxes at the same rate or a lesser rate as Maryland residents, albeit the revenue derived from this taxation is distributed differently once collected.\u201d Thus, the Tax Court concluded that the fact that the tax collected is distributed differently did not affect the constitutionality of the SNRT.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The third prong of the test requires that the \u201cthe events on which the interstate and intrastate taxes are imposed must be \u2018substantially equivalent\u2019; that is, they must be sufficiently similar in substance to serve as mutually exclusive \u2018proxies]\u2019 for each other.\u201d <em>Fulton, </em>516 U.S. at 333, 116 S.Ct. 848 (citations omitted). The Tax Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">With respect to \u00a7 10-106.1., income is the event on which the tax is based for both residents and non-residents. Being the same event for both classes of taxpayer, it meets the test for \u2018substantially equivalent.\u2019 Hence, the third prong of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the three-part test under <em>Fulton </em>is also satisfied, and this Court finds that \u00a7 10-106.1. is a valid compensatory tax.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The Tax Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">[TJhis Court finds that \u00a7 10-106.1. serves a rational purpose to create parity in the income tax burdens between Maryland residents and non-residents. There is no extra tax burden that would deter a non-resident from free and open commerce inside or outside the state, and there is no extra tax burden that might be construed to violate the privileges and immunities, and equal protection accorded to everyone. Accordingly, \u00a7 10-106.1. does not violate the Interstate Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution, or the Maryland Constitution and the Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The Tax Court also abated the penalties, but concluded that it did not have the authority to abate interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Appellants petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, where the cases were again consolidated. A hearing was held on July 2, 2007, and, by Order dated July 18, 2007, the circuit court affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s Order upholding the assessment of the SNRT, but remanded the case to the Tax Court \u201cfor consideration of abatement of interest.\u201d In its Memorandum Opinion, the circuit court stated that the local or county income tax was, in fact, a State tax:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">It is clear from the statute, the legislative history and the applicable case authorities that the special nonresident tax is intended to make up for the fact that nonresidents do not pay the county tax. However, the so-called county tax is, in fact, a component of the State tax and not a separate tax altogether.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">The circuit court recognized that the county portion of the income tax was distributed to the counties while the SNRT was distributed to the General Fund of the State, but conclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>ed that \u201cthe ultimate use of the funds is not dispositive of the question.\u201d The circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">As the local/county tax is a component of the Maryland State income tax and the total rate payable by nonresidents does not exceed that paid by residents, it follows that the nonresident tax does not place any increased burden upon nonresidents. Therefore, this tax is not discriminatory and does not violate any of the constitutional provisions relied upon by Petitioners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Regarding the abatement of interest, the circuit court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">Section 13-606 [of the Tax-General Article], entitled Waiver of Interest, provides that \u201c[f]or reasonable cause, a tax collector may waive interest on unpaid tax.\u201d This Section parallels [Section] 13-714 and clearly authorizes the abatement of interest in the appropriate circumstances. The Tax Court erroneously concluded that it did not have authority to waive interest, and declined to exercise its discretion in this regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">While the Circuit Court has the power to determine <em>de novo </em>a question of law, this court may not rule on a discretionary matter in the first instance. Accordingly, the case will be remanded to the Tax Court for consideration of waiver of interest under Section 13-606. If this Court had the authority to make the decision regarding abatement of interest, the Court would be inclined to waive interest on the unpaid tax. This Court finds that the issues raised by Petitioners are substantial, and that they pursued this matter in good faith and with reasonable cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Appellants then noted an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Appellants claim that the SNRT is an additional Maryland State income tax imposed exclusively on nonresident taxpayers; therefore, it violates the commerce clause. According to appellants, as a result of the SNRT, in 2004, nonresidents were subject to Maryland State income tax at a rate of 6%, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>that is, the 4.75% rate for the State income tax plus the 1.25% for the SNRT. In contrast, they claim that Maryland residents had to pay only Maryland State income tax at a rate of 4.75%. Appellants assert that they \u201cwere subjected to Maryland State income tax at a rate more than 25% higher than the rate imposed on residents.\u201d Appellants thus claim \u201cthat the SNRT is unconstitutional because (1) on its face, the SNRT discriminates against non-resident taxpayers and is thus <em>prima facie </em>unconstitutional and (2) the SNRT is not a valid \u2018compensatory tax\u2019 under the three part test set forth by the Supreme Court in\u201d <em>Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, </em>516 U.S. 325, 116 S.Ct. 848, 133 L.Ed.2d 796 (1996). Appellants allege that the Tax Court incorrectly determined that the SNRT was a valid compensatory tax. They also claim that the circuit court failed to mention <em>Fulton </em>in its opinion and that it thus appears that the circuit court opinion is \u201cpredicated on the position that the SNRT does not discriminate against nonresidents because the local income taxes imposed by Maryland counties and the City of Baltimore are merely a component of Maryland State income taxes, and thus non-residents are not subjected to higher Maryland State income taxes than residents.\u201d Appellants claim that this conclusion is directly contrary to the previous position of appellee and the Court of Appeals\u2019 recent decision in <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Blanton, </em>390 Md. 528, 890 A.2d 279 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Appellee responds that the SNRT does not treat nonresidents less favorably than residents because the tax is structured so that nonresidents will always pay the same or less tax on the same amount of income as residents pay. Appellee asserts that the SNRT is not disfavored treatment of nonresidents, but is a special method of state tax computation necessary to create equal treatment. Appellee refers us to U.S. Supreme Court cases and cases from our sister states to claim that it is not unconstitutional discrimination if the State uses different or distinctive methods to calculate the tax on nonresidents, so long as the burden on equivalent incomes \u2014 that of the resident and the in-state income of the nonresident \u2014 are the same. Appellee asserts that the courts have rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>formalistic distinctions that appellants attempt to draw and, instead, focus on the actual tax obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Appellee further claims that the SNRT is a State tax and that the county tax imposed on residents is a State tax for constitutional purposes. It alleges that <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Blanton, </em>390 Md. 528, 890 A.2d 279 (2006), did not alter that conclusion. Appellee thus asserts that the SNRT is not discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\u201cDespite its name, the Tax Court is not a court; instead, it is an adjudicatory administrative agency in the executive branch of state government.\u201d <em>Fumitureland, South, Inc. v.

At other times, the Court has compared the taxes imposed on an activity or product that is conducted, made, or sold both in-state and out-of-state, but which taxes the out-of-state activity or product at a higher rate. <em>See Oregon Waste, </em>511 U.S. at 99, 114 S.Ct. 1345 (surcharge on out-of-state waste that was three times higher than charge imposed on in-state waste was facially discriminatory); <em>Chemical Waste Mgmt., Inc. v.

It is thus a State-imposed tax that nonresidents pay. In 1967, the concept of the local or county income tax was adopted for the first time. <em>Stern v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>271 Md. 310, 312, 316 A.2d 240 (1974). In <em>Stern, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the question before the Court of Appeals was whether the Sterns were entitled to claim a credit for income taxes paid to New York State against that portion of their Maryland income tax that would be collected by the Comptroller and paid to Montgomery County where Petitioners resided. <em>Id. </em>at 310, 316 A.2d 240. For two years, the Sterns filed Maryland income tax returns and took as a credit against the State and local income tax the amount of income taxes paid to New York State. <em>Id. </em>at 312, 316 A.2d 240. The Comptroller assessed a deficiency along with penalty and interest. <em>Id. </em>at 313, 316 A.2d 240. In the Tax Court, the assessments were affirmed and the Sterns appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">At the time in question, Art. 81, \u00a7 290 allowed Maryland residents a credit for income taxes paid to another state and provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">Whenever a resident individual of this State has become liable for income tax to another state upon such part of his net income for the taxable year as is properly subject to taxation in such state, <em>the amount of income tax payable by him under this subtitle </em>shall be reduced by the amount of the income tax so paid by him to such other state upon his producing to the Comptroller satisfactory evidence of the fact of such payment; but application of such credit shall not operate to reduce the tax payable under this subtitle to an amount less than would have been payable if the income subjected to tax in such other state were ignored.... (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The provision allowing for the local income tax then appeared in Art. 81, \u00a7 283(a) and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">The county council or board of county commissioners of any county and the mayor and city council of Baltimore, by ordinance or resolution enacted pursuant to their ordinary and regular legislative procedure, shall adopt, by reference, a local income tax imposed upon the residents of any county or Baltimore City as a percentage of the liability of such resident for State income tax. Any ordinance or resolution so enacted shall impose a rate of tax for any current <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>calendar year and may provide that such tax rate shall continue in effect for each succeeding calendar year, unless and until such tax rate is changed or modified by a subsequent ordinance or resolution. Any income tax so adopted shall not be less than twenty (20) percent nor more than fifty (50) percent of the State income tax liability of such resident, and any such tax imposed, and any increase or decrease in any tax so imposed, shall be in increments of five (5) percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">In <em>Stern, </em>the Court of Appeals discussed the nature of the local income tax:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA3\">We think that the case turns simply on a question of statutory construction. When section 290 provides that <em>\u201cthe amount of income tax payable by him under this subtitle </em>shall be reduced by the amount of the income tax so paid by him to such other state\u201d (emphasis supplied), reference is clearly being made to taxes imposed by sections 729 through 323A of article 81, subtitled \u201cIncome Tax.\u201d While the argument that the tax is actually imposed by the ordinance or resolution adopted by the political subdivision is liminally attractive, its appeal is considerably attenuated by the provision of section 283(c) that \u201cLocal income taxes imposed pursuant to this section shall be subject to the provisions of \u00a7 312 of this subtitle relating generally to withholding at the source, declaration of estimated tax due, and remittance thereof to the Comptroller.\u201d Further, section 283(a) has provided since 1969 that the counties and Baltimore City <em>\u201cshall adopt </em>\u201d (emphasis supplied) local income taxes. There is no discretion in the subdivisions to adopt or refuse to adopt such a tax; the imposition of the tax is mandatory, and it is only with respect to the establishment of the rate of tax that the local governments retain a modicum of flexibility. In other words, one mechanism, that prescribed by the subtitle, is used for the collection of the tax imposed by section 288(a) (individuals), section 288(b) (corporations), and that created by section 283.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-6\"><em>Stem, </em>271 Md. at 313-14, 316 A.2d 240 (footnote omitted). The Court of Appeals reversed the Tax Court and allowed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>out-of-state taxes to reduce the Sterns\u2019 local income tax liability because the credit provided for in Art. 81, \u00a7 290 was allowed against State taxes. <em>Id. </em>at 313-15, 316 A.2d 240. The Court of Appeals thus concluded that the local income tax was a State tax because it was imposed by State law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">More recently, in <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Blanton, </em>390 Md. 528, 890 A.2d 279 (2006), the Court of Appeals was asked to determine whether a tax credit provided pursuant to T.G. \u00a7 10-703(a) could properly be applied to both State and local income taxes paid by an individual. <em>Id. </em>at 530-31, 890 A.2d 279. Tax General \u00a7 10-703(a) provides, in relevant part, that \u201ca resident may claim a credit only against the State income tax.\u201d The Court of Appeals concluded that T.G. \u00a7 10-703(a) \u201cdoes not reduce the amount owed by a Maryland resident for local income tax. The tax credit may be applied only to reduce the amount of an individual\u2019s state income tax liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531, 890 A.2d 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In 2001, the Blantons were residents of Baltimore County and held property interests in North Carolina. <em>Id. </em>They paid income taxes in both states. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals noted that the Blantons were allowed a credit for the North Carolina income tax they paid, but that credit was nearly $6,000.00 less than the total amount of income tax they had paid to North Carolina. <em>Id. </em>at 532, 890 A.2d 279. In addition, this credit reduced the Maryland State income tax they owed, but did not affect the local income tax. <em>Id. </em>The total income tax owed by the Blantons was $ 10,875.60. <em>Id. </em>The amount owed after prior payments, taxes withheld, and all credits and offsets was $4,637.60. <em>Id. </em>On their 2001 Resident Maryland Tax Return, however, the Blantons subtracted the North Carolina income tax amount from the total of their Maryland state income tax and local income tax. <em>Id. </em>The Blantons thus calculated the amount of Maryland Tax owed to be $4,998.00. <em>Id. </em>The Blantons enclosed a letter with their tax return, asserting that the tax return form was flawed because it required that the State and local income taxes be calculated independently of each other. <em>Id. </em>Although the Blantons claimed that they paid the Comptroller a total of $4,998.00, the Comptroller sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>them a letter requiring them to pay the outstanding tax balance of $4,637.60. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The Blantons requested an informal hearing, after which the Comptroller affirmed the assessment. <em>Id. </em>at 532-33, 890 A.2d 279. The Blantons appealed to the Tax Court, which \u201cdetermined that the Legislature defined State tax and local tax as two distinct taxes, and, as such, they \u2018are not the same, they are two separate ideas.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533, 890 A.2d 279. The Tax Court further concluded that T.G. \u00a7 10-703(a) \u201cdirects a credit against the State income tax only.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533, 890 A.2d 279. The Tax Court affirmed the Comptroller\u2019s decision, holding that \u201cthe Legislature intended for the credit to apply against the State income tax and not the local income tax.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533, 890 A.2d 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The Blantons petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, which reversed the Tax Court. <em>Id. </em>Relying on <em>Stem, </em>the circuit court held that the definition of \u201cState income tax\u201d included the local income tax for purposes of the tax credit provided for in T.G. \u00a7 10-703(a). <em>Id. </em>at 533, 890 A.2d 279. The Comptroller appealed that decision to this Court, but before we could decide the appeal, the Court of Appeals, on its own initiative, issued a writ of certiorari. <em>Id. </em>at 531, 890 A.2d 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The Court of Appeals framed the issue before it: \u201c[WJhether the language of \u00a7 10-703(a) of the Tax-General Article allows for a credit solely toward the State income tax, or allows for a credit toward both State and local income taxes.\u201d <em>Blanton, </em>390 Md. at 535, 890 A.2d 279. The Court of Appeals held that T.G. \u00a7 10-703(a) referred \u201conly to the State income tax.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535, 890 A.2d 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Tax General \u00a7 10-703(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">\u00a7 10-703 Tax paid to another state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a resident may claim a credit only against the State income tax for a taxable year in the amount determined under subsection (c) of this section for State tax on income paid to another state for the year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>The Court of Appeals concluded that the statute was unambiguous. <em>Blanton, </em>390 Md. at 537, 890 A.2d 279. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>if the General Assembly had intended to include, in the availability of the tax credit, both State and local income tax, it could have clearly stated that intent. It did not. Instead, the Legislature used the words \u201conly ... State income tax.\u201d In its expression of one narrow objective (a credit against only the State income tax), it canceled out all other possibilities. The word \u201conly\u201d is limited by what it expresses, the credit applies only toward the State portion of the income tax, not the local income tax. The plain meaning of the statute is that the local tax is excluded, and only State tax may be offset or reduced. We hold that \u00a7 10-703(a) of the Tax-General Article shows a clear legislative intent to limit the credit to State income tax to Maryland residents who also pay income tax to another state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 539, 890 A.2d 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The Blantons relied on <em>Stem, </em>but the Court of Appeals noted that following <em>Stem, </em>the Legislature \u201cquickly\u201d amended Art. 81, \u00a7 290. <em>Id. </em>at 542, 890 A.2d 279. The Court wrote: \u201cIn February 1975, the Legislature enacted emergency legislation, amended \u00a7 290 by adding \u00a7 290(b), which provided that only the income tax portion of the State tax could be reduced and no reduction from the local tax portion would be permitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541, 890 A.2d 279 (citation omitted). Article 81, \u00a7 290(b) then provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">[Wjith respect to the taxable year 1974 and each taxable year thereafter, the credit provided for by this section operates to reduce only the State income tax payable under this subtitle and does not operate to reduce any local income tax imposed....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">When Art. 81, \u00a7 290(a) and (b) were recodified as T.G. \u00a7 10-703, the language of \u00a7 290(b) was deemed unnecessary. <em>Blanton, </em>390 Md. at 542, 890 A.2d 279. Relying on the Revisor\u2019s Note, the Court of Appeals explained: \u201c[T]he Legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>lature intended that the addition of the word \u2018only\u2019 in \u00a7 290(a) would replace \u00a7 290(b). Further, \u00a7 290(b) was deemed \u2018unnecessary.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542, 890 A.2d 279. The Court thus concluded: \u201c[W]e hold that the Legislature did not intend the term \u2018only against the State income tax\u2019 to include local income tax for purposes of credits under \u00a7 10-703(a) of the Tax-General Article.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, 890 A.2d 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Contrary to appellants\u2019 assertion, in <em>Blanton </em>the Court of Appeals did not determine that the local income tax imposed under T.G. \u00a7 10-106 was not a State tax for constitutional purposes. Rather, the Court determined that the local income tax did not fall within the meaning of \u201conly against the State income tax\u201d under T.G. \u00a7 10-703(a). We perceive nothing in <em>Blanton </em>that requires the conclusion that the local income tax is not a State-imposed tax. <em>Blanton </em>holds only that the local income tax is not the same as the State income tax within the meaning of T.G. \u00a7 10-703(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In appellants\u2019 case, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County correctly noted: \u201cThe Court of Appeals\u2019 observation in <em>Blanton </em>that the State tax and the local tax are two distinct taxes does not mean that they are imposed by different authorities.\u201d The State and county taxes are different, but that does not mean that they are not both State taxes. They are imposed by the same authority. The local tax is not imposed by the county, it is imposed by the State. We thus conclude that the local income tax imposed under T.G. \u00a7 10-106 is a State tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Nor do we perceive any discrimination because the proceeds from the SNRT are distributed to the General Fund of the State, while the proceeds from the local income tax, after certain other distributions are completed, are distributed by the Comptroller to each county. The taxes are both paid to the State and the State distributes the revenue. Moreover, they are both income taxes, that is, general forms of taxation that distribute the expenses of government. <em>See generally Oregon Waste, </em>511 U.S. at 104, 114 S.Ct. 1345 (\u201c[general] tax payments are received for the general purposes of the [gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>eminent], and are, upon proper receipt, lost in the general revenues\u201d) (quoting <em>Flast v.

The Court added: \u201cEven assuming, however, that various other means of general taxation, such as income taxes, could serve as an identifiable intrastate burden roughly equivalent to the out-of-state surcharge, respondents\u2019 compensatory tax argument fails because the in-state and out-of-state levies are not imposed on substantially equivalent events.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is, the third prong of the analysis was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">The prototypical example of substantially equivalent taxable events is the sale and use of articles of trade.

For the intermediate cases, holders of stock were able to look up the taxable percentage for a large number of corporations as determined and published annually by the North Carolina Secretary of Revenue (Secretary). In 1990, for example, the Secretary determined the appropriate taxable percentage of IBM stock to be 95%, meaning that IBM did 5% of its business in North Carolina, with its stock held by North Carolina residents being taxable on 95% of its value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-6\"><em>Fulton, </em>516 U.S. at 328,116 S.Ct. 848 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Fulton Corp. was a North Carolina company that owned stock in six other corporations, five of which did no business and earned no income in the State. <em>Id. </em>As a result, Fulton\u2019s stock in those five corporations was subject to the intangibles tax on 100% of its value. <em>Id. </em>The sixth corporation in which Fulton held stock conducted 46% of its business in North Carolina; therefore, Fulton\u2019s stock in that corporation was subject to an intangibles tax on 54% of its value. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Upon considering the intangibles tax, the Supreme Court concluded that it was facially discriminatory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">There is no doubt that the intangibles tax facially discriminates against interstate commerce.

The Supreme Court summarized the Secretary\u2019s position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">The Secretary\u2019s theory is that one of the services provided by the State, and supported through its general corporate income tax, is the maintenance of a capital market for corporations wishing to sell stock to North Carolina residents.

The fact that the manufacturing tax is not reduced when a West Virginia manufacturer sells its goods out of State, and that it is reduced when part of the manufacturing takes place out of State, makes clear that the manufacturing tax is just that, and not in part a proxy for the gross receipts tax imposed on Armco and other sellers from other States.\u201d) (footnote omitted); <em>Boston Stock Exchange, </em>429 U.S. at 331, 97 S.Ct. 599 (amendment to New York State transfer tax statute, which afforded nonresidents a 50% reduction in the rate of tax when the transaction involved an in-state sale of shares and limited the total tax liability of any taxpayer, resident or nonresident, to $350 if it involved a New York sale of shares violated the commerce clause because the \u201cobvious effect of the tax [was] to extend a financial advantage to sales on the New York exchanges at the expense of the regional exchanges\u201d; the tax did not \u201ccompensate\u201d for a prior New York tax statute, which taxed a sale and transfer of shares in New York the same as a transaction involving instate transfer but an out-of-state sale, and, instead, \u201cforeclose[d] tax-neutral decisions and create[d] both an advantage for the exchanges in New York and a discriminatory burden on commerce to its sister states\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Turning to the present case, we conclude that the SNRT is a valid compensatory tax. Under the first prong of the test, the \u201cState must, as a threshold matter, \u2018identify] ... the [intrastate tax] burden for which the State is attempting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>compensate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oregon Waste, </em>511 U.S. at 103, 114 S.Ct. 1345 (quoting <em>Maryland v. Louisiana, </em>451 U.S. at 758, 101 S.Ct. 2114). In finding that the first prong was met, the Tax Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">As to prong one of the three prong <em>Fulton </em>test, the Comptroller asserts that \u00a7 10-106.1., strives to equalize the income tax burden between residents and non-residents, and that non-residents will not pay more than residents who are also subject to a county tax. The Comptroller contends that this alone is sufficient to justify imposing the special non-resident tax. Not surprisingly, Petitioners [appellants] argue that the special non-resident tax is not compensating for any burden imposed on intrastate commerce for which residents are paying the county tax, and fails, therefore, to satisfy the first prong of identifying the intrastate tax burden for which the facially discriminatory tax is compensating. <em>Fulton, </em>516 U.S. at 332, 116 S.Ct. 848. Petitioners argue that the special tax compensates for nothing, and cannot be \u201cfairly related to the services provided by the State [which benefit interstate commerce].\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">To fully explore these contrasting points-of-view, this Court questioned counsel as to whether the nonresident taxpayer gains any direct or indirect benefit from local services being provided by a Maryland county or Baltimore City. Such local services traditionally include police and fire protection, waste disposal, water and sewer services, and the myriad of other local governmental activities on behalf of people within each local jurisdiction. It was conceded that such local benefits do, in fact, accrue both directly and indirectly to nonresidents <footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark> while they are present or doing business in a jurisdiction. Obviously, both residents and nonresidents receive these local governmental benefits by mere virtue of their physical presence within a jurisdiction, either in person or as part of a business entity doing business within the jurisdiction. It seems perfectly reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>able, therefore, for the State to seek compensation for these services from non-residents through the tax system. Although there is no direct mechanism to allocate the special non-resident tax revenue to a particular county, the General Fund of Maryland exists to provide funding for the benefit of all Maryland counties and Baltimore City, selectively, through legislation and through the legislative budgeting process. In this regard, the evidence is clear that the burden on intrastate commerce for which \u00a7 10-106.1., is compensating, is the burden of providing local governmental services, directly or indirectly, to all persons or entities physically situate or doing business within its local borders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Appellants assert that, at oral argument before the Tax Court, counsel for appellants stated that the real estate and personal property taxes paid by the law firm compensated the local jurisdictions for the various governmental services they provided. Appellants further contend that the Tax Court misunderstood the first prong of the <em>Fulton </em>test. They refer us to the Supreme Court\u2019s acknowledgment in <em>Fulton </em>that \u201c \u2018use taxes on products purchased out of state are the only taxes we have upheld in recent memory under the compensatory tax doctrine.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fulton, </em>516 U.S. at 338, 116 S.Ct. 848 (quoting <em>Oregon Waste, </em>511 U.S. at 105, 114 S.Ct. 1345). The Supreme Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">On the other hand, we have rejected equivalence arguments for pairing taxes upon the earning of income and the disposing of waste, the severance of natural resources from the soil and the use of resources imported from other States, and the manufacturing and wholesaling of tangible goods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\"><em>Fulton, </em>516 U.S. at 338-39, 116 S.Ct. 848 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The difficulty with appellants\u2019 position is that the above quoted portions of <em>Fulton </em>address the third prong of the compensatory tax analysis and not the first prong. Accordingly, it has no relevance to our determination of whether appellee has met the first prong of the test, that is, whether appellee has adequately identified the intrastate tax burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>for which the State is attempting to compensate. We will, however, consider this argument when we reach the third prong of the compensatory tax analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Appellants also claim that the SNRT does not compensate for any burden imposed on intrastate commerce for which residents pay the county income tax. Appellants further allege that the county income tax is different from the State income tax in several respects. First, unlike the State income tax, which is paid to the General Fund of the State, the county income tax is distributed to the county or Baltimore City where the taxpayer resides. Second, the county or Baltimore City decides how the revenue from the county income tax is to be spent. Third, the revenues are used by the county or Baltimore City for governmental services and purposes while the expenditures from the state income tax are determined by the Governor and the General Assembly. Further, appellants contend, the SNRT is added to the General Fund of the State just as the State income tax is added to the General Fund; therefore, the SNRT is not compensating for any burden imposed on intrastate commerce for which residents pay the county income tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Appellee responds that the first prong is met \u201cbecause the in-state burden that the special nonresident tax is designed to equalize is the total income tax paid by state residents \u2014 the combined state and local components of the state income tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Here, as found by the Tax Court, the county income tax is the burden on intrastate commerce for which the SNRT is attempting to compensate. The county income tax and the SNRT are imposed on an in-state activity, that is, earning income in Maryland. In addition, both taxes are general revenue taxes designed to support government services. <em>Cf. Maryland v. Louisiana, </em>451 U.S. at 758-59, 101 S.Ct. 2114 (Louisiana\u2019s first-use tax did not compensate for the State\u2019s severance tax on local production of natural gas; Louisiana has an interest in protecting its natural resources and chose to impose a severance tax on the privilege of severing resources from the soil, but the first-use tax did not meet the same ends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>since it was imposed on the severance of resources from the federally owned continental shelf and thus Louisiana has no sovereign interest in being compensated for resources from land it does not own; \u201c[t]he two events are not comparable in the same fashion as a use tax complements a sales tax\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Appellants assert that they already pay real and personal property taxes, but so do residents. Indeed, any individual owning property in Maryland may be subject to property tax. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2007), \u00a7 6-101(a)(l) of the Tax-Property Article (\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this article, all property located in this State is subject to assessment and property tax and is taxable to the owner of the property.\u201d); \u00a7 l-101(z) of the Tax Property Article (\u201cproperty\u201d is defined as \u201creal and personal property\u201d). The SNRT, however, is only equalizing the income tax burden on residents and nonresidents who earn income in Maryland. The fact that appellants pay property taxes does not affect the validity of the SNRT.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Under the second prong of the compensatory tax analysis, \u201cthe tax on interstate commerce must be shown roughly to approximate \u2014 but not exceed \u2014 the amount of the tax on intrastate commerce.\u201d <em>Oregon Waste, </em>511 U.S. at 103, 114 S.Ct. 1345. Here, the Tax Court found, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">It is clear from the language of the statute [the SNRT], coupled with the existence of county income taxes paid by residents, that non-residents pay no more, and in most cases less, than their resident counterparts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">Petitioners argue that the facial discrimination against non-resident taxpayers is in no way cured or offset by the fact that, in addition to Maryland state income tax, resident taxpayers are also subject to county income taxes. Petitioners find significance in the fact that county income taxes are imposed by each separate county in Maryland, and not by the State of Maryland. Likewise, the counties set their own local tax rate. Petitioners add that the proceeds of all county taxes are remitted to the counties that impose them, and are used exclusively to provide governmental services to residents of those counties. In contrast, the special non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>resident tax is imposed by the State of Maryland, and all proceeds from this tax are distributed to the General Fund of the State of Maryland. In support of this distinction, Petitioners cite <em>Comptroller of The Treasury v. Edward L. Blanton, Jr., et al., </em>390 Md. 528, 890 A.2d 279 (2006) where the Court of Appeals of Maryland, upholding a Tax Court finding, make[s] it clear that the County income taxes are not just an element of the State income tax, but are rather separate and distinct taxes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-4\">Although it is clear from <em>Blanton </em>that the State income tax and the county income tax are separate taxes, this distinction does little to answer the question of whether \u00a7 10-106.1., as applied, is unconstitutional. The Court finds the distinction between the state and county income taxes to be irrelevant to the constitutional issue. The facts reveal that the non-resident taxpayers are paying the same rate overall as the resident taxpayers, based on their Maryland income. Viewing this from a federal perspective, the burden on each class of taxpayer is the same overall. For example, if one looks at the border between Maryland and other jurisdictions and asks ... is a non-resident outsider paying more income tax than an inside resident, simply because he is a non-resident outsider ... the answer is no, he is not paying more. There is merit, therefore, in the Comptroller\u2019s assertion that what matters is not where the revenue is allocated, but rather whether there is a discriminatory burden on nonresidents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">The Comptroller states that numerous cases have sustained state taxes against claims of discrimination, even thought] the taxes are calculated in different ways for residents and non-residents. Thus in <em>Shaffer v. Carter, </em>252 U.S. 37, 40 S.Ct. 221, 64 L.Ed. 445 (1920), the court sustained a tax calculation method that was different for a nonresident and only allowed him to deduct losses from operations within the taxing state. Under this rule, states are free to limit non-residents to deductions related to income within the taxing state, even if deductions allowed to residents are not so limited. Additional case examples were cited which need not be described here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The Comptroller\u2019s position is that a distinction in the direction of funds does not affect the amount Petitioners pay, and therefore cannot be unconstitutional discrimination. In support of this assertion, the Comptroller cites <em>Lundi[n]g v. N.Y. Tax Appeals Tribunal, </em>522 U.S. 287, 118 S.Ct. 766, 139 L.Ed.2d 717 (1998) for the proposition that states must be afforded a \u201cconsiderable amount of leeway in aligning the tax burden of nonresidents to in-state activities.\u201d Indeed, a reference in <em>Fulton </em>supports this same contention. Quoting Justice Cardozo in <em>Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, </em>286 U.S. 472, 480, 52 S.Ct. 631, 76 L.Ed. 1232 (1932), explaining a compensatory tax scheme, \u201cthe stranger from afar is subject to no greater burdens as a consequence of ownership than the dweller within the gates. The one pays upon one activity or incident, and the other upon another, but the sum is the same when the reckoning is closed.\u201d \u00a7 10-106.1. ensures that non-residents pay Maryland income taxes at the same rate or lesser rate as Maryland residents, albeit the revenue derived from this taxation is distributed differently once collected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Appellants claim that the Tax Court erred in concluding that the State income tax combined with the SNRT paid by the nonresident is not greater than the sum of the State income tax and county income tax paid by the resident. Appellants insist that this analysis fails because the SNRT is not the same as the county income tax, that is, they are collected by two different governments and the county income tax is spent by the county or Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Appellants also contend that in <em>Fulton </em>the Supreme Court \u201crejected a similar argument with respect to the Intangibles tax.\u201d Relying on <em>Fulton, </em>appellants claim that appellee cannot demonstrate \u201cwhat portion of the SNRT goes to support the various services that the Tax Court noted as being provided in the City of Baltimore[]\u201d where the law firm has its Maryland offices. Appellants assert that \u201c[t]he SNRT, like the income tax, is commingled with funds from other sources, and it is impossible to track it to any particular expenditure.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>They allege that the two cases cited by the Tax Court, <em>Shaffer v. Carter, </em>252 U.S. 37, 40 S.Ct. 221, 64 L.Ed. 445 (1920), and <em>Lunding v. New York Tax Appeals Tribunal, </em>522 U.S. 287, 118 S.Ct. 766, 139 L.Ed.2d 717 (1998), do not support the Tax Court\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">Appellee states only that the second prong of the compensatory tax analysis is satisfied \u201cbecause the relevant burden is the total or combined burden: the state portion and the local portion for the resident, and the state portion and the tax of \u00a7 10-106.1 for the nonresident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In the present case, the SNRT very closely approximates the county income tax imposed on residents. In addition, because the SNRT is tied to the lowest possible county income tax rate, a nonresident will never pay more Maryland income tax than a resident pays. In addition, the SNRT and the county income tax are not collected by different governments. They are both collected by the State. All the funds are commingled before distributions are made. Finally, the taxes pay for the services provided by government, whether at the State or county level.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">This stands in marked contrast to the intangibles tax at issue in <em>Fulton. </em>There, the Secretary asserted that the intangibles tax was imposed to support the capital market within the State and that it compensated for the general corporate income tax paid by corporations doing business in the State. 516 U.S. at 334, 116 S.Ct. 848. When a corporation pays income tax, it pays for a wide variety of governmental services, such as, the construction and maintenance of the transportation network and police and fire protection. <em>Id. </em>at 337, 116 S.Ct. 848. Although the Supreme Court suspected that the capital market was funded by North Carolina\u2019s blue sky fees, it commented that the Secretary could not show \u201cwhat portion of the corporate income tax goes to support the capital market, or whether that portion represents a burden greater than the one imposed on interstate commerce by the intangibles tax.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338,116 S.Ct. 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">In contrast, in the present case, the SNRT and the county income tax are both income taxes. All of the funds are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>collected by the State, commingled, and then distributed to provide governmental services. The funds collected from the county income tax are not earmarked in the same way that the funds collected from the intangibles tax were earmarked.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In <em>Fulton, </em>the Supreme Court briefly discussed <em>Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., </em>300 U.S. 577, 57 S.Ct. 524, 81 L.Ed. 814 (1937), which, in turn, relied on and quoted Justice Cardozo in <em>Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, </em>286 U.S. 472, 480, 52 S.Ct. 631, 76 L.Ed. 1232 (1932). In <em>Henneford, </em>300 U.S. at 580, 57 S.Ct. 524, the Supreme Court upheld a use tax imposed by Washington State on the privilege of using any article of tangible personal property within the state. Exempt from the use tax was tangible personal property that had already been subject to a sales tax equal to or greater than the use tax. <em>Id. </em>at 581, 57 S.Ct. 524. In effect, the use tax applied only to goods purchased outside of Washington State. <em>Id. </em>The use tax was facially discriminatory, but the combined effect of the sales and use taxes ensured that interstate and intrastate commerce were subject to equal burdens. The Court wrote, <em>id. </em>at 583-84, 57 S.Ct. 524:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">Equality is the theme that runs through all the sections of the statute. There shall be a tax upon the use, but subject to an offset if another use or sales tax has been paid for the same thing. This is true where the offsetting tax became payable to Washington by reason of purchase or use within the state. It is true in exactly the same measure where the offsetting tax has been paid to another state by reason of use or purchase there. No one who uses property in Washington after buying it at retail is to be exempt from a tax upon the privilege of enjoyment except to the extent that he has paid a use or sales tax somewhere. Every one who has paid a use or sales tax anywhere, or, more accurately, in any state, is to that extent to be exempt from the payment of another tax in Washington.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">When the account is made up, the stranger from afar is subject to no greater burdens as a consequence of ownership than the dweller within the gates. The one pays upon one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>activity or incident, and the other upon another, but the sum is the same when the reckoning is closed. Equality exists when the chattel subjected to the use tax is bought in another state and then carried into Washington. It exists when the imported chattel is shipped from the state of origin under an order received directly from the state of destination. In each situation the burden borne by the owner is balanced by an equal burden where the sale is strictly local. \u2018There is no demand in (the) Constitution that the state shall put its requirements in any one statute. It may distribute them as it sees fit, if the result, taken in its totality, is within the state\u2019s constitutional power.\u2019 <em>Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, </em>286 U.S. 472, 480, 52 S.Ct. 631, 76 L.Ed. 1232 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In the present case, equality is also the theme that runs through the income tax statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">We further conclude that the Tax Court committed no error in citing to <em>Shaffer </em>and <em>Lunding. </em>In those cases, the Supreme Court discussed the states\u2019 abilities to tax residents and nonresidents as each must pay for the government services from which they benefit. The Court noted, as we have already discussed, <em>supra, </em>that the effect of the tax is the critical consideration. <em>See generally Lunding, </em>522 U.S. at 297, 118 S.Ct. 766 (1998) (\u201cBecause state legislatures must draw some distinctions in light of \u2018local needs,\u2019 they have considerable discretion in formulating tax policy.\u201d) (Citation omitted); <em>Shaffer, </em>252 U.S. at 55, 40 S.Ct. 221 (\u201c[W]here the question is whether a state taxing law contravenes rights secured by [the Federal Constitution], the decision must depend not upon any mere question of form, construction, or definition, but upon the practical operation and effect of the tax imposed.\u201d) (Citations omitted); <em>see also Brown-Forman Distillers Corp., </em>476 U.S. at 579, 106 S.Ct. 2080 (\u201cthe critical consideration is the overall effect of the statute on both local and interstate activity\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, </em>235 U.S. 350, 362, 35 S.Ct. 99, 59 L.Ed. 265 (1914) (\u201c[W]hen the question is whether a tax imposed by a State deprives a party of rights secured by the Federal Constitution, ... [w]e must regard the substance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>rather than the form, and the controlling test is to be found in the operation and effect of the law as applied and enforced by the state.\u201d) (Citations omitted). Moreover, as asserted by appellee, the effect of the SNRT, when considered in light of the county income tax paid by residents, is to ensure that equal income tax burdens are carried by residents and nonresidents. Indeed, in many instances the tax paid by the nonresident under the SNRT will be less than the county income tax paid by the resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Appellants focus on the specific facts of <em>Shaffer </em>and <em>Funding </em>to assert that the Tax Court erred in relying on those cases. But, as the Supreme Court has explained, the Commerce Clause involves a case-by-case analysis. To be sure, we may analogize from other cases, but the Tax Court cited to <em>Shaffer </em>and <em>Funding </em>merely to express certain basic principles of taxation. The Tax Court was not asserting that the facts of those cases applied to the present case. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Under the third prong of the compensatory tax analysis, the Tax Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">The third prong of the compensatory tax doctrine requires that \u201cthe events on which the interstate and intrastate taxes are imposed must be \u2018substantially equivalent\u2019; that is, they must be sufficiently similar in substance to serve as mutually exclusive proxies] for each other.\u201d <em>Fulton, </em>516 U.S. at 333[, 116 S.Ct. 848]. With respect to \u00a7 10-106.1., income is the event on which the tax is based for both residents and non-residents. Being the same event for both classes of taxpayer, it meets the test for \u201csubstantially equivalent.\u201d Hence, the third prong of the three-part test under <em>Fulton </em>is also satisfied, and this Court finds that \u00a7 10-106.1. is a valid compensatory tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">\u2022 Appellants contend that the Tax Court erred in finding substantial equivalence. They assert that although income for both residents and nonresidents is being taxed, there is no substantial equivalence because the SNRT is imposed by the State, but the county income tax is levied by the counties or Baltimore City. They thus claim that the SNRT and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>county income tax are wholly different from sales and use taxes, which, as noted in <em>Fulton, </em>516 U.S. at 338, 116 S.Ct. 848, do fall on substantially equivalent events. In <em>Fulton, </em>the Supreme Court also explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">Although we found such equivalence in the sales/use tax combination at issue in <em>Silas Mason, </em>our more recent cases have shown extreme reluctance to recognize new compensatory categories. In <em>Oregon Waste, </em>we even pointed out that \u2018use taxes on products purchased out of state are the only taxes we have upheld in recent memory under the compensatory tax doctrine.\u2019 511 U.S., at 105[, 114 S.Ct. 1345].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfK\">516 U.S. at 338,116 S.Ct. 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Appellants also refer us to two out-of-state cases, <em>Annenberg v. Commonwealth, </em>562 Pa. 581, 757 A.2d 338 (2000), and <em>General Motors Corp. v. FTB, </em>120 Cal.App.4th 114, 16 Cal.Rptr.3d 41 (2004), in support of their position.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">We conclude that the Tax Court committed no error in determining that there was substantial equivalence because income was the taxing event for both nonresidents and residents. These events are identical and thus may serve as proxies for each other. <em>Compare Oregon Waste, </em>511 U.S. at 105, 114 S.Ct. 1345 (rejecting equivalence argument for pairing taxes on earning income and disposing of waste); <em>Maryland v. Louisiana, </em>451 U.S. at 759, 101 S.Ct. 2114 (rejecting pairing of taxes for severance of natural resources and the use of resources imported from other states); <em>Tyler Pipe Indus., </em>483 U.S. at 244, 107 S.Ct. 2810 (rejecting pairing of taxes for the manufacturing and wholesaling of tangible goods). Further, the parties taxed are the same, that is, individuals earning income in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>In addition, as discussed <em>supra, </em>the county income tax and the SNRT are State taxes. That the counties set the tax rate of the county income tax does not alter this conclusion. Moreover, to the extent that there is a distinction to be drawn from the distribution of the funds, we note that the funds are not earmarked for any specific use. Rather, the SNRT and the county income tax are collected by the State, all monies are commingled and, eventually, the county income tax is distributed to the counties or Baltimore City and the SNRT is applied to the General Fund of the State. These revenues are thus used to provide governmental services whether by the State, counties, or Baltimore City. In contrast, the intangibles tax in <em>Fulton </em>was imposed to pay for the privilege of access to the capital market while the corporate income tax paid for a wide range of government services. 516 U.S. at 334-35, 337,116 S.Ct. 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Nor do the two out-of-state cases to which appellants refer us offer them any relief. In <em>Annenberg, </em>a personal property tax imposed on certain shares of stock was at issue. The net effect of the \u201cstock clause\u201d was that the only stock that an owner was liable to pay tax on was stock in foreign corporations that did no business in Pennsylvania. 757 A.2d at 341 n. 4. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania concluded that the tax was facially discriminatory and that the stock clause was not a valid compensatory tax. <em>Id. </em>at 345. Regarding the three-pronged analysis, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that none of the prongs were met.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 343-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Under the first prong, \u201cthe Counties\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> argued that \u201cthe legislature crafted the stock clause as part of a comprehensive taxing scheme in order to compensate for the taxes exacted by the capital stock and franchise taxes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343. The capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>stock tax applied to companies organized under the law of Pennsylvania, and the franchise tax was owed by entities organized in any jurisdiction other than Pennsylvania that also did business in and were liable to taxation in Pennsylvania. <em>Id. </em>at 341 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected the Counties\u2019 argument for two reasons. First, the stock clause was not part of a comprehensive scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 343. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court traced the development of the Commonwealth\u2019s first personal property tax and its first capital stock tax, which dated from 1831 and 1840, respectively. <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded that the \u201ctaxes were not an integrated, comprehensive system of taxation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344. Rather, they developed independent of each other. <em>Id. </em>The evidence thus did not support the contention that the legislature had enacted the taxes as part of an interconnected scheme. <em>Id. </em>Second, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court concluded that the Counties did not establish that the stock clause tax \u201c \u2018is fairly related to the services provided by the State [which benefit interstate commerce].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Fulton, </em>516 U.S. at 334, 116 S.Ct. 848.) The Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\">Some of the Counties attempted to show that they provided services which benefited interstate commerce by showing that they provided services which corporations not doing business in Pennsylvania arguably utilized. However, none of the Counties established to what extent these services were provided to or utilized by corporations not doing business in Pennsylvania. Thus, we are unable to determine whether the tax imposed by the stock clause \u201cis fairly related to the services\u201d provided by the Counties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-6\"><em>Annenberg, </em>757 A.2d at 344 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">When considering the second prong, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania stated that the Counties were required to \u201ces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>tablish that the tax imposed by the facially discriminatory stock clause roughly approximates, but does not exceed, the amount of the tax burden which the capital stock tax and the franchise tax impose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334 (citing <em>Fulton, </em>516 U.S. at 332-33, 116 S.Ct. 848.) The Counties had presented the testimony of an expert witness who asserted that most of the monies collected through the capital stock and franchise taxes went to the general fund, which was distributed on a statewide basis. <em>Annenberg, </em>757 A.2d at 344. The remaining amount went to the Lottery Fund and the Hazardous Sites Cleanup Fund. <em>Id. </em>During one of the years in question, approximately 40% of the general fund was distributed to the local governments. <em>Id. </em>The expert witness compared this figure to the rate levied by the personal property tax and \u201cconcluded that the personal property tax roughly approximates, but does not exceed, the amount of the tax burden which the capital stock tax and the franchise tax impose.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court was not persuaded by the expert witness. First, the Court noted that the expert failed to recognize \u201cthat the money distributed from the general fund to local governments is distributed not only to counties, which may collect the personal property tax, but also to municipalities, townships and school districts, which in general may not collect the personal property tax.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345 (footnote omitted). It was thus impossible to determine how much of that 40% \u201cwas distributed to the Counties and thus could possibly be seen as a counterpart to the allegedly compensatory personal property tax, and which portion was distributed to local entities which cannot collect the personal property tax and thus could in no fashion be seen as a counterpart to the personal property tax.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Second, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania found a problem with the expert witness\u2019s calculations because not all the Counties collected the personal property tax. <em>Id. </em>at 345. As a result,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">[i]n order to give an accurate representation of whether the taxes collected by the personal property tax are in parity with the portion of the capital stock and franchise taxes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>counties receive from the general fund, the witness would have had to calculate how much the counties which collect the personal property tax receive from the general fund, and exclude from his calculations how much the general fund distributes to the counties which do not collect the personal property tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Upon considering the third prong, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court concluded that the taxes were not substantially equivalent, that is, that they could not be considered proxies for each other. <em>Id. </em>This was because the personal property tax was based on the value of the shares on one day, but the capital stock and franchise taxes were determined \u201cby measuring economic flow.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the taxes were \u201cimposed and utilized by different levels of government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court explained: \u201cThe personal property tax is imposed at the county level and is utilized for county purposes. The capital stock and franchise taxes, on the other hand, are imposed at the state level and are utilized for state purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345-46 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court concluded, <em>id. </em>at 346:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">The Counties have failed to carry their burden of establishing that the stock clause of the personal property tax is a compensatory tax. We are thus compelled to find that the portion of the stock clause which excludes from the personal property tax stock held in companies which are subject to the capital stock and franchise taxes is unconstitutional as it violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">In contrast to the present case, in <em>Annenberg </em>a tax was imposed on stock on corporations not doing any business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Here, the law firm does business in the Maryland and appellants earn income in Maryland. Also, in <em>Annenberg </em>the personal property tax was imposed at the county level, but, in Maryland, the county income tax is imposed by the State and is collected by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>State.

As a result, the dividends received deduction scheme favors dividend-paying corporations doing business in California and paying California taxes over dividend-paying corporations which do not do business in California and pay no taxes in California.

In <em>Farmer Bros., </em>the California Court of Appeal relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Oregon Waste </em>and <em>Fulton, </em>which explained the difficulty of satisfying the second prong \u201cwhen the state contends that the tax burden on interstate commerce compensates for the burden of state income taxes.\u201d <em>Farmer Bros., </em>108 Cal.App.4th at 990, 134 Cal.Rptr.2d 390. The <em>Farmer Bros. </em>Court noted that \u201c[wjhether or not the interstate tax burden roughly approximates the intrastate tax burden \u2018is difficult to determine, as \u201c[general] tax payments are received for the general purposes of the [government], and are, upon proper receipt, lost in the general revenues.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Farmer Bros., </em>108 Cal.App.4th at 990, 134 Cal.Rptr.2d 390 (quoting <em>Oregon Waste, </em>511 U.S. at 104, 114 S.Ct. 1345 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>(quoting <em>Flast, </em>392 U.S. at 128, 88 S.Ct. 1942 (Harlan, J., dissenting))).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The <em>General Motors </em>Court concluded that the FTB also failed to satisfy the third prong of the compensatory tax analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AarI\">\u201c[The] FTB argues that this condition is met because corporate income and the dividend paid from that income are the \u2018same dollars\u2019 and are substantially similar events. Yet, <em>Fulton </em>expressly disapproved of this analysis with respect to the intangibles tax. \u2018[W]e find that the intangibles tax is not functionally equivalent to the corporate income tax.\u2019 <em>(Fulton, supra, </em>516 U.S. at p. 339[, 116 S.Ct. 848].) Because the objective of the equivalent-event requirement is to enable in-state and out-of-state businesses to compete on an equal footing, \u2018[t]his equality of treatment does not appear when the allegedly compensating taxes fall respectively on taxpayers who are differently described, as, for example, resident shareholders and corporations doing business out of state. A State defending such a tax scheme as one of complementary taxation, therefore, has the burden of showing that the actual incidences of the two tax burdens are different enough from their nominal incidences so that the real taxpayers are within the same class, and that therefore a finding of combined neutrality on interstate competition would at least be possible.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 340[, 116 S.Ct. 848].) The court in Fulton noted that determining whether the tax burden is shifted out of state, rather than borne by in-state producers and consumers, requires complex factual inquiries, and that courts as institutions are poorly equipped to evaluate with precision the relative burdens of various methods of taxation. <em>(Fulton, supra, </em>516 U.S. at pp. 341-342[, 116 S.Ct. 848].) \u2018Indeed, the general difficulty of comparing the economic incidence of state taxes paid by different taxpayers upon different transactions goes a long way toward explaining why we have so seldom recognized a valid compensatory tax outside the context of sales and use taxes.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 342[, 116 S.Ct. 848].)\u201d <em>(Farmer Bros., supra, </em>108 Cal.App.4th at p. 992, 134 Cal.Rptr.2d 390.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number><em>Farmer Bros, </em>thus explains that the \u201cFTB must establish that the burden created by the structure of the dividends received deduction falls on the same class of taxpayers as does the corporate income tax.

They claim that the higher rate imposed upon nonresidents is as discriminatory against them as the tax was in <em>Armco.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">Here, if the SNRT is examined alone, it is discriminatory. We thus agree with appellants on that point, but that does not end our analysis because we must then proceed with the compensatory tax analysis.

Iowa did not, however, tax the dividends received from domestic subsidiaries. <em>Id. </em>at 73, 112 S.Ct. 2365.

The Supreme Court set forth Iowa\u2019s position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">To the extent corporations do business in Iowa, an apportioned share of their entire corporate income is subject to Iowa tax. In the case of a foreign subsidiary doing business abroad, Iowa would tax the dividends paid to the domestic parent, but would not tax the subsidiary\u2019s earnings. Summarizing this analysis, Iowa asserts: \u201cMore earnings of the domestic subsidiary, which has income producing activities in Iowa, than earnings of the foreign subsidiary, which has no Iowa activities, are included in the preapportioned net income base for the unitary<footnotemark>[17]</footnotemark> business as a whole.\u201d Far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>from favoring local commerce, Iowa argues, the tax system places additional burdens on Iowa businesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 78-79,112 S.Ct. 2365 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The Supreme Court did not find this position persuasive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">We agree that the statute does not treat Iowa subsidiaries more favorably than subsidiaries located elsewhere. We are not persuaded, however, that such favoritism is an essential element of a violation of the Foreign Commerce Clause. In <em>Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, </em>441 U.S. 434[, 99 S.Ct. 1813, 60 L.Ed.2d 336] (1979), we concluded that the constitutional prohibition against state taxation of foreign commerce is broader than the protection afforded to interstate commerce, <em>id., </em>at 445-446[, 99 S.Ct. 1813], in part because matters of concern to the entire Nation are implicated, <em>id., </em>at 448-451[, 99 S.Ct. 1813]. Like the Import-Export Clause, the Foreign Commerce Clause recognizes that discriminatory treatment of foreign commerce may create problems, such as the potential for international retaliation, that concern the Nation as a whole. <em>Id., </em>at 450[, 99 S.Ct. 1813]. So here, we think that a State\u2019s preference for domestic commerce over foreign commerce is inconsistent with the Commerce Clause even if the State\u2019s own economy is not a direct beneficiary of the discrimination. As the absence of local benefit does not eliminate the international implications of the discrimination, it cannot exempt such discrimination from Commerce Clause prohibitions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-7\"><em>Kraft, </em>505 U.S. at 79, 112 S.Ct. 2365.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Here, appellants claim that in <em>Kraft </em>\u201cthe Supreme Court is saying that there does not have to be a local benefit result in order for the tax imposed to be considered discriminatory.\u201d We disagree. The Supreme Court was clearly relying on the Foreign Commerce Clause, which is not at issue in the present case. Under <em>Kraft, </em>it is only under the Foreign Commerce Clause that, even in the absence of a local benefit, the discrimination may nonetheless still carry international implications. Such concerns are not present in appellants\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Appellants refer us to another portion of <em>Kraft, </em>in which Iowa asserted that its tax system did not favor business activity in the United States over business activity abroad. <em>Kraft, </em>505 U.S. at 79, 112 S.Ct. 2365. The Supreme Court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\">If true, this would indeed suggest that the statute does not discriminate against foreign commerce. We are not convinced, however, that this description adequately characterizes the relevant features of the Iowa statute. It is true that if a subsidiary were located in another State, its earnings would be subject to taxation by the Federal Government and by the other State (assuming that the State was one of the great majority that impose a corporate income tax). This state and federal tax burden might exceed the sum of the foreign tax that a foreign subsidiary would pay and the tax that Iowa collects on dividends received from a foreign subsidiary. But whatever the tax burdens imposed by the Federal Government or by other States, the fact remains that <em>Iowa </em>imposes a burden on foreign subsidiaries that it does not impose on domestic subsidiaries.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We have no reason to doubt the assertion of the United States that \u201c[i]n evaluating the alleged facial discrimination effected by the Iowa tax, it is not proper to ignore the operation of other provisions of the <em>same </em>statute.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14, n. 19 (emphasis added).

In appellants\u2019 case, in applying the compensatory tax analysis, we concluded that the SNRT was discriminatory because it imposed a tax on nonresidents that was not imposed on residents.

Halliburton paid Louisiana use taxes upon the value of the raw materials and semifinished and finished articles used in manufacturing the equipment, but did not pay labor and shop overhead expenses attributable to assembling the equipment. <em>Id. </em>The Louisiana Collector of Revenue assessed a deficiency. <em>Id. </em>If the equipment had been assembled in Louisiana, the labor and shop overhead expenses would not have been taxed. <em>Id. </em>In addition, outside of Louisiana, Halliburton purchased oil well cementing service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>units in isolated sales that it then transferred to Louisiana and was thus subject to the use tax. <em>Id. </em>at 67-68, 83 S.Ct. 1201. If these purchases had been made within Louisiana, they would not have been subject to a sales tax. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 83 S.Ct. 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The Supreme Court concluded that \u201cequal treatment for instate and out-of-state taxpayers similarly situated is the condition precedent for a valid use tax on goods imported from out-of-state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 83 S.Ct. 1201. Nonetheless, Louisiana admitted \u201c[t]he inequality of the Louisiana tax burden between in-state and out-of-state manufacturers-users[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2Z\">Although the rate is the same, the [Halliburton\u2019s] tax base is increased through the inclusion of its product\u2019s labor and shop overhead. The Louisiana Supreme Court characterized this discrepancy as incidental. However, equality for the purposes of competition and the flow of commerce is measured in dollars and cents, not legal abstractions. In this case the \u2018incidental discrepancy\u2019-the labor and shop overhead for the units in dispute-amounts to $1,547,109.70. The use tax rate in Louisiana is <em>2% </em>and has risen in some States to 4%. The resulting tax inequality is clearly substantial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">But even accepting this, the Louisiana Supreme Court concluded that the comparison between in-state and out-of-state manufacturer-users is not the proper way to frame the issue of equality. It stated: \u2018The proper comparison would be between the use tax on the assembled equipment and a sales tax on the same equipment if it were sold.\u2019 On the basis of such a comparison, the out-of-state manufacturer-user is on the same tax footing with respect to the item used as the retailer of a similar item, or the competitor who buys from the retailer rather than manufacture his own. However, such a comparison excludes from consideration, without any explanation, the very in-state taxpayer who is most similarly situated to the appellant, the local manufacturer-user. If the Louisiana Legislature were in fact concerned over any tax break the manufacturer-user obtains, it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>surely have made special arrangements to take care of the in-state as well as out-of-state loophole-unless, of course, it intended to discriminate. We can only conclude, therefore, that the proper comparison on the basis of this record is between in-state and out-of-state manufacturer-users. And if this comparison discloses discriminatory effects, it could be ignored only after a showing of adequate justification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsV\"><em>Id. </em>at 70-71, 83 S.Ct. 1201 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The Supreme Court went on to \u201cconclude that the Louisiana use tax as applied to the specialized equipment discriminates against interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73, 83 S.Ct. 1201. The Court then considered the isolated sales at issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">A similar disposition of the tax on the isolated sales follows as a matter of course. The disparate treatment is baldly admitted by the Louisiana Supreme Court: \u2018The exemption of an isolated sale from the provisions of the sales tax applies strictly to sales within the State of Louisiana; it has no effect whatsoever on any transaction without the state.\u2019 The out-of-state isolated sale, it concludes, must therefore be treated \u2018as if it were a sale at retail. As the facts of this case indicate, isolated sales involve primarily the acquisition of second-hand equipment from previous users. The effect of the tax is to favor local users who wish to dispose of equipment over out-of-state users similarly situated. Whatever the Louisiana Legislature\u2019s reasons for granting such an exemption to this segment of the local second-hand market, no attempt has been made to justify it or to show how its purpose would be defeated by extending the same exemption to similar out-of-state transactions. We therefore conclude that the use tax on isolated sales in this case departs from the equality required by Silas Mason and discriminates against interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 73-74, 83 S.Ct. 1201 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Contrary to appellants\u2019 assertion, these cases and <em>Oregon Waste, </em>discussed <em>supra, </em>do not call for a comparison of the State income tax paid by a resident and a nonresident. Rather, the inquiry is into the Maryland income tax burden im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>posed upon residents as contrasted with nonresidents. As we have repeatedly discussed, nonresidents are not subject to a higher Maryland income tax than residents. The SNRT helps provide governmental services, which benefit the law firm since it is doing business in Maryland. The SNRT is a valid compensatory tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">The Equal Protection Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Appellants claim that the SNRT violates the Equal Protection Clause. They state that although they raised this issue below, neither the Tax Court nor the circuit court addressed it. They are incorrect. In the Tax Court\u2019s written opinion, it did not provide an in-depth equal protection analysis. Nonetheless, it concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">As to each of the constitutional questions 1 \u2014 3<footnotemark>[18]</footnotemark> posed by the Petitioners in this Appeal, this Court finds that \u00a7 10-106.1. serves a rational purpose to create parity in the income tax burdens between Maryland residents and nonresidents. There is no extra tax burden that would deter a non-resident from free and open commerce inside or outside the state, and there is no extra tax burden that might be construed to violate the privileges and immunities, and equal protection accorded to everyone. Accordingly, \u00a7 10-106.1. does not violate the Interstate Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution, or the Maryland Constitution and the Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Similarly, the circuit court\u2019s written opinion provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-10\">As the local/county tax is a component of the Maryland State income tax and the total rate payable by nonresidents does not exceed that paid by residents, it follows that the nonresident tax does not place any increased burden upon nonresidents. Therefore, this tax [the SNRT] is not dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>criminatory and does not violated any of the constitutional provisions relied upon by Petitioners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Appellants claim that taxing schemes that discriminate against nonresident taxpayers violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and, in support of their position, refer us to three cases from the Supreme Court: <em>Williams v. Vermont, </em>472 U.S. 14, 105 S.Ct. 2465, 86 L.Ed.2d 11 (1985); <em>Nordlinger v. Hahn, </em>505 U.S. 1, 112 S.Ct. 2326, 120 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992); and <em>Fitzgerald v. Racing Ass\u2019n of Central Iowa, </em>539 U.S. 103, 123 S.Ct. 2156, 156 L.Ed.2d 97 (2003). Appellants assert that \u201c[t]he theme that is running through all of these cases, be they considered under the Interstate Commerce Clause or the Equal Protection Clause, is that there must be a rational basis to impose a different tax scheme on essentially the same category of taxpayers.\u201d Appellants contend that there is no rational justification for the State of Maryland to impose a tax on nonresidents with respect to income earned within the State that is greater than that imposed on residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In <em>Williams v. Vermont, </em>472 U.S. 14, 105 S.Ct. 2465, 86 L.Ed.2d 11 (1985), a new Vermont resident challenged the statute imposing a use tax on motor vehicles. The Supreme Court explained the circumstances under which the use tax was imposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">The State of Vermont collects a use tax when cars are registered with it. The tax is not imposed if the car was purchased in Vermont and a sales tax has been paid. The tax is also reduced by the amount of any sales or use tax paid to another State if that State would afford a credit for taxes paid to Vermont in similar circumstances. The credit is available, however, only if the registrant was a Vermont resident at the time he paid the taxes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 14, 105 S.Ct. 2465. Williams was an Illinois resident when he purchased his car and paid a 5% sales tax. <em>Id. </em>at 16, 105 S.Ct. 2465. He moved to Vermont three months later, brought his car with him, and when he registered the vehicle, was charged the use tax. <em>Id. </em>He was not granted the tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>credit. <em>Id. </em>Williams challenged the denial of the tax credit under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">In considering the validity of the tax credit, the Supreme Court pointed out \u201cthat in structuring internal taxation schemes, \u2018the States have large leeway in making classifications and drawing lines which in their judgment produce reasonable systems of taxation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22, 105 S.Ct. 2465 (quoting <em>Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., </em>410 U.S. 356, 359, 93 S.Ct. 1001, 35 L.Ed.2d 351 (1973)).

Accordingly, an exemption like the Vermont statute at issue \u201c \u2018will be sustained if the legislature could have reasonably concluded that the challenged classification would promote a legitimate state purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23, 105 S.Ct. 2465 (quoting <em>Exxon Corp. v.

The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">In the present case, residence at the time of purchase is a wholly arbitrary basis on which to distinguish among present Vermont registrants-at least among those who used their cars elsewhere before coming to Vermont. Having registered a car in Vermont they are similarly situated for all relevant purposes. Each is a Vermont resident, using a car in Vermont, with an equal obligation to pay for the maintenance and improvement of Vermont\u2019s roads. The purposes of the statute would be identically served, and with an identical burden, by taxing each. The distinction between them bears no relation to the statutory purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkL\"><em>Id. </em>at 23-24, 105 S.Ct. 2465 (footnote and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The case of <em>Nordlinger v.

As a result of the changes brought by Proposition 13, which was approved by state-wide ballot in 1978, a 1% ceiling was placed on the property tax rate along with a 2% cap on annual increases in assessed valuations. <em>Id. </em>at 5, 112 S.Ct. 2326. A change in ownership would trigger a reassessment up to the property\u2019s current appraised value. <em>Id. </em>Real property was thus \u201cassessed at values related to the value of the property at the time it is acquired by the taxpayer rather than to the value it has in the current real estate market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Over time, this system \u201ccreated dramatic disparities in the taxes paid by persons owning similar pieces of property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6,112 S.Ct. 2326. Thus, longer term property owners would pay lower property taxes, which reflected historic property values, while newer owners would pay higher property taxes, which reflected more recent values. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In 1989, Nordlinger purchased a residence in Los Angeles County and later learned that she was paying about five times more in property taxes than some of her neighbors who had owned comparable homes since 1975. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 112 S.Ct. 2326. She brought an Equal Protection challenge, which was denied in the California courts. <em>Id. </em>at 7-9,112 S.Ct. 2326.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The U.S. Supreme Court applied a rational basis review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \u00a7 1, commands that no State shall \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d Of course, most laws differentiate in some fashion between classes of persons.

Accordingly, this Court\u2019s cases are clear that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>unless a classification warrants some form of heightened review because it jeopardizes exercise of a fundamental right or categorizes on the basis of an inherently suspect characteristic, the Equal Protection Clause requires only that the classification rationally further a legitimate state interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-5\"><em>Nordlinger, </em>505 U.S. at 10, 112 S.Ct. 2326 (some citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The appropriate standard of review was thus \u201cwhether the difference in treatment between newer and older owners rationally furthers a legitimate state interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 112 S.Ct. 2326. The Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">In general, the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification, the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the governmental decisionmaker and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational. This standard is especially deferential in the context of classifications made by complex tax laws. \u201c[I]n structuring internal taxation schemes \u2018the States have large leeway in making classifications and drawing lines which in their judgment produce reasonable systems of taxation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v.

The State therefore legitimately can decide to structure its tax system to discourage rapid turnover in ownership of homes and businesses, for example, in order to inhibit displacement of lower income families by the forces of gentrification or of established, \u201cmom-and-pop\u201d businesses by newer chain operations. By permitting older owners to pay progressively less in taxes than new owners of comparable property, the ... assessment scheme rationally furthers this interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">Second, the State legitimately can conclude that a new owner at the time of acquiring his property does not have the same reliance interest warranting protection against higher taxes as does an existing owner. The State may deny a new owner at the point of purchase the right to \u201clock in\u201d to the same assessed value as is enjoyed by an existing owner of comparable property, because an existing owner rationally may be thought to have vested expectations in his property or home that are more deserving of protection than the anticipatory expectations of a new owner at the point of purchase. A new owner has full information about the scope of future tax liability before acquiring the property, and if he thinks the future tax burden is too demanding, he can decide not to complete the purchase at all. By contrast, the existing owner, already saddled with his purchase, does not have the option of deciding not to buy his home if taxes become prohibitively high. To meet his tax obligations, he might be forced to sell his home or to divert his income away from the purchase of food, clothing, and other necessities. In short, the State may decide that it is worse to have owned and lost, than never to have owned at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\"><em>Nordlinger, </em>505 U.S. at 12-13, 112 S.Ct. 2326 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">More recently, in <em>Fitzgerald v. Racing Ass\u2019n of Central Iowa, </em>539 U.S. 103, 123 S.Ct. 2156, 156 L.Ed.2d 97 (2003), the Supreme Court concluded there was no violation of the Equal Protection Clause when Iowa statutes authorized racetracks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>operate slot machines, but taxed adjusted revenues from the racetrack\u2019s slot machines at a maximum rate of 36% while taxing adjusted revenues from slot machines on excursion riverboats at a maximum rate of 20%. <em>Id. </em>at 105, 123 S.Ct. 2156. The Court stated that the legislation at issue advanced the racetracks\u2019 economic interests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">Its grant to the racetracks of authority to operate slot machines should help the racetracks economically to some degree-even if its simultaneous imposition of a tax on slot machine adjusted revenues means that the law provides less help than respondents might like. At least a rational legislator might so believe. And the Constitution grants legislators, not courts, broad authority (within the bounds of rationality) to decide whom they wish to help with their tax laws and how much help those laws ought to provide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajr\"><em>Id. </em>at 108,123 S.Ct. 2156. The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">Once one realizes that not every provision in a law must share a single objective, one has no difficulty finding the necessary rational support for the 20 pereent/36 percent differential here at issue. That difference, harmful to the racetracks, is helpful to the riverboats, which ... were also facing financial peril. These two characterizations are but opposite sides of the same coin. Each reflects a rational way for a legislator to view the matter. And aside from simply aiding the financial position of the riverboats, the legislators may have wanted to encourage the economic development of river communities or to promote riverboat history, say, by providing incentives for riverboats to remain in the State, rather than relocate to other States. Alternatively, they may have wanted to protect the reliance interests of riverboat operators, whose adjusted slot machine revenue had previously been taxed at the 20 percent rate. All these objectives are rational ones, which lower riverboat tax rates could further and which suffice to uphold the different tax rates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-7\"><em>Fitzgerald, </em>539 U.S. at 109, 123 S.Ct. 2156 (citations omitted).

Interestingly, the Net State tax paid by Non-Residents was $253 million, about the same as the amount of income tax paid by Maryland residents to other states. If the states that have an income tax decide to impose their own non-resident tax, the amount of taxes paid by Maryland residents to other states will no doubt increase, and this will result in less Net State tax. The ability to claim the credit for income taxes paid other [States] will become greater as the maximum State income tax rate increases from 4.75% to 5.5% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">Approximately 68% of the $224 million in state income taxes paid other states applies to those residents having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Adjusted Gross Income over $500,000 who will likely be liable for the maximum state tax rate of 5.5%. Whether the other states tax rate is higher or lower than the one in Maryland, the Maryland resident will be able to reduce his Maryland State income tax by the amount of income tax paid the other state to the extent it does not exceed the amount of Maryland income tax calculated on the income subject to tax in other states using the Maryland tax rates. Thus, if the other states increase their income tax rates for non-residents, Maryland will receive less Net State Tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-4\">This is exactly what the Privileges and Immunities Clause was meant to prevent. As a practical matter, Maryland may regret enacting the SNRT if the other states retaliate. There were 124, 297 Non-Resident returned filed in Maryland, and they paid $253 million in Maryland income tax. These folks may urge their states to take action, particularly those in lower tax jurisdictions like Pennsylvania whose income tax rate is about 3% which denied to its residents a full credit for the income taxes paid to Maryland.

On the other hand, the nonresident, enjoying little or none of the benefits of local government, was exempted from taxation on account of the expenses of such local government. At the same time it was not right that he should escape all contribution to the support of the state which created and protected the corporation and the property of all its stockholders, and so a tax was cast upon the nonresident stockholder for the expenses of the state. This, with kindred taxes, has been found sufficient to pay the running expenses of the state government. The resident is not called upon to pay any of the expenses of the state, but only to bear his proportional share of those of the municipality.

This requirement is absolute and has no exceptions. Furthermore, as emphasized by the Board at oral argument before us, the relationship between the student and the out-of-state benefactor is immaterial. Although in the present case the benefactor may be an out-of-state parent, the out-of-state monetary source could be a grandparent, a distant relative, a family friend, or any other out-of-state benefactor, and the student will still be deemed a nonresident. A student who is a Maryland resident under any legal meaning or ordinary usage of the term \u201cresident,\u201d but whose chief source of monetary support is someone out-of-state, will, under the Policy, be deemed a nonresident of Maryland and will be required to pay a greater tuition than other Marylanders.

This Court affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 306, 761 A.2d 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The Court of Appeals noted that \u201c[e]ven under the \u2018minimal\u2019 rational basis test\u201d it had \u201c \u2018not hesitated to strike down discriminatory economic regulation that lacked any reasonable justification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315, 761 A.2d 324 (quoting <em>Maryland Aggregates v. State, </em>337 Md. 658, 673, 655 A.2d 886 (1995)). The Court stated that \u201csuch invalid regulations have often \u2018imposed economic burdens, in a manner tending to favor [some Maryland] residents ... over [other Maryland] residents ....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Maryland Aggregates, </em>337 Md. at 672 n. 9, 655 A.2d 886). The Court then explained that \u201ca governmental regulation placing a greater burden on some Marylanders than on others based on geographical factors must \u2018rest upon \u201csome ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the\u201d \u2019 regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317, 761 A.2d 324 (quoting <em>Verzi v. Baltimore County, </em>333 Md. 411, 419, 635 A.2d 967 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The Board of Regents\u2019 stated Policy was \u201cto allow bona fide Maryland residents to pay a lower tuition than nonresidents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Board insisted that \u201cwhether one receives his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>primary monetary support from persons inside of the State or from out-of-state is \u2018probative\u2019 of his or her permanent residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Frankel did not challenge this objective and the Court of Appeals assumed that it was \u201centirely legitimate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, the Court concluded that \u201cthe Board\u2019s absolute preclusion of resident status for any student whose primary source of monetary support resides out-of-state has no \u2018fair and substantial relation to\u2019 the Board\u2019s and Policy\u2019s objective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court described a few hypothetical situations in which applications of the Policy would be inconsistent with providing a tuition benefit to a bona fide Maryland Resident. <em>Id. </em>In one example, the Court envisioned a student, born and raised in Maryland, who, after the student\u2019s parents divorced, continued to reside in Maryland with one parent while the other parent moved to another state. <em>Id. </em>The student, a bona fide Maryland resident, would have to pay out-of-state tuition if the out-of-state parent provided the monetary support while the student attended the University of Maryland. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Policy had \u201clittle relation to the stated objective of benefitting bona fide Maryland residents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318, 761 A.2d 324. The Court of Appeals concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Add\">[T]he Board\u2019s and the Policy\u2019s use of \u201cfinancial dependence\u201d and \u201cfinancial independence\u201d creates an arbitrary and irrational classification which violates the equal protection principle embodied in Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The petitioner is entitled to have his residency classification determined by the University based on the eight \u201cdomicile\u201d criteria set forth in Part I, subpart A, of the Policy, and without using the \u201cfinancial dependence\u201d and \u201cfinancial independence\u201d factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In the present case, the SNRT bears a fair and substantial relationship to the goal of requiring out-of-state residents to pay for governmental services. It does not impose a higher Maryland State income tax rate on nonresidents. The SNRT does not violate Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights of the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Waiver of Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Appellee assessed appellants for their failure to pay the SNRT. The assessments included penalties and interest. The hearing officer affirmed the assessments. The Tax Court abated the penalty assessments, but affirmed all others. Regarding the abatement of penalties, the Tax Court determined that \u201cthe Appeal was taken in good faith without any intent to avoid or delay the proper payment of all taxes legitimately owed. Accordingly, penalties are hereby abated with respect to all Petitioners in this case.\u201d In regard to the abatement of interest, the Tax Court concluded that it \u201cdoes not have the authority to abate interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The circuit court disagreed and wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">Petitioners requested the Tax Court to abate interest and penalties on the unpaid taxes arguing that their refusal to pay was based upon a good faith belief that the statutory provision discussed above was unconstitutional. The Tax Court abated the penalties, apparently agreeing that the Petitioners had a reasonable basis for challenging the law and that they were acting in good faith. Its decision was premised on \u00a7 13-714, entitled Waiver of Penalty. However, the Tax Court concluded that it lacked authority to abate interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">Section 13-606, entitled Waiver of Interest, provides that \u201c[f]or reasonable cause, a tax collector may waive interest on unpaid tax.\u201d This section parallels 13-714 and clearly authorizes the abatement of interest in the appropriate circumstances. The Tax Court erroneously concluded that it did not have authority to waive interest, and declined to exercise its discretion in this regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">While the Court has the power to determine <em>de novo </em>a question of law, this Court may not rule on a discretionary matter in the first instance. Accordingly, the case will be remanded to the Tax Court for consideration of waiver of interest under Section 13-606. If this Court had the authority to make the decision regarding abatement of interest, the Court would be inclined to waive interest on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>unpaid tax. This Court finds that the issues raised by Petitioners are substantial, and that they pursued this matter in good faith and with reasonable care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Appellants contend that since the Tax Court had determined that they met the test for abatement of penalties, which, they claim, is the same test for the waiver of interest, the circuit court, instead of remanding the case to the Tax Court on the question of the waiver of interest, should have included in its Order that the interest was waived. Accordingly, appellants assert that the circuit court should have waived the interest and not remanded the case to the Tax Court for consideration of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Appellee, in its cross-appeal, contends that the circuit court erred in concluding that the Tax Court had authority to modify or eliminate interest. Appellee claims that interest is required under T.G. \u00a7 13-601 (a) and that no statute grants the Tax Court authority to reduce or modify interest. Appellee also states that the Tax Court, which is an administrative agency, has not been granted the authority to exercise the judicial function of discretion. According to appellee, once it levies an assessment, the Tax Court cannot reduce the assessment on grounds of fairness or hardship. The Tax Court, appellee continues, may only find facts that increase or decrease an assessment, such as, \u201cthe amount of income or deduction, the value of property, the actual amount of a sale subject to a tax, or whether an individual is domiciled in the state.\u201d Appellee claims that once the Tax Court finds such facts, \u201cthe adjustment to the assessment follows as a matter of course.\u201d Appellee also refers us to several cases in the federal courts in support of the \u201cprinciple of limited authority over interestf.]\u201d Appellee claims that these cases hold that unless there is an express statutory grant of authority, the United States Tax Court nor the federal courts can abate or reduce an obligation to pay interest on the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">On appeal, we review only the decisions of the Tax Court. We thus consider whether the Tax Court erred in concluding that it did not have authority to abate interest, which requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>us to interpret the various sections of the Tax-General Article. Accordingly, we begin with a discussion of the rules of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Comptroller of Treasury v.

Further, the Tax Court \u201cis not bound by the technical rules of evidence.\u201d T.G. \u00a7 13-525.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Finally, the Tax Court\u2019s powers are limited as provided in T.G. \u00a7 13-528:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">(a) <em>Powers. </em>\u2014 (1) The Tax Court shall have full power to hear, try, determine, or remand any matter before it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">(2) In exercising these powers, the Tax Court may reassess or reclassify, abate, modify, change or alter any valuation, assessment, classification, tax or final order appealed to the Tax Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-12\">(b) <em>Limitation on powers. </em>\u2014 Absent affirmative evidence in support of the relief being sought or an error apparent on the face of the proceeding from which the appeal is taken, the decision, determination, or order from which the appeal is taken shall be affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">In the present case, appellee\u2019s position that the Tax Court may not abate interest would render parts of the statutory scheme a nullity. Although assessment of interest is required, T.G. \u00a7 13-601(a), the tax collector may, under T.G. \u00a7 13-606 waive interest. The tax collector, <em>i.e., </em>the Comptroller, is thus granted authority to waive the interest, but this does not mean that authority over an assessment of interest is confined solely to the tax collector. The plain language of T.G. \u00a7 13 \u2014 510(a)(1) allows for an appeal to the Tax Court from \u201ca final assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>of tax, interest, or penalty----\u201d In addition, T.G. \u00a7 3-103(a)(4) grants the Tax Court jurisdiction to hear appeals concerning \u201cthe application for an abatement, reduction, or revision of any assessment or tax....\u201d Finally, the Tax Court is granted the power to \u201creassess or reclassify, abate, modify, change or alter any valuation, assessment, classification, tax or final order appealed to the Tax Court.\u201d T.G. \u00a7 13-528(a). Accordingly, the Tax Court may consider the assessment of interest if that the party appealing raises that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Appellees are correct that the Tax Court is an administrative body. Nonetheless, it acts in a quasi-judicial capacity. <em>See Maryland Aggregates v. State, </em>337 Md. 658, 678, 655 A.2d 886, 896 (1995) (an administrative \u201cagency in the executive branch may ordinarily perform adjudicatory functions in harmony with the principle of separation of powers provided that there is an opportunity for judicial review of the agency\u2019s final determination\u201d); <em>Shell Oil Co. v.

The Tax Court, therefore, can be said to act in a quasi-judicial capacity.... [T]he Legislature may within limits delegate quasi-judicial functions to an administrative agency, and the delegation of these functions is not the delegation of a judicial function or judicial authority.\u201d) An individual may appeal from assessment of interest and it would render the T.G. \u00a7 13-510(a)(l) a nullity and mere surplusage to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">We also note that appellee refers us to federal case law, but the plain language of the applicable sections in the Tax-General Article lead to the conclusion that the Tax Court has authority to abate interest.

These \u201cfederal phantasms\u201d have no assets, no property, and no personnel; they are hollow bookkeeping entities that serve to isolate export profits of a domestic enterprise. The profits so isolated are eligible for preferential tax treatment. Only a portion of this profit-the deemed dividend-is taxed currently to the parent company, the rest-the accumulated income-is not taxed to either the parent or the DISC until it is actually distributed to the parent (the shareholder), or until the DISC no longer exists. As a result, under the federal tax scheme, no income is taxed to the DISC itself. The parent corporation is thus able to defer tax payment on a portion of its profits which would otherwise be immediately taxable. The parent can use the DISC\u2019S accumulated income for further export activities without losing the tax benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-9\"><em>Armco, </em>70 Md.App. at 406-07, 521 A.2d 785 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b432-8\">. \"The Congress shall have Power ...

Iowa would tax an apportioned share of the domestic subsidiary's entire earnings, but would tax only the amount of the foreign subsidiary\u2019s earnings paid as a dividend to the parent.

A corporation with a subsidiary doing business in Iowa is not situated similarly to a corporation with a subsidiary doing business abroad.
