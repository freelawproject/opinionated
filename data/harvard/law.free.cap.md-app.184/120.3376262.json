Appellant, Ameriquest Mortgage Company (\u201cAmeriquest\u201d), appeals from a decision of the Circuit Court for Calvert County granting summary judgment on the motion for declaratory judgment filed by appellee, Paramount Mortgage Services, Inc. (\u201cParamount\u201d), and declaring that Ameriquest\u2019s March 23, 2003, deed of trust was invalid. Ameriquest presents the following three issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-15\">I. Does a defective affidavit of consideration and/or disbursement render a deed of trust void and unenforceable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>II. Is Paramount\u2019s claim barred by Maryland\u2019s curative statute, which corrects defects in compliance with \u201cformal requisites\u201d unless legal action is initiated -within six months of recordation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">III. Does judicial estoppel bar Ameriquest\u2019s claim?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">We shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">In 1992, Rex Plant acquired title to property at 3650 Yellow Bank Road, Dunkirk, Maryland, in Calvert County (the \u201cProperty\u201d). The Property was described as Lot Number Two (2) and Parcel B, containing 0.34 acres. Parcel B is the driveway leading to Yellow Bank Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">In 2000, Mr. Plant began a romantic relationship with Colleen Bossier, and they lived together on the Property beginning in mid-2000. On or about November 15, 2000, Mr. Plant sold the Property to Ms. Bossier. Pursuant to the sales contract, Ms. Bossier, agreed to pay $213,000 to Mr. Plant, including $10,650 in earnest money. No such earnest money was ever paid. To finance her purchase of the Property, Ms. Bossier executed a deed of trust with GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. (\u201cGreenPoint\u201d) to secure a loan in the amount of $202,350.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, both Ms. Bossier and Mr. Plant tendered mortgage payments to GreenPoint. On January 17, 2001, the deed of trust and property deed were recorded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>In mid-2001, the relationship between Mr. Plant and Ms. Bossier soured, and Ms. Bossier moved out. Pursuant to a recorded Land Installment Contract dated September 26, 2002, Ms. Bossier sold the Property back to Mr. Plant for $200,251.82. That contract provided that Mr. Plant would make payments due on Ms. Bossier\u2019s GreenPoint mortgage loan directly to GreenPoint. The contract provided that Mr. Plant could refinance the GreenPoint loan and, upon its payoff, Ms. Bossier would convey the Property to Mr. Plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In February 2003, Mr. Plant submitted an application for mortgage financing to Ameriquest, a residential mortgage lender. He stated that he was purchasing the Property from Ms. Bossier. The application contained false information, including fabricated checks, purporting to show that he had been making direct payments to Ms. Bossier pursuant to a land installment contract. Mr. Plant acknowledged that he never made direct payments to Ms. Bossier. Based upon the information furnished by Mr. Plant, Ameriquest understood that the proceeds from its loan would be used to pay off Ms. Bossier\u2019s GreenPoint mortgage. It approved Mr. Plant\u2019s application for mortgage financing in the amount of $221,000, which it believed would be sufficient to both pay off the mortgage and cover associated closing costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">On March 24, 2003, the purported closing took place. At the closing, Mr. Plant executed and delivered a deed of trust granting Ameriquest a security interest in the Property subject to the $221,000 loan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appended to this deed of trust was an affidavit of consideration and disbursement, which certified, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">I Hereby Certify, that on this 24 day of March, 2003, before me, the subscriber, A Notary Public of the State of Maryland, in and for the County of Baltimore personally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>appeared Casey M. Busch the agent of the party secured by the foregoing Deed of Trust ... made oath in due form of law that the consideration resided [sic] in said Deed of Trust is true and bona fide as therein set forth and that the actual sum of money advanced at the closing transaction by the secured party was paid over and disbursed by the party or parties secured by the Deed of Trust to the Borrower or to the person responsible for disbursement of funds in the closing transaction or their respective agent at a time not later than the execution and delivery by the Borrower of this Deed of Trust; and also made oath that he is the agent of the party or parties secured and is duly authorized to make this affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The deed of trust also provided, in part, that it \u201csecures to Lender: (i) the repayment of the Loan, and all renewals, extensions and modifications of the Note....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Following the closing, Ameriquest learned that the Green-Point mortgage was significantly more than Mr. Plant had represented, and it cancelled the loan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This decision was not communicated to Mr. Plant, however, and Mr. Plant remitted at least seven payments to Ameriquest between April 2003 and January 2004, totaling $15,137.98. Greenpoint, meanwhile, was not receiving any payments. In early 2004, it decided to foreclose on Ms. Bossier\u2019s mortgage. On May 4, 2004, after being contacted by Mr. Plant\u2019s lawyer and after reviewing the situation, Ameriquest paid off the GreenPoint mortgage in the amount of $272,625.59, thereby satisfying Ms. Bossier\u2019s mortgage debt in full. In so doing, Ameriquest expected to absorb a loss because it agreed to pay off Ms. Bossier\u2019s mortgage in return for Mr. Plant\u2019s promise to pay $221,000. GreenPoint released its encumbrance on the Property on May 10, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Ameriquest then negotiated a new agreement with Mr. Plant. An initial letter agreement was signed on July 9, 2004. On September 27, 2004, Mr. Plant and Ameriquest executed a Settlement and Release Agreement (\u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d), which provided that the parties \u201chave agreed to rewrite the loan.\u201d Mr. Plant agreed to pay $221,000, the same amount involved in March 2003. A number of the terms, however, were different, including a fixed, rather than variable, rate, no prepayment charge, and no lender or third-party fees and charges. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Mr. Plant, agreed, among other things, to: (i) \u201cCooperate in a timely manner with regard to providing current income documentation and proof of employment\u201d; (ii) \u201cpermit[ ] an independent appraiser to conduct a new appraisal of the property;\u201d (iii) furnish proof that the property taxes were current; and (iv) \u201c[pjrovide a binder evidencing hazard ... insurance coverage on the Property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">In the six weeks following the execution of the Settlement Agreement, Ameriquest investigated the title to the Property, and it tried to communicate with Mr. Plant regarding actions needed to finalize settlement. Although Ameriquest had some initial contact with Mr. Plant\u2019s counsel on November, 15, 2004, Mr. Plant and his lawyer thereafter ceased responding to Ameriquest\u2019s inquiries. According to Ameriquest, Plant failed to tender any payments after signing the Settlement Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">In December 2004, Mr. Plant began negotiations with Paramount in an effort to secure additional financing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On February 3, 2005, Paramount conducted the closing of a loan. Because the March 2003 deed from Ms. Bossier to Mr. Plant had never been recorded, and because the deeds between Ms. Bossier and Mr. Plant did not include Parcel B, the driveway on the Property, the closing agent initiated several transactions. First, Mr. Plant executed a confirmatory deed of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Property, which included Parcel B, to Ms. Bossier. Next, Ms. Bossier, indicating that she was the seller of the Property, executed a deed conveying the Property, consisting of both Lot Number Two and Parcel B, back to Mr. Plant. Finally, Mr. Plant executed a deed of trust to Paramount as security for a $160,000 loan, and the loan was disbursed to Mr. Plant. The deed of trust securing the loan and the deeds executed by Ms. Bossier and Mr. Plant were recorded on April 15, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">On April 13, 2005, more than one year after the March 24, 2003, deed of trust was executed, and two days before Paramount\u2019s deed of trust was recorded, Ameriquest recorded the deed of trust dated March 24, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">On June 17, 2005, Ameriquest filed suit against Mr. Plant and Ms. Bossier in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. In its Complaint, Ameriquest alleged breach of contract against Mr. Plant, based on his refusal to comply with the Settlement Agreement, and unjust enrichment against Ms. Bossier. Ameriquest subsequently filed a Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In January 2006, Paramount refinanced its loan to Mr. Plant, with a loan for $183,000, which was secured by a deed of trust recorded by Paramount on April 7, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">On October 23, 2006, Paramount filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment against Ameriquest in the Circuit Court for Calvert County. In its complaint, Paramount sought a declaration that the deed of trust between Ameriquest and Mr. Plant, which was recorded on April 13, 2005, was void, or, alternatively, that it was subordinate to the deed of trust by and between Paramount and Mr. Plant dated January 18, 2006, and recorded on April 7, 2006. On February 13, 2007, Ameriquest filed a Counterclaim for Declaratory Judgment \u201cto establish that Ameriquest\u2019s Deed of Trust has priority over any Paramount Deed of Trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">On February 13, 2007, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland granted, in part, Ameriquest\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment in its suit against Mr. Plant. The court concluded that \u201c[t]here is no genuine dispute that Plant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>breached the Settlement Agreement,\u201d which \u201crequired [Mr.] Plant to cooperate with Ameriquest.\u201d The court rendered judgment against Mr. Plant in the amount of $221,000, plus pre-judgment interest. The court denied summary judgment as to Ms. Bossier.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">On June 19, 2007, in the Circuit Court for Calvert County, Paramount filed a Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to its claim that Ameriquest\u2019s deed of trust was void. In response, on July 12, 2007, Ameriquest filed a Cross Motion for Summary Judgment. On October 10, 2007, the circuit court held a hearing on the motions for summary judgment. On November 2, 2007, the circuit court granted Paramount\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, denied Ameriquest\u2019s Cross Motion, and declared Ameriquest\u2019s deed of trust \u201cnull and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">In granting summary judgment in favor of Paramount, the court first observed that \u201c[t]he pleadings and the record ... amply support the finding that the March 24, 2003, mortgage loan to Plant was cancelled, the agreed upon consideration was not exchanged between Ameriquest and Plant, or between Ameriquest and GreenPoint, at the time of the closing, and a new contract was negotiated and executed by Ameriquest and Plant in September, 2004.\u201d With respect to the loan\u2019s cancellation, the court cited eleven references by Ameriquest, in its pleadings, indicating that it cancelled the March 2003 loan to Mr. Plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The court rejected Ameriquest\u2019s argument that its deed took priority over Paramount\u2019s deed pursuant to Maryland\u2019s recording statute, Md.Code (2002, 2008 Supp.), \u00a7 3-203 of the Real Property (\u201cR.P.\u201d) Article, because it was recorded first. The court explained that the recording statute \u201cdoes not address situations in which a deed may be invalid or unenforceable, for the myriad reasons and situations which can render a deed invalid.\u201d It noted that \u201c[i]t is simply one factor in this situation, and is not a determinative one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The court concluded that Ameriquest\u2019s deed of trust was invalid under R.P. \u00a7\u00a7 4-106(a) and (b), which provide for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>mandatory affidavits with respect to deeds of trust. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">Sub-section (a) requires an affidavit, attached to a mortgage or deed of trust, stating that the recited consideration is true and bona fide. While Ameriquest may have participated in the March 24, 2003 transaction with good faith, and there is no reason to believe they did not, the fact remains that, some time after that date, Ameriquest cancelled the loan. Although there may have been technical delivery of the deed, the loan was not funded, no payment was made. Ameriquest argued that the decision to cancel the loan was reversed, and the loan was funded, when they paid [the] GreenPoint mortgage. They further argue that Judge Bennett, U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, in his February 13, 2007 Memorandum Opinion, found for Ameriquest and against Plant based on the payment to Green-Point. In fact, the Memorandum Opinion states that the March, 2003 loan was cancelled, and based the judgment against Plant on the Settlement Agreement, not the payment to GreenPoint____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">Real Property, Section 4 \u2014 106(b) requires attachment of an affidavit to a mortgage or deed of trust affirming that the actual sum of money advanced at the closing was paid over and disbursed by the secured party (here Ameriquest), no later than the time of the execution and delivery of the mortgage or deed of trust. In this case, there is no dispute from Ameriquest that the loan was not funded at the time of the execution and delivery of the deed. Even assuming that the later payment to GreenPoint constituted funding of the March, 2003 transaction, that payment was not made until May 4, 2004, over a year after the closing. Under Section 4-106(a) and (b), Ameriquest\u2019s deed was not valid, and recording an invalid deed does not render the transaction valid and enforceable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Additionally, the court rejected Ameriquest\u2019s assertion that the curative statute, R.P. \u00a7 4-109, protected its deed of trust, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>That statute requires that, for a deed which is defective because the affidavit requirements under 4-106(a) and (b) are not met, a judicial challenge must be made to the defective deed within six months of recording, or the faults are considered cured. Paramount is correct that improper or missing affidavits are cured by the statute; false or fictitious ones, however, are not cured....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">The loan was cancelled by Ameriquest at some point after the purported closing on March 24, 2003. The record does not reflect how much time elapsed after the purported closing before the loan was cancelled and Plant was informed of the cancellation. Thereafter, Ameriquest began negotiations with Plant for a new agreement-the amount that Plant agreed to repay was the same as the March, 2003 loan, $221,000, but a number of terms were different. The Agreement was fully executed by Ameriquest and Plant by September 27, 2004, well over a year after the March, 2003 purported closing, and over four months after payment was made to GreenPoint, on May 4, 2004. The amount paid to GreenPoint, $272,625.59, was greater than what Plant agreed to repay, even though the basis of the settlement agreement with Plant was the payment to GreenPoint.... In the Terms section, there are a number of references to the \u201ccurrent loan\u201d and the \u201cnew loan,\u201d changing the new loan to a fixed rate rather than an adjustable rate, changing the interest rate, and removing a prepayment charge. Ameriquest also waived all lender fees and charges, and agreed to pay all third party fees for the new loan. Plant agreed to cooperate in obtaining a credit report, which could result in a change in the interest rate, and to conduct a new appraisal of the property. There was no argument that the terms of the loans were the same. The Settlement was clearly a separate transaction, and not a fulfillment of the original loan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Finally, the court declined to \u201creach the issue of judicial estoppel\u201d because it was \u201cconvinced that the March, 2003 deed is void and unenforceable, and because application of Real Property, Section 4-106(a) and (b) resolves the issues here<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>in----\u201d Nonetheless, it stated that \u201cParamount\u2019s argument for the application of judicial estoppel is well-taken.\u201d The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">The basis of [the U.S. District Court\u2019s] decision was the later agreement between Ameriquest and Plant, and had no basis in the March, 2003 transaction. Ameriquest\u2019s position in the U.S. District Court case was clearly based on the September, 2004 Settlement Agreement with Plant. In their Complaint in that case, the claim against Plant was for Breach of Contract, based on the Settlement Agreement. They were awarded money damages and attorney\u2019s fees against Plant based on that Agreement. [The U.S. District Court] found that there was no dispute that there was a Settlement Agreement between Ameriquest and Plant, that Plant had breached the Settlement Agreement, and, therefore, [the U.S. District Court] awarded damages to Ameriquest on a motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The circuit court issued an order declaring that Ameriquest\u2019s deed was \u201cnull and void\u201d and \u201cdid not convey any interest from Rex Plant to Ameriquest Mortgage Company[ ] in the property.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">The standard of review of a \u201c \u2018declaratory judgment entered as the result of the grant of a motion for summary judgment is whether that declaration was correct as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Claggett v. Md. Agric. Land Pres. Found., </em>182 Md.App. 346, 368, 957 A.2d 1083 (quoting <em>Olde Severna Park Improvement Ass\u2019n v. Gunby, </em>402 Md. 317, 329, 936 A.2d 365 (2007)), <em>cert. granted, </em>406 Md. 743, 962 A.2d 370 (2008). In <em>Claggett, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">We \u201creview the record in the light most favorable to [appellant as] the non-moving party and construe any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts against the moving party.\u201d When, as here, there is no dispute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>material fact, \u201cwe proceed to determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Ameriquest asserts that its \u201cdeed of trust was executed, delivered, and recorded long before Paramount\u2019s,\u201d and therefore, under \u201cMaryland\u2019s recording statute, Ameriquest\u2019s lien is superior to Paramount\u2019s.\u201d It challenges, on several grounds, the circuit court\u2019s ruling granting Paramount\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and its finding that Ameriquest\u2019s deed of trust was \u201cnull and void.\u201d First, it argues that the circuit court erroneously determined that the alleged defects in Ameriquest\u2019s affidavit \u201crendered the deed of trust void and unenforceable.\u201d In Ameriquest\u2019s view, because its affidavit was executed in good faith and demonstrated substantial compliance, any defects were insufficient to render the deed void. Second, Ameriquest argues that the court \u201cshould not have even reached the question of whether alleged defects in the affidavit of consideration and disbursement voided the deed of trust\u201d because Paramount\u2019s \u201cchallenge to Ameriquest\u2019s deed of trust is time-barred as a matter of law.\u201d Ameriquest argues that Paramount missed, \u201cby more than a year,\u201d the six-month deadline under R.P. \u00a7 4-109. Ameriquest\u2019s third contention is that the circuit court erred \u201cwhen it suggested that the doctrine of judicial estoppel bars Ameriquest from asserting its first-lien position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">In response, Paramount argues that Ameriquest\u2019s assertion that its deed of trust has priority because it was recorded first \u201cmisses the point\u201d because it was not a valid deed. Paramount argues that the trial court properly found Ameriquest\u2019s deed of trust to be \u201cvoid and unenforceable because the underlying loan was cancelled, no funds were disbursed thereunder, and the affidavits of consideration and disbursement required by R.P. \u00a7 \u00a7 4-106(a) and (b) were therefore false or fictitious.\u201d Paramount further asserts that the curative statute cures \u201ca failure of formal requisites,\u201d but it \u201cdoes not cure a false affidavit of consideration or disbursement, where no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>funds were disbursed at or before the delivery of the mortgage by the borrower or even thereafter.\u201d Finally, Paramount contends that Ameriquest is judicially estopped from arguing that it merely cancelled funding for the loan, rather than canceling the loan itself, based on the position it took in its lawsuit against Mr. Plant in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">We hold that the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Paramount on the ground that Ameriquest\u2019s deed of trust was void and that Maryland\u2019s curative statute did not bar Paramount\u2019s claim. Because we affirm the circuit court on the first two issues raised, it is not necessary for us to address whether Ameriquest\u2019s claim is barred by judicial estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">We begin by considering Ameriquest\u2019s contention that the circuit court erred in finding that the deed of trust was void and unenforceable due to defects in the affidavit filed with the deed of trust. R.P. \u00a7 4-106 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">(a) No mortgage or deed of trust is valid except as between the parties to it, unless there is contained in, endorsed on, or attached to it an oath or affirmation of the mortgagee or the party secured by a deed of trust that the consideration recited in the mortgage or deed of trust is true and bona fide as set forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">(b) (1) No purchase-money mortgage or deed of trust involving land, any part of which is located in the State, is valid either as between the parties or as to any third party unless the mortgage or deed of trust contains or has endorsed on, or attached to it at a time prior to recordation, the oath or affirmation of the party secured by the mortgage or deed of trust stating that the actual sum of money advanced at the closing transaction by the secured party was paid over and disbursed by the party secured by the mortgage or deed of trust to either the borrower or the person responsible for disbursement of funds in the closing transaction or their respective agent at a time no later than the execution and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>delivery of the mortgage or deed of trust by the borrower....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">In this case, there was an affidavit attached to the deed of trust. The affidavit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">[T]he consideration resided <em>[sic </em>] in said Deed of Trust is true and bona fide as therein set forth and that the actual sum of money advanced at the closing transaction by the secured party was paid over and disbursed by the party or parties secured by the Deed of Trust to the Borrower or to the person responsible for disbursement of funds in the closing transaction or their respective agent at a time not later than the execution and delivery by the Borrower of this Deed of Trust....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The question in this appeal is whether this affidavit satisfied the requisites of R.P. \u00a7 4-106. Although the affidavit refers to consideration and states that the funds were disbursed \u201cnot later than the execution and delivery\u201d of the deed of trust, there is no dispute that the money was not disbursed at that time. We find that, under these circumstances, the affidavit did not satisfy the requisites of \u00a7 4-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The Court of Appeals has explained the purpose of \u00a7 4-106 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">This [C]ourt has frequently declared it was the purpose of this statutory provision to prevent fraudulent transfers of property upon false or pretended considerations, and not only thus to protect creditors against frauds, but also to enable them to claim against such instruments when executed without the required affidavit as void in law, no matter how the question of actual fraud may stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-9\"><em>Pagenhardt v.

Thus, in the absence of an affidavit of consideration, the mortgage is not wholly void, but it is void as against creditors. Similarly, a false or fictitious affidavit is void as against creditors. <em>See Duckworth, </em>55 Md.App. at 721, 466 A.2d 517 (If the affidavit is false or fictitious, \u201cthe mortgage is void as against creditors of the mortgagor, at least those without notice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">A different result obtains, however, with respect to a violation of \u00a7 4-106(b), which requires an affidavit of disbursement. <em>Dryfoos, </em>268 Md. at 403, 302 A.2d 28. The \u201cabsence of an affidavit of disbursement from a deed of trust ... brings about a sharply different result. The deficient deed of trust is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>invalid as to the parties as well as to third persons: in other words, it is wholly void.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in <em>Dryfoos, </em>the deed of trust that bore no affidavit of disbursement was \u201cof no effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404, 302 A.2d 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">We will address each of the requirements of \u00a7 4-106. With respect to the requirement of \u00a7 4-106(a), requiring an affidavit of consideration, Ameriquest contends that the affidavit was made in good faith, and it was not fictitious because Ameriquest intended to give Mr. Plant $221,000 to pay off the GreenPoint loan. Ameriquest argues that there was substantial compliance with \u00a7 4-106(a), and therefore, the deed of trust is not void against creditors, including Paramount. Although Ameriquest is correct that substantial, rather than literal, compliance is the standard regarding the content of an affidavit of consideration, we hold that there was not substantial compliance with the statute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Ameriquest relies upon the cases of <em>Smith v. Myers, </em>41 Md. 425 (1875), and <em>Govane Bldg. Co. v. Sun Mtge. Co., </em>156 Md. 401, 144 A. 486 (1929), in support of its argument that the affidavit here substantially complied with \u00a7 4-106(a). Those cases, however, clearly are distinguishable. In <em>Smith, </em>an affidavit attached to a mortgage indicated that the consideration for the mortgage was $5,000, but the actual consideration was a loan of $4,400. <em>Id. </em>at 427. The Court of Appeals noted that the mortgagee had agreed to give the $600 difference to the mortgagor as a bonus for the loan. <em>Id. </em>The Court stated that \u201cthe note truly represents the contract made between the parties,\u201d and the \u201cthe amount of money loaned was obtained for the purpose of meeting the demands of pressing debts, and was actually applied to their payment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In <em>Govane, </em>the Court upheld a mortgage as to third parties, with an affidavit that stated that the mortgage was secured by a $5,000 debt, when it actually secured indebtedness of \u201cnot over $3,453.75.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406, 144 A. 486. The Court observed, however, that \u201c[o]f the $5,000 claimed to have been lent ... $4,425 is fairly well accounted for,\u201d and the \u201cbalance was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>up of cash advanced from time to time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405, 144 A. 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">In <em>Sandler v. Freeny, </em>120 F.2d at 885, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reviewed these and other Maryland cases to conclude that, where \u201cthere is no fraud and no intentional misstatement of fact,\u201d an \u201cincidental inaccuracy in the recital of the consideration, which confers no benefit upon the parties to the transaction and works no detriment to the creditors, will not invalidate the instrument.\u201d (Emphasis added.) There, the affidavit stated that $3,900 was advanced as part of the purchase money for the property. <em>Id. </em>at 882. The Court found substantial compliance with the statute, noting that, although the entire sum was not applied \u201cas part of the purchase money for the property,\u201d the \u201cmortgage debt was bona fide,\u201d and the \u201centire sum was actually advanced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Here, by contrast, the money was not actually advanced as alleged in the affidavit, and therefore, it cannot be said that there was an \u201cincidental inaccuracy in the recital of consideration.\u201d Accordingly, there was not substantial compliance with \u00a7 4-106(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">With respect to Ameriquest\u2019s argument that the money was advanced at a later date, we find persuasive the reasoning in <em>Lerner v. Gladstone, </em>1 F.2d 89, 91 (3d Cir.1924). That case involved the application of \u201cthe Chattel Mortgage Act of New Jersey,\u201d which provided that a mortgage \u201cshall be absolutely void as against the creditors of the mortgagor, and as against subsequent purchasers and mortgagees in good faith,\u201d unless an affidavit \u201cstating the consideration of said mortgage\u201d was attached. <em>Id. </em>at 90-91. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit noted that, although New Jersey courts looked to substantial compliance with the act, \u201cany material deviation from the truth will invalidate the mortgage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91. In that case, the required affidavit stated that $5,000 was advanced on the mortgage on September 23, 1921, but the money was not advanced as stated. <em>Id. </em>at 91. The money was advanced five days later, but the court still found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>affidavit was \u201ca substantial departure from the truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91. Pertinent to this case, the court stated: \u201cThat money five days later was deposited, so that the fact then accorded with the representation, cannot legalize a void mortgage.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Similarly, here, that Ameriquest subsequently disbursed the amount of money stated in the affidavit did not change the fact that the affidavit of consideration was false when made. Therefore, the mortgage was \u201cvoid as against creditors of the mortgagor, at least those without notice.\u201d <em>Duckworth, </em>55 Md.App. at 721, 466 A.2d 517. <em>Accord Pagenhardt, </em>250 Md. at 338-39, 243 A.2d 494 (\u201clien of a defective mortgage is subordinate, however, to the claims of creditors who extended credit subsequent to the date of the mortgage, without actual knowledge of the existence of the mortgage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">It is not clear in this case whether Paramount qualifies as a creditor without notice of an Ameriquest mortgage. The court properly granted summary judgment without resolving this factual issue, however, because, in addition to a failure to comply with \u00a7 4-106(a), there was a failure to comply with \u00a7 4-106(b), which requires an affidavit of disbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">As noted, a failure to comply with \u00a7 4-106(b) produces a different result. Whereas a violation of \u00a7 4-106(a) results in a mortgage that is void against creditors \"without notice, noncompliance with the requirement of an affidavit of disbursement results in a deed of trust that is \u201cwholly void\u201d and \u201cof no effect.\u201d <em>Dryfoos, </em>268 Md. at 404, 302 A.2d 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In the present case, there was an affidavit of disbursement. The affidavit, however, was false. Although the affidavit stated that the money was disbursed not later than the \u201cexecution and delivery\u201d of the deed of trust, no money was disbursed at the time. A deed of trust with a materially false affidavit should not be given greater status than a deed with no affidavit. <em>See Kline v. Inland Rubber Corp., </em>194 Md. 122, 134, 69 A.2d 774 (1949) (\u201c \u2018The statement thus made in the affidavits being fictitious, it is just as ineffective as if it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>been omitted\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Groh v. Cohen, 158 </em>Md. 638, 149 A. 459 (1930)).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">As stated by the circuit court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">Real Property, Section 4-106(b) requires attachment of an affidavit to a mortgage or deed of trust affirming that the actual sum of money advanced at the closing was paid over and disbursed by the secured party (here Ameriquest), no later than the time of the execution and delivery of the mortgage or deed of trust. In this case, there is no dispute from Ameriquest that the loan was not funded at the time of the execution and delivery of the deed. Even assuming that the later payment.to GreenPoint constituted funding of the March, 2003 transaction, that payment was not made until May 4, 2004, over a year after the closing. Under Section 4-106(a) and (b), Ameriquest\u2019s deed was not valid, and recording an invalid deed does not render the transaction valid and enforceable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The trial court\u2019s ruling is consistent with the Third Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Levner, </em>where the court held that, where money was not advanced as stated in the affidavit, the subsequent advance of the money did not \u201clegalize a void mortgage.\u201d 1 F.2d at 91. Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s order that the March 24, 2003, deed of trust, which did not comply with \u00a7 4-106(b), was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">We next consider Ameriquest\u2019s assertion that the circuit court should not have considered whether deficiencies in the affidavit voided its deed of trust because any such challenge is time-barred by Maryland\u2019s curative statute. We find no merit to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">R.P. \u00a7 4-109 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-10\">(a) If an instrument was recorded before January 1, 1973, any failure of the instrument to comply with the formal requisites listed in this section has no effect, unless the defect was challenged in a judicial proceeding commenced by July !, 1973.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>(b) If an instrument is recorded on or after January 1,1973, whether or not the instrument is executed on or after that date, any failure to comply with the formal requisites listed in this section has no effect unless it is challenged in a judicial proceeding commenced within six months after it is recorded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-4\">(c) For the purposes of this section, the failures in the formal requisites of an instrument are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">(1) A defective acknowledgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">(2) A failure to attach any clerk\u2019s certificate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">(3) An omission of a notary seal or other seal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">(4) A lack of or improper acknowledgment or affidavit of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">consideration, agency, or disbursement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">(5) An omission of an attestation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">This statute is a curative statute, which \u201ccorrects errors in deeds, mortgages, etc., defectively executed or acknowledged.\u201d <em>Wingert v. Zeigler, </em>91 Md. 318, 46 A. 1074 (1900). <em>Accord Dryfoos, </em>268 Md. at 404, 302 A.2d 28; <em>Berean Bible Chapel, Inc. v. Ponzillo, </em>28 Md.App. 596, 600-01, 346 A.2d 702 (1975). Curative statutes have been described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\">\u201cA curative act is a statute passed to cure defects in prior law, or to validate legal proceedings, instruments, or acts of public and private administrative authorities which in the absence of such an act would be void for want of conformity with existing legal requirements, but which would have been valid if the statute had so provided at the time of enacting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7i\"><em>Berean Bible, </em>28 Md.App. at 600-601, 346 A.2d 702 (quoting 2 Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 41.11 (C. Sands, ed., 4th ed. 1973)). The Court noted that \u201c[t]he test usually used for determining the validity of curative acts may be stated thusly: if the legislature had the power to enact originally the matters now sought to be enacted as curative, such legislation is valid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601, 346 A.2d 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">Pursuant to \u00a7 4-109, with respect to a deed or other instrument, a \u201cfailure to comply with the formal requisites\u201d set forth in the statute has no effect unless it is challenged in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>judicial proceeding within six months of recording the instrument. The \u201cformal requisites\u201d listed in the statute include a \u201clack of or improper\u201d affidavit of consideration or disbursement. The question in this case is whether the curative statute applies when the affidavit is false, in that the loan did not occur as represented. We agree with the circuit court that the curative statute is inapplicable under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In interpreting the meaning of a statute, we seek to ascertain the intent of the legislature. <em>In re Damien F., </em>182 Md.App. 546, 958 A.2d 402 (2008). We \u201c \u2018begin with the plain language of the statute, and if that language is clear and unambiguous, we look no further than the text of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018We may also consider \u2018the consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Claggett, </em>182 Md.App. at 374, 957 A.2d 1083 (quoting <em>Chesapeake Charter, Inc. v. Anne Arundel County Bd. of Educ., </em>358 Md. 129, 135, 747 A.2d 625 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The plain language of the curative statute indicates that it applies only to a failure to comply with \u201cformal requisites.\u201d Webster\u2019s Dictionary defines \u201cformal\u201d as \u201cfollowing or according with established, form, custom, or rule.\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1987). <em>See also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 678 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \u201cformal\u201d as \u201c[p]ertaining to or following established procedural rules, customs, and practices\u201d). Thus, we interpret the phrase \u201cformal requisites\u201d to refer to technical requirements as to form. Accordingly, if there is a failure to comply with technical procedural requirements, it \u201chas no effect\u201d unless it is challenged within six months after it is recorded. Filing an affidavit stating that money was disbursed on a certain date, when there was no disbursement of money as alleged, however, does not qualify as a technical defect as to form.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Because the language of the statute is clear, we do not need to consider the legislative history of \u00a7 4-109. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>Doe v. Montgomery County Bd. of Elections, </em>406 Md. 697, 712, 962 A.2d 342 (2008) (\u201cIf the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends.\u201d). We note, however, that an earlier version of the statute confirms our construction of the statute as applying only to technical problems with form. Section 99 of former Article 21 provided that a deed or other instrument conveying property that was executed after 1858, and in which \u201cthe certificate of acknowledgment or affidavit of consideration is not in the prescribed form,\u201d was \u201cmade valid,\u201d providing that the deed was \u201cin other respects in conformity with the law.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1966 Repl.Vol.), Art. 21, \u00a7 99 (emphasis added). This language supports our holding that the curative statute was intended to validate only technical defects in the form of an affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Our construction of the Maryland curative statute as applying only to technical defects is consistent with the view of curative statutes taken in treatises and by other states. In Paul E. Basye, Clearing Land Titles \u00a7 204 (2d ed. 1970 &amp; Supp. 2007-2008), a curative statute was explained as \u201cone which corrects errors and irregularities in past acts, transactions or legal procedures and renders them valid and effective for the purpose intended.\u201d The author made clear, however, that curative statutes do not apply to all errors. Rather, curative statutes are passed \u201cto validate irregularities in legal proceedings or to give effect to contracts between parties which might otherwise fail for failure to comply with technical legal requirements.\u201d Basye, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 206 at 472. Defects \u201cwhich are not mere informalities or irregularities, but so vital in their character, are beyond the reach of curative statutes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Other state courts have looked to the nature of the error to determine if a curative statute is applicable. In <em>Bummer v. Collier, </em>864 P.2d 453, 457 (Wyo.1993), the Wyoming Supreme Court construed its curative act, which applied to defects in the \u201cformalities\u201d of execution. The Court held that the defect involved, \u201crecording the pages of the property\u2019s legal description out of order,\u201d was not the type of error cured by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>statute. <em>Id. </em>The court held: \u201cA proper legal description of the property affected by the recorded instrument does not constitute a formality, and thus the act will not cure an error in that description.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Other jurisdictions similarly have construed curative acts to apply only to technical defects. <em>See, e.g., Cirelli v. Ent, </em>885 So.2d 423, 433 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2004) (\u201cCurative legislation only corrects certain minor or technical defects through the passage of time ... \u201d); <em>Crum v. Butler, </em>601 So.2d 834, 837 (Miss.1992) (\u201ca curative statute does not cure <em>any </em>defect and cannot be held to supply an acknowledgment when in fact there is no acknowledgment\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>City of Scranton v. O\u2019Malley Mfg. Co., </em>341 Pa. 200, 19 A.2d 269, 272 (1941) (noting that curative act \u201ccured irregularities in the process but did not cure the want of process,\u201d court held deed invalid where return of city treasurer of tax sales was fatally defective).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">In <em>McWilliams v. Clem, </em>228 Mont. 297, 743 P.2d 577 (1987), Ms. McWilliams sought to nullify a deed which purported to transfer property owned by her and her husband. The notary public fraudulently signed the certificate of acknowledgment that Ms. McWilliams had personally appeared to acknowledge the deed. The court rejected the argument that the forged deed was validated by Montana\u2019s curative statute, which applied to deeds that are otherwise valid except for the lack of an acknowledgment. <em>Id. </em>at 584. The court stated that \u201ca curative statute cannot breathe life and validity into ... void deeds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lowery v. Garfield County, </em>122 Mont. 571, 208 P.2d 478, 485 (1949)). The curative statute did not validate the deed because Ms. McWilliams, as one of the necessary grantors, never made the grant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Similarly, here, the curative statute did not validate the deed because there was not a mere technicality in the execution of the deed. As the trial court found, not only was the affidavit false in that the money was not disbursed on March 24, 2003, as represented, but the loan subsequently was can-celled by Ameriquest. Although Ameriquest ultimately paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the GreenPoint mortgage, it did so pursuant to a new Settlement Agreement with Mr. Plant with different terms. As the trial court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\">In the Terms section, there are a number of references to the \u201ccurrent loan\u201d and the \u201cnew loan,\u201d changing the new loan to a fixed rate rather than an adjustable rate, changing the interest rate, and removing a prepayment charge. Ameriquest also waived all lender fees and charges, and agreed to pay all third party fees for the new loan. Plant agreed to cooperate in obtaining a credit report, which could result in a change in the interest rate, and to conduct a new appraisal of the property. There was no argument that the terms of the loans were the same. The Settlement was clearly a separate transaction, and not a fulfillment of the original loan.<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">This case does not involve a technical defect that can be cured by R.P. \u00a7 4-109. Accordingly, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Paramount on the basis that Ameriquest\u2019s deed of trust was void and unenforceable. We affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CALVERT COUNTY AFFIRMED.
