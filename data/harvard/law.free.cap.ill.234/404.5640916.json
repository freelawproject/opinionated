Principal and agent\u2014authority to \u00f1nd a purchaser is not authority to bind principal by contract. A real estate agent employed to find a purchaser for land, although the terms of sale are fully prescribed, does not have authority to execute a contract of sale which binds the owner of the land.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b404-11\" pgmap=\"404\">2. Same\u2014letter authorising agent to act must be strictly construed. In construing a letter authorizing an agent to act for the owner of land with reference to selling the same, every word must be considered in determining the authority conferred, and the letter will be strictly construed and the, authority thereby conferred will not be extended.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b404-12\" pgmap=\"404(71) 405(53)\">3.

The fact that a defendant to a bill for specific performance answers without demurring but later files a demurrer when the complainant, after the cause had been referred to the master, amended his bill, and later amended again by striking out the first amendment, does not require that the costs before the master be awarded against the defendant upon his demurrer being sustained.</headnotes><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b405-4\" pgmap=\"405\">Dunn and Cartwright, JJ., dissenting.</p><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-5\" pgmap=\"405\">Appear from the Circuit Court of Sangamon county; the Ho\u00f1.

The court sustained a demurrer to the bill and dismissed the same for want of equity, and the complainant has prosecuted an appeal to this court.</p> <p id=\"b407-9\" pgmap=\"407\">Appellee, on August 2, 1904, was the owner of said premises, and on that day placed the same in the hands of T. C. Baker, Jr. &amp; Co., real estate agents in Springfield, for sale. At that time he signed an instrument in writing, which reads, in part, as follows:</p> <p id=\"b407-10\" pgmap=\"407\">\u201cSpeingeieed, Iee., Aiig. 2, 1904.</p> <p id=\"b407-11\" pgmap=\"407(124) 408(34)\">\u201cTo T.

Jones, Springfield, Ill. \u201cMarch 29, 1905.</p> <p id=\"b408-13\" pgmap=\"408\">\u201cDear Sir\u2014Attached hereto is a true copy of our authority to act as agents for T. W. Howard in the sale of lot 4, in block 25, of the old town plat of Springfield, Illinois. In so far as we are thereby authorized, we, as such agents, accept your proposition to purchase said property as contained in your letter of this date. \u201cRespectfully yours,</p> <p id=\"b408-14\" pgmap=\"408\">By T. C. Baker, Jr.\u201d T. C. Baker, Jr. &amp; Co.</p> <p id=\"b408-15\" pgmap=\"408\">There was attached to the foregoing letter of T. C. Baker, Jr.,&amp; Co. a copy of the original instrument which authorized T. C. Baker, Jr. &amp; Co. to make a sale of said premises. The appellee refused to convey the premises to appellant, whereupon this bill was filed.</p> <p id=\"b408-16\" pgmap=\"408(66) 409(222)\">The main question discussed in the briefs of the parties is, did T. C. Baker, Jr. &amp; Co. have the right, under the authority in writing given to them by the appellee, to execute a contract with the appellant, in writing, for the sale of said premises, which was binding upon the appellee and which would be specifically enforced by a court of equity? The trial court answered that question in the negative, and we think correctly. The first clause of the letter of August 2 is: \u201cPlease assist me to sell my property described below until sale is made and properly closed.\u201d These words can not be disregarded in determining the authority conferred by appellee upon T. C. Baker, Jr. &amp; Co., but in determining this question every word and phrase in the letter must be considered and the letter strictly construed and the authority of said firm not extended beyond that clearly found in the letter as a whole. (Bissell v. Terry, 69 Ill. 184.) There were a number of things which the parties would have to settle before a conveyance of the property could be made. The property was encumbered to the amount of $7000, which would have to be adjusted, and nothing was said as to when possession of the premises was to be delivered. We think it clear, therefore, when all provisions of the letter of August 2 are considered, that all the defendant intended to authorize T. C. Baker, Jr. &amp; Co. to do was to find a purchaser for his property, -and that he did not intend T. C. Baker, Jr. &amp; Co. should execute to such purchaser a contract for the sale of his property.</p> <p id=\"b409-5\" pgmap=\"409(162) 410(311)\">\" The authorities seem to be of one accord that a real estate agent employed by the owner to find a purchaser for a tract of land, although the terms of sale are fully prescribed, does not have authority to execute a contract of sale which will bind the owner. (23 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law,\u2014 2d ed.\u2014p. 900; 19 Cyc. 197, 294, 295; McCullough v. Hitchcock, 71 Conn. 401; Stewart v. Pickering, 73 Iowa, 652; Furst v. Tweed, 93 id. 300; Campbell v. Galloway, 148 Ind. 440; Keim v. Lindley, (N. J. Ch.) 30 Atl. Rep. 1063; Halsey v. Monteiro, 92 Va. 581; Duffy v. Hobson, 40 Cal. 244; Grant v. Ede, 85 id. 418; Larson v. O\u2019Hara, 98 Minn. 71; Fitzpatrick v. Gilson, 176 Mass. 477.) In Keim v. Lindley, supra, the vice-chancellor said: \u201cThe mere employment of an ordinary real estate broker to effect the sale of a parcel of land, even though th&amp; price and terms be prescribed, does not amount to giving present authority to such broker to conclude a binding contract for the same. Moreover, such authority is not usually to be inferred from \u25a0the use by the principal and the broker, in that connection, of the terms \u2018for sale,\u2019 or \u2018to sell,\u2019 and the like. These words, in that connection, usually mean no more than to negotiate a sale by finding a purchaser upon satisfactory terms.\u201d In the Halsey case, the court, quoting from McCullough v. Hitchcock, supra, said: \u201cA real estate broker or agent is defined to be one who negotiates the sale of real property. His business, generally, is only to find a purchaser who is willing to buy the land upon the terms fixed by the owner. He has no authority to bind the principal by signing the contract of sale. A sale of real estate involves many things besides fixing a price. The delivery of the possession has to be settled, generally the title to be examined, and the conveyance, with its covenants, to be agreed upon and executed by the owner, all of which require conference and time for their completion. They are for the determination of the owner, and do not pertain to the duty and are not within the authority of a real estate agent. For obvious reasons, therefore, the law wisely withholds from him any implied authority to sign a contract of sale on behalf of his principal.\u201d In the case of Johnson v. Dodge, 17 Ill. 433, and other cases relied upon by appellant, the agent was expressly authorized to make a sale and the agent had implied authority to execute a contract of sale in the name of the owner. Here the agent was not given express authority to make a sale, and those authorities are not in point.</p> <p id=\"b410-5\" pgmap=\"410\">We are of the opinion the court did not err in declining to. specifically enforce the contract. ,</p> <p id=\"b410-6\" pgmap=\"410(39) 411(125)\">The complainant filed his bill and the defendant answered the same, and the case was \u2022 referred to the master to take the evidence and report his conclusions. Subsequently the complainant amended his bill by stating therein that the defendant had a homestead in the premises. Further evidence was taken before the master, and the bill was again amended by striking out the averment that the defendant had a homestead in said premises, whereupon the defendant demurred to the bill. Upon the demurrer being sustained the complainant moved the court to tax the costs made before the master to the defendant, on the ground that he had not demurred to the bill before it was amended. The court overruled the motion. In this we see no error. The defendant clearly had the right to determine his own method of defense without subjecting himself to a judgment for costs if the complainant\u2019s bill was ultimately held to be without merit.</p> <p id=\"b411-5\" pgmap=\"411\">The decree of the circuit court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b411-6\" pgmap=\"411\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b411-7\" pgmap=\"411\">Dunn and Cartwright, JJ.,</author> <p id=\"A3Y\" pgmap=\"411\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b411-8\" pgmap=\"411\">In some jurisdictions it has been held that even though an owner.of real estate has authorized another to sell it, the latter cannot execute a contract of sale which will be binding on the owner. This court, however, has held in Johnson v. Dodge, 17 Ill. 433, that authority from the owner to sell land included the necessary and usual means to make a binding contract in the name of the principal, and in Hemstreet v. Burdick, 90 Ill. 444, that a power of attorney to sell land conferred power to convey it. To the same effect is Peabody v. Hoard, 46 Ill. 242. We do not think these cases should now be overruled. They establish in this State the proposition that authority to sell real estate includes authority to execute a binding contract of sale. In our judgment the demurrer to the bill should have been overruled.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
