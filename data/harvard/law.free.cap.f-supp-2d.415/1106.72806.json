Rag-land, and Winston E. Hickman move to dismiss Plaintiffs second amended federal securities complaint (\u201cSAC\u201d). Plaintiff opposes the motion. Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(d)(1), this matter is appropriate for decision without oral argument. For the reasons set forth below, the motion to dismiss is granted with 20 days leave to amend from the date of entry of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-12\">Lead Plaintiff, the Cuvelier Group, alleges that Defendants Remec, Inc. (\u201cRemec\u201d), its CEO Ronald E. Ragland (\u201cRag-land\u201d), and its CFO Winston E. Hickman (\u201cHickman\u201d) violated the federal securities laws by issuing a series of knowingly false statements concerning Remec\u2019s financial condition during the Class Period of September 8, 2003 through September 8, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-14\">Remec is a designer and manufacturer of high frequency subsystems used to transmit voice, video and other data over wireless communications networks and in space and national defense applications. (SAC \u00b6 2). The Class Period begins on September 8, 2003 when Remec announced its second fiscal quarter 2004 financial results, for the period ending August 1, 2003. Remec announced increased six month revenue of $167.5 million compared to $112.6 million in the same period of 2003 and losses of $16 million compared to $10.7 million for the comparable period. (SAC \u00b6 29). The SAC then sets forth approximately 18 additional statements to the effect that Remec was experiencing increased sales and positive financial results. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 32-59). The SAC then sets forth several additional statements issued on September 8th and 9th that allegedly disclose the goodwill impairment and internal control deficiencies. On September 8, 2004 Remec announced that it was taking a $62.4 million charge for goodwill impairment. Remec announced that it \u201cconducted an impairment analysis of the goodwill associated with our commercial wireless business and determined that it should be written off in its entirety.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 63). Remec explained that the primary factors contributing to the impairment assessment writeoff \u201cwere continued projected losses resulting from industry overcapacity resulting in lower profit margins, and manufacturing cost reductions lagging market price decreases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The next day, on September 9, 2004 Remec disclosed that its auditors discovered internal control deficiencies. On September 9, 2004 the price of Remec\u2019s stock fell to $4.30 per share, after having reached a Class Period high of $12.86 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>In order to explain the nature of the securities fraud, Plaintiff alleges that \u201c[e]ach of the positive statements\u201d failed to disclose the following adverse information: the amount of the goodwill related to \u201ccertain acquisitions was overstated by approximately $62 million;\u201d customers \u201cwere pulling business back from Remec due to poor performance, quality, and concerns about the stability of the company;\u201d demand for its products was weakening; the Company\u2019s assets were overstated because of excess inventory and non-functioning products; the Company was dependent upon the sale of previously written off inventory with a zero cost basis to stave off the appearance of imminent disaster; the Company\u2019s gross margins were \u201cdecaying;\u201d expenses were higher than anticipated; and the company had material internal control deficiencies. (CAC \u00b6 58).</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">\u201cAt the heart of defendants\u2019 fraud ... is defendants\u2019 failure to timely write-down impaired goodwill which should have been taken at the latest by August 2003, or a full year before it was taken.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 4). In 25 pages of text and graphics, encompassing approximately 73 paragraphs of allegations, Plaintiffs set forth the perceived deficiencies with Remec\u2019s goodwill impairment representations and analysis. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 75-157). The SAC sets forth in substantial detail Remec\u2019s public financial disclosures as set forth in the Company\u2019s SEC filings, including the Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The allegations identify that the goodwill impairment analysis implemented by Remec used projected sales growth rates ranging from 5% \u2014 15% and gross profit margins ranging from 30%\u2014 38%. (SAC \u00b6 76). Based upon publicly available information, Plaintiff alleges that from April 27, 2001 through July 30, 2004 at no time did Remec achieve the gross profit margins used in its good will impairment analysis. Based upon a comparison with Remec\u2019s historical financial performance, Plaintiff concludes that the gross profit margins used in the goodwill analysis were \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d and \u201cnot reasonable or supportable.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 84).</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-7\">At the beginning of the Class Period, September 8, 2003, \u201cRemec carried approximately $44.1 million of good will attributed to the Commercial Segment in its financial statements.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 83). At the time of this good will impairment analysis, conducted on December 27, 2002, Remec used a gross profit margin range of 30%\u2014 38%. However, the gross profit margins for the three subsequent quarters were 15.8% (4QFY03), 20.2% (1QFY04), and 21.9% (2QFY04). (SAC \u00b683). Plaintiff alleges that Remec should have written off the entire $44.1 million as of the beginning of the Class Period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-8\">In performing the goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2004 (Remec\u2019s fiscal year ends on January 31), Remec assumed gross profit margins ranging from 24%\u2014 29%. (SAC \u00b6 87). In contrast to the assumed gross profit margin, Remec reported a gross profit margin of -7% for the final quarter of fiscal year 2004, for the period ending January 31, 2004. (SAC \u00b6 88). The- gross profit margin for the first fiscal quarter of 2005 was 13.5% and - 6.6% for the second fiscal quarter ending July 31, 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (SAC \u00b6 90).</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-9\">In short, Plaintiff alleges that the entire goodwill impairment amount should have been recognized much earlier then July 31, 2004 and that Remec\u2019s failure to do so violated GAAP and FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards. In Remec\u2019s second quarter fiscal year 2005 Form 10-Q, filed on September 9, 2004 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>Company recognized that \u201cthere were indicators of impairment ... as a result of changes in management\u2019s assumptions with respect to revenue growth and gross margins.\u201d The revised goodwill impairment assumptions lowered sales growth rates ranges to <em>4% </em>\u2014 8% and gross profit margins to 14% \u2014 24%. (SAC \u00b6 107).</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-4\">Plaintiff also interviewed several former Remec employees. Based upon these interviews Plaintiff alleges that William Sweeney, Remec\u2019s Global Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing \u201cbullied sales people into providing forecasts of sales that he could \u2018give to the street\u2019 (i.e. forecasts showing growth) although they knew those forecasts could not be met.\u201d When those forecasts were not met, Mr. Sweeney \u201cwould require them to pull in orders from future quarters to make up the shortfall.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 158). In this manner Mr. Sweeney would \u201cbrowbeat\u201d sales people to come back with higher sales. (SAC \u00b6 159). Plaintiff also alleges that defendant Ragland would impose the Company\u2019s sales objects on the various business units in order \u201cto provide a forecast of anticipated sales opportunities that matched Ragland\u2019s number.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 1612). Defendant Ragland would tell the sales staff \u201cHere are your numbers ... find a way to get there.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 162). Witnesses confirmed that many of the sales forecasts were \u201coverly optimistic and did not result in actual sales.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 163).</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">Plaintiff also alleges that Remec maintained undisclosed excess and obsolete inventory. To achieve growth in sales, Remec purchased several companies during the Class Period, including Paradigm. The acquisitions resulted in overstated inventory assets during the Class Period in the \u201cmillions of dollars ... easily over $10 million.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 167). Plaintiff concludes that the failure to timely write-down obsolete of slow moving inventory violated GAAP. (SAC \u00b6 176). \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-7\">Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants violated GAAP by failing to timely write-down obsolete or slow-moving inventory, (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 176-181); by improperly assigning Paradigm\u2019s inventory assets \u201cno value\u201d, but instead, assigning] that value to the goodwill associated with the acquisition, (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 182-185); and by improperly shipping and recognizing revenue on nonfunctional products. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 186-188).</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-8\">Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants failed to maintain an adequate system of internal controls. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 191-199). The internal control deficiencies \u201cmade it very difficult for the Company to report reliable and accurate financial results.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 192). In the Company\u2019s September 30, 2004 Form 8-K, Remec disclosed that its auditors, Ernst &amp; Young, had advised the audit committee of certain internal control deficiencies including, lack of review and technical accounting oversight, lack of time reconciliation of bank statements, inability to prepare a mechanized calculation of inventory reserves, and inadequate program and access controls for the Company\u2019s information technology processes that support the internal control environment. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 194-195).</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AlV\">Legal Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-10\">\n<em>1. Rule 12(b)(6)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-11\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) dismissal is proper only in \u201cextraordinary\u201d cases. <em>United States v. Redwood City, </em>640 F.2d 963, 966 (9th Cir.1981). Courts should grant 12(b)(6) relief only where a plaintiffs complaint lacks a \u201ccognizable legal theory\u201d or sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal theory. <em>See Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dept., </em>901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir.1990). Courts should not dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>a complaint \u201cunless it appears beyond doubt that plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle [the party] to relief.\u201d <em>Moore v.

However, conclusory allegations of law and unwarranted inferences are insufficient to defeat a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. <em>See In re Syntex Corp. Sec.

The PSLRA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">In an effort to curtail the filing of perceived abusive lawsuits, Congress enacted the PSLRA to establish a uniform pleading standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-7\">(b) Requirements for securities fraud actions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-9\">(1) Misleading statements and omissions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-10\">In any private action arising under this chapter in which the plaintiff alleges that the defendant\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-11\">(A) made an untrue statement of a material fact; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-12\">(B) omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-14\">the complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-15\">(2) Required state of mind</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-16\">In any private action arising under this chapter in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind, the complaint shall, with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter, state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApS\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-17\">Under the heightened pleading standards of the PSLRA, <em>see In re Silicon Graphics Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>183 F.3d 970, 974 (9th Cir.1999), Plaintiff must (1) specify each statement alleged to have been misleading and the reasons why the statement is misleading; (2) state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the requisite state of mind; and (3) with respect to allegations made on information and belief, state with particularity facts on which the belief is formed. <em>See Gompper v. VISX, Inc., </em>298 F.3d 893, 895 (9th Cir.2002). Scienter is the \u201cmental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate or defraud.\u201d <em>Wharf Holdings Ltd. v. United Int\u2019l Holdings, Inc. </em>532 U.S. 588, 593, 121 S.Ct. 1776, 149 L.Ed.2d 845 (2001). Under the PSLRA, \u201cthe court must consider <em>all </em>reasonable inferences to be drawn from the allegations, including inferences unfavora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>ble to the plaintiffs. District courts should consider all the allegations in their entirety, together with any reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom, in concluding whether, on balance, the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint gives rise to the requisite inference of scienter.\u201d <em>Gompper, </em>298 F.3d at 897. The inquiry into scienter and falsity are generally inferred from the same set of facts, \u201cand the two requirements may be combined into a unitary inquiry under the PSLRA.\u201d <em>Daou, </em>397 F.3d at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">Finally, PSLRA\u2019s heightened pleading standards require Plaintiff \u201cto plead, in great detail, facts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of deliberately reckless or conscious misconduct.\u201d <em>Silicon Graphics, </em>183 F.3d at 974. \u201c[T]o show a strong inference of deliberate recklessness, plaintiffs must state facts that come closer to demonstrating intent, as opposed to mere motive and opportunity [to commit fraud].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">\n<em>S. Rule 10b-5</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-7\">To state a claim under \u00a7 10b of the Exchange Act, Plaintiff must allege that defendant (1) made a misrepresentation or omission; (2) of material fact; (3) in connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) with scienter; (5) that the plaintiff relied upon; and (6) causing Plaintiff to suffer damages. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b); <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, </em>544 U.S. 336, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 1631, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005). Rule 10b-5 claims must comply with Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See In re Daou, </em>397 F.3d at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-8\">The Goodwill Impairment Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-9\">At the heart of Plaintiffs securities fraud SAC is the allegation that Defendants failed to timely write-down goodwill that had become impaired in relation to certain acquisitions. The $62.4 million write down for impairment in the value of the goodwill allegedly caused Remec\u2019s assets and stock prices to be materially overstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-11\">In order to place the goodwill impairment allegations in context, the court notes that Remec\u2019s disclosures concerning the assumptions used to analyze the impairment of goodwill are not themselves alleged to be false or misleading. That is, Remec did in fact apply the represented sales growth rates and gross profit margin rates to the goodwill impairment analysis as represented in its public filings. Further the actual sales growth rates and gross profit margins as reported in Remec\u2019s SEC filings are not themselves alleged to be false or misleading. Under the fraud on the market theory, \u201cin an open and developed securities market, the price of a company\u2019s stock is determined by the available material information regarding the company and its business.\u201d <em>Basic Inc. v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 241, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1990). As noted by Plaintiff, \u201cthe market for Remec securities promptly digested current information regarding Remec from all publicly-available sources and reflected such information in Remec\u2019s stock price.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 221). Thus, under an efficient market view, the market had assimilated the information regarding projected or estimated future sales and gross profit margin rates (used in the goodwill impairment analysis) as well as the actual, and substantially lower, rates actually achieved by Remec both preceding and during the Class Period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-12\">The court has touched upon the efficient market theory only to highlight that the disclosure of accurate financial information does not preclude liability for securities fraud. \u201cSome statements, although literally accurate, can become, through their context and manner of presentation, devices which mislead investors. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>For that reason, the disclosure required by the securities laws is measured not by literal truth, but by the ability of the material to accurately inform rather than mislead prospective buyers.\u201d <em>McMahan &amp; Co. v. Wherehouse Entertainment. Inc., </em>900 F.2d 576, 579 (2d Cir.1990). Thus, to prevail, Plaintiff must demonstrate that the goodwill impairment statements, when read in light of all the information then available to the market, conveyed a material false or misleading impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">The issue before the court is whether Plaintiffs allegations are reduced to a non-actionable claim of poor business judgment or actionable securities fraud based upon accounting violations coupled with corresponding fraudulent intent. <em>See Novak v. Kasaks, </em>216 F.3d 300, 309 (2d. Cir.2000) (allegations of GAAP violations coupled with corresponding fraudulent intent might be sufficient to state a securities fraud claim). The court begins the analysis by reviewing the requirements under GAAP and FASB 142. GAAP requires that the \u201cgoodwill value must be assessed for impairment at least on an annual basis and whenever certain events occur, such as a change in the assumptions that went into calculating the discounted future cash flows.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 83). The triggering events for a reassessment of goodwill include: (1) a significant decrease in the market value of the asset; (2) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset; and (3) a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with an asset used for the purpose of producing revenue. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 50, 98-100). Remec explained the basis for its goodwill impairment analysis in its 2004 Form 10-K, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-5\">Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of reach reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.... <em>Our impairment review process is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses our estimates of revenue for reporting units, driven by assumed market growth rates and assumed market segment share, and estimated costs as well as appropriate discount rates. These estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying business. The estimates we used assume that we will gain market segment share in the future and that the Commercial segment will experience continued recovery and a return to growth and profitability from the current trends.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1138-8\">(SAC \u00b6 50).</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-9\">In an attempt to show that Remec\u2019s goodwill impairment analysis was fraudulent throughout the Class Period, Plaintiff alleges that the goodwill impairment analysis performed on December 26, 2003 for Fiscal 2004, ending January 31, 2004, and reported in the Company\u2019s 2004 10-K, used unrealistic and inflated assumptions. Remec used assumed \u2014 but disclosed\u2014 gross profit margins ranging from 24%\u2014 29% in the Commercial Segment but reported gross profit margin percentages of 20.2% for 1QFY2004, 21.9% for 2QFY2004, 20.2% for 3QFY2004. (SAC \u00b6 88). During this same period of time, Remec assumed sales growth rates ranging from 5% \u2014 42% in the Commercial segment. While the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>SAC identifies actual sales growth rates outside the Class Period, the court could not locate in the SAC the actual sales growth rates for 1QFY2004 through 3QFY2004. Notwithstanding Plaintiff alleges that the sales growth rate.reached high of 9.8% in 4QFY2004. Presumably, the sales growth rate for the first three quarters of Fiscal Year 2004 fell within the lower portion of the 5% \u2014 42% range.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">Plaintiff alleges that GAAP requires that a goodwill impairment be performed annually and more frequently where circumstances warrant. (SAC \u00b6 83). Here, Remec performed the goodwill impairment analysis as of December 26, 2003 and then again seven months later as of July 30, 2004. The court separately reviews the goodwill impairment analysis as of these dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">\n<em>The December 26, 2003 Goodwill Impairment Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-7\">Plaintiff alleges that Remec used unrealistic assumptions to perform the goodwill impairment analysis and therefore committed security fraud. As set forth above, Remec used a projected gross profit margin estimate of 24%-29%. The gross profit margins over the preceding three fiscal quarters were 20.2%, 21.9%, and 20,2%. (SAC \u00b6 88). While the actual gross profit margins fell short of the projected lower gross profit range by about 2-4%, and the sales growth rate fell within the lower portion of the estimated range, absent from the SAC\u2019s allegations are \u201cfacts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of deliberately reckless or conscious misconduct.\u201d <em>Silicon Graphics, </em>183 F.3d at 974. \u201c[T]o show a strong inference of deliberate recklessness, plaintiffs must state facts that come closer to demonstrating intent, as opposed to mere motive and opportunity [to commit fraud].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The SAC\u2019s allegations fall short of establishing a strong inference that the estimates were false, baseless; fraudulent, or unreasonable as the result of deliberately reckless or conscious misconduct. Plaintiff cannot point to the difference between the estimated and actual numbers and simply assume that the difference is attributable to fraudulent conduct. <em>See In re GlenFed, </em>42 F.3d at 1549 (\u201cThe fact that an allegedly fraudulent statement and a later statement are different does not necessarily amount to an explanation as to why the earlier statement was false.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-13\">Plaintiff argues that the identified \u201cgross profit margin and sales growth assumptions for the December 2003 test were completely unrealistic,\u201d (Oppo. at p. 10:25-26), and lacked \u201cany basis in reality.\u201d (Oppo. at p. 10:27). Plaintiff contends that this explains the nature of the fraud because Defendants used \u201cfraudulent assumptions in the face of such contemporaneous information.\u201d (Oppo. at p. 11:7-9). Rather than explaining how this is so Plaintiff circuitously reasons that the 2-4% difference between the forecasted and actual gross profit margin manifests the nature of the fraud with respect to goodwill impairment. The court concludes that Plaintiff has not pled with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that Defendants acted either intentionally or with deliberate recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-14\">In sum, the court grants the motion to dismiss the securities fraud claim based upon the goodwill impairment allegations as of December 26, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-15\">\n<em>The July SO, 200k Goodwill Impairment Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-16\">Plaintiff alleges that- GAAP requires that a goodwill impairment be per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>formed annually and more frequently where circumstances warrant. (SAC \u00b6 83). Here, Remec performed the goodwill impairment analysis as of December 26, 2003 and then again seven months later as of July 30, 2004. Even assuming that Remec violated GAAP by failing to conduct a goodwill impairment analysis earlier than July 30, 2004, Plaintiff must also specifically allege the falsity of the statement as well as fraudulent intent. Plaintiff argues that Defendants \u201ccould not have reasonably believed their assumptions were viable or had any basis in reality. Based upon this alone, their statements regarding Remec\u2019s financial condition during the Class Period are actionable.\u201d (Opposition at p. 10:26-28).</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">As Remec\u2019s financial condition worsened in the last quarter of calendar 2003 and the first half of 2004, Remec experienced declining and even negative gross profit margins of negative 7%. for 4QFY2004, 13.4% for Q1FY2005, and 4.0% for Q2FY2005. Plaintiff argues that \u201cDefendants intentionally or recklessly ignored these historical results,\u201d (Oppo.7:20), and therefore \u201cDefendants could not have reasonably believed their assumptions were viable or had any basis in reality.\u201d (Oppo.lO:26-27). Fatal to Plaintiffs claim is the absence of specific alleged facts explaining how this is so. Plaintiff must \u201cplead, in great detail, facts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of deliberately reckless or conscious misconduct.\u201d <em>Silicon Graphics, </em>183 F.3d at 974. The SAC\u2019s scienter allegations, set forth throughout the SAC and at \u00b6\u00b6 200-210, consist of boilerplate generalized allegations that the CEO and CFO of a publicly traded company had \u201creceipt of information reflecting the true facts regarding\u201d the Company, (SAC \u00b6 200); \u201cknew and/or recklessly disregarded the falsity and misleading nature of the information which they caused to be disseminated to the investing public,\u201d (SAC \u00b6 201); \u201chad access to information they needed to monitor the Company\u2019s operations and financial figures, particularly that which pertained to any accounting and finance-related matters,\u201d (SAC \u00b6 202); \u201chad access to the adverse undisclosed information about the Company\u2019s business, operations, operational trends, financial statements, markets and present and future business prospects and access to internal corporate documents,\u201d (\u00b6 2005); \u201cwere involved in drafting, producing, reviewing and/or disseminating the false and misleading statements and information alleged, were aware, or recklessly disregarded, that the false and misleading statements,\u201d (SAC \u00b6 206); \u201cwere aware of, or recklessly disregarded, the misstatements contained therein and omissions therefrom, and were aware of their materially false and misleading nature of the various public and shareholder and investor reports and other communications.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 208).</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-7\">In sum, the allegations resonate with generalities, lacking the specificity required to show the strong inference of scienter required by the PSLRA. While the allegations set forth in the SAC are more prolix and repetitive than the two earlier attempts to state a claim, they similarly lack actionable substance. This is particularly true where Remec made full disclosure of its declining gross profit margins throughout this period of time in its SEC filings and public statements. Plaintiff. must go beyond mere characterization and allege specific facts showing that Defendants possessed the requisite state of mind.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>The Other Alleged GAAP Violations</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">\n<em>Improper Shipping, False and Unreliable Sales Forecasts, Overstated Revenue Recognition, Inventory Deficiencies and Lack of Internal Controls</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">Plaintiff alleges that Remec experienced internal control deficiencies, (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 70, 115-117, 191-199), fraudulently forecasted sales revenue, (SAC 158\u2014 164), and sold zero value inventory and non functioning goods and maintained excess and obsolete inventory. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 165-188). \u201cWhen pleading irregularities in revenue recognition, plaintiffs should allege \u2018(1) such basic details as the approximate amount by which revenues and earning were overstated; (2) the products involved in the contingent transaction; (3) the dates of any of the transactions; or (4) the identities of any of the customers or [company] employees involved in the transactions.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Daou, </em>411 F.3d at 1016. The court notes that many of Plaintiffs allegations are based upon confidential sources, identified as former or current Remec employees. The confidential sources appear to be in a position to have personal knowledge of the events and transactions described in the SAC. Certain of the allegations based upon confidential sources are silent as to the specific time periods and the companies involved in the allegedly improper sales and exaggerated revenue scheme. Notwithstanding, the cited confidential sources add credence to Plaintiffs allegations yet fail in other respects to provide the detail required to put Remec on notice of the allegedly false and misleading accounting violations. The fact that Plaintiff relies heavily on confidential sources does not eliminate or lessen Plaintiffs burden to plead each element of a federal securities claim, including scienter. <em>See In re Daou, </em>411 F.3d at 1015.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-9\">Rather than analyze each and every alleged accounting violation, the court reviews the allegations to determine whether Plaintiff has adequately pleaded scienter. The court notes that the SAC provides some specific details regarding revenue recognition and the other accounting issues. For instance, Plaintiff alleges, based upon information received from high level Remec employees, that Defendant Rag-land would browbeat sales staff to provide unrealistic sales objectives and that the sales goals \u201cwere completely unrealistic and unattainable\u201d and overly optimistic. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 159-164). Plaintiff identifies that Defendant Ragland would provide individual business unit managers with sales goals and the managers were \u201crequired to come up with numbers that were equal to Ragland\u2019s numbers.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 161). In explaining why the projections of anticipated future sales were overstated, the SAC explains \u201cthat Remec\u2019s projections were overstated or inflated due to sales personnel projecting that they foresaw opportunities that did not actually exist, but which they made because of pressure from the Company\u2019s senior executives, including Ragland.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 164).</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-11\">Plaintiff also alleges that Remec would improperly recognize revenue on products that did not function to the customer\u2019s satisfaction. Further, Remec\u2019s senior management and sales staff would continue shipments of products that \u201chad yet to perform to customer satisfaction.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 186). Plaintiff alleges that the amount involved in the shipment \u201cof non-functioning products cumulatively amounted to the \u2018high hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 per customer and that there were at least two or three of these customers.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 186). The court notes that the complaint does not identify the customers or even whether these transactions occurred during the Class Period or whether the amount of \u201chigh hundreds of thousands of dollars\u201d is a material amount. The court concludes that these statements fail to par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>ticularly describe the falsity of these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">One specifically identified transaction occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 (for the period commencing October 31, 2002) wherein Remec allegedly recognized close to $1 million in revenue with Alamosa Holdings, Inc; Plaintiff explains that the customer was unwilling to accept the Remec installed system at that time, yet improperly recognized the revenue. (SAC \u00b6 188). The court notes that this transaction occurred about 10 months prior to the beginning of the Class Period and does not support the claims asserted during the Class Period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">Plaintiff alleges that Remec pursued a \u201cgrowth-by-acquisition strategy,\u201d (SAC \u00b6 165), and accumulated large quantities of written-off inventory which it would sell at retail thereby resulting in a 100% margin. (SAC \u00b6 182, 185). Plaintiff identifies specific transactions and alleges that for three of the four quarters during the Class Period that about $6 million in pure margin was generated by such sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">As with the goodwill impairment argument, Plaintiff argues that scienter is adequately pleaded in the SAC because Defendants \u201cmust have known\u201d the problems with Remee\u2019s accounting system and procedures and the impact of those problems in connection with the Remec\u2019s financial condition. Plaintiff argues, alternatively, that Defendant Ragland directly participated in improper recognition practices and/or must have known of the allegedly fraudulent sales forecasting practices, the fraudulent entries into the forecasting computer system, the pervasive policy of selling zero-value inventory, the large amounts of excessive and obsolete inventory, meetings at which senior management told others in attendance that the sales goals could be met selling zero-value inventory, and the inherent unreliability of the BAAN software system (Oppo. at pp. 21: 23-22:3). Plaintiff alleges that the accounting, shipping, inventory and revenue irregularities were made with scienter. The court concludes that these allegations and arguments are insufficient to establish a strong inference of scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-8\">One distinguishing characteristic of a strong showing of scienter is that it highlights a mental state embracing a strong intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud, and serves to separate optimistic statements and or negligent acts from fraudulent ones. Plaintiffs argument in support of scienter is one based primarily on their executive positions within the Company. Plaintiff argues that \u201cit is not plausible that Ragland and Hickman, who were responsible for directing the day-to-day affairs of the Company as CEO and CFO, were not aware\u201d of the fraudulent or misleading accounting and forecasting practices. Plaintiff attributes the difference between the actual internal state of affairs (i.e. the alleged fraudulent or misleading accounting and forecasting practices) and the public statements to knowledge of actual fraud. Plaintiff reaches too far. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant Ragland \u25a0 bullied the sales staff and pressured them into providing sales numbers that met with his sales forecasts. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 161-162). While these allegations move down the scienter path, they fail to distinguish what is non-actionable bullish conduct from fraudulent or reckless conduct. For example, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Ragland would cajole sales staff into providing optimistic sales forecasts. \u201c[T]he goals set by Ragland were completely unrealistic and unattainable.\u201d (SAC \u00b6 162). Plaintiff argues that such direct involvement is particularly probative of scienter but does not explain how this is so. The difficulty with this argument is that the SAC fails to allege facts to explain and distinguish what is optimistic, unrealistic or unattainable. To place Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>generalized allegations of optimistic sales forecasts in context the court notes that Plaintiff alleges that Remec was experiencing year-over-year sales growth in the range of 50%-70%. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 38, 41). General allegations to the effect the sales goals imposed by Defendant Ragland were \u201coverly optimistic\u201d or \u201ccompletely unrealistic and unattainable\u201d fail to distinguish between what may be non-actionable conduct from fraudulent conduct, particularly when the company is experiencing strong year-over-year sales growth of 50-%-70%.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\">One purpose of the PSLRA\u2019s strong inference of scienter requirement is to distinguish between non-actionable and fraudulent conduct by alleging a mental state encompassing an intent to deceive or manipulate. The pleading requirement is not satisfied by characterizing basic facts as optimistic, unrealistic, or unattainable. Plaintiff must \u201cplead, in great detail, facts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of deliberately reckless or conscious misconduct.\u201d <em>Silicon Graphics, </em>183 F.3d at 974; <em>In re Vantive, </em>283 F.3d at 1085 (complaint must allege \u201ccontemporaneous facts in sufficient detail and in a manner that would create a strong inference that the alleged adverse facts were known at the time of the challenged statements\u201d). Plaintiffs allegations regarding alleged accounting and forecasting deficiencies fall short of what is required by the PSLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">In light of the dismissal of the SAC\u2019s claims, Remec seeks dismissal with prejudice and Plaintiff seeks dismissal with leave to amend. Remec argues that Plaintiffs fraud theory does not make any sense and that each complaint has faired no better than the earlier one. The PSLRA requires a high degree of particularity and detail giving rise to a strong inference of scienter. \u201cThis is not an easy standard to comply with \u2014 it was not intended to be\u2014 and plaintiff must be held to it. But how much detail is <em>enough </em>detail? When is an inference of deliberate recklessness <em>\u25a0sufficiently </em>strong? There is no bright-line rule.\u201d <em>Eminence Capital v. Aspeon, Inc., </em>316 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir.2003). In light of the heightened pleading standards, the \u201cdrafting of a cognizable complaint can be a matter of trial and error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the court cannot conclude that there are no circumstances under which Plaintiff can state a claim, the court grants Plaintiff one last opportunity to state a claim that complies with the PSLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">In sum, the motion to dismiss is granted with 20 days leave to amend from the date of entry of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-8\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">. Although Plaintiff alleges -3.3% gross profit margin for 1QFY05, the opposition acknowledges that this is a typographical error in the SAC and that the correct figure is Remec\u2019s reported figure of 13.5%. (Oppo. at p. 8, fn. 8)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1139-9\">.
