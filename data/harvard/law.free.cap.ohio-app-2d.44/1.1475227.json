R. C. 4509.45 provides that financial responsibility may be evidenced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>either a certificate of insurance or a bond. In compliance with this statute Mr. Kerr purchased an instrument titled \u201cFinancial Responsibility Bond\u201d from defendant-appellee Personal Service Insurance Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">On March 25,1972 Mr. Kerr was injured in an automobile accident with an uninsured motorist. The plaintiff brought suit against Personal Service, alleging in his complaint : (1) that the instrument issued was in effect a motor vehicle liability policy of insurance; (2) that pursuant to R. C. 3937.18(A),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> liability policies are deemed to include uninsured motorist coverage unless such a provision is rejected in writing by the insured; (3) that such coverage was neither offered nor rejected; (4) and that the defendant was therefore liable to the plaintiff to compensate him for his injuri\u00e9s. Personal Service answered that the instrument was a bond, not an insurance policy, and therefore not within the purview of R. C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">Both parties moved for summary judgment,, stipulating the following issue to the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">Did the Defendant issue a policy of insurance to the Plaintiff within the terms and purview of Sec. 3937.18 of the Ohio Revised Code, but in violation of s\u00e1id Section, if a policy of insurance, in that it failed to provide coverages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>therein for the protection of an insured from losses caused by an uninsured motorist, and in that event is the Defendant obligated to the Plaintiff as an insurer , to an insured, as if under, a standard policy of uninsured motorist coverage?</p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">The.trial court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion and granted summary judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff appeals, arguing , that the title of the instrument in question is not dispositive of its true nature. Although courts have held that a financial responsibility bond is in legal effect a liability insurance policy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> such cases deal only with the definition of terms within an insurance policy. The present action, however, requires statutory interpretation, and. this court is bound by terms as defined by the Ohio legislature in the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">Although R. C. 3937.18 requires uninsured motorist coverage in a \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy of insurance,\u201d ^Revised Code Title 39 contains no definition of liability insurance. Chapter 4509 does expressly define this term, and we hold this definition'applicable to R. C. 3.937.18. R. C. 4509.01 (L) defines \u201cmotor-vehicle liability policy\u201d as either an \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d or an \u201coperator\u2019s policy.\u201d R. C. 4509.51 requires that an owner\u2019s policy:</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">(A) Shall'designate by explicit description or by appropriate reference all motor vehicles with respect to which coverage is thereby granted;</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">(B) Shall insure the person named therein and any other person, as insured, using any such motor vehicles with the - express or implied permission of the insured, against loss from the liability imposed by law for damages ....</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">R. C. 4509.52 provides that an operator\u2019s policy</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">\"\u2022 shall insure the person named as insured against loss from the liability imposed upon him by law for damages arising out of the use by him of any motor vehicle not owned by him. . ..</p>\n<p id=\"b24-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>The instrument in question covers Mr. Kerr \u201cin the ownership, maintenance, use or operation of a motor vehicle . . . .\u201d Applying the statutory definitions, the instrument cannot be an owner\u2019s policy because it fails (1) to designate which vehicles are covered, and (2) to insure others driving Mr. Kerr\u2019s car with his permission. The instrument is not an operator\u2019s policy because it is limited to the use of non-owned vehicles. Being neither an owner\u2019s nor an operator\u2019s policy, the instrument by definition is not liability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">Moreover, there are persuasive policy reasons to differentiate between a bond and liability insurance. By providing alternative methods of proving financial responsibility, the legislature recognized that many \u201cpoor risk\u201d drivers would' be unable to obtain liability insurance. Although a bond and liability insurance have many identical provisions, there is one important distinction. A bond surety may recover from its principal the amount paid to ihird persons injured by the principal. Because of this right of recovery, an insurance company may bond a driver it would not insure. Such bonds would probably not be issued if it were necessary to include an uninsured motorist provision because the company would have no legal recourse for recovery of the funds paid out from the injured party since he would be the principal under such coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">We therefore hold that there exist sound definitional and policy reasons to distinguish a bond from a policy of liability insurance. The trial court ruled correctly that the instrument in question is a bond and that R. C. 3937.18 does not require that uninsured motorist coverage be included in financial responsibility bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b24-7\">Krenzler, P.
