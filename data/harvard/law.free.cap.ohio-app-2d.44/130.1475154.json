C. 2907.01; four counts of blackmail, R. C. 2901.38, and two counts of malicious destruction of property, R. C. 2909.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">On July 27, 1973, the prosecution filed a motion to obtain an exemplar of defendant\u2019s vioce,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which motion was granted in a court order October 16, 1973. The defense objected to this order and requested a hearing which was held November 16, 1973. At this hearing the prosecution called a Westlake, Ohio police lieutenant who testified that pursuant to his investigation of an osteopathic doctor\u2019s complaint of receiving harassing phone calls, he installed a recording device on the doctor\u2019s telephone and listened to the recorded conversations with the harrassing caller. The court then overruled the defendant\u2019s objections to its original order and further directed the defendant to cooperate with Cleveland Police personnel in obtaining the voice exemplar. The court further found merit to a defense request that the court set guidelines or standards for the taking of the voice exemplar.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>At a subsequent hearing, on November 28, 1973, the court left the mechanics of time, place, and procedure for taking the voice exemplar to prosecution and defense counsel stating that defense counsel had the right to be present and to represent the defendant at all stages and as to all aspects of the taking of the voice exemplar. The court threatened sanctions if either side unreasonably failed to cooperate in the taking of the voice exemplar.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">On January 15, 1974, the court held a hearing on the prosecution\u2019s motion to show cause why the defendant should not be held in contempt for his failure to submit to the voice exemplar. The defense argued that it was unable to agree with the prosecution on standards, that the phrases submitted by the prosecution to be uttered by the defendant tended to show substantive guilt rather than simply identification and that upon advice of counsel the defendant refused to submit to the procedure. The prosecution showed the court a letter setting forth the phrases that the defendant had refused to utter for the exemplar.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court ordered these phrases repeated for the exemplar and reiterated its threatened contempt sanction if the defendant refused to comply with the court\u2019s prior order.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Defense counsel still refused arguing that the voice exemplar violated defendant\u2019s rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the U. S. Constitution. Determining that defendant and counsel were fully aware of the consequence of their refusal, the court adjudged defendant in contempt and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Appellant has assigned four errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">\u201c(1) The Court\u2019s order requiring the furnishing of a voice print is in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>\u201c(2) The Court\u2019s order requiring the furnishing of a voice print is in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">\u201c(3) The Court\u2019s order requiring the voice print and the use of certain court ordered phrases violated the Fourteenth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">\u201c(4) The Court\u2019s order requiring the furnishing of a voice print is in error since a voice print is inadmissible into evidence for identification or testimony purposes on the grounds that voice prints and spectrograms are scientifically unproven and inaccurate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Assignments of error Nos. 1 and 2 maintain that the court-ordered voice exemplar violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against compulsory self-incrimination and the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. Appellant argues that the court-ordered voice exemplar constitutes an invasion of his body \u2014 that is, his voice \u2014 in violation of the Fourth Amendment and that such voice exemplar would compel him to be a witness against himself in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Assignment of error No. 3 maintains that the court order denied appellant due process of law guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment arguing that the court has interfered with the pre-trial process by interjecting itself on the side of the prosecution and further that the court-ordered phrases are unduly suggestive, testimonial in character, and thus prejudicial. Appellant\u2019s assignments of error Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and his constitutional arguments shall be consolidated and answered together. Appellant\u2019s arguments are contrary to the vast weight of authority from other jurisdictions, and we conclude that his assignments of error are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Both sides rely upon the recent decision of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dionisio </em>(1973), 410 U. S. 1. Antonio Dionisio as well as some twenty others had been subpoenaed before a special federal grand jury investigating unlawful gambling activities. Dionisio had repeatedly refused to submit to a recorded voice exemplar to be compared with previously obtained wiretap recordings for identification purposes. Dionisio appealed his civil contempt conviction. In <em>Dionisio </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>th\u00e9 United States Supreme Court held that court-ordered voice exemplars \u2022 involve no more than the compelled display of identifiable physical characteristics which infringe upon no interest protected by the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. The <em>Dionisio </em>court noted that such conclusion was supported by its previous holdings in <em>Holt </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1910), 218 U. S. 245; <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California </em>(1966), 384 U. S. 757; <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967), 388 U. S. 263, and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade </em>(1967), 388 U. S. 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">In <em>Gilbert </em>the court concluded that handwriting exemplars were not protected by the privilege against self-incrimination, stating that \u201c [o]ne\u2019s voice and handwriting are, of course, means of communication. It by no means follows, however, that every compulsion of an accused to use his voice or write compels a communication within the cover of the privilege. A mere handwriting exemplar, in contrast to the content of what is written, like the voice or body itself, is an identifying physical characteristic outside its protection.\u201d 388 U. S. at 266-67. Moreover, in <em>Wade </em>the court found no error in compelling an accused bank robber \u201c. . . to speak within hearing distance of the witnesses, even to utter words purportedly uttered by the robber, [which] was not compulsion to utter statements of a \u2018testimonial\u2019 nature,\u201d the accused was only \u201c. . . required to use his voice as an identifying physical characteristic, not to speak his guilt.\u201d 388 U. S. at 222-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Similarly, the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostrowski </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St. 2d 34, held that a handwriting exemplar, used solely for identification purposes, was merely an identifying physical characteristic and, as such, outside the scope of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, even if the words written are identical to the words contained in a writing directly linked to the crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>preme Court concluded that \u201c [a]n examination of the exemplar clearly indicates that it contains nothing \u2018testimonial\u2019 in character, and from an evidentiary standpoint it was used solely for handwriting identification purposes. While it did contain three of the four words printed on the mirror, it also contained, on what appears to be a standard form of the detective bureau, James Ostrowski\u2019s printing of some fourteen names, three street addresses, and all of the arabio numerals. The expert testimony, both of the prosecution and the defense, was not limited merely to a comparison of the three words which appeared both on the mirror and on the exemplar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38-39. The United States Supreme Court denied Ostrowski\u2019s petition for certiorari.'<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">The highest courts of other states have also found no denial of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in the compulsory submission to tests for physical characteristics such as handwriting and voice exemplars. In a procedural setting similar to the instant case the Supreme Court of South Carolina found no denial of the privilege against self-incrimination or the denial of the right to a fair trial in requiring a defendant, during a trial recess, to speak into a telephone so that his voice could be recorded for comparison with the voice of an anonymous person whose call reporting the homicide to police had been automatically recorded. The trial court ordered that the exemplar be recorded out of the presence of the jury by the same police dictaphone that had recorded the anonymous call; the supreme court held such order to be \u201ctantamount to a pre-trial requirement\u201d that the prosecution had requested but to which the defendant had refused to submit. Both recordings were played to the jury for their aural comparison for identification. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vice </em>(1972), 259 S. C. 30, 190 S. E. 2d 510. Appellant\u2019s argument of a denial of his privilege against self-incrimination is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Appellant further argues that the court-ordered voice exemplar violates his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures. When a defendant\u2019s per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>son is the source of the desired evidence, the test of reasonableness is twofold. First, the procedure wMch must be used to obtain the evidence must neither shock the conscience nor offend society\u2019s traditional sense of justice. <em>Rochin </em>v. <em>California </em>(1952), 342 U. S. 165. Second, the search may be made only upon a showing of probable cause. <em>Schmerber v. California </em>(1966), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Clearly, requiring a person to speak, an activity engaged in daily by the vast majority of the public, cannot, in any sense, be considered the type of conduct which offends common notions of decency and fairness. In <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1967), 389 U. S. 347, the Supreme Court said that: \u201cWhat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351. Moreover, the court in <em>Dionisio, supra, </em>said: \u201cThe physical characteristics of a person\u2019s voice, its tone and manner, as opposed to the content of a specific conversation, are constantly exposed to the public. Like a man\u2019s facial characteristics, or handwriting, his voice is repeatedly produced for others to hear. No person can have a reasonable expectation that others will not know the sound of his voice, any more than he can reasonably expect that Ms face will be a mystery to the world.\u201d 410 U. S. at 14. Therefore, a court-ordered voice exemplar is not the type of procedure that could be considered an unreasonable intrusion of the defendant\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The record in this case clearly establishes the requirement of a showing of probable cause. Olderman had already been indicted when the prosecution requested the court-ordered voice exemplar. The court conducted a hearing wherein it was established by testimony that Olderman and a \u201cBob Petrella\u201d were former patients of the victim, that the anonymous telephone caller had mentioned the name of Bob Petrella, and that Olderman and Petrella were known associates; that the victim had singled out Olderman and Petrella as probable suspects based upon what was said over the telephone and further that based on the victim\u2019s personal knowledge of Olderman, he noticed that both Older-man and the anonymous caller had the same distinguishing speech characteristic, a stutter when excited, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>demonstrated on an existing tape. Appellant\u2019s argument of an unreasonable search and seizure is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Finally, appellant argues that the court\u2019s ordering a voice exemplar violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as an interference with the pre-trial process. Appellant further argues that the phrases he was ordered to say were unduly suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">As the defendant\u2019s voice is an identifying physical characteristic and thus real evidence subject to proper seizure and use by the prosecution, the court acted within its power in ordering the prosecution\u2019s motion for a recorded exemplar. Moreover, the lower court acted affirmatively in assuring defendant\u2019s rights to be heard on the issue of whether the exemplar should be ordered, in assuring representation by counsel at every stage of the proceedings, and in reviewing the substance of the exemplar to assure its non-prejudicial content. This was not a denial of due process of law but rather a proper implementation of the role of the court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Moreover, the phrases submitted by the prosecution, approved and ordered by the court for the exemplar contain nothing obviously \u201ctestimonial\u201d in character. The fact that the words chosen for identification purposes are identical to words contained in a communication directly linked to the crime does not render the exemplar testimonial in character and thereby unduly suggestive in derrogation of constitutional rights. <em>Wade, supra </em>at 222; <em>Ostrowski, supra </em>at 38-40. Appellant\u2019s argument that the court\u2019s ordering a voice exemplar was a denial of due process of law is therefore without merit. Appellant\u2019s assignments of error Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Appellant\u2019s assignment of error No. 4 argues that in any event ordering a voice exemplar was error as such recordings<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> are scientifically unproven, inaccurate and thus inadmissible for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>. This court cannot rule at this pre-trial stage of the instant- case <em>whether </em>the voice exemplar sought by the prosecution and ordered by the court <em>will he </em>admissible when and if it is proffered into evidence. It is, nevertheless, this court\u2019s conclusion that voice exemplars are, <em>when properly qualified, </em>admissible. If our conclusion were to the contrary \u2014 that voice exemplars were inadmissible for any purpose as appellant argues \u2014 fairness would dictate that we modify the contempt conviction accordingly. Our conclusion that voice exemplars are admissible is in accord with the growing weight of authority from other jurisdictions on the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The standard of admissibility of scientific evidence such as voice exemplars was set forth in the early federal decision of <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1923), 54 App. D. O. 46, 47, 293 F. 1013, 1014, as follows: \u201c* * * Just when a scientific principle or discovery.crosses the line between the experimental and demonstrable stages is difficult to define. Somewhere in this twilight zone the evidential force of the principle must be recognized, and while courts will go a long way in admitting expert testimony deduced- from a well-recognized scientific principle or discovery, the thing from which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.\u201d Although there are numerous recent decisions under the <em>Frye </em>standard holding that voice-print spectrogram exemplars have not achieved sufficient scientific acceptance for reliability and are thus inadmissible;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we find more persuasive the growing weight of authority finding no inhibition to the admission of recorded</p>\n<p id=\"A2H\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>voice exemplars, offered in the form of . a scientific spectrographic analysis corroborated by expert witnesses. <em>See, e. g., Hodo </em>v. <em>Superior Court, Riverside County </em>(1973), 30 Cal. App. 3d 778, 106 Cal. Rptr. 547; <em>Alea </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla. App. 1972), 265 So. 2d 96; <em>Worley </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla. App. 1972), 263 So. 2d 613; <em>State, ex rel. Trimble, </em>v. <em>Hedman </em>(1971), 291 Minn. 442 [as to probable cause for an arrest warrant]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Andretta </em>(1972), 61 N. J. 544; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1967), 17 U. S. C. M. A. 183, 37 C. M. R. 447; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Franks </em>(6th Cir. 1975), 511 F. 2d 25; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Askins </em>(D. Md. 1972), 351 F. Supp. 408 [all holding spectrographic evidence admissible].</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in a case decided March 27, 1975, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus </em>(1975), \u2014 Mass. \u2014 [initially reported in 43 L. W. 2434], found that spectrographic analysis meets the \u201cgeneral acceptance in scientific community\u201d test and that carefully scrutinized expert testimony on voiceprint can be used against a criminal defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">We therefore conclude that the prosecution\u2019s spectrographic voice-print exemplar is, if properly qualified and shown to be reliable, admissible for identification purposes only. Assignment of error No. 4 is therefore wdthout merit and is overruled.
