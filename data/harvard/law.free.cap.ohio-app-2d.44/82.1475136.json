The complaint was filed on April 15, 1971 and a trial of the issues commenced on September 24, 1973, without the attendance of the plaintiff. On the morning of the second day of trial, September 25, 1973, counsel for plaintiff advised the court that plaintiff could not be present for trial because of the demands of his medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>cal practice then being carried on in another state, and for that reason a continuance was requested. After considerable discussion between the court and both counsel, the details of which are not pertinent here,- the motion for a continuance was overruled. Coincident with the motion for a continuance, the court was considering defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal with prejudice, and in the same breath in which the motion for a continuance was overruled, the motion for dismissal with prejudice was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Immediately, counsel for plaintiff stated: \u201cWe are prepared after the * * * overruling of our motion for a continuance to proceed with certain evidence to the court, and I think we should have the opportunity to do that.\u201d After some remarks by the opposing counsel, counsel for plaintiff said: \u201cWe are ready to proceed with the case. * * *1 would certainly think that we would have the opportunity to continue with the trial of the case.\u201d He outlined to the court in general terms what he intended to offer. Nevertheless, the court restated its ruling granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The entry by which the court\u2019s ruling was journalized recites, in-part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">\u201cUpon due consideration the court finds that plaintiff has failed to prosecute and the plaintiff, Thomas E. Brown, was not present when said case proceeded to trial. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The assignments of error are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">\u201c(1.) The trial court erred by dismissing plaintiff-appellant\u2019s complaint .with prejudice immediately after the denial of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s motion for continuance even though plaintiff-appellant, by his counsel, promptly advised the court that he was ready to proceed with presentations of testimony and evidence to support his case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">\u201c(2.) The trial court erred when it dismissed plaintiff-appellant\u2019s case with prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">Since in our estimate both assignments raise the same question, they will be ruled upon simultaneously. Article I, Section 16 of the Constitution of Ohio provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-12\">\u201cAll courts shall be open, and every person, for an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>jury done him in his land, goods, person, or reputation; shall have remedy by due course of law,- and shall have justice administered without denial or delay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Here, the court must be held to have been aware that despite the denial of his motion for a continuance plaintiff intended to present whatever evidence was available to maintain the issues on his part. Under the circumstances disclosed by the record, the denial of the opportunity so to do constituted an abuse of discretion resulting in a- denial of due process of law to the plaintiff. A litigant has a constitutional guarantee of access to the courts and to deny Mm the opportunity to pursue his course to its end when he stands ready to do so deprives that litigant of that fundamental right.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Consequently, the assignments of error are well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County is reversed and this cause is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b104-8\">Hess, P. J., Shannon and Palmer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
