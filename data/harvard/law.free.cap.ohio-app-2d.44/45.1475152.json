C. 2901.13), rendered by a jury on May 9,1972, in the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is that: the trial court erred \u201cby permitting the alleged eyewitness to identify defendant * * * in open court and in the presence of the jury,\u201d because that identification, the defendant argues, was tainted by unduly suggestive pre-trial photographic identification procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">On the evening of August 23, 1971, Rita Vaughan was \u201cheld up\u201d while clerking in her family\u2019s service store. The robber came into the store on two occasions for a period of three or four minutes each. The first time, he purchased a can of Blatz beer, and on the second trip the holdup took place. Rita followed the robber out of the store. He fled in a car and Rita got into her car and followed him. She was able to obtain the license number and a description of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Later that evening, she was taken to the police station where she was shown about five \u201cmug shots,\u201d and from that group she identified a photograph of the defendant as the man who had held her up. She was not confronted with the defendant that evening, and did not see him until the preliminary hearing, at which time she testified that she recognized the defendant before the hearing. She identified him at that hearing and at his trial before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Within a short time after the robbery, as a result of Rita\u2019s description, the police officers located the vehicle used in the crime. A search of that car, by the police officers, revealed a Blatz beer can, check book, driver\u2019s license, sunglasses, and certain papers belonging to the defendant. The car was titled and its plates were registered in defendant *s name. Later that same evening, the defendant called the police department to report the automobile stolen. Defendant was located and arrested that same night, and charged with armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The defendant contends that the identification of him by the use of \u201cmug shots\u201d was tainted by a police officer pointing out the defendant\u2019s picture and uttering words to the effect: \u201cDoesn\u2019t this man look familiar\u201d? The officer denied this statement during the voir dire hearing, held out of the presence of the jury. Rita Vaughan\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>is uncertain as to whether the officer made that statement, in substance, with regard to the individual picture or the group.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Rita Vaughan indicated repeatedly that she had made the identification without any suggestion or help from anyone, and just from viewing t'he pictures. Testimony reveals that each of the five pictures was of a black male; two of the men had goatees, and four of them (other than the defendant) were approximately 20 years of age. The defendant was allegedly at least 10 years older.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">During defendant\u2019s trial, Rita Vaughan described the robber as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">\u201c * * * The man was, oh, practically six foot tall and he Avas thin and he was black, and he had a black hat on, and sunglasses, and he had long sideburns, and he had a mustache and he had like a goatee that was more or less hooked onto the mustache like this. # * * He had work clothing and I don\u2019t know Whether the shirt was green or the pants, but the combination was green and gray; very neatly pressed and real nice and clean.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The record reveals that, when defendant was arrested that same evening, his face was freshly shaved. At the time of trial, he had a goatee, or similar hirsute growth on his chin.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The question before this court is: Was Rita Vaughan\u2019s in-court identification of the defendant tainted by the viewing of \u201cmug shots,\u201d and the statement of the police officer1?</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">The case of <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1968), 390 U. S. 377, 384, lays down the general standard for testing admissibility :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">\u201c* # * [W]e hold that each case must be considered on its OAvn facts, and that convictions based on eyewitness identification at trial following a pretrial identification by photograph will be set aside on that ground only if the photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">We have reviewed the record and find that Rita Vaugh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>an saw the robber and deliberately studied his features at close range over a counter on two occasions. Further, she observed him leave the store and followed him down the street to the place where he entered the car. She was very positive in her identification, and asserted that her selection of defendant\u2019s photograph out of the group of pictures was based purely on her recollection of the defendant as the man who had held her up. We find that her in-court identification of the defendant was from her independent recollection and observation of the defendant. We fail to find that the police photographic procedure was in any way \u201cimpermissibly suggestive.\u201d The first assignment of error is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The second assignment of error states that \u201cthe weight and sufficiency of the evidence does not sustain appellant\u2019s conviction of armed robbery beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d It is the thrust of defendant\u2019s contention that the prosecuting witness never actually saw a gun in the hand of the robber when he re-entered the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In this regard, Mrs. Vaughan\u2019s testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">\u201c* * * I was filling the candy case * * * and this gentleman came in and he reached over the case. * * * He bent over very slowly * * * and he said \u2018I want all your money; put it in a paper bag, and hurry; I have a gun.\u2019 So, naturally I was fearful for my life and I was scared * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">\u201cHe said, \u2018I want all your money; I have a gun, and hurry up; put it in a paper bag. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\"><em>i C </em># * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">\u201cQ. Did you see the positions of his arms?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">\u201cA. Yes. He was down like this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-11\">\u201cQ. And you\u2019re indicating that he had his right arm extended?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-12\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-13\">\u201cQ. Could you discern whether or not he had anything in his hand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-14\">\u201cA. Yes, sir. He had something that appeared to be a gun. He told me he had a gun, so therefore I was very fearful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-15\">\u201cQ. Can you tell me just what you observed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u201cA. I observed his hand. His arm was stretched ont. His hand was like this. Whatever he had in his hand, he had it covered with a cloth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-3\">\u201cQ. Conld you describe the cloth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-4\">\u201cA. It was greenish colored cloth and soft. It was something like you\u2019d use in a gas station as a cleaning cloth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. But you never saw a gun, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">\u201cA. I saw what appeared to be a gun. He told me he had a gun, so I definitely believed him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">&lt; \u00c9 # # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">\u201cQ. Whatever was underneath was covered by the cloth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">\u201cA. Yes, sir. * * # All I could see was this cloth covering lfis hand with an object in his hand, which he said was a gun and I was scared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-10\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. How far up did this cloth go ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-11\">\u2018 \u2018 A. Well, it covered his hand completely. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">The defendant argues that the failure of Bita Vaughan to actually see a gun should have raised a reasonable doubt in reasonable minds that the state had proved that the defendant was \u201cthen and. there armed with a certain dangerous weapon, to-wit: a gun,\u201d as charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">The defendant urges this court to modify the verdict to one of unarmed robbery, because the verdict of guilty of armed robbery is not sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-14\">As disclosed by the record, Mrs. Vaughan testified to statements made by the robber during the hold up. The jury, as the trier of the facts, had the right to believe or disbelieve the witness, and to decide whether the defendant was, in fact, truthful about having a gun under the cloth that covered his hand. These- statements, together with the other circumstances, were sufficient for the jury to infer that the defendant had a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-15\">The second assignment of error is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-16\">We have examined the record and find that the defendant was afforded a fair and impartial trial, and was represented by skilled counsel. We fail to find any error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>prejudicial to any substantial right of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The judgment of the trial court, entered on the verdict of the jury, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed,.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b70-6\">Victor, P. J., and \"VVasserman, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b70-7\">Wasserman, J., retired, of the Eighth Appellate District, was assigned to active duty, in the Ninth Appellate District, under authority of Article IV, Section 6 (C), Constitution.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
