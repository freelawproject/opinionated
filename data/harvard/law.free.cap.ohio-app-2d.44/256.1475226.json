A number of children were born of the marriage. Prior to the incident, the couple had separated and were living apart in separate dwellings. The defendant had consulted an attorney about instituting divorce proceedings. About 3:30 a. m. on July 25, 1974, the defendant left his home at 832 Ann Street and drove to fhe residence of the decedent at 347 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Loeffler, where the decedent was in bed with her paramour, a Mr. Raymond Miller, in a first floor bedroom. The children were asleep on the second floor. When the defendant, armed with a shotgun, knocked on the front door and demanded entrance, his wife refused (according to testimony of the defendant); whereupon, defendant broke out the glass in a door on the front porch with the butt of his weapon, at which time the shotgun fired. At this time, Miller awoke and fled from the house by the back door, clad only in his shorts (according to Miller\u2019s testimony). The defendant, who stated he heard movements in the bedroom, removed his shoes on the front porch and quickly ran to the rear where he met Miller (whom defendant described as follows: \u201cLike he was glowing. He was stark-brick naked\u201d and twice shot Miller with the shotgun. A scuffle developed. Miller stated he heard the shotgun misfire and was able to escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Meanwhile, the wife had gone up to the second floor and asked her daughter to call the police. The defendant then entered the house through the front door. The daughter testified she heard her father call her mother by name, \u2018 \u2018 Carol, \u2019 \u2019 and then he came up the stairs and called \u2018 \u2018 Carol \u2019 \u2019 again. She testified that he said \u201che killed that other man,\u201d and her mother said: \u201cNo, Thiny!\u201d Her father then said: \u201cCome on out. I ain\u2019t going to kill you!\u201d Her mother replied: \u201cNo, Thiny, I can\u2019t take that for an answer!\u201d So it was about two or three seconds and then a shot. She fell, to the floor. She stated that she saw her mother, but she did not see her father; that she lay down because she was frightened, but did not stay there long because her father kicked the door open and told her to call the ambulance; that she had seen the gun at various times at home, and that she saw her father with it that night after he shot her mother. The defendant left the premises and in a short while turned himself in to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The defendant was indicted for aggravated burglary, R. C. 2911.11, aggravated murder, R. C. 2903.01, and felonious assault, R. C. 2903.11. The jury found the defendant not guilty of aggravated murder, but guilty of volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>tary manslaughter, aggravated assault, and aggravated burglary from which this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"Aer\">Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">\u201cThe verdict, judgment and subsequent sentence on the aggravated burglery charge are contrary to law and must be set aside.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Defendant contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">\u2018 \u2018 [A] man who is legally married and not under any restraining order from a court of competent jurisdiction, cannot be deemed to trespass upon the dwelling of his spouse, hence he cannot commit the act of aggravated burglary within the meaning of the law when a situs of the alleged offense is the dwelling of Ms spouse.\u201d Although a husband has a possessory interest in the abode of Ms spouse and, therefore, may not be found guilty of simple trespass where no violence is involved because of his right to be there, he may not use violence to enforce his possessory interest. In other words, one spouse may not use violence to enter the abode of the other. We find that the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1912), 85 Ohio St. 317, is distinguishable from the instant case. In Phillips, the wife was charged with the theft of money belonging to her husband, from a safe in their joint residence. The court distinguished the facts of <em>Phillips </em>\u201cfrom many of the cases cited in argument, in which there appear schemes of fraud or violence,\u201d in finding that the wife could not be prosecuted for larceny. We find no error in the verdict, judgment and sentence on the charge of aggravated burglary. The first assignment of error is overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in not entering judgment of acquittal on the aggravated burglary charge at the close of the state\u2019s case when defendant moved to dismiss all charges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">\u25a0 For the reasons stated in our ruling upon the first assignment of error, the second assignment of error is likewise overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">Defendant\u2019s third assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">\u201cThe verdict with respect to the aggravated assault conviction is fatally defective and just [sic] be set aside.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Defendant complains that the third count of the indictment charges: \u201cAnd the Grand Jurors aforesaid, upon their oath, do further find and present that Arnold Win-bush on or about the 25th day of July, 1974, within the County of Franklin aforesaid, in violation of Section 2903.-11 R. C. did, knowingly, cause serious physical harm to Raymond Miller. \u2019 \u2019 At trial, the jury found as follows: \u2018 \u2018 The defendant Arnold Winbush [is] guilty of aggravated assault as he stands charged in the indictment. * * *\u201d It should be noted that the words \u201cas he stands charged in the indictment\u201d appear on the form the jury used and are not words written by the jurors. It is clear that the jury, in declining to find the-defendant guilty of the more serious offense of felonious assault, chose to find the defendant guilty of the included offense of aggravated assault. The words \u201cas he stands charged in the indictment\u201d is a mistake in the language of the form used rather than a mistake of the jury and such words may be rejected as mere surplusage. Jury verdicts in criminal cases are to have reasonable constructions and are not to be declared void unless from necessity originating in doubt of their import or irresponsiveness to the issue submitted, or unless they show a manifest tendency to work injustice. Paragraph 2 of the syllabus in <em>State </em>v. <em>McNicol </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">In this case, we find a mere technical error in the use of the jury verdict form which actually inures to the benefit of the defendant and causes defendant no prejudice. There is no prejudicial error here. The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Defendant\u2019s fourth assignment of error relates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">\u201cThe finding of guilt on aggravated assault and voluntary manslaughter is against the manifest weight of the evidence hence must be set aside.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Defendant contends that a review of the entire record indicates that the defendant was legally insane at the time of the offense, requiring a finding that the jury lost its way because the defendant was psychotic and suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the offense</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">A psychologist, Mrs. Dorothy Turner, testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>she was not sure if the defendant knew right from wrong at the time of the crime, but she felt that defendant was incapable of resisting the impulse to kill his wife and shoot Raymond Miller. A psychiatrist, Dr. Henry Luidens, agreed with Mrs. Turner, that defendant was a paranoid schizophrenic, but stated: \u201cHe had the knowledge of right from wrong and he had the ability to desist from doing the wrong, to abjure the wrong as that section says.\u201d He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax2\">\u201c * * * I think he had the ability at that moment to resist doing it. * * * I said he did know right from wrong at the time. * * * Yes, that\u2019s a speculative point but that\u2019s the part that is kind of hard to say, how much rage and passion overcame him and how much control he had over that, that\u2019s pretty difficult, that\u2019s speculative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">In a criminal case, the defense of insanity is an affirmative defense. In order to find the jury\u2019s verdict against the manifest weight of the evidence upon that issue, sufficient evidence must be adduced so that the only reasonable conclusion therefrom is that disease, or some other defect of his mind had so impaired his reason that at the time of the criminal act with which he is charged he either did not know that such act was wrong, or he did not have the ability to refrain from the act. <em>State </em>v. <em>Staten </em>(1969), 18 Ohio St. 2d 13, paragraph 2 of the syllabus; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St. 2d 203. Here, the state of the evidence was such that reasonable minds could reach different conclusions. The fourth assignment of error is overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b280-6\">Holmes and Whiteside, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
