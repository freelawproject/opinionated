J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-V\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Hamilton County Municipal Court. Defendant, the appellant, was found guilty of parking her one-half ton truck in the street in front of her house in violation of Ordinance No. 341.16 of the city of Wyoming, which reads: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-12\">\u201cThe parking of commercial vehicles in public streets-in the city for more than two hours during the period from 6:00 P. M. \u2014 6:00 A. M. daily is prohibited. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">It was stipulated by counsel that defendant\u2019s vehicle had not been used for commercial purposes despite the fact it had a license plate of the type issued to commercial vehicles by the state of Ohio. The trial court held that \u201ca vehicle is determined to be a \u2018commercial vehicle\u2019 or a \u2018non-commercial vehicle\u2019 by the license plates thereon.\u201d Accordingly, he found defendant guilty of violating Ordinance No. 341.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-14\">B. C. 4501.01(G) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-15\">\u201c \u2018Commercial car\u2019 means any motor vehicle having motor power designed <em>and used </em>for carrying merchandise or freight or used as a commercial tractor.\u201d (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>A review of the statutes of Ohio relating to the issuing of license plates, indicates that the designation \u201ccommercial car\u201d is used in reference to license plates issued for any motor vehicle designed and used for commercial tractor,\u201d which type of commercial vehicle is not involved in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">In the instant case, in the absence of any statutory definition of \u201ccommercial vehicle,\u201d other than the statutory definition of \u201ccommercial car,\u201d which also appears in the ordinances of the city of Wyoming, and in view of the stipulation of the parties that defendant\u2019s vehicle is not used for commercial purposes, we conclude that defendant\u2019s vehicle is not a commercial vehicle within the purview of Ordinance No. 341.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter a final judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b64-7\">McCormac and Buzzard, J J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b64-8\">Cook, P.
