He meanwhile retained private legal counsel who appeared before the trial court on April 29, at what apparently was a pre-trial conference, and there agreed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>behalf of the defendant to a May 30 trial date on the charge of aggravated robbery. The defendant, at all times relevant to this appeal, was unable to make bond and was incarcerated. On the date set for trial, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved for dismissal predicated upon the failure of the state to bring the defendant to trial within the time required by R. C. 2945.71, ninety days after the arrest. Defendant\u2019s counsel also indicated to the court that in the event the court overruled his motion, he would not be ready for trial on the instant day inasmuch as his alibi defense required additional time to locate missing witnesses. The trial court, after submitting the matter, granted the motion and entered judgment dismissing the indictment against the defendant, stating in its corrected entry of dismissal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-3\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court finds that it has no discretion in this matter and that under the provisions of Ohio Revised Code 2945.73 it is required by law to discharge the defendant in these proceedings and that there is no discretion on the Court\u2019s part in these matters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The state thereafter timely filed its notice of appeal from this judgment and, contemporaneously, its motion for leave to appeal. This court granted leave to appeal and ordered the appeals consolidated. The state presents two assignments of error addressed to the merits of the trial court\u2019s judgment, and a third raising technical matters subsumed in the action taken herein and unnecessary to further discuss. The two merit arguments, reduced to their essentials, urge error in granting the motion to dismiss under R. C. 2945.73, where defendant\u2019s own counsel voluntarily agreed to a trial date beyond the ninety day period from the date of arrest, and where the court decided that it had no discretion to continue the matter beyond the ninety day period. We agree that the judgment of the trial court was in error, and that its stringent view of the mandate of R. C. 2945.71 et seq. cannot be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The first requirement in reviewing this problem; it seems to us, is to understand clearly the relationship'between the constitutional mandate for a speedy tri\u00e1l and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>the Ohio statute which implements it, and to thereby appreciate the limits of the question raised in this appeal. Thus, the majority of this court does not view the case before us as presenting a viable argument that there has occurred, on these facts, a deprivation of the right to a speedy trial based on the broad definition of that right in the United States and Ohio Constitutions, except in the limited sense that R. C. 2945.71 et seq. attempt to implement and codify the right by setting out specific temporal requirements as to criminal trial procedure. We do not understand that either the general law of the land, as it has been expressed in Sixth Amendment cases, or the Ohio statutes themselves, would view the specific time limitations set out in R. C. 2945.71 as finally and immutably definitive of the Sixth Amendment generalization of the right to a speedy trial. We think this conclusion follows from a review of recent United States Supreme Court decisions, beginning with <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo </em>(1972), 407 U. S. 514, a case where the petitioner was not brought to trial on a murder charge for more than five years after his arrest because of a series of continuances secured by the prosecutor, which were not objected to by the petitioner for 3% years. After petitioner finally objected, a further delay of 1% years intervened before trial and conviction. Rejecting any inflexible rule measuring the right to a speedy trial, the Supreme Court adopted an \u201cad hoc balancing\u201d test, in which the conduct of the parties is measured against such factors as the length and reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant. Applied against the facts of the case, the court found no constitutional infringement of the Sixth Amendment right. Additional qualifications of this balancing test were provided in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1973), 414 U. S. 25, where an affirmative showing of prejudice by the accused, one of the facts to be considered, was held not essential.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Several principles pertinent to the instant inquiry may be abstracted from the <em>Barker </em>decision. The Supreme Court pointed out that the right to a speedy trial generally differs from other more specific and fundamental rights of accused persons enshrined in the Constitution. In addition to being \u201cmore vague\u201d (407 U. S. at 521) and \u201cslippery\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 522) than, say, the right to counsel or to a jury trial, or to freedom from self-incrimination, it requires the substantially more drastic remedy of dismissal of charges against the accused. In addition, the Supreme Court justly observed that there are many occasions, and perhaps <em>most </em>occasions, in which delay works to the <em>advantage </em>of the accused <em>(id. </em>at 521). For these and other reasons, the Supreme Court has rejected the idea of quantifying the speedy trial right into a specified number of days or months, although recognizing the rights of states to prescribe reasonable periods consistent with constitutional standards. Similarly rejected is the \u201cdemand-waiver\u201d approach automatically limiting the right to cases where the accused <em>demands </em>a speedy trial; rather, the presence or absence of demand is relegated to one of the \u201cfactors\u201d to be considered in arriving at a balanced determination. But, in any event, states the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\">\u201cWe hardly need add that if delay is attributable to the defendant, then his waiver may be given effect under standard waiver doctrine, the demand rule aside.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">An additional factor in the balancing test has been suggested by one authority, which although not expressly articulated in the <em>Barker </em>decision, is clearly consistent therewith:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">\u201c * * * [T]he test for when a trial is too long delayed by (sic) Sixth Amendment purposes is one thing when a defendant is asking for a trial. There they will be very brief indeed and he may have a right to a very quick trial. * # * It will be somewhat longer when what he is asking for is the right to have the charges dismissed without prejudice, <em>and it' might he quite long indeed before he is entitled to dismissal of the charges with </em>prejudice <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The justice of this comment becomes apparent when applied to the instant case, where the defendant moved for the dismissal of all charges against him because of the state\u2019s failure to bring him to trial within ninety days, but announced at the same time that if his motion were overruled, <em>he. would not be ready for trial but would require a continuance to prepare his defense. </em>Under such circumstances, where prejudice to the accused is wholly absent and the other negative factors in the <em>Barker </em>test either absent or minimal, the existence of any serious Sixth Amendment argument is inconceivable.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The question remains, nevertheless, whether the defendant was entitled to a dismissal of the charge, even though his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was not violated, where under the circumstances of this case he was not brought to trial within ninety days from the date of his arrest, as is arguably inflexibly required under R. C. 2945.71. For while it is clear that the states may not <em>extend </em>the mandate of the Sixth Amendment beyond the time contemplated therein, <em>Klopfer </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1967), 386 U. S. 213, they are free \u201cto prescribe a <em>reasonable </em>period consistent with constitutional standards.\u201d <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, supra </em>at 523 (emphasis added). These would include, obviously, periods which would substantially reduce what would otherwise be held proper under the Sixth Amendment. The instant ease might well serve as an example of such reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The dispositive question here, therefore, is whether the Ohio statutes were properly construed as mandating the defendant\u2019s dismissal. We hold that they were not, and that the trial court erred in entering the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">R. C. 2945.72 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">\u201cThe time within which an accused must be brought to trial, or, in the case of a felony, to preliminary hearing and trial, may be extended only by the following * # * (H) The period of any continuance granted on the accused\u2019s own motion, and the period of any reasonable continuance granted other than upon the accused\u2019s own motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>As relevant to the instant factual situation, the statute thus provides two instances<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> where the stringent limitations of R. C. 2945.71 may be both waived and subjected to the discretion of the trial court: (1) where time is extended on the accused\u2019s \u201cown motion\u201d or (2) other \u201creasonable continuance\u201d where accused\u2019s consent is immaterial. Applied to the judgment appealed from here, it is immediately apparent that the conclusion of the trial court that it \u201chas no discretion in this matter\u201d is faulty, and would be faulty even if it were determined that the time was not extended as a result of the first exception, i. e., as a result of the accused\u2019s own motion. Thus, we take it that if the May 30th trial date had been selected, for example, because of a missing witness,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or because it was the first open date for which the judge or courtroom was available for trial,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the continuance might well have been held to have been \u201creasonable\u201d on those grounds alone. Clearly, the trial court was not, as it thought, precluded from considering these or other factors in determining whether the continuance to May 30th, roughly two weeks beyond the ninety day limit, was reasonable under the circumstances. The case was not therefore necessarily subject to dismissal for delay under R. C. 2945.73.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">However, while the trial court misconceived the extent of its discretion in granting a continuance, or an original trial setting, on its own motion, it is unnecessary to remand the matter on that basis for a determination of the reasons for the setting,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> since we deem the <em>other </em>issue under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>R. C. 2945.72(H), where a continuance is secured on the defendant\u2019s own motion, to be dispositive of the issue in this appeal. Here, as previously discussed, the continuance to May 30th was <em>arguably </em>proper if the court had found the existence of certain of the factors previously mentioned which made the continuance a reasonable one, but it was <em>clearly </em>proper if the continuance may be said to have been on the accused\u2019s own motion. Under these conditions, the motion to dismiss should have been overruled without more, and without the necessity for the inquiry required under the first exception into the reasonableness of the trial date setting. We are persuaded that such, indeed, was the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The trial court found, in its corrected entry of dismissal, and without objection or exception by the defendant, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">\u201c3. Privately retained legal counsel on April 29, 1974, which period was within the ninety day provision for the trial required by the statute agreed to a trial date of this matter which trial was commenced on May 30,1974.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">While the record does not disclose at whose initiative the trial date was fixed, we take it that the statute ought not to be so literally read that subsection (H) of R. C. 2945.72 is held to require a motion to be drafted, initiated, and/or presented by the defendant himself before it may be said to be his \u201cown motion.\u201d We think it is clear and accordingly hold that a motion to fix or to continue a trial date beyond the ninety day period may become the accused\u2019s own motion within the meaning of R. C. 2945.72 (H), by adoption or agreement as well as by initiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Finally, it has been suggested that the motion to continue or, as in our case, the agreement to fix the trial date, is required to be made, or at least affirmatively consented to, by the accused <em>personally </em>because the matter is of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>constitutional magnitude that the agreement of the defendant\u2019s own counsel is ineffective to waive the statutory time limitation. We find ourselves unable to agree with this argument for three reasons. First, we do not believe, for the reasons set forth in Part I of this decision, that the question presents an otherwise unmanageable Sixth Amendment or other constitutional rights problem of the order of those rights which by their nature have been held to preclude action, consent, or waiver by proxy, such as an entry of a plea of guilty, a waiver of trial by jury, an appearance at sentencing, etc. Secondly, we find that where such undelegable rights of the accused <em>are </em>involved, the Rules of Criminal Procedure meticulously accord them recognition by carefully and explicitly requiring action by the accused personally, while in other instances (including the present example) the words \u201caccused\u201d or \u201cdefendant\u201d are used without such qualification, either generieally or with the phrase \u201cof counsel\u201d conjoined, to indicate action, consent or waiver in the customary course by either the individual or his attorney.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Lastly, where, as here, indulgence in such considerations is not precluded by some more critical consideration, we find that we disapprove of what we perceive to be some tendency to detract from the dignity and importance of the attorney in his joint role as an officer of the court and the advocate of his client in assisting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>orderly and proper dispatch of judicial proceedings. We have difficulty conceiving it to he either in the public interest or as enhancing the individual\u2019s procedural or substantive rights by defining due process of law without regard to or by diminishing the vital role played by the attorney at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we find the assignments of error well taken and grant the same. T'he judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County is accordingly reversed,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings according to this decision and law.</p>\n<judges id=\"b123-5\">Shannon, P.

Neither is it here. Thus, we hold that a motion to discharge for delay in trial under R. C. 2945.73 (a motion to dismiss under Crim. R. 12(A)), inasmuch as it performs the function of the now abolished motion to quash, is one of those instances where, under R.

Commenting first upon Assignment of Error 3,1 agree with the majority that the trial court erred in deciding \u201cthat there is no discretion on the court\u2019s part in these matters.\u201d My conception of the intendment of the following language in R. C. 2945.72(H) is to vest trial courts with discretion, consistent with reasonableness, as the statute demands:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>The time within which an accused must be brought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>trial, or, in the case of felony, to preliminary hearing and trial, may be extended only by the following * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">\u201c(H) The period of any continuance granted on the accused\u2019s'own motion, <em>and the period of any reasonable continuance granted other than upon the accused\u2019s own motion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">What is reasonable must bear a direct relationship to the facts in each ease. In view of the obvious intent of the legislature to have criminal charges disposed of with dispatch, thus serving the interests of the state and the rights of the defendant, the time extension which a trial court can grant under R. C. 2945.72 (H) generally would consist of a few days continuance, possibly several weeks,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but probably never months. The language and spirit of R. C. 2945.71, 72 and 73 speak eloquently of the legislature\u2019s intent, so far as (H) is concerned, simply to provide for a reasonable continuance as an escape or relief valve from contingencies such as excessive case loads, no courtroom being available or the temporary incapacity of the court. However, that portion of (II) which grants judicial discretion as to continuances is not an invitation to indiscriminate postponements.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Whenever a court upon its own motion orders a reasonable continuance, under (H), the basis for such action must affirmatively appear in the record. The reason or reasons cited in the record must always satisfy the concept of \u201creasonableness.\u201d Consequently, I agree with the decision to remand this case to the court of common pleas. It should proceed with a hearing incident to a discretionary determination whether or not the complete factual situation confronting it in this case justifies a reasonable extention of the trial date beyond 90 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The other assignment of error to which I desire to direct evaluation is No. 2. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">\u201cThe Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, .Ohio, committed error when privately retained legal <em>counsel agreed </em>to a trial date beyond the 90 day period from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the date of- arrest and thereafter held that this agreement as to the trial date was not binding upon the defendant and did not waive his statutory right to be tried within a period of 90 days from the date of his arrest.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">My brothers come to the conclusion that this assignment is well taken and that counsel\u2019s agreement to a trial date beyond the 90 day period is effective without any showing of the participation by the defendant himself in such continuance. I disagree. My conclusion would be that counsel\u2019s agreement in this case was not binding on defendant and the assignment should be held meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The record establishes no affirmative selection of the delayed trial date either by defendant or his counsel. There is an ambiguity about who chose the May 30, 1974 date. There is no indication that the defendant was present when it was selected. In fact the clear implication from the record is that the prosecuting attorney and defense counsel were there, but <em>defendant was not. </em>Defense counsel maintained consistently that he merely \u201caccepted\u201d May 30, suggesting at most aequiesence. Neither defendant nor his counsel made a \u201cmotion\u201d for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Whether mere aequiesence in a trial setting can fairly bo equated with a motion, as required by the first part of R. C. 2945.72 (H), seems highly questionable. Assuming for the sake of argument only that defense counsel\u2019s acceptance of a trial date did amount to a motion brings us then to a determination of whether counsel under the instant facts, as a prosy, had authority to agrae to a trial date beyond the 90 days mandated in R. C. 2945.71.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The defendant has a constitutional right to a speedy trial, guaranteed both by the federal and state constitutions. <em>Klopfer </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1967), 386 U. S. 213. In Ohio, the new criminal code, effective January 1,1974, establishes :n definite authoritative time schedule according to which 'those accused of crime must be tried. In Ohio now, generally speaking, a speedy trial does not depend on circumstances and is no longer a relative concept unless the statutory exceptions in R. O. 2945.72 apply. '</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Is the right to a speedy trial within the criminal code\u2019s present requirements therefore a substantial one? In <em>Klopfer, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court describes the sacredness of the right in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\">\u201cThe history of the right to a speedy trial and its reception in this country clearly establish that it is one of the <em>most basic rights </em>preserved by our Constitution. 386 U. S. at 226.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">My colleagues have concluded that the agreement to fix the trial date beyond the 90 day period is not of such constitutional magnitude that defendant\u2019s own counsel is ineffective to waive the statutory time limitation. I am obliged to reach a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The manifest intendment of R. C. 2945.71 in quantifying into a specific number of days what constitutes a speedy trial in this state compels the conclusive determination that this defendant has a right personally to be present and the opportunity to approve or reject a trial date which exceeds 90 days after arrest. In the factual framework before us, defendant\u2019s personal consent was essential, and there is no showing even of his presence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Defendant has a significant stake in a delayed trial setting; that is, his entitlement to be discharged if not tried within time. See R. C. 2945.73. The accused\u2019s consent to or acquiesence in any trial delay beyond 90 days (or in other fact situations beyond the limitations prescribed in R. C. 2945.71) cannot be presumed; it must affirmatively appear from the record which here it does not. (It is observed parenthetically that most lawyers not only would prefer, but insist upon the personal consent of an accused who is their client in such matters.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">When a trial setting is <em>within </em>the periods established in R. O. 2945.71 \u2014 not the instant situation \u2014 counsel will be presumed, in the absence of a showing to the contrary, to have full authority without the presence of the defendant. Possible discharge for delay is not usually involved in instances of timely settings.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>There is no perfect fact parallel between the case at bar and <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State </em>(1962), 372 P. 2d 785, but it contains similar facts, one of which is the absence of the defendant from certain proceedings incident to his criminal trial. What was said in <em>Brown </em>is worthy of note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\">\u201cThe defendant had not waived his right to be present; in fact he did not know that the hearing was being held. It is true that his attorney was present. But the proceeding that occurred appears to us to have been of such a nature that defendant himself should have been present in person * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">\u201cWe believe that under the circumstances * * * the appellant\u2019s presence was required * * * and that his right to be present was as vital to his defense as his specific constitutional right to be confronted with the witnesses against hiTYi ^ <em>Id </em>8,t 789</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1965), 213 N. E. 2d 445, the Court of Appeals of New York held that the unexplained absence of the defendant from the pre-trial hearing on his motion to suppress required reversal of his conviction. Admittedly, the matter before us is not a review of a motion to suppress. However, there is adequate identity between the issues to justify noting the following from the New York decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">\u201cWhat is of primary importance after all is the strong social policy in favor of requiring the presence of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">\u201cIn my view the decision below [which affirmed the conviction] # * <em>* </em>is a violation of fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">R. C. 2953.21 <em>et seq. </em>provide for a post-conviction determination of constitutional rights including, of course, one\u2019s right to a speedy trial. I am convinced that one of the incidental and collateral advantages to denying proxy extensions beyond times required for trial in R. C. 2945.71 will be the avoidance, at least to some extent, of resort by defendants to petitions for post-conviction review of criminal judgments with attendant multiplication of time consuming judicial determinations and especially hearings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\"> Webster defines \u201cseveral\u201d as \u201cmore than two but fewer than many.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\"> There is no attempt here absolutely to determine what amounts to \u201cpersonal consent\u201d in each case. However, the minimum requirement is the presence of the defendant when a delayed trial date is fixed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
