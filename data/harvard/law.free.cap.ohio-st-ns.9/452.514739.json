A. Stone against Candee and Scribner, requiring them, said Webster and Gaylord, to appear and answer as to their indebtedness to Candee and Scribner; that on the 30th of December, 1848, and before said Webster and Gaylord were, by the process, required to answer as to their indebtedness to Candee and Scribner, due notice of said assignment of the debt to Marsh was by him given to Webster and Gaylord ; that the suit in attachment was continued, from.time to time, in said court of common pleas, upon a plea to the jurisdiction of the court, until the term held September 23, 1851, when the suit in attachment was settled and discontinued; that on the 2d day of February, 1852, Webster and Gaylord paid to Marsh six hundred and thirty-eight dollars and fifty cents, to apply on their said indebtedness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-10\">No other evidence was offered by either party; and thereupon the plaintiffs asked the court to assess the damages and render judgment for the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars \u2014 that being \u25a0the amount due on the debt, if, by law, the defendants were bound to pay interest on the debt during the time the suit in attachment was pending,, which the court refused to do, but assessed the damages of the plaintiffs at eighteen dollars, the amount due if the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>fendants were not bound to pay interest during the time the attachment suit was pending; 'to which ruling *and assessment of damages the plaintiffs excepted, and moved the court for a new trial, on the ground that the ruling and assessment of damages were contrary to law; but the court overruled the motion, and entered-judgment for the amount of the damages so assessed; and the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-5\">To reverse this judgment, the present proceedings in error were brought ;\u25a0 and the assignment of errors are, that the district court erred in refusing to allow the plaintiffs interest on the debt during the pendency of the suit in attachment, and in overruling their motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b373-6\"><em>Buckland &amp; Everets, </em>and <em>C.

The garnishee, however, is only there entitled to the benefit of the rule, upon his standing as a mere stakeholder between the plaintiff and defendant, admitting his liability to pay to the party entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>to receive the money, or, at least, not denying his liability to pay. In that state, the <em>general rule </em>is understood to be that the garnishee is not chargeable with interest during the time he is restrained by the attachment from paying. But if the garnishee is chargeable with fraud or collusion, or occasioning unreasonable delay, he will, in that state, be charged with interest. Fitzgerald <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 2 Hall. 215; Mackey <em>v. </em>Hodgsen, 9 Penn. St. 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">A similar rule prevails in Maine. The garnishee is there held to be entitled to the benefit of the presumption that he was ready to pay but restrained by the attachment. And the garnishee is only chargeable with interest in that state, upon the proof of facts rebutting such presumption. Norris <em>v. </em>Hall, 18 Maine, 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">So, too, in Georgia a similar rule obtains. It is there presumed, in the absence of proof of the contrary, that the garnishment restrains the garnishee from paying the money when he would otherwise have paid the same. Georgia Insurance and Trust Company <em>v. </em>Oliver, 1 Georgia, 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">In Massachusetts a similar rule obtains. The presumption is there, in the absence of any proof upon the subject, that the garnishee is, by the attachment, restrained from paying, and the interest upon a debt otherwise drawing interest, is not chargeable to the garnishee. But if the proof show that the garnishee has, in fact, made use of the money during the pendency of the attachment, the presumption in his favor is thereby overcome, and he is chargeable with interest. Prescott <em>v. </em>Parker, 4 Mass. 170; Adams <em>v. </em>Cordis, 8 Pick. 270. In the latter case-the *court say: \u201c <em>Prima facie, </em>the service of the trustee writ stays the property in the hands of the trustee, and the law considers that it remains in <em>statu quo </em>until the judgment; but if it appears by the answer that the money is in constant use, or so mixed -up with his general funds as to form part of his trading capital, the reason of the rulo ceases, and so the rule itself ought not to be applied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">In Virginia the garnishee is charged with interest during .the pendency of the attachment, the same as in any other action for the recovery of money, unless he pay the money into court. Tazewell\u2019s Ex\u2019r <em>v. </em>Barrett &amp; Co., 4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">In Maryland the rule j&gt;revailing in Pennsylvania, that the garnishee shall not bo compelled to pay interest pending the attachment, unless guilty of fraud or collusion, or unreasonable delay, has been rejected. The reason given is thus expressed: \u201cNothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>can appear to be more just and equitable than that when a debtor is positively prohibited from paying his creditor, or is prevented from doing so by the overruling calamity of war, he ought not to ' pay interest. Because in such case he is compelled against his will to become the holder or bailee of the money at his own risk.\u201d . . . . \u201cBut in this state a garnishee in an attachment case is not thus absolutely tied up and restricted. He is not bound to hold the money at his own risk and against his consent, or longer than he chooses.\u201d . . . \u201cI take it to be the established law of this state that the defendant, in all actions founded on contract for the recovery of a debt, may have leave, as a matter of course, to bring the sum sued for into court, and thus put a stop to the further accumulation of interest and costs, at least for so much as he brings in.\u201d Chase <em>v. </em>Munhardt, 1 Bland, 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">It has been held in Missouri that the fact of the garnishee, in his answer, denying his indebtedness, fully rebutted the presumption \u25a0insisted upon in his favor, that he had had the money lying idle by him to pay the indebtedness, and so ought not to be charged interest. And the *court refused to exempt the garnishee from his liability to pay interest in the case during the pendency of the attachment. \u201c There are cases,\u201d says the court, \u201c in which the garnishee ought not, in strict justice, to be held liable for interest ; as where he comes forward, admits his indebtedness, and avows a readiness to pay the amount thereof, whenever the court shall determine who is entitled to receive it.\u201d Stephens\u2019 Garnishee, etc. <em>v. </em>Wathney, 9 Missouri, 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">In this want of uniformity in the decisions of the other states upon the subject, owing in part to the difference in the statutes of the different states, as well as to the different views taken of the subject, wo have in the absence of any previously-established rule in this state, regarded ourselves at liberty to have respect to our own statute and practice, and endeavor to apply to the case such a rule as may, in its general application, seem most in accordance with reason and the rights of the respective parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Our statute of June 1, 1824, fixing the rate, and providing for the payment of interest in this state, provides \u201c that all creditors shall bo entitled to receive interest' on all money after the same shall become due,\u201d <em>. \u201c </em>until such debt, money, or property shall be paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">The act allowing and regulating writs of attachment, of June, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>1824, under which the attachment proceedings mentioned in the record before us, were conducted, is only to be regarded an action for the recovery of an existing indebtedness. The section under which the garnishment of defendant in error was had, simply authorizes the collection of a debt by a third person, by <em>his </em>creditor, instead of its being collected by the payee, the person himself to whom the same is due.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The real question before us, therefore, seems to be this: Is it incumbent upon the debtor where the general rule of law imposes \u2022interest as an incident to delay in payment, to <em>show a cause </em>for a \u2022suspension of the general rule; or is a cause of suspension to be <em>presumed </em>merely *from the fact of payment being demanded by the creditor of the debtor\u2019s payee.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">All the adjudications in other states referred to, seem consentaneous upon the <em>reason </em>for which the garnishee should be exempt from paying interest during his garnishment. And that reason is, that during the pendency of the attachment proceedings, the garnishee is, while so exempt from paying interest, holding the money as a trustee for another, and without using it, or deriving any benefit from so holding it. The exemption is put upon the ground, in Pennsylvania, that the attachment prevents the use, and receipt of profit thereby, of the money by the garnishee, and rests, consequently, upon'the same principle as the question of interest in the case of Osborn and others <em>v. </em>Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738. But that was a case arising under positive proof of the party being put, by law, in the attitute of a stakeholder. Osborn, as the auditor of the State of Ohio, being about to enter the bank, with process, and seize upon $50,000 specie, to satisfy a delinquent tax, the bank procured, in the circuit court of the United States, the allowance of an injunction against his taking the money. But the injunction was only served upon Osborn after he had taken the money from the bank at Chilli eothe, and while on his way to the treasury at Columbus. In that case, the auditor, Osborn, in obedience to the injunction, having retained the money in his possession, in the attitude of a stakeholder between the two claimants, the bank on the one hand and the state on the other, the court very properly held that he ought not to be chargeable with interest while so restrained from using the coin in question, at the instance of the party to which it was decreed to be paid. The court say of the injunction suit in that case: \u201cIts effect and operation were to place it (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>coin) in the custody of the law. The defendants could not use it, and consequently can not be charged with interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">And it is only upon the fact being proved or presumed that *a garnishee is in like manner restrained from using the amount of money necessary to pay his indebtedness, and that the same was by the attachment proceedings placed in the custody of the law, that the garnishee has been hold exempt from payment of interest, in the State of Pennsylvania and other states, during the attachment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The precise question, therefore, before us, is, may such fact be <em>presumed </em>in favor of the debtor, or must it be proved by him, like any other defense, after the proof of his indebtedness and liability by the plaintiff?</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">It has already been seen that the law subjecting the debtor to the liability of paying interest in this state, continues such liability as <em>an incident to the </em>debt, <em>\u201c </em>until such debt, money, or property is paid.\u201d The statute makes no exception in favor of any legal proceedings. And the exemption by reason of an injunction or garnishment seems to rest entirely upon the idea of the money being <em>actually held by the party in readiness to be disposed of as directed by the court; </em>and so being in the custody of the law, to be regarded <em>a quasi </em>payment, as if placed on deposit subject to the order of the court. Nothing short of such a state of facts, we think, should have exempted the defendant in this case from the payment of interest during the pendency of the attachment proceedings. The record shows no proof of such a state of facts in this case. It is not pretended that the defendant, either before or during the attachment, expressed a wish or even willingness to pay his indebtedness. Nor does it appear that he was ready to pay. If, then, the defendant is in law exempt from payment of interest during the time of his garnishment, for the reason that he was actually holding the money ready and willing to pay, but was prevented by the attachment proceedings, such state of facts <em>must be presumed. </em>But a presumption is the supposition of a truth, grounded on circumstantial <em>or probable </em>evidence. It should always be a natural and reasonable deduction from ^pertinent circumstances and relative existing facts, to constitute a legal presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Arc there, then, any circumstances or facts shown in this case from which the defendant may reasonably be presumed to have held the money during the time of his garnishment, in readiness to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>4he debt, and to have been prevented paying by such attachment jproceedings?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The facts shown by the record are, that the. debt had been due for some time previous to the attachment, and that it remained due for a long time after the attachment was dismissed or terminated, without any offer to pay on the part of the defendant. Add to this the fact that the defendant had it in his power during all the time of the attachment proceedings, whenever ready and desirous of paying, to bring the money into court and pay the same under the order of the court, upon motion or bill of interpleader, and to have released himself from further liability, and the natural presumption would seem to be, that the defendant was not ready and willing to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">We do not think that in such cases as the one under consideration, any presumption arises from the fact of the attachment proceedings that should exempt the garnishee from paying interest during the pendency of such proceedings. A party seeking to avail himself of an exemption from his general liability to pay interest on his indebtedness under such circumstances, must show such a state of facts as in equity entitle him to. exemption. No such state of \u25a0facts appears upon the record in this case. We think, therefore, that the district court erred in holding that the defendant was not chargeable with interest during the pendency of the attachment proceedings, and for this cause the judgment of that court must be reversed, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b378-7\">Brinkerhorr, C.
