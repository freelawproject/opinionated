The proposition is too well settled to require citation of authority that a court may not set aside the order of a fact-finding administrative body, acting within the field of its designated powers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>unless such order is illegal, capricious or unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Upon consideration of the briefs and argument of counsel, and from a review of the whole record in this proceeding, the Court is of the opinion that the findings made by the Commission are amply supported by the evidence, that those findings are adequate to sustain the Commission\u2019s orders, and that the Commission acted within the scope of its authority and without unreasonable abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">It is therefore considered, ordered, and adjudged by the Court that \u2022 the temporary restraining order be and it hereby is terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Further considered, ordered, and adjudged by the Court that the complaint be and the same hereby is dismissed. Costs are taxed against the plaintiffs, for which, unless presently paid, execution may issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
