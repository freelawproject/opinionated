The United States and the Commission jointly answered, and the Southern Pacific Company duly intervened as defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-14\">A three-judge court was convened. The record we have before us consists of the pleadings, the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission made herein and the certified copy of the record before the Interstate Commerce Commission. In addition we have been furnished with briefs and the cause has been orally argued and submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-16\">The compass of our review is narrow. If the Commission\u2019s order is justified and supported by the Findings contained in the Commission\u2019s report, the Commission\u2019s order must stand. We so conclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-17\">We find this cause to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-18\">It is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
