Whether the attorney general as representing the public also has the right to appeal from such a decree, <em>quaere.</em></headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-8\">Petition filed in the Land Court on May 23, 1904, by the First National Bank of Woburn as the owner of certain land with the buildings thereon bounded northwesterly by Main Street in that city, claiming title in fee simple to the middle line of that highway, to have its title registered and confirmed and to have the line of that highway determined, and also to have the line of a certain private way determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-9\">The city of Woburn appeared and filed an answer objecting to the establishment of the street upon the line asked for by the petitioner. The case was heard by <em>Jones, </em>J., .who ruled \u201cas a matter of law that no easement of way has been acquired by the public or the city of Woburn over a strip of land belonging to the petitioner lying between the base line of its bank building and the easterly line of Main Street as laid out; said strip of land being 60.15 feet long, 2.60 feet wide at the northerly end and 2.47 feet wide at the southerly end.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-10\">He made a decree for the petitioner; and the city of Woburn appealed to the Superior Court.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1R\">In this case the Superior Court allowed a motion of the petitioner to dismiss the appeal, taken to that court from an order of the Land Court, upon a petition for the registration of a title. The respondent took an exception to the ruling of the Superior Court, and this presents the only question before us. The ground of the decision was that the city of Woburn had no interest which gave it a standing as a party and entitled it to prosecute an appeal. The question which arose in the Land Court was, whether the petitioner\u2019s title was good up to the line of the street as originally laid out, or whether the public had acquired a way by prescription over a strip of land, about two and one half feet wide, lying between the easterly line of Main Street as laid out and the base line of the bank building standing on the petitioner\u2019s lot.</p>\n<p id=\"AMN\">A fundamental inquiry is whether the Land Court, in a proceeding of this kind, has a right to determine such a question. We have no doubt that it has this right. An application for the registration of a title is, by the terms of the statute, a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>which operates directly to vest and establish title to the land. R. L. c. 128, \u00a7 1. The statute contains elaborate provisions for the determination of rights claimed in the land, which shall be binding upon all the world. R. L. c. 128, \u00a7\u00a7 87, 38. It requires not only special notice to all persons known to be interested, but general notice \u201c to all whom it may concern.\u201d R. L. c. 128, \u00a7\u00a7 30, 31. The certificate is made conclusive as to all incumbrances, with certain exceptions mentioned in \u00a7 38. This itself implies that the court is to pass upon the validity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>incumbrances before issuing a certificate. There is a special provision for the determination of the boundaries of highways. <em>R. </em>L. c. 128, \u00a7\u00a7 31, 38, cl. 3. In this case the application contains a request to have the boundary of the way determined. The court, therefore, had jurisdiction of this part of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The right of travellers to use the way is a public easement, and the right by prescription, claimed in the narrow strip between the located line of the street and the base line of the building, is of the same kind. Ordinarily, rights of the general public are represented in court by the attorney general, and under this statute he may not only appear under the general description of parties in the notice \u201c to all whom it may concern,\u201d (see \u00a7 33) but he must be given special notice \u201c if the land borders on a river, navigable stream or shore, or on an ar.m of the sea where a river or harbor line has been established, or on a great pond, or if it otherwise appears from the application or the proceedings that the Commonwealth may have a claim adverse to that of the applicant.\u201d \u00a7 31. In like manner, if the applicant requests to have the line of a public way determined, notice must be given to the mayor of the city or to one of the selectmen of the town or towns in which the land lies, or if the way is a highway, to one of the county commissioners of the county or counties in which the land lies. \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In a case like the present the statute expressly recognizes the mayor of the city as the person to whom notice must be sent specially by registered letter. This notice is given him in his official capacity, as a representative of the city, and the provision is a statutory recognition of the rights of cities and towns to be heard upon questions affecting the boundaries of public ways. If a city must be given notice, and an opportunity to be heard, in such a case, it has a right of appeal to the Superior Court under \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">There are good reasons for giving cities and towns a right to to be heard when the boundaries of ways are to be determined. While they have no title to the land in public ways, by virtue of the laying out of the ways they have an interest in them and in the public easement which subjects the land to use for the construction and repair of the ways as well as for travel over them. They are bound by law to keep them safe and convenient for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>travellers. It is important that they should know the true boundaries of ways, whether they are laid out by the public authorities or acquired by prescription. The extent of a way is important as bearing upon the duty of the city or town to keep it in repair, and its liability to travellers who are injured while passing over it. R L. c. 51, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 17, 18. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Taunton, </em>126 Mass. 349. <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Harwich, </em>180 Mass. 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Whether the attorney general, as a representative of the public, had also a right to be heard, it is unnecessary to decide. In <em>McQuesten </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>187 Mass. 185, the attorney general represented public rights, and the town was also a party claiming municipal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">We are of opinion that the appeal was wrongly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
