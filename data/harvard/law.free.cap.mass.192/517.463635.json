Nay, wife of George M. Nay, of Boston, in the County of Suffolk, and George M. Nay, of said Boston, as her husband, of the first part, and the Boston &amp; Worcester Street Railway Company, a corporation duly organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, of the second part, hereby agree to submit the demands, a statement of which is contained in two declarations filed in said Superior Court for Suffolk County, copies of which are sent herewith, and all other demands between them, to the arbitration of Dr. Edward Reynolds of 65 Marlborough Street, Boston, and Dr. James R.

If the said Dr. Edward Reynolds and the said Dr. James R.

If either of the parties hereto neglects to appear before the arbitrators, after due notice given to them of the time and place appointed for hearing said parties, if said arbitrators consider hearings necessary, said arbitrators may proceed in the absence of the parties so neglecting to appear before them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-7\">\u201cThe liability of the Boston &amp; Worcester Street Railway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Company is admitted and the question of damages, if any, to be decided by the arbitrators hereunder, is based upon the following propositions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-3\">\u201c First: Taking into consideration the previous medical history and age of Lucy S. Nay, what injury, if any, did she suffer as a result of the accident at Chestnut Hill on October 22,1904. Counsel agree that as a matter of law, if injured, she is entitled to recover fair and reasonable compensation based on her suffering and the duration thereof, her incapacity as to her ordinary occupation resulting from said accident according to the length thereof, her permanent injury, if any, her loss of earnings if any. All the foregoing in so far only as the same are the result of said accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-4\">\u201c Second: All reasonable expenses in excess of usual and ordinary expenses made necessary by the accident of October 22, 1904.

Suffolk, ss. Boston, June 16,1905.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-10\">\u201c Then personally appeared the above named Frank N. Nay, attorney for the party of the first part, and Guy Murchie, attorney for the party of the second part, and severally acknowledged the above instrument by them signed to be the free act and deed of the several parties represented by them, before me,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-11\">\u201c Alton W. Eldredge, Notary Public.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-12\">On June 30,1905, the following award by the persons named as arbitrators was filed in court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-13\">\u201c Whereas, an agreement for arbitration made and executed between the above parties has been referred to us, and we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>examined said Lucy S. Nay, and have considered her claim and the claim of her husband, and have agreed without the need of calling in a third <em>physician;</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-3\">\u201c Now therefore, we as arbitrators find that the Boston &amp; Worcester Street Railway Company should pay said Lucy S. Nay and said George M. Nay jointly the sum of Fifteen Hundred Dollars ($1500) and an award of that amount is hereby made this 26th day of June, 1905, in accordance with the terms of said agreement for arbitration, to be reported to the Superior Court for the County of Suffolk, in accordance with the terms of said agreement for arbitration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-4\">\u201c James R. Chadwick, M. D., Edward Reynolds, Arbitrators.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-5\">After the award the plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the reference to the physicians of the question of damage on which they had made an award, and attached to the motion an affidavit of the plaintiff Lucy S. Nay. Subsequently affidavits of Dr. Edward Reynolds, Dr. James R. Chadwick and Frank N. Nay, counsel for the plaintiffs, were filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-6\">The motion was heard by <em>Lawton, </em>J. upon the affidavits filed in court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-7\">The defendant requested certain rulings, of which some were given and the others refused. The judge was asked, generally, to find and rule upon all the competent evidence presented that the motion of the plaintiffs should be denied, that the agreement of arbitration was valid and should not be dismissed, and that the award of the physicians was a valid and binding award. The judge refused so to rule', but allowed the motion of the plaintiffs, and made an order rejecting the award and dismissing the order of reference. The defendant appealed, and also alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-8\">The first, second and thirty-first rulings requested by the defendant which are mentioned in the opinion were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-9\">\u201c 1. The reference to arbitration in these cases is valid and in compliance with the terms of chapter 194 of the Revised Laws of Massachusetts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-10\"><em>\u201c </em>2. The award of the arbitrators is in form and substance in compliance with the terms of chapter 194 of the Revised Laws of Massachusetts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>\u201c 81. I rule that inasmuch as no hearings as contemplated by the statute, Revised Laws, chapter 194, were held, and the defendant had no notice of any examination of Mrs. Nay and was not present and had no part in the proceeding, and the proceeding yas devoid of any formality or attempt at formality, that the rule that \u2018all the arbitrators shall meet and hear the parties\u2019 does not apply.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-3\">The judge gave the rulings <em>I </em>numbered 1 and 2 and refused to give the ruling numbered 31.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b543-4\"><em>G. Murchie &amp; J. F. Bacon, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b543-5\"><em>E. N. Carpenter, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b543-6\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atmh\">The parties to these two actions at law might have submitted to arbitration the matters in dispute between them by a submission <em>in pais, </em>a submission under the statute, or by a rule of court made in each action. If the first method of procedure had been adopted, the only way of enforcing the award would have been by an action on the award when made. If the second had been adopted, it would have been an independent proceeding in court. The third method of procedure is the only method which <em>proprio vigore </em>would have ended the further prosecution of these two actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Had it not been for the first, second and thirty-first rulings asked for by the defendant, it might have been somewhat difficult to decide which method of submission to arbitration the parties in these actions intended to take. On the one hand the submission in the main is in the terms of a statutory submission under R. L. c. 194. On the other hand it was filed in the two actions and \u201c allowed \u201d by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">But the defendant is bound by its first, second and thirty-first requests for rulings, in which it in effect asked that the submission should be treated as a submission under the statute. As a statutory submission it is void. It departs from the form prescribed in R. L. c. 194, in providing in substance (first) that no hearings are to be had except in the discretion of the arbitrators, and (second) for the selection of \u201c some reputable physician \u201d as a referee if the two arbitrators named are unable to agree. These are matters of substance, and render the submission void as a submission under the statute. As to the second objection stated above see <em>Monosiet </em>v. <em>Post, </em>4 Mass. 532; <em>Frank</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>lin Mining Co. </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>101 Mass. 359. As to the general principle see <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Dexter, </em>6 Cush. <em>108; Bent </em>v. <em>Erie Telegraph &amp; Telephone Co. </em>144 Mass. 165. This rule was not overthrown by the recent decision in <em>Giles </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co. </em>179 Mass. 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Since the defendant elected to treat the submission to arbitration as a submission under R. L. c. 194, and as a submission under that statute it is void, there was no error in proceeding with the trial of these two actions in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">It is perhaps worth while to state in addition that the present award in any event was bad because it was a joint award on the submission of two several causes of action. See <em>Giles </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co. </em>179 Mass. 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The appeal is not properly before us, no final judgment having been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed ; exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
