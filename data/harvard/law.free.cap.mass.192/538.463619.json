Writ dated March 16,1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-8\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before Holmes, J. The plaintiff testified that he went to work for the defendant as a fireman about December 12,1902, and worked in the boiler shop at the fire doors firing until January 6, 1903; that he was employed by one Pearson who was called the general foreman; that one Dutton was the chief engineer of the plant; that Dutton had charge of all the boilers and engines that were there; that the plaintiff did not see him do anything in particular except looking over the plant, that is, the steam plant, boilers and engines, steam pipes; that Dutton gave the plaintiff orders and directions and also gave orders to the firemen that were working with him; that there were three firemen on the day shift and four on the night; that the plaintiff always obeyed Dutton\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>orders; that he never saw any other men refuse anything Dutton asked them to do; that he heard him give orders to the other men, tell them what to do; that the orders he gave to the other men were obeyed; and that he never saw Dutton discharge any one. The duties performed by Dutton are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-3\">The plaintiff\u2019s account of the happening of the accident was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-4\">\u201c On the 6th of January I was working at the fire doors in the boiler house about three o\u2019clock in the afternoon and Dutton came over and he says \u2014 \u2018 Go up the ladder and shut off that steam up there, that valve.\u2019 He also tapped me on the shoulder and he said \u25a0\u2014\u25a06 Go ahead Mac,\u2019 and I went and I got up. Mr. Dutton was standing right beside me at the front of the boiler. I went around to the ladder about eight or ten feet from where we were standing. I don\u2019t know how long the ladder had been there exactly. It might have been there a day or so. I am not sure just what time the ladder was put there. I saw it put there by Mr. Dutton. It was up against the side of the boilers and I went over to the ladder when I got the order and went up the same as I would any ladder. I went up \u2014 when I was just about getting off the ladder it went right from under me like that. When I made the move to the ladder he was facing toward the front of the boiler, just stood there in front of the boiler, you know, about eight or ten feet from the ladder. In the act of getting off the ladder the ladder slipped from under me and I came down. The ladder was long, I should say fourteen or fifteen feet long and probably more. I never measured the ladder and was never up on it before and never had any occasion to use it and when I made the move to get off the ladder, the ladder went right from under me and I did not know anything, I went so quick, until I was on my back on the floor. I never saw any one going up on the ladder before myself, I never saw any one use the ladder before myself, but I know the ladder was used, I know the ladder had been there for that purpose I suppose. I did n\u2019t think of making any examination of the ladder because I started to go up the ladder, as I thought as the ladder was put there it was all right. I did n\u2019t think there was anything at all the matter with the ladder. I went up the ladder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>just the same as I would now if I was going to do anything. I didn\u2019t think of making any examination at all of the ladder. I saw when I put my hand on the ladder it was standing there on the concrete floor and I went up, I didn\u2019t think there was anything more to it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-3\">Later the plaintiff testified \u201c Dutton placed the ladder the minute before I went on the ladder,\u201d and also testified \u201c Dutton came over from the ladder after placing the ladder that day, for me to go up on it, he came over to me and he told me to go up on the ladder then, and that is the time he gave me the order.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-4\">There was evidence that previously there had been a step ladder in the boiler room; and that about two days before the accident Dutton had taken the step ladder away and had brought the ladder in question into the boiler room; that this ladder was without any hooks or stays to hold it in place and had V shaped points of iron at the bottom or foot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-5\">One Haudel testified that about two days before the accident he told Dutton that he would not go up on that ladder again: that when he was ready to go down on the ladder it slid away from him ; and that Dutton only laughed at this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-6\">One Karklin testified that he was in the defendant\u2019s employ when the foregoing conversation occurred, and heard Haudel tell Dutton that \u201c the ladder wasn\u2019t safe, there was' danger there,\u201d and \u201c that he would not go up the ladder any more.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-7\">Dutton was called by the defendant and testified, on cross-examination, that he got this ladder in one of the defendant\u2019s shops; that he took it into the boiler room a few days before the accident and placed it against the brick wall for the use of the firemen ; that this was the only ladder in the boiler room at the time of the accident which could be used by a person to go up and turn off the steam and that when he ordered any one to go up and shut off the steam \u201c he would go on that ladder.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-8\">At the close of the evidence the judge ruled that on the evidence the plaintiff could not maintain his action on any count in his declaration, and ordered a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b563-9\"><em>C. Reno &amp; J. P. </em>Fagan, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b563-10\"><em>J. L. </em>Hall, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b563-11\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUtx\">We assume in favor of the plaintiff that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>ladder was a part of the ways, works and machinery of the boiler room, and also, though with much more doubt, that Dutton was a person whose sole or principal duty was that of superintendence. He had charge of the engines and as engineer had the direction and control of his assistants and of the firemen, of whom the plaintiff was one. He started and stopped the engines, saw to the cleaning of them and the filling of the oil cups and the packing of the engines and did other manual labor as required. He had no power to hire or discharge his assistants or the firemen, and it would seem that his position was that of a superior servant performing manual labor as required in the proper discharge of his duties, and exercising such direction and control over his assistants and the firemen as was necessary to secure efficient service on their part, rather than that of one whose sole or principal duty was that of superintendence. But, however that may be, we think that there was no evidence of a defect in the ladder or of negligence on the part of Dutton. The only thing in respect to which it is contended that the ladder was defective is the V shaped irons on the bottom. There is nothing to show that this was not a usual and proper mode of construction adopted to prevent the ladder from breaking and wearing, or that the ladder as thus made was unsafe in the hands of a person exercising ordinary care. The fact that the ladder slipped, and had done so once before, was as consistent, to say the least, with a want of due care on the part of the plaintiff and the other person using it, as with a defect in the construction. The V shaped irons would seem to have rendered the ladder more secure instead of less so, if the person using it exercised proper care. It cannot be said as matter of law that the defendant was bound to furnish a stationary ladder or one with hooks upon it, and that it could be found guilty of negligence for not doing so. It was not bound to furnish the best possible appliances but only to exercise reasonable care in seeing that those which it furnished were safe and proper for the use for which they were intended. We see no evidence of negligence on its part in the performance of this duty. See <em>Nealand v. Lynn &amp; Boston </em>Railroad, 173 Mass. 42; <em>Regan </em>v. Donovan, 159 Mass. 1; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Tileston &amp; Hollingsworth Co. </em>182 Mass. 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>As to Dutton, all that he did was to place the ladder against the boiler and tell the plaintiff to go up and shut off the steam. The position in which the ladder stood was perfectly obvious to the plaintiff and he was at liberty to change it if he saw fit to. Dutton\u2019s act in placing the ladder against the boiler cannot fairly be regarded as anything more than a slight act of assistance to the plaintiff in doing that which Dutton had directed him to do. It cannot properly be regarded as an act of superintendence, or as relieving the plaintiff from himself looking to the placing of the ladder before he attempted to ascend it. Nor can the direction \u201c Go up the ladder and shut off that steam up there, that valve \u201d and tapping him on the shoulder and saying \u201c Go ahead Mac\u201d be regarded as excusing the plaintiff from such attention to his own safety. <em>Gouin </em>v. <em>Wampanoag </em>Mills, 172 Mass. 222. <em>Ruchinsky </em>v. <em>French, </em>168 Mass. 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
