The mayor was not in his office and did not see the act and the vote until Monday, July 6. On July 14, the mayor returned the vote to the board of aldermen, in which it originated, with a message purporting to be a veto of the vote. A committee of the board of aldermen reported that \"this veto was not returned to the board within the time required by law\u201d and this report was accepted. <em>Held, </em>that the veto of the mayor was made in due season, the vote not having been presented to him until July 6.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-5\">Petition, filed August 26, 1903, under St. 1903, c. 392, for damages to the property of the plaintiff by reason of the removal of the railroad of the Old Colony Railroad Company operated by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company, in the abolition of the grade crossing at Dorchester Avenue in Boston under the provisions of St. 1897, c. 519.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-6\">The answer, after a general denial, alleged that the petitioner in June, 1899, brought a petition against the respondent for the same cause of action, that the case was heard before a jury and damages were awarded to the petitioner, and that the petitioner is not entitled to bring a new petition for the same cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-7\">In the Superior Court the case was heard by Lawton, J. The former petition, referred to in the answer, was filed in the Superior Court on June 12, 1899, to recover the value of the land of the petitioner taken in abolishing the grade crossing in question and also for damages to his remaining land caused by the removal of the railroad which was used by him in carrying on the business of a kindling wood manufacturer. That case, after being tried in the Superior Court, was reported to this court upon questions of law, and on February 26, 1902, by a decision reported in 180 Mass. 433, this court decided that the petitioner was entitled to no damages for the injury to his remaining land by the removal of the railroad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-8\">On May 27,1903, the Legislature passed St. 1903, c. 392, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-9\">\u201c Section 1. The city of Boston shall be liable to pay to any person owning land abutting on the line of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company, as the same was located prior to the abolition of the grade crossing on Dorchester avenue, and having railroad connection with such railroad, and whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>land, or any- part thereof, has been taken by said city for the purpose of constructing a highway, such damages to property as he has suffered by reason of the removal of the railroad and of the loss of his railroad connection therewith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-5\">\u201c Section 2.

The facts bearing upon this question are as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b40-14\">On Monday, June 29, 1903, the board of aldermen of the city of Boston voted to accept the act; and on July 2, 1903, the common council of that city voted that the act be accepted in concurrence. On Friday, July 3, being the next day, the vote of acceptance duly certified was taken by the assistant city clerk to the office of the mayor, and there delivered into the hands of a clerk in the office, who indorsed upon it \u201c Received July 3, 1903.\u201d The mayor was not then in his office, and did not see the act and vote until Monday, July 6, 1903.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-15\">On July 14, 1903, the mayor sent to the board of aldermen a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>communication purporting to be a veto of the vote. This communication was laid on the table in the board of aldermen, and on January 2, 1904, was taken from the table and referred to the committee on public improvements, which committee on the same day reported <em>\u201c </em>that in the opinion of the committee this veto was not returned to the board within the time required by law and recommending that no further action be taken.\u201d This report was accepted, and reconsideration refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The charter of the city of Boston, St. 1854, c. 448, in \u00a7 47, requires an ordinance, order, resolution or vote to be presented to the mayor, and provides that if an ordinance, order, resolution or vote \u201c shall not be returned by the mayor within ten days after it shall have been presented, the same shall be in. force.\u201d The case of the petitioner rests upon the assumption that the mayor did not send in his veto within ten days after the vote was presented to him, as required by the charter. This depends upon the meaning of the word \u201c presented.\u201d We are of opinion that leaving a vote with a clerk in the mayor\u2019s office in the absence of the mayor is not a presentation to him within the meaning of the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">This question arose in 1868, in regard to a similar provision in the Constitution of the Commonwealth, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 2, which reads as follows: <em>\u201c </em>And in order to prevent unnecessary delays, if any bill or resolve shall not be returned by the governor within five days after it shall have been presented, the same shall have the force of a law.\u201d The bill in that case was sent on February 10 to the secretary of the Commonwealth with whom all bills had been left for presentation to the Governor for twenty years before. The Governor was absent from the Commonwealth, and returned on February 14. On February 19 he returned the bill to the House of Representatives with his objections thereto. The House of Representatives requested the opinion of the justices of this court as to whether the bill was a law. The opinion of the justices was to the effect that the bill had not been presented to the Governor until his return. It was said: \u201c As the duty of revisal by the governor is a personal duty, with which he alone is intrusted when his chair is not vacant, it is necessary that the bill should be laid before him personally.\u201d <em>Opinion of the </em>Justices, 99 Mass. 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>We are of opinion that this reasoning is sound, and that it applies to the case before us. The veto of the mayor was made in due season, and the St. of 1903, c. 392, not having been accepted, the petition under the act is of no effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
