I came from Russia about six years ago, I had known Max Pearl-stein three or four years ago, Mr. Pearlstein was a junk man, I went around with him and did a little farming, he owned the horses and the tip cart, I remember November 26, 1904, Mr. Pearlstein was killed that day, we went in morning to Osterville to Mr. Crosby\u2019s to take a machine to West Barnstable for freight, we put it on the tip cart, then went to dinner and fed the horses, after dinner we went to West Barnstable with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>machine, went to the freight house, we took it to the platform, I turned the horses around and backed up to the platform, the freight man [Hiller] came and said, \u2018 That is the car for the machine,\u2019 and showed us the car in which to put the machine, Mr. Pearlstein said, 61 don\u2019t want to put it in the car; I want to put it on the platform,\u2019 the freight man said, \u2018 I want you to put the machine into the car.\u2019 He said, \u2018I want you to turn the horses around and back up to the car and put the machine into the car.\u2019 I said, \u2018No, I can\u2019t do it.\u2019 I said, \u2018The big piece of iron weighs eight or nine hundred, and is pretty heavy, and there is not enough men here \u2014just three men.\u2019 And he said, \u2018 I will get you some rope.\u2019 The machine was about two and a half feet wide and about five or six feet long, the platform was just like the tip cart, just the same height when the tailboard was let down, then I turned horses around and backed up to the car and blocked the wheels, Mr. freight man told me to bring that ladder [skids], I picked the ladder up and put it on the cart and put it in the car, after I brought the ladder the freight man put the ladder in the car, and he bring two rollers, Max was pushing the rollers under the machine, I asked the freight man \u2018Have you got any rope in here?\u2019and he said, \u2018No, I no got any rope \u2019; and he went and got a rope and he tied up the machine with a rope \u2014 the freight man tied the rope in the car, around a rod next to the opposite door of the car, I did not see the place where it was tied ; but I saw it was tied and the freight man tied it, I didn\u2019t see anybody else in the car, I didn\u2019t look, the freight man jumped from the car to see about his ladder and called the fellow who was all the time helping about jobs [Cook], told him to jump in the car and gave him this rope and said, \u2018 You keep this,\u2019 when we started to move the machine he said to him, \u2018 You hold the rope and pull.\u2019 The man that the freight man called I had seen before, taking barrels of cranberries and lifting them into the car, working for the railroad, came from another car. The freight man called him to help move the machine into the car. ' The floor of the car was about two feet higher than tip cart, about ten feet from car to tip cart, we started moving machine from tip cart on to the ladder, fellow in car holding rope, we had got it about half way up the ladder, about same distance from car and from cart, I said to him [freight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>man] \u2018 we cannot push the machine; it is too high and there is not enough men \u2019 and he said \u2018 push it.\u2019 But he told this fellow to stay in the car and keep the rope and pull, and we pushing the machine, and this fellow stayed in the car and pulled the rope, and started to jump, and dance and whistle, and stopped pulling the machine. And I said \u2018 John, you keep the rope good. Do not play with the rope because the machine will fall down.\u2019 Well for three or four minutes the machine went, and then it fell down, and fell on this shoulder, and scraped my head, and I fell with the machine, and moved it four or five inches before it fell down. After I said stop, John\u2019 I started moving the machine and the next thing that happened, the machine fell and I with it. Pearlstein was standing at my back, the freight man and Crocker on the other side of ladder. Crocker came from Parker\u2019s store and was helping the freight man. I could not do anything for five or six weeks. I sat down for five or six minutes, it was dark to me, after the accident I saw Mr. Pearlstein at the machine, it was killing his head, he was taken into a store and in forty minutes was dead. The skid was about a foot and a half wide, the machine was a little wider than the skid. Pearlstein said, \u2018 Tony, I can\u2019t get up. I have a broken leg.\u2019 He lived about forty minutes. I was struck by the machine and it made a scar on my head.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-3\">His cross-examination was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-4\">\u201cWe had two horses, we drove into the grounds near the station and near Parker\u2019s store, I did not know station agent or baggage master, nor assistant baggage master, saw a man on platform, Pearlstein said \u2018 Where shall we put this machine ? \u2019 the man asked \u2018 Where is it going ? \u2019 Pearlstein said \u2018 It is going to Boston,\u2019 the man said \u2018It goes in that car right over there,\u2019 the cart was just about at the platform, and the freight man pointed at the car, the land was perfectly level, I or Pearlstein drove the horses over near the car and backed the cart up against the door of the car, at this time another railroad man was in another car arranging cranberries.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYi\">These actions were brought to recover damages caused by the falling of a heavy iron machine while it was being moved from the rear end of a two horse cart into a freight car at the defendant\u2019s railroad station. The intestate of the plaintiff in the first two actions' survived less than an hour after the accident, and died from the effects of it. The plaintiff in the third action was injured, but not very seriously. There was much contradiction between the testimony of the plaintiff Yelkin and that of most of the other witnesses in regard to some of the circumstances preceding and attending the accident. From his testimony the jury might have found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>that one Cook, who was employed by the defendant in unloading freight at the station, was negligent in starting to jump, dance, and whistle and jerk the rope, while standing in the car holding a rope hitched to the machine with which he was expected to steady the machine and help to keep it in position. Although this testimony was contradicted by the other witnesses, the jury might have believed it, and have found that Cook\u2019s negligence was one of the causes of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\">This was enough to entitle the plaintiffs to go to the jury in the actions at common law, if there was evidence that Yelkin and the deceased Pearlstein were in the exercise of due care. They were engaged in the performance of their duty, as they understood it, and it cannot be held as matter of law that they were negligent, nor does it appear that they assumed the risk of such an accident. They were not in any relations of contract with the defendant, whereby the defendant was relieved from the duty of seeing that its servants exercised proper care in the work in which they were engaged, and it cannot be said as matter of law that they understood, appreciated and assumed the risk, especially the risk of Cook\u2019s negligence, if he was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">It is not necessary to decide whether the jury would have been warranted in finding that Hiller, the freight agent, was negligent in choosing the place in which the machine should be delivered by Pearlstein, and accepted by the defendant, and in directing the manner of its delivery and acceptance. We think the evidence tends to show that these matters were determined by Hiller, and that Pearlstein and Yelkin were acting, in part at least, under his direction in trying to load the machine upon a freight car directly from the cart in which it was brought to the station. If it had been unloaded from the cart upon the platform the accident would have been less likely to happen. As there was evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant\u2019s servant Cook, this subject becomes unimportant in the two actions at common law, in which the exceptions must be overruled without reference to Hiller\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The action brought to recover for the death of Pearlstein stands on different grounds. To recover in this the plaintiff was bound to show negligence on the part of the corporation itself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>or unfitness or gross negligence on the part of its servants. There was no evidence to sustain the averment that the corporation was negligent in failing to provide suitable apparatus and appliances for loading its freight, nor was there any evidence to show the unfitness of the defendant\u2019s servants for the work in which they were engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\">We come, therefore, to the question whether there was evidence of gross negligence on the part of these servants. If the jury might have found that Hiller was negligent in attempting to receive the machine for the company upon the car, to which it was to be transferred from the cart by rolling it over the skids,called by some of the witnesses a ladder, there is no evidence that his negligence was greater than a mere want of ordinary care. The jury would not have been warranted in finding gross negligence on his part. There was no evidence of other negligence on the part of any of the defendant\u2019s servants, except that of Cook, to which we have referred. The plaintiff Yelkin was the only witness who testified to this, and, if we give full effect to all he said, Cook stopped his objectionable conduct before the accident, when Yelkin said \u201c Stop, John \u201d, and did not repeat it. The evidence of this plaintiff, as well as that of the other witnesses, tends to show that Cook held the rope all the time, and was pulling upon it at the time of the accident. The testimony goes no further than to show that probably he did not pull upon it so effectively as he might have done. While the jury might have found that failure on his part to do his work to the best of his ability was one of the causes of the accident, we think they would not have been warranted in finding that he was guilty of gross negligence which caused the machine to fall. The difference in degree between ordinary negligence and gross negligence, recognized or created by the statute, is material, and cannot be ignored in the trial of cases. R. L. c. 111, \u00a7 267; c. 171, \u00a7 2. <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>187 Mass. 376, 378. In the action founded on the death of Pearlstein there was no evidence to warrant a submission of the case to the jury, and the result is that in this action the exceptions are sustained. In the other two actions they are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
