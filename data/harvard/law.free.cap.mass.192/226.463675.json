His preliminary report referred to in the beginning of the opinion was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-18\">\u201c This is an action upon a building contract for the erection of a dwelling-house for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-20\">\u201c One of the main issues involved is, whether or not the said dwelling-house was constructed of proper materials and in a workmanlike manner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-23\">\u201c The plaintiffs request a view of the premises and at the present time.

The motions were denied by <em>Fessenden, </em>J., and the defendant appealed. These motions were made and denied on November 14,1905. On November 20, the defendant was defaulted. The judge found for the plaintiffs in the sum of $5,667.41 and judgment was entered for $5,695.75 damages and costs. The defendant appealed. On January 30, 1906, the plaintiffs moved to dismiss the appeal for want of prosecution. The motion was allowed unless the papers were printed and entered in the clerk\u2019s office of \u201e this court on or before February 10, which was done.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-5\"><em>W.

Generally cases are to be heard and determined upon the evidence submitted in open court. But where the judge is of opinion that a view will tend to a better understanding and more satisfactory disposition of the case he may in his discretion authorize one to be taken. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chance, </em>174 Mass. <em>245; Tully </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Railroad, </em>134 Mass. 499, 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">The case was entered in June, 1900, and the plaintiffs duly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>filed a claim for a trial by jury. An auditor was appointed and his report was filed on September 30,1905. On October 4, the plaintiffs filed a waiver of a jury trial. On November 14, apparently just as the case was about to be reached for trial, the defendant filed the two motions referred to above. The grounds on which the judge overruled them do not appear, and nothing is before us except what the record discloses. It is possible that the judge may have been of the opinion that the only satisfactory explanation of the defendant\u2019s conduct in not claiming a jury trial when the action was entered, and in delaying from October 4 to November 14 to file her motions was that she had no in tentian of claiming a jury trial originally, and that her purpose was to delay and obstruct the plaintiffs in the prosecution of their claim. If so, the judge was justified in the exercise of his discretian in denying the motions, and the question which the defendant seeks to raise as to the effect of a withdrawal by the party making it of a claim t\u00f3 a jury trial on which the other party has relied does not arise. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>173 Mass. 382. Further it is to be noted that the defendant was defaulted and the case was heard by the judge only on the question of the -assessment of the damages. If the defendant had wished to have 4he damages assessed by a jury it was necessary to make a motian specifically addressed to the assessment of damages after the default. <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Silberstein, </em>182 Mass. 20. Not having done so, she has no just ground of complaint at having her motions denied.</p>\n<p id=\"AYE\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
