By this instrument the plaintiff agreed to sell the defendant on or before February 10 of that year $700,000 of the bonds in question on being paid a price named, and agreed \u201c in case this option is accepted \u201d to endeavor to procure $50,000 more of the same bonds for delivery at the same price. The agreement recited that in addition to the $750,000 of the bonds mentioned above there were $59,000 of the bonds pledged for the debts of the corporation that issued them, and the plaintiff agreed \u201cin case this option is accepted\u201d to sell to the defendant these bonds also at the same price. There also were other outstanding bonds which the plaintiff agreed to help the defendant to procure \u201cin case this option is accepted\u201d and the plaintiff also agreed \u201cin case this option is taken up\u201d to sell to the defendant certain shares of the corporation which issued the bonds at certain prices named. After these provisions came the following: \u201cIt is also hereby expressly understood that\u201d the defendant \u201cis to purchase upon accepting this option $20,000 of said bonds out of said above mentioned lot of $59,000 \u201d at the price named, the \u201c proceeds of said sale to be applied to the payment of certain debts of\u201d the corporation. There was another agreement made between the plaintiff and the defendant of the same date as the agreement of option relating to the coupons of the bonds named in that agreement which among other things made a provision for the coupons of the lot of $59,000 of the bonds which was conditional on the exercise of the option by the defendant. Shortly after January 1 and before February 10 the defendant paid to the plaintiff at his request $100 to be applied toward one of the debts of the corporation in question. The defendant allowed the time to expire without exercising his option and refused to buy any of the bonds. The plaintiff contended that the defendant had agreed in any case to buy $20,000 of the bonds upon accepting the instrument of option. <em>Held, </em>that the words \u201c upon accepting this option \u201d in the clause relating to the $20,000 of bonds meant the exercise by the defendant of the option to purchase $700,000 of the bonds and not the acceptance of the agreement of option, having the same meaning as the corresponding words in the other parts of the agreement, that the payment of $100 by the defendant at the plaintiff\u2019s request as a part of the purchase money for the bonds was not an exercise of the option and did not bind the defendant to purchase the bonds, that the conduct of the parties in doing nothing about the $20,000 of bonds when the agreement of option was delivered tended to support the construction of the contract adopted by the court, and that the bill should he dismissed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Bill ih EQUITY, filed March 12,1903, and amended June 6, 1904, and June 26, 1905, to enforce specifically an agreement in writing annexed to the bill as Exhibits A. and B. and printed below by compelling the defendant to purchase from the plaintiff $20,000 of the bonds of the Rio Grande Irrigation and Colonization Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-5\">The defendant demurred to the bill before its amendment alleging as causes of demurrer want of equity and that there was no memorandum in writing of the contract signed by the party to be charged as required by R. L. c. 74, \u00a7 5. The case was heard by <em>Fessenden, </em>J., who sustained the demurrer. The plaintiff appealed, and afterwards was allowed to amend his bill by adding the following paragraph:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-6\">\u201c That afterwards, shortly after January 1, 1903, and before February 10, 1903, the defendant acknowledged his obligation under said agreements or options by paying to the said Martyn or at his request the sum of $100 to be applied towards one of the certain debts of the said Rio Grande Company mentioned in said agreements or options; that the plaintiff has ever been ready and willing to sell, transfer and deliver said bonds mentioned in said seventh paragraph to the defendant upon his paying the balance of the purchase price thereof, and has been ready to apply the proceeds to the payment of said certain debts of the Rio Grande Irrigation and Colonization Company but the defendant, though often requested so to do and though a reasonable time thereafter has already elapsed, has not completed said purchase by taking said bonds and paying for the same, and still refuses to take said bonds and pay the balance of the purchase price thereof as agreed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-7\">The defendant demurred to the bill as amended alleging the same causes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-8\">The case was heard by <em>Richardson, </em>J., who sustained the demurrer. Thereafter the plaintiff was allowed further to amend his bill by adding after the \u201c $100 \u201d in the paragraph above quoted the words \u201c as a part of said purchase price of the $20,000 of bonds mentioned in clause seventh of Exhibit A. said $100.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-9\">It was agreed by the parties that the defendant\u2019s last demurrer should apply to the bill as finally amended. <em>Richardson, </em>J. made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>an order overruling the demurrer to the bill as finally amended, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\">The judge, being of the opinion that the questions raised by the demurrer so affected the merits of the controversy that the matter ought, before further proceedings, to be determined by this court, at the request of the parties reported the ease for such determination. If the demurrer to the bill as finally amended was rightly overruled the defendant was either to plead or answer; otherwise, the bill was to be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-6\">Exhibits A. and B. containing the alleged contract sought to be enforced were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-7\">\u201c Exhibit A.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-8\">\u201c I, James E.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMe\">The rights of the parties in this case depend upon the meaning of the contract contained in the two papers signed by the plaintiff and delivered to the defendant, bearing date January 1, 1903. The second of these papers relates to coupons annexed to bonds referred to in the first paper, and it was to have effect only upon condition that the defendant exercised the option to buy bonds given him in the first paper. It is therefore of but little consequence as an aid in the construction of the first contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The contract contained in the first paper is the giving of an option by the plaintiff to the defendant, to remain open through February 10, 1903, which option was \u201cthe right to purchase \u201d, from the plaintiff as trustee, certain bonds to the amount of $700,000; face value, at the price of seventy per cent of their par value, with accrued interest after the date of the contract. In the first clause of the contract the plaintiff also agrees \u201c that in case this option is accepted by said Hitchings, as hereinafter provided,\u201d he will endeavor to procure the sale and delivery of $50,000 more of the same kind of bonds, or such part thereof as he can obtain control of, at the same price. In the second clause, \u201cin case this option is taken up as hereinafter provided,\u201d he makes an agreement to sell at a certain price stock of the company that issued the bonds. In the third clause there is an agreement of the plaintiff to sell certain other bonds of the same kind, at the same price, \u201c in case this option is accepted by said Hitchings, as hereinafter provided.\u201d Plainly, the option referred to in each of these clauses is the right to buy the bonds to the amount of $700,000, face value, referred to in the first clause, and \u201caccepted ... as hereinafter provided!\u2019 means accepted within the time that the option is to remain open under the ninth clause, which is through February 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The fourth clause contains an agreement of the plaintiff to use all reasonable effort to help the defendant get $187,000 more of the same bonds then outstanding in the hands of various parties, and this agreement is only \u201c in case this option is accepted by said Hitchings.\u201d The option referred to here is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The fifth and sixth clauses give the defendant the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>buy certain treasury bonds of the same kind, with certain treasury stock, at prices stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The seventh clause, upon which the plaintiff founds his suit, is as follows: \u201c It is also expressly understood that said Hatchings is to purchase upon accepting this option $20,000 of said bonds out of said above mentioned lot of $59,000 the purchase price to be seventy per cent of the face value thereof, proceeds of said sale to be applied to the payment of certain debts of said Rio Grande Company.\u201d The lot of $59,000 is the one referred to in the third clause of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The contention of the plaintiff is that the words \u201c upon accepting this option \u201d, in the seventh clause, mean upon the delivery and acceptance of the writing, which purports to give an option to be exercised on or before February 10. He contends that the obligation of the defendant to purchase bonds to the amount of $20,000 became absolute immediately on the delivery and acceptance of the paper. He thus gives the words \u201c this option \u201d, in this clause, a meaning different from their obvious meaning in every other part of the contract. The bill as originally drawn was plainly founded on this construction of the contract, and the two amendments do not change it in this particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The defendant, on the other hand, contends that accepting this option, in the seventh clause, means the same thing as the similar language in the first, second, third and fourth clauses of the contract, namely, the election to purchase $700,000 of bonds, upon which everything else is made to depend. The third clause, in which the words are plainly used in that sense, refers to the sale of the same lot of bonds which are to be purchased under the seventh clause if the option is accepted. In the ninth clause the word \u201coption\u201d has the same meaning. Looking for a moment at the second writing, the plaintiff\u2019s agreement in reference to the coupons upon this lot of $59,000 is made conditional upon the purchase of the bonds by the defendant. This is inconsistent with the existence of a contract of purchase which was absolute the moment that the writing was delivered and accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">While the case is not free from difficulty, we are of opinion that the construction contended for by the plaintiff is not correct. It seems a strained and unnatural view to hold that the words \u201c this option \u201d, in the seventh clause, mean a paper writing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>while in every other part of the instrument they mean the right to purchase certain specified property within a stated time at a stated price.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The averments in the amendments to the bill have little bearing upon this point. They are intended to relieve from the defence of the statute of frauds, and to show how the parties interpreted the contract. In the view that we take of the. case the statute of frauds becomes immaterial. A payment of $100 by the defendant to the plaintiff, or at his request, as a part of the purchase price of the bonds referred to in the seventh clause, made at some tyne after January 1,1903, and before February 10, 1903, does not bind the defendant to purchase these bonds, if he elected not to accept the option. This is conceded by the plaintiff upon the interpretation which we give to the word \u201coption.\u201d The plaintiff relies upon the averment as showing the defendant\u2019s construction of the contract; but if the contract means what the plaintiff contends that it means, the defendant should have taken and paid for bonds to the amount of $20,000 on the delivery of the paper. The conduct of the parties, taken as a whole, tends to support the defendant\u2019s rather, than the plaintiff\u2019s construction of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
