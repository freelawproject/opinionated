At the time of the testator\u2019s death, the family, besides the petitioner and her father, consisted of the petitioner\u2019s husband, her two young children, and her youngest brother, named Robert, who was a boy sixteen years of age. The testator had three older sons who were grown men, having families of their own, and lived elsewhere in North Adams, and one other daughter, a married woman, who also lived in North Adams.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>The testator died on October 7, 1897, and his will was proved and allowed. His wife had died before him. The executor named in the will declined to serve, and Yalmore A. Whitaker of North Adams was appointed administrator with the will annexed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-5\">After the death of her father the petitioner paid the expenses of his last sickness, his burial expenses, expenses in connection with the burial lot and other debts of the deceased. The administrator refused to repay her, and she brought an action against the estate in the Superior Court. The case was referred to an auditor who reported that there was due to her the sum of I960. The case in the Superior.Court is still pending, awaiting funds in the hands of the administrator with which to pay the amount found due. The administrator, representing that he had not sufficient personal estate in his hands with which to satisfy the petitioner\u2019s claim, petitioned the Probate Court for leave to sell \u201c Home Place \u201d to raise such funds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-6\">The petitioner then filed the present petition to marshal the .assets, and action on the petition to sell real estate was stayed \u25a0by injunction until it should be determined by the decision in :the present proceeding what estate should be applied to make :such payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-7\">So far as appeared the testator had sold and disposed of none of his real estate between the time that he made his will and the date of his death, and had bought none.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-8\">The petitioner contended that the devise to her and her brother Robert under the first clause of the will was specific; that the devise under the third clause of the will was general and residuary; that the real estate devised under the third clause must be exhausted before any portion of the real estate devised under the first clause of the will could be taken for the payment of the debts of the testator; and that the decree of the Probate Court should be affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-9\">The respondent contended that all the devises in the will were specific, and that all should contribute in proportion to their fair market value to the payment of the debts of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-10\">With the consent of the parties the justice reported the case for determination by the full court, such decree to be entered as law and justice might require.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>H. C. </em>Joyner, for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b621-5\"><em>C. J. Parkhurst, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b621-6\">Knowlton, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Asp\">The questions of law presented on this record are very simple. No doubt is suggested as to the jurisdiction of the court to entertain a petition of this kind and make a decree which shall marshal the assets for the proper settlement of the estate. B. L. c. 162, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, 5. <em>Lee, appellant, </em>18 Pick. 285, 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">There is no dispute that the devise of real estate to the petitioner and her brother, in the first clause of the will, is specific. It is equally clear and undisputed that specific devises and legacies are not to be taken for the payment of a testator\u2019s debts until the general legacies and devises are exhausted. B. L. c. 135, \u00a7\u00a7 26, 27. <em>Blaney </em>v. <em>Blaney, </em>1 Cush. 107,115. <em>Farnum </em>v. <em>Bascom, </em>122 Mass. 282, 286. The only contention of the appellants as a ground for reversing the decree of the Probate Court is that the devise of real estate to them, in the third clause of the will, is also specific. The language of this clause is as follows : \u201c To my three sons, Jeremiah M. Broderick, James Broderick and P. H. Broderick, all the remainder of my real estate, to be divided equally between them, in three equal shares.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">The English rule that all devises of real estate are to be regarded as specific is not in force in this State. <em>Blaney </em>v. Blaney, <em>1 </em>Cush. 107, 116. <em>Farnum </em>v. <em>Bascom, </em>122 Mass. 282, 286. Under the R. L. c. 135, \u00a7 23, land acquired by a testator after the making of his will may pass by the will, as well as that owned by him at the time of making it. The devise in question in this case included all the real estate that the testator might own at the time of his death, except that specifically devised in the preceding clauses of the will. The clause contains no reference to any particular land. We think it plain that the devise is general, and not specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">It follows that the land covered by it is to be applied to the payment of debts before resort is had to the real estate specifically devised, and that the decree of the Probate Court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
