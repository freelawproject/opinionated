Later the defendant leased the property to the tenant from whom the plaintiff testified that he procured the offer on terms which the plaintiff contended were in substance those procured by him. The presiding justice refused to instruct the jury that the plaintiff\u2019s authority to procure a tenant for the defendant\u2019s property was terminated or revoked at this interview between the plaintiff and the defendant before the lease was made. <em>Held, </em>that, apart from the question whether the revocation of authority was in good faith, the instruction that there .was a revocation in fact should have been given.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b255-12\">The effect of a verdict for a defendant on a special count, ordered by the presiding justice at a previous trial, on the right of the plaintiff at a new trial to go to the jury on a count on an account annexed involving directly or indirectly the same issues was here referred to by Losing, J. although not passed upon by the court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A6I\">Discussion by Losing, J. of the question at what point negotiations conducted by a real estate broker employed by a landowner have progressed so far that a revocation of the broker\u2019s authority would be in fraud of his rights.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b255-13\">A concession made by a counsel in his client\u2019s presence in conducting an argument before the full court in answer to a question of one of the justices as to his contention is regarded as made for the purposes of that hearing and cannot be introduced in evidence at a new trial of the case as an admission in behalf of his client.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Contract to recover a commission for services as a real estate broker.

The first and second counts were stricken out with the consent of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. The justice ordered a verdict for the defendant on the fifth and sixth counts, and submitted the case to the jury on the third and fourth counts, but gave instructions which were in effect a ruling that the plaintiff had not made out the case set forth in his third count. The third count was to recover a commission of $2,750 for procuring a tenant for the Hotel Reynolds in Boston belonging to the defendant at an agreed rental, the defendant having refused to carry out her agreement. The fourth count was upon an account annexed for the same amount of money as a commission on a lease of the property with interest from January 1, 1898. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $2,847.38. Exceptions alleged by the defendant were sustained by this court in a decision reported in 179 Mass. 474.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-7\">There was a second trial before <em>Boring, </em>J.

Exceptions alleged by the defendant were sustained by this court in a decision reported in 186 Mass. 7, on the ground that upon all the evidence, as presented at that trial, the jury were not warranted in returning a verdict for the plaintiff on the fourth count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-11\">There was a third trial before <em>Knowlton, </em>C.

Before this trial the plaintiff amended his declaration by adding a seventh count, which was on an account annexed for $2,750, and was exactly like the fourth count as it then stood, except that interest was claimed from March 16,1899, instead of from Januarv 1, 1898.

The plaintiff cannot recover in this action except upon the ground that he was the procuring or predominating efficient cause of the lease given by the defendant to Gould and Polio; that he was the active and efficient cause of securing the letting of the Hotel Reynolds to Gould and Polio, that his work was the efficient cause of the making of the Gould and Polio lease.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AsDK\">The justice gave this ruling.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqB\">\u201c Eighth.

The terms of the Mann lease are not, for the purposes of this case, substantially the same as the terms of the lease with Gould and Pollo. I do not consider that it is of crucial importance in this case, because I have said to you that the principal question is, take the Gould and Polio lease as it was made, has the plaintiff satisfied you by a fair preponderance of the evidence that he was the efficient, predominating cause of the making of that lease as it is.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-13\">\u201cEleventh.

But whichever of the two stories was believed, the plaintiff\u2019s authority to get a tenant for the property was revoked in fact at that time (if it had not been re-yoked before by the defendant\u2019s instructions as to the taking down of the plaintiff\u2019s sign), and the jury should have been so instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s story is that on or about December 24, 1898, Gould and Polio made a definite offer to take \u201ea lease on the terms of the Mann lease, which he, the plaintiff, reported to the defendant\u2019s agent Gilman ; that Gilman said he could get no answer from the defendant and added: \u201c She is at the Adams House, why don\u2019t you go up to see her ? \u201d that he did go up on January 2, and that at that interview the defendant said \u201c she would not do anything about it just then; that she was going away, but that she would like to sell the property, and would sell it for $1,100,000, \u2018And you see if you can get me a customer.\u2019 I said, \u2018 If you change your mind about renting it, let me know \u2019; she said she would.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-19\">The defendant denied that any such offer from Gould and Polio was ever communicated to her, and testified that on December 29 she wrote to Gilman to \u201c take the sign down,\u201d as she had made up her mind to sell the property if it took a year or even more than a year to do it; and that on January 2, she saw the plaintiff near the elevator and \u201c told him at once I would do nothing whatever with my property; that my mother and myself were disgusted with the whole business; that we were tired out and were going off to rest in Hew York.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-28\">The refusal to give these rulings cannot be supported on the ground that a revocation of authority in fraud of the plaintiff\u2019s rights is not in law a revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-31\">This is not the accurate meaning of these two requests for rulings, and it is plain that they were not understood at the trial to have that meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-34\">It is plain that the defendant did not so understand them. The only difference between the requests marked 8 and 9 on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>one hand and the request marked 10 on the other hand is that in. the request marked 10 the defendant asked for a ruling in case the defendant was not acting in good faith when she revoked the plaintiff\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The presiding justice evidently did not so understand these requests. He told the jury that they could find for the plaintiff if they found that the plaintiff had not in fact been discharged, or if they found that he had been discharged in fact, but that that discharge was made in bad faith. His exact words were: The plaintiff says in the first place that he was the efficient, predominating cause of the making of that lease. He also says that he was in the employment of the defendant as broker up to the time when that lease was made. He further says that if you find that he had been discharged from his employment as broker by her before that lease was made, that the discharge was made in bad faith, and that he has a right, although so discharged, \u2014 a right to be in a position of being employed by her up to that time. You can take up those questions in any order you see fit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5z\">\u2022 And finally, it is manifest that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel did not so understand them, at least when they made their brief in the case now before us. On the first page of their brief the plaintiff\u2019s counsel say: \u201c The plaintiff contended that he was the efficient, predominating cause of the lease, that either the defendant had not terminated his employment before the agreement for the lease was really made or if the plaintiff\u2019s employment had before then been terminated by the defendant, such termination was by the bad faith of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYv\">Under the instructions given to them, the jury may have found for the plaintiff on the ground that, independently of the question of bad faith, the plaintiff\u2019s authority to get a tenant for the hotel was not revoked before the lease made to Gould and Polio in March, 1899.</p>\n<p id=\"A_IV\">As the exceptions to the refusal to give the rulings marked 8 and 9 asked for by the defendant must be sustained, it is not necessary to consider a question which arises in connection with the exceptions to the refusal to the rulings marked Eleventh, 13, 14, 22 and 23. The question is whether (so long as the verdicts stand which were ordered for the defendant on the third count at the second trial and on the fourth count at the fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>trial) the following issue of fact (so far as this case is concerned) is not concluded against the plaintiff, namely: \u201c That Gould and Polio did not offer before January 2,1899, to take a lease on the terms stated in the lease to Mann.\u201d It is manifest that the question whether the revocation of the plaintiff\u2019s authority on January 2, 1899, was made in bad faith depends upon how far negotiations by the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant had then progressed, if such negotiations with them had then been carried on by the defendant\u2019s request (express or implied) after the Mann lease fell through.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Neither is it essential to consider whether it was necessary for the plaintiff to show that he was the efficient cause of the lease to Gould and Polio made in March, in addition to showing that the plaintiff\u2019s negotiations with them had progressed so far on the date when the defendant revoked the plaintiff\u2019s authority as to make that revocation a fraud on the plaintiff. It perhaps might be assumed that a broker\u2019s authority is revoked in bad faith where negotiations had been carried on by a broker for his principal and had progressed so far at the time when the broker\u2019s authority was revoked that he was found to be the effieient cause in fact of a trade subsequently struck between the principal and the customer. In such a case it would seem that the finding that the broker was the efficient cause of the trade made includes a finding that the revocation was in fraud of his rights. But it does not follow that a revocation of authority may not be in fraud of the broker\u2019s rights when it could not be found that his acts before the revocation were the efficient cause of the subsequent trade. It seems to have been assumed at the trial that the plaintiff had to make out in proof two propositians, first, that he was the efficient cause of the contract subsequently made, and second, that the revocation of his authority was in fraud of the broker\u2019s rights. But, as we have said, it is not necessary to consider those questions now.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-33\">The question of efficient cause is ordinarily at least a question of fact for the jury where no exclusive agency has been given and where two brokers have worked on the case, as in <em>Crowninshield </em>v. Foster, 169 Mass. 237. It is in that class of cases that ordinarily at least the substantial identity of the offer not accepted and the trade made is material.</p>\n<p id=\"ASx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>There is one question of evidence which may arise again. The defendant\u2019s counsel asked the plaintiff on- cross-examination whether at the argument before the full court in <em>Cadigan </em>v. <em>Crabtree, </em>186 Mass. 7, the Chief Justice did not ask the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his (the plaintiff\u2019s) presence, \u201cif he contended that Miss Crabtree was acting in bad faith when she said what she testified to in January, 1899.\u201d This was excluded on the ground that the question asked by the Chief Justice was asked as to the contention of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel for the purpose of that hearing, and that if the plaintiff\u2019s counsel answered that question in the negative it did not preclude the plaintiff from contending at the trial in question that there was in fact bad faith on the defendant\u2019s part in revoking the plaintiff\u2019s authority. We are of opinion that the ruling was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
