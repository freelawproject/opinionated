Snider leased for a term of ten years a certain lot with the building thereon in Lafayette, Indiana, to be occupied by the United States as a post office ; that the building was so occupied until December, 1869, when it was destroyed by fire; that James Montgomery, previous to the fire, became the owner of the property, and entitled to the benefit of the lease; that on the 1st day of May, 1870, Montgomery made a lease, in form to the United States represented by the Postmaster General, for the term of twenty years and at an annual rental of $1500, payable in equal quarterly instalments, of certain parts of a building which he covenanted to erect upon the same lot. He also covenanted to supply and keep in repair to the satisfaction of the Postmaster General all boxes and fixtures necessary for a post office in that building.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-5\">Montgomery erected the required building and the United States took possession of it.

Harris </em>filed the brief for same,) said, on the merits:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-6\">The Postmaster General had, by virtue of his power \u201c to establish post offices,\u201d full power to rent, or lease, in short all the power of Congress which had not been taken from him by some negative act of Congress; and the power to lease, while it has been treated as a power \u201c necessarily implied \u201d from the power \u201cto establish,\u201d is something more. It is more correct to call it an \u201c included \u201d power than an \u201c implied\u201d power; but whatever be its correct name, it was a power which reposed in the Postmaster General\u2019s hands at the time he made the lease sued-on ; so it was \u201c authorized by law \u201d within section 3732 of the Kevised Statutes. <em>Ware </em>v. <em>United States, </em>4 Wall. 617.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-7\">When it is admitted that the Postmaster General has power to make a lease, it follows that, in the absence of a statute limiting the length of time leases may run, he has plenary po-wer (unless acting in bad faith) to make leases; for, if a court should assume to inquire into the necessity of the lease, <em>i.e. </em>-whether a lease of one, two, five or twenty years was longer than necessary to the proper conduct of the post office in a given- place, that would be <em>ipso facto </em>to deny the power, and moreover it would seem impossible to find any basis for the decision of such a question. See <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>4 Wheat. 316, 423; <em>Jacksonville, Pensacola &amp;c. Railroad </em>v. <em>United States, </em>118 U. S. 626; <em>Garfielde </em>v. <em>United States, </em>93 U. S. 246; <em>Ex parte Jackson, </em>96 U.

Owing to unfamiliarity of many District Attorneys. and Federal judges with the Court of Claims practice, and the inaccessibility of reports of the decisions of that court, the methods adopted in bringing up judgments and records for review and the rulings of the courts thereon vary widely and are' extremely confusing. In many cases the right of litigants to review such judgments is jeopardized, and, indeed, entirely defeated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-5\">In one Circuit Court of Appeals, appeals, are dismissed because no bill of exceptions is settled bringing into the record the various objections and exceptions saved in the course of the trial. In others, both attorneys and court apparently deem it essential that the evidence taken on the trial be embodied in the record. In very many the importance and significance of the findings of fact and conclusions of law are wholly lost sight of by reason of misapprehension as to the proper method of review. In others, appeal is held to be proper. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>60 Fed. Rep. 53; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Yukers, </em>60 Fed. Rep. 641.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-6\">The existing statutes for the review of judgments of the Court of Claims reached their present form in the Revised Statutes in 1874, in \u00a7\u00a7 707, 708, by the latter of which author-. ity was expressly conferred on the Supreme Court to regulate-the method of allowing .appeals. By virtue of these statutes certain rules prescribed by the Supreme Court have been incorporated into and have undoubtedly become a part of the law regulating the appeals; among others Rule I, limiting the review to the purely legal question, <em>what judgment properly results from the facts found by the trial court, </em>thereby elimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>nating many of the.questions usually presented on appeals, but more especially eliminating those matters which are presented by writs of error, and require exceptions' to be taken in the trial court and bills of exceptions to be settled to bring them into the record, such as error in the admission or rejection of evidence,.or in making findings of fact unsupported by evidence or contrary to the undisputed evidence. The single question so to be considered requires no variation in the method of bringing it up, and therefore an <em>appeal </em>only is provided and no writ of error authorized. <em>United States </em>v. Young, 94 U. S. 258, 259.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-5\">Under this jurisdiction grew up a well-recognized class of cases known as claims against the United States, distinguished from all other litigations by the character of the defendant, and' unaffected by the nature of the transactions out of which they sprang or by considerations as to whether they would have been legal or equitable in their character if between individuals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-6\">When in 1887, by the Tucker Act, <em>concurrent </em>jurisdiction over this same class of cases was conferred on Circuit and District Courts, no change took place in the distinctiveness of the class; they remained cases of claims against the United States as before. The statute, \u00a7 9, gave to the parties \u201c the same rights of appeal or writ of error as are now reserved.iri the statutes of the United States in that behalf made. . . . The modes of procedure in claiming and perfecting an appeal or writ of error shall conform in all respects as near as may be to the statutes and rules of court governing appeals and writs of error in like causes.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-8\">This court has had occasion to pass upon this portion of. the statute but once, viz., in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>131 U. S. 36. That was an <em>appeal </em>from a judgment in an action of legal, as distinguished from equitable, character, rendered by the District Court of the District of Maryland. This court held that the rights of appeal and writ of error reserved by the Tucker Act were' the same as formerly existed from the Court of Claims, and that the words in that act \u201creserved in the statutes of the United States in that behalf made\u201d meant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>reserved with reference to judgments in cases of claims against the United States in the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-4\">The statute has received further construction at the hands of Mr. Justice Lamar, sitting at circuit in <em>Strong v. United States, </em>40 Fed. Rep. 183, So. Hist. Alabama. The logic of the Davis case is there slightly amplified, and it is held that the right to the review of judgments in claims cases in Circuit and District Courts is controlled by the statutes regulating reviews of judgments of the Court of Claims ; in other words, sections 707 and 708, Revised Statutes, are held to be, by the section above quoted, embodied in the Tucker Act, and therefore to constitute and limit the full measure of review to which either party js entitled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-5\">This principle applied to the present case is conclusive of the motion to dismiss the writ. Writ of error is not and never was authorized to review judgments of the Court' of Claims, and therefore is not available to bring up for review judgments of the Circuit and District Courts rendered in their concurrent jurisdiction over claims cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-6\">Another consideration exists in the long and well-established practice of this court under the Tucker Act to take jurisdiction by appeal from judgments which iu case of individual litigants -would be reviewable only on writ of error. We cite below all the reviews of judgments of Circuit or District Courts in claims cases upon which this court has passed otherwise than to dismiss either on stipulation or on motion of the appellant or plaintiff in error. They are all <em>appeals, </em>and all except thr\u00e9e are actions at <em>law </em>as distinguished from suits in equity. So far as we have been able to discover, no case other than the one at bar has been brought to this court by writ of error, except that of <em>Richard S. Tuthill, </em>which was dismissed in April, 1890, on' motion of the government, plaintiff in error, for what reason we have been unable to ascertain. <em>United States v.

The United States contend that a judgment rendered in a suit brought under the act of March 3, 1887, c. 359, entitled <em>\u201c </em>An act to provide for the bringing of suits against the government of the United States,\u201d and commonly known as the Tucker Act, cannot be reexamined here except upon appeal. 24 Stat. 505. So much of that act as can have any bearing upon this case is printed in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>The contention of the government as to the jurisdiction of this court is not well founded. Congress did not intend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>cases brought under this act in a District or Circuit Court of the' United States, should be brought here by appeal only. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Throughout all the provisions relating to actions commenced in those courts there is shown a purpose to preserve' the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>tinction between cases at law, cases in equity, and cases in admiralty. The phrases \u201c judgment or decree,\u201d \u201c right of exception or appeal,\u201d \u201cequity or admiralty,\u201d \u201crights of appeal or writs of error,\u201d and \u201cappeal or writ of error,\u201d taken in connection with the clause in the fourth section relating to the jurisdiction of the respective courts of the United States proceeding under the act and providing that \u201c the course of procedure sh9.ll be in accordance with the established rules of said respective courts, and of such additions- and modifications thereof as said courts may adopt;\u201d with that part of section seven which in terms refers to the distinction between cases at law and cases in equity and admiralty, and directs that \u201c if the suit be in equity or admiralty the court shall proceed with the same- according to the rules of such courts ; \u201d with the express recognition in section nine, of the \u201c same rights of appeal or writs of error\u201d in any suit brought under this act as were reserved in the statutes of the United States in that behalf at the date of the passage of the act; with the require-, ment, in the same section, that \u201c the modes of procedure in claiming and perfecting an appeal or writ of error shall conform in all respects, and as near as may be, to the statutes and rules of court governing appeals and writs of error in like causes ; \u201d and with the provision in section ten, making it the duty of the District Attorney, when the Attorney General shall determine \u201c whether an appeal or writ of error shall be taken or not\u201d in cases in which \u201cthe judgment or decree\u201d shall be adverse to the government, to cause \u201c an appeal or writ of error to be perfected in accordance with the terms of the statutes and rules of practice governing the same; \u201d these phrases, clauses, and provisions make it, we think, reasonably, clear that Congress intended that the final determination of suits brought under this act in a District or Circuit Court of the United States shall be reviewed here upon writ of error, if the case be one at law, and upon appeal, if the case is one cognizable in equity or in admiralty under the existing statutes regulating the jurisdiction of those courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">But Congress, while recognizing the settled distinction between law, equity, and admiralty, did not intend that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>records of cases brought against the government under this act should contain all that is required in suits instituted in the courts of the United States under the general statutes regulating their jurisdiction and the modes of procedure therein. Neither the mode of procedure in the Court of Claims, nor the mode in which cases there determined may be brought here for reexamination, were changed by the act of March 3, 1887. But under that act, a judgment of a District or Circuit Court of the United States in an action at law. brought against the government, will be reexamined here only when the record contains a specific finding of facts with the conclusions of law thereon. In such cases, this court will only inquire whether the judgment below is supported by the facts thus found. And, we think, it was also the purpose of Congress to require like specific findings or statements of fact and conclusions of law in cases in equity and in admiralty brought under that act in the District and Circuit Courts of the United States, and to restrict our inquiry in such cases, as in actions at law, to the sufficiency of the facts so found or stated to support the final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">For the reasons stated the motion to dismiss the writ of error for want' of jurisdiction in this .court to review, in that mode, the final judgment of the court below is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\"Was the United States' liable upon the written contract of lease which is the foundation of this action ?</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">By the law in force when the lease sued on was executed, it was made the duty of the Postmaster General <em>\u201c </em>to establish post offices.\u201d By section 3732 of. the Revised Statutes it is provided,- as did, substantially, the statutes in force \"when the lease was made, that <em>\u201c </em>no contract or purchase on behalf of the United States shall be made unless the same is authorized by law, or is under an appropriation adequate to its fulfilment, except in the \"War and Navy Departments, for clothing, subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters, or transportation, which, however, shall not exceed the necessities of the current year.\u201d Act of March 3, 1825, c. 64, \u00a7 1, 4 Stat. 102; Act of March 2, 1861, c. 84, \u00a7 10, 12 Stat. 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Much stress is placed by counsel' for the plaintiff upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>clause making it the duty of the Postmaster General to establish post offices; the contention being that the power to establish a post office carries with it authority to lease rooms or a building in which the postmaster m\u00e1y conduct the business of his office. In support of this position <em>Ware v. United States, </em>4 Wall. 617, is cited. But that case does not justify any such interpretation of the act of Congress. The question there was as to the power of the Postmaster General to discontinue a post office that had once been established by him under the authority conferred by the act of 1825, 4 Stat. 102, \u201c to- establish post offices.\u201d This court, observing that the power to discontinue post offices is incident to the- power to establish them, unless there was some provision in the acts of Congress restraining its exercise, said: \u201c Undoubtedly, Congress might discontinue a post office which they had pre: viously established by law, and it is difficult to see why the Postmaster General may not do the same thing when acting under an act of Congress, expressed in the very words of the Constitution from which Congress derives its power.\u201d Again: \u201cPower to establish post offices and post roads is conferred upon Congress, but the policy of the government from the time the general post office was established has been to delegate the' power to designate the places where the mail shall be received and delivered to the Postmaster General.\u201d p. 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">There was no issue in that case as to the extent of the authority of the Postmaster General to bind the. government by contract for the payment of mpney or for the l\u00e9ase of a building for a post office. That case did not call for any consideration of the general question, whether the words in the statute, \u201cto \u00e9stablish post offices,\u201d had the full meaning of the same' words found in the section of the Constitution enumerating the powers of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Nor is it necessary to. determine all that may be done by the Postmaster General under the power \u201c to establish post offices \u201d conferred upon that officer; for those words are to be interpreted in connection with the above statutory provision forbidding the making, except in the War and Navy Departments, and in those departments only for certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>things and under specified conditions, of any contract or purchase on behalf of the United States unless the same be authorized by law, or is under an appropriation adequate to its fulfilment. There is no claim that the lease in question was made under any appropriation whatever, much less one adequate to its fulfilment. So that the only inquiry is, whether the contract of lease was \u2022\u201c authorized by ls\u00fcw \u201d within the meaning of the statute relating to contracts or purchases on behalf of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The counsel of the plaintiff contends that a contract of lease on behalf of the United States is authorized by law if made by the Postmaster General for the purpose of procuring rooms or a building for a post office established by him. The same argument would sustain a purchase by the Postmaster General, on behalf of the United States, of a building to be used for a post office so established by that officer. We cannot give our sanction to this interpretation of the statute. It would give the Postmaster General much larger powers than we believe Congress intended to give him. While the Postmaster General, under the power to establish post offices, may designate the places, that is, the localities, at which the mails are to be received, he cannot bind the United States by any lease or purchase of a building to be used for the purposes of a post office, unless the power to do so is derived from a statute which either expressly or by necessary implication authorizes him to make such lease or- purchase. The general authority \u201cto establish post offices\u201d does not itself, or without more, necessarily imply authority to bind the United States by a contract to lease or purchase a post-office building, although an appropriation of money to pay for the rent of a post-office building at a named place might give authority to the Postmaster General to lease such building in that locality as he deemed proper for the service, always keeping within the amount so appropriated. So also the power to lease a building to be used as a post office may be implied from a general appropriation of money to pay for rent of post offices in any particular fiscal year or years.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">We have considered the case in the light of the statutes in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>force when the lease of May 1, 1870, was executed. Shortly after that date, by the act of July 12,1870, c. 251, \u00a7 7, 16 Stat. 251, it was provided that no department of the government should expend, in any one year, any sum in excess of appropriations^made by Congress for that fiscal year, or involve the government in any contract for the future payment of money in excess of such appropriations. And that provision is reproduced in section 3679 of the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">We are of opinion that the lease sued on was not authorized by law, and, consequently, no action can be maintained thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"A0s\">The judgment is <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-7\"> Sec. 1.
