A judgment creditor of the lessee sought by judicial proceedings in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, Ohio, to subject his interest in these and other lands to payment of his claim.

The property was sold at judicial sale, and the proceeds received by Kebler and not paid over or accounted for by him to said trustees. The defendants, Vos and Stix, were purchasers.

He denied that said Kebler. was wholly insolvent at all times mentioned in said bill. H\u00e9 denied that prior to or at the time of his purchase of said premises he knew complainants were absent from the State of Ohio, or non-residents of said State during the time of said proceedings. He denied that the proceedings and acts taken and done in- said cause, purporting to be on behalf of said complainants, were Avithout authority, notice, or knowledge, or that they were done solely by fraud of said Kebler, or that they were ignorant of said suit and the proceedings therein and of the receipt of said money by said Kebler until after his death. He denied that the said decree in said cause Avas null and void as to said complainants, or that th.e said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Court of Common Pleas was without jurisdiction to order the said premises sold free from their claim and title, or that said sale and conveyance to him by said Tyler were null and void.

Robb and Mary Robb a portion of said sum of $11,361.66, but how much thereof exactly he could not state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AGI\">And, further answering, said Yos averred that any alleged want of authority on the part of said Kebler, or Kebler &amp; Roelker, to do any and all of the acts by him or said firm done and in said bill mentioned, was supplied, and all such acts purporting to be done on behalf of said complainants, were ratified by them as follows : Said complainants, on March 2, 1888, in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, Ohio, in the case of William J. Coppock, Administrator, <em>v. </em>John Kebler et al., No.- 79,812, on the docket of said court, voluntarily entered their appearance and filed their answer and cross-petition ; and again, on April-10, 1888, in the same court, in the case of William J. Coppock, Administrator, <em>v. </em>John Kebler et al., No. 79,902, on the docket of said court, said complainants having, on cross-petition of Frederick G. Roelker, been made parties defendant in said cases, voluntarily entered their appearance and filed their answer and cross-petition in each of said cases, being in the same language, and in each case averring that said Charles A. Kebler, for his firm of Kebler &amp; Roelker, had entered the appearance of said Robb and Strong, trustees, in said action in the bill mentioned, brought by said Gugenheim, and had filed an answer therein on their behalf, and that on May 11, 1887, said firm of Kebler &amp; Roelker had been dissolved, and had been succeeded by the firm of Kebler, Roelker &amp; Jelke, composed of said Kebler and Roelker and Ferdinand Jelke, Jr., and that thereafter all steps taken in said cause on behalf of said Robb and Strong, trustees, were taken by said new firm; and that in the case aforesaid, brought by said Gugenheim, the premises in the said bill herein described had, pursuant to decree made therein, been sold by George Sidney Tyler, special master, commissioner appointed by the court for that purpose, free from the claims of said Robb and Strong, trustees, and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>other persons whomsoever; averring further, that the decree had been made in said cause on May 19, 1887, whereby it was ordered, adjudged, and decreed that said special master commissioner should pay to said Robb and Strong, trustees, or their counsel; Kebler, Roelker &amp; Jelke, out of the proceeds of said sale, the sum of $11,361.65; and further averring, that said sum had been by said special master commissioner, on June 16, 1887, duly paid to said firm, but no portion thereof had by said firm been paid or accounted for to said Robb and Strong, trustees; and further averring, that, on November 23, 1887, said Charles A. Kebler had deceased, and that said Roelker &amp; Jelke were the surviving partners of said firm of Kebler, Roelker &amp; Jelke, and praying that said Jelke might be made party defendant to said causes ; and that it might be adjudged that said Robb and Strong, trustees, were creditors of said firm of Kebler, Roelker &amp; Jelke; and that the property in the petition and cross-petition of said Roelker sought to be sold might be sold, and that out of the proceeds thereof said sum of $11,361.65, with interest from June 16, 1887, might be paid to said Robb and Strong, trustees; and that said Robb and Strong, trustees, might recover judgment against said Roelker &amp; Jelke, as surviving partners of said Kebler, Roelker &amp; Jelke, for said sum and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-5\">And, further answering, said Yos averred that said answers and cross-petitions were sworn to by the said James Hampden Robb, and were signed and filed by the duly authorized attorneys of the said Robb and Strong, trustees, that the same remained on file in said cases until May 16, 1888, when, said cases having in the meantime been consolidated \u2022 April 21, 1888, (Record, p. 164,) said Robb and Strong, trustees, filed a demurrer to said cross-petition of Frederick G-. Roelker, on the ground that they had been improperly joined as defendants thereto; and thereafter, until May 28, 1888, when said demurrer was sustained, and said Robb and Strong, trustees, were dismissed from said cases. A copy of said answers and cross-petitions was filed with the answer of said defendant, William Stix, to said bill, to which copy the said Yos makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>reference and incorporates said copy in this his answer as part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-4\">Said Yos further averred that at the time of swearing to said answers and cross-petitions and filing them, said Robb and Strong, trustees, had full knowledge of all things and acts done in their behalf by said Kebler, and Kebler &amp; Roelker, and Kebler, Roelker &amp; Jelke, and they deliberately adopted them as done on their behalf and ratified them, and supplied all lack of previous authority upon the part .of said Kebler, and Kebler <em>&amp; </em>Roelker, and Kebler, Roelker &amp; Jelke, if any such there previously had been, which he, said Yos, denied. And thereupon said Yos prayed to be hence dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-5\">On the same day, December 8, 1888, the said August Yos filed in said Circuit Court and in said cause No. 414S his. cross-bill against the said James Hampden Robb and Charles E. Strong, trustees, William -Stix and Moritz Loth, stating fully the facts alleged in said bill of Robb and Strong, trustees, which were admitted in his answer to said bill; also the facts set forth in his said answer; also averring that on May 24, 1887, he entered into possession of the premises ;so purchased and conveyed to him, and had had possession thereof ever since, and had expended a large amount of money thereon in repairs and permanent improvements, which he was ready to show to the court; also referring to the petition hereinbefore mentioned, filed in a cause brought by said Robb and Strong, trustees, May 12, 1888, in the Superior Court of, Cincinnati, No. 43,368, removed to said Circuit Court and then on the docket thereof, No. 4182, in which they averred that the said transactions between them and said Loth \u2014 the deed and lease \u2014 were in truth and in fact a loan by them to said Loth of $10,000, for which sum and interest thereon they had a first and best lien upon said premises. Reference was made to the certified copy of said petition contained in the transcript of the record in said case 43,368, Superior Court of Cincinnati, on file in said Circuit Court in said case No. 4182, and the same incorporated therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-6\">Yos prayed that, in the event it be found by the court that the said acts done by said Kebler, or Kebler <em>&amp; </em>Roelker, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Kebler, Roelker &amp; Jelke, were unauthorized by and not ratified by and not binding on said Robb and Strong, trustees, and the said judgments, orders, and decrees of said Court of Common Pleas void as to them, and that he acquired no title by his purchase and deed of the said real estate, it should be decreed that the deed and lease aforesaid constituted only' a mortgage to secure to said Robb and Strong, trustees, the payment of said $10,000 and. interest, and that an account be taken to ascertain what proportion of said sum and interest ought justly'to be borne by him*'as chargeable against the land covered by said mortgage purchased by him, taking into accourit the payments which it might be found said Kebler, or Kebler <em>&amp; </em>Roelker, or Kebler, Roelker &amp; Jelke, had made on account of said interest and principal, or out of said sum of $11,361.65, to said Ellen W. Robb and Mary Robb, which proportionate sum that might be so found he thereby offered and.agreed to pay as said Circuit Court should direct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-5\">On December 21, 1888, said Robb and Strong, trustees, filed their general replication to the answer of said Yos in No. 4M8.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\">On February 16, 1889, said Robb and Strong, trustees, filed their answer to the said cross-bill of August Yos, in which they denied that said Yos was an innocent purchaser for valuable consideration, without notice of the want of authority from the said Kebler, or Kebler &amp; Roelker, or of the want of consent of said Robb and Strong, as trustees, to the decree of sale in the said Gfugenheim case; and they denied that any of the acts of said Kebler, or Kebler &amp; Roelker, or Kebler, Roelker &amp; Jelke, had been ratified by any act of said Robb and Strong, as trustees. As to whether the said transaction, Avhereby the said Loth conveyed to them said property for $10,000, and they leased the same back to him, was a loan, and Avhether said conveyance should be regarded as a mortgage, and to be foreclosed as such, they left the same to the determination of the court upon the proof to be made by said August Yos of the allegations of his said cross-bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-7\">They also denied any authority on the part of said Kebler, or Kebler &amp;\u25a0 Roelker, to collect said rent, or to act for them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>in the collection of said interest or principal; and they denied that said Kebler collected any of the interest of said $10,000, and paid the same to Ellen W. Eobb and Mary Eobb, and if he did so, that he was authorized to collect the said principal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-5\">On February 23, 1889, said Yos filed a general replication to said answer of Eobb and Strong, trustees, to his cross-bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-6\">The defendant, William Stix, did not file any demurrer or special plea to said bill, but otherwise filed pleadings substantially the same as those filed by August Y os..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-7\">On the final hearing, November 26, 1889, upon the pleadings and evidence, the court found the equity of the case with the defendants, and that the complainants had ratified said Kebler\u2019s want of authority, and therefore, decreed the dismissal of the bill; and also that the title of Yos should be quieted against the complainants, as prayed for in his cross-petition.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-8\">. <em>Mr. Edward Colston, </em>(with whom were <em>Mr. Judson Harmon </em>and <em>Mr. George Iloadly, Jr., </em>on the brief,) for appellants, on the question of election and ratification said:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-9\">It is claimed that Eobb and Strong, trustees, by filing an answer and cross-petition in the Coppock case, ratified Kebler\u2019s want of authority, and thereby made the title of Yos and Stix to the land in question good.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-10\">Eatification being thus asserted and denied, the question is, whether 'the mere fact that Eobb and Strong, trustees, filed an answer and cross-petition in the Coppock case furnishes, <em>under the circumstances, </em>conclusive evidence that they did thereby elect to abandon their title, as trustees, to this land, and to adopt in lieu thereof the chance of recovering some, or it may be all, or it may be none, of the money from Kebler\u2019s assets or from Kebler\u2019s partners <em>by means of the Coppock case. </em>The court below decided in the affirmative and accordingly dismissed the bill on that ground.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-11\">We claim that there is'in this record no evidence of an intelligent and intentional ratification of the acts of Kebler and of deliberate choice <em>actually made </em>to look solely to what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>might he got out of the Coppock case. It is not pretended that there was any express ratification,.and, therefore, if any ratification there was, it must be implied. This presents a question of fact, not-of law. Ratification and election rest upon intention. The answer and cross-petition of Robb and Strong, which is claimed to operate as a ratification, was not a <em>suit begun </em>by them, but only a pleading filed in an action in which they .had been summoned as defendants, <em>for a limited </em>purpose, by the cross-petition of Frederick G. Roelker. Roelker did not claim it was necessary to bring in Robb and Strong, trustees, in order to determine the question whether they had any claim upon \u201c the subject-matter in this case.\u201d The precise language of Roelker\u2019s cross-petition is that Robb and Strong, trustees, \u201care necessary parties to the determination of the right of <em>plaintiff </em>(Coppock) and of this <em>defendant </em>(Roelker) to the subject-matter of the litigation in this cause.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVF\">Roelker did not aver that Robb and Strong, trustees, had any claim to participate in his indemnity fund or that they had asserted a right to avail themselves thereof. He recognized no rights of Robb and Strong in that fund nor to any relief in the case. Their presence was averred to be necessary only to determine rights between Coppock and him. Roelker acted on the idea that it was necessary to have Robb and Strong before the court to enable <em>him, </em>to establish <em>his </em>lien upon the Kebler assets to an extent that would protect him against the Robb and Strong claim should they make it, and not in order to afford <em>them </em>an opportunity to assert any right of <em>theirs. </em>But in reality their presence was not necessary even for this purpose; and the court so decided, and they were dismissed. It is true that Robb and Strong, in their answer, overlooking the purpose for which they had been invoked into the case, did set up a claim to a personal judgment not only against Roelker, but against Jelke, the other partner, whom the- answer of Robb and Strong prayed should be made a. party. But Jelke was not made a party. It was, however, clearly not a case for a personal judgment against Roelker and Jelke, or either. Such cause of action would have been foreign to the case as affecting some and not all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the parties to the cause, and would have been contrary to the provisions of \u00a7 5020 Revised Statutes of Ohio, which requires that each cause of action' shall affect all the parties to a case. It was proper, then, for these reasons, if for no other, that Robb and Strong should withdraw their answer and cross-petition, it being subject at any time before trial to be stricken from, the files for non-conformity to that section or to a demurrer for the same reason. The result is the same as if no such answer had ever been filed by them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-4\">Rut if any effect is t.o be given to the filing of this answer and cross-petition, no greater effect can be rightly claimed for it than would attach- to it as the presentation of a claim to participate in a fund, the value of which the claimant knows nothing of; for anything more would have exceeded the limits of that case.' The presentation of such a claim- would not amount to an election even where it is filed <em>voluntarily. </em>So are all the authorities, particularly <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>3 B. <em>&amp; </em>C. 196 ; <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>L. R. 10 Q. B. 57; <em>Wells, Fargo &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>13 California, 133. But the appearance of Robb and Strong in the Coppock case was not voluntary. Robb and Strong, although non-residents, were subject to constructive service by publication,-and being thus compellable to appear, their appearance without waiting to be served by publication would have no different effect than if they had been served in that manner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-5\">Our claim that there was no election on the part of Robb and Strong to ratify the acts of Kebler in consenting to the .sale of the property as professed attorney for Robb and Strong, trustees, is placed upon the following grounds :</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-6\">I. - Robb and Strong, trustees, had no authority or power to ratify a transaction, the effect of Which would- be to divest them of their title as trustees to this property. They could not have conveyed this property in the first instance so as to divest their <em>cestuis que trustent </em>of their title; and <em>a fortiori </em>could not do so by ratification after the property had been sold and the proceeds thereof squandered. Stix and Yos derived notice of this want of power, in the part of Robb and Strong from the- conveyances and from the pleadings in the case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Eobb and Strong had no power to have accepted in lieu of the land the <em>chance </em>of making the money out of the insolvent Kebler, or out of his solvent partners who denied responsibil-' ity for his acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-5\">A ratification can only be made when the party ratifying possesses the power to perform the act ratified. <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Fulton </em>County, 10 Wall. 676, 684. See also <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>100 Mass. 382, <em>S. C. </em>97 Am. Dec. 107; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ayer, </em>101 U. S. 320; <em>The Distilled Spirits, </em>11 Wall. 356.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-6\">II. There could be no ratification as against the partners of Kebler without their consent; they did not consent to a ratification the result of which would hav\u00e9 made them.liable for stolen money. The claim in the answer and cross-petition of Eobb and Strong was not against the estate of Kebler, but only against his partners; or at most against Kebler, in conjunction with them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-7\">III. Katification being a question of intention, the filing of the answer and cross-petition of Eobb and Strong did not, under the circumstances, constitute an election to give up the land and accept in lieu thereof a <em>supposed </em>right of recovery, for which they had in that case no remedy <em>enforceable in that proceeding.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-8\">To constitute an election by implication, the acts relied upon must be plain and unequivocal acts, done under a full knowledge of all the circumstances and rights of the parties. <em>Reaves </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em>34 Alabama, 558, 562; <em>Anderson\u2019s Appeal, </em>36. Penn. St. 476.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-9\">In considering the question of ratification or- election as arising from the act of filing this answer and cross-petition, we cannot accord to it the same significance as attaches to proceedings at common law where the pleading indicated to- a certaint}r, whether it was founded upon tort or contract, there being in Ohio no forms of action. We find no case in the books where it has been decided that the mere commencement of a suit which was afterwards withdrawn without issue of process, has been held to amount to a ratification; In all the cases where the pendency of a suit not prosecuted to judgment has been held to constitute a ratification, there has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>been either an attachment, a trial by jury or a replevin, or some other step taken whereby the plaintiff had acquired, some advantage. There are in the opinions in some cases, expressions such as that any decisive act would constitute a ratification or election, as the case may be; but, in those very cases, there had either been a trial of the case or an attachment, or the case was still pending when the second action was brought. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>3 B. <em>&amp; </em>C. 196; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Couchman, </em>14 C.

S. 714; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>111 U. S. 640; <em>Arrowsmith </em>v. <em>Gleason, </em>129 U. S. 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Whether the presumption, in favor of innocent third parties, that Kebler had authority to enter an appearance for Robb and Strong, trustees, and to receive the proceeds of the sale, was sufficiently overcome by the evidence in this case, we need not consider, because we agree with the conclusion of the court below that the acts of Kebler, whether done with or without authority, were subsequently adopted and ratified by the complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">That the course of Robb and Strong, in voluntarily appearing in the case of Copp'ock <em>v. </em>Kebler, and filing an answer and cross-petition therein, whereby they sought to appropriate to themselves the benefit of the mortgage given by Kebler, in June, 1887, to F. Gf. Roelker, would have been an adoption and ratification of the acts of Kebler done in their behalf, and would have estopped them, as against innocent third parties whose proceedings were or may have been influenced by such course, is clear, upon reason and authority, if Robb and Strong were acting in their own behalf. This course was deliberately chosen, after the lapse of several months from the death of Kebler, and with a full knowledge of all the facts. It does not appear that they acted under any mistake, nor that, when they afterwards dismissed their cross-petition and resorted to the present suit, they had acquired any additional information. The subsequent withdrawal of their answer and cross-petition did not avail to put the parties in <em>statu quo. </em>Such withdrawal could not restore to the purchasers at the Gugenheim sale their lost opportunity to pursue Kebler\u2019s estate. Nor is it necessary that it should be made to appear, by evidence, that benefit would certainly have accrued to Vos and Stix from an attempt, if seasonably made, to secure indemnity from Kebler\u2019s estate. The right to seek such indemnity was a valuable one, and it is enough that it -appears that Robb and Strong, by acquiescing in Kebler\u2019s acts and resorting to legal proceedings against his administrator and partner, prevented Vos and Stix from promptly and perhaps successfully pursuing their remedies against the criminal\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Similar reasoning was applied by this court in the case of <em>Leather </em>Manufacturers\u2019 <em>Bank </em>v. Morgan, 117 U. S. 96, l44. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>It was there held that a depositor, whose checks had been \u2022fraudulently raised-by his clerk, lost his remedy against the bank by his delay and negligence in making known the facts to the bank and thus giving it an opportunity to. seek restitution from the wrongdoer, and the following language was used :</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">\u201c Still further, if. the depositor was guilty of negligence in not discovering and giving notice of the'fraud of his clerk, then the bank was thereby prejudiced, because it was prevented from taking steps, by the arrest of the criminal, or by an attachment of his property, or other form of proceeding to compel restitution. It is not necessary that it should be made to appear, by evidence, that benefit would certainly have accrued to the bank from an attempt to secure payment from the criminal. Whether the depositor is to be held as having ratified what his clerk did, or to have adopted the checks paid by the bank and charged to him, cannot be made, in this action, to depend on a calculation whether the criminal had at the time the forgeries were committed, or subsequently, property sufficient to meet the demands of the bank. An inquiry as to the damages in money actually sustained by the bank by reason of the neglect of the depositor to give notice of the forgeries might be proper if this were an action by it to recover damages for a violation of his duty. But it is a suit by the depositor, to falsify a stated account, to the injury of the bank, whose defence is that the depositor has, by his conduct, ratified or adopted the payment of the altered checks, and thereby induced it to forbear taking steps for its protection against the person committing the \u25a0 forgeries. As the right to seek and compel restoration and payment from the person committing the forgeries was, in itself, a valuable one, it is sufficient if it appears that the bank, by reason of the negligence of the depositor, was prevented from promptly, and, it may be, effectively, exercising it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">We do not deem it necessary to review the numerous cases, involving questions of election of remedy and ratification, cited on behalf of the respective parties, but shall content ourselves with referring to two or three which satisfactorily illustrate the principles upon which we proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>Thompson </em>v. Howard, 31 Michigan, 309, 312, was a case where a father who had brought an action of assumpsit for a minor son\u2019s wages, and, after the jury disagreed, had discontinued the suit, and brought an action for the unlawful enticing away and harboring the son. The Supreme Court said :</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u201c A man may not take contradictory positions; and where he has a right to choose one of two modes of redress, and the two are so inconsistent that the assertion of one involves the negation or repudiation of the other, his deliberate and- settled choice of one, with knowledge, or the means of knowledge of such facts as would authorize a resort to each, will preclude him thereafter from going back and electing again. . . . [The plaintiff\u2019s] proceeding necessarily implied that the defendant had the young man\u2019s services during the time <em>with plaintiffs assent, </em>and this was absolutely repugnant to the foundation of this suit, which is, that the young man was drawn away and into defendant\u2019s service <em>against the plaintiffs </em>assent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">In <em>Conrow </em>v. <em>Little, </em>115 N. Y. 387, 393, 394, the court said :</p>\n<p id=\"AA7\">\u201cThe contract between Branscom and the plaintiffs was, upon the discovery of Branscom\u2019s fraud, voidable at their election. As to him, the plaintiffs could affirm or rescind it. They could not do both, and there must be. a time when their election should be considered final. \u00a5e think that time was-when they commenced an action for the sum due under the contract, and in the course of its prosecution applied for and obtained an attachment against the property of Branscom as their debtor. They then knew of the fraud practised by him, and disclosed that knowledge in the affidavit on which the attachment was granted, and became entitled to that remedy because it was made to appear that a cause of action existed in their favor by reason of \u2018 a breach of contract to pay for goods and money loaned obtained by fraud.\u2019 The attachment was levied and the action pending when the present action, which repudiates the contract and has no support except on the theory of its disaffirmance, was commenced. The two remedies are inconsistent. By one, the whole estate of the debtor is pursued in a summary manner, and payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>of a debt sought to be enforced by execution ; by the other, specific articles are demanded as the property of the plaintiff. One is to recover damages in respect of the breach of the contract, the other can be maintained only by showing that there was no contract-. After choosing between these modes of proceeding, the plaintiffs no longer had an option. By bringing the first action, after knowledge of the fraud practised by Branscom, the plaintiffs waived the right to disaffirm the contract, and the defendants may justly hold them to their election. The principle applied in <em>Foundry Company </em>v. <em>Hersee, </em>103 N. Y. 26, and <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Midas, </em>104 N. Y. 602, require this construction, for the present contains the element lacking in those cases, viz., knowledge of the fraud practised by the vendee ; and by .reason of it the plaintiffs were put to their election.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u201c It is not at all material to the question that the plaintiffs discontinued the first suit before bringing the present to trial, for it is the fact that the plaintiffs elected this remedy, and acted affirmatively upon that election, that determines the present issue. Taking any steps to enforce the contract was a conclusive election not to rescind it on account of any thing known at the time. -After that-the option no longer existed, and is of no consequence whether or not the plaintiffs made-their choice effective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Hildreth, </em>5 Met. (Mass.) 49, it was held that \u201c an assignee of an insolvent debtor,\u201d under the insolvent law of 1838, \u201cmay affirm a sale of goods made by such debtor for the purpose of delaying or defrauding his creditors,- and receive the price of the goods from the vendee. And if such assignee, knowing all the facts of the case, brings an action against the vendee, on a note given by him for' the price of the goods, and secures the demand by an attachment of his property, he thereby so far affirms the sale, and waives his right to disaffirm it, that he. cannot, by discontinuing such action, and demanding the goods, entitle himself to maintain an action of trover against the vendee, on his refusal to return them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">At page 51 the court said : \u201cIt would, we think, be going too far to say that merely demand of the price would be deemed a waiver of his right to avoid the sale and claim the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>goods; because, in many cases, if the price could be obtained, it would be equally beneficial to the creditors, and he would have no farther occasion to pursue the harsher remedy of impeaching the sale. But we think that, if the assignee commences an action against the purchaser for the price, and causes his property to be attached to secure it, this is a significant act, an unequivocal assertion that he does not impeach the sale, blit by necessary implication affirms it. It is an act, too, deeply affecting the rights of the purchaser, whilst it is an assertion of his own; and if done with a knowledge of all the facts which ought to influence him in his election,, it is conclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">In <em>Connihan </em>v. Thompson, 111 Mass. 270, 272, the court said: \u201cThe defence of waiver by election arises where the remedies are inconsistent; as where one action is founded on an affirmance and the other upon the disaffirmance of a voidable contract or sale of property. In such cases, any decisive act of affirmance or disaffirmance, if done with knowledge of the facts, determines the legal rights of the parties, once for all. The institution of a suit is such a decisive act; and if its -maintenance necessarily involves an election, to affirm or disaffirm a voidable contract or sale, or to rescind one, it is generally held to be a conclusive waiver of inconsistent rights, and thus to defeat any action subsequently brought thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The rule established by these cases, is that any decisive act' by a party, with knowledge of his rights and of the facts, determines his election in the case of inconsistent remedies, and that one of the most unequivocal methods of showing ratification of an agent\u2019s act is the bringing of an action based upon such an act.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u00a5e cannot accept the contention that Kobb and Strong never had any legal standing in the Coppock case, and that the filing of their answer and cross-petition was merely a fortuitous circumstance, which did no injury to Yos and Stix.. It is true that when the answer and cross-petition were, by leave of court, withdrawn, the record did not, of itself, disclose any good reason for making them parties, and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>demurrer was properly sustained. But if they had stood upon their case, as set up in their answer and cross-petition, it would seem that they would have been entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">These views justify the decree of the court below, unless the fact that Robb and Strong were trustees calls for a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">It is .claimed that the interest held by Robb and Strong, in the lands' embraced in the deed and lease between them and Loth, was in the nature of an estate in realty, and that, as trustees, they could not themselves, nor by authority given to Kebler, have consented to the sale of such lands in the Gugenheim case. If the nature of their tenure was indeed such that it could not be affected by the sale in the Gugenheim case without their consent, and if, as trustees, they were disabled from consenting, it would seem to follow that the sale in that case was inefficacious, and that the remedy at law would be the sufficient and only onq.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">But our examination of the deed and lease, read in the light of the testimony of the parties, satisfies us that, as between Robb and Strong and Loth, the transaction was that of a loan of money secured by the covenants of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Moritz Loth testified, in the present case, that he regarded the transaction as a loan; and Robb and Strong, in the petition filed by them against Y os and Stix, alleged that <em>\u201c </em>the said transactions between them and the said Moritz <em>Loth </em>were in truth and in fact a loan by them to the. said Moritz Loth of the sum of $10,000, in consideration whereof the said Moritz \u2022 Loth conveyed to them the premises hereinbefore described, and they executed to the said Loth the lease hereinbefore described containing the privilege of purchase for the said sum of $10,000,\u201d and they accordingly prayed that <em>\u201c </em>their claim shall be declared to be a first and best lien on the premises, and that unless the defendants should pay them the said $10,000, with interest, the said land might be sold for the satisfaction of their claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">It also appears that, in the Gugenheim case, the petition averred that Robb and Strong, trustees, held the land only as security.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Accordingly it would seem plain that the rights of Robb and Strong, trustees, were correctly asserted by Kebler in the answer and cross-petition filed by him in the Gugenheim case, and that, assuming that he was authorized to appear, the decree in that case, directing the lands to be sold, and awarding to Robb and Strong, trustees, the said sum of $10,000 and interest out of the proceeds, was fully warranted. It follows that, by the payment into court of the amount of the principal and interest of the- money found to be due to Robb and Strong, trustees, and by the conveyance to them by the master of the lands in question, in pursuance of the decree', the purchasers became vested with a fee-simple title to said lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The decree of the court below is accordingly' .</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b67-7\">Mr. Justice Jackson and Mr. Justice White, not having heard the argument, took no part in the decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
