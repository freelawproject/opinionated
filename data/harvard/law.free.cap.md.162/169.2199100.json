The bill prays for a decree declaring the ordinance null and void; that the order passed by the commission be declared null and void, and that the commission be ordered to rescind it; that plaintiffs and other citizens and taxpayers of said city be protected by an order of court as to their rights to have the benefit of electric current in said city under such terms and conditions as the court may direct. The Mayor and City Council of Ocean City, the Eastern Shore Public Service Company of TVlaryland, and the individuals constituting the Public Service Commission of Maryland, are made defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The several defendants demurred to the bill of complaint. The chancellor sustained the demurrers and dismissed the bill. This appeal is from that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">We have no doubt of the correctness of the ruling of the chancellor.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Section 1 of chapter 464 of the Acts of 1924 provided that the Mayor and City Council of Ocean City \u201cshall have control and superintendence over the public property of the city, and the franchises and the easements of the public-streets of said city shall be vested completely in them, with power to grant the same whenever to them the interest of the public shall demand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The language of the act is clear, full, and explicit, andi leaves no room for doubt that the legislature meant to confer and did confer upon the city the power to grant such franchises as that here complained of. The power conferred upon the city by the act was that of the State itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Again, section 178 of article 23 of the Code of Public General Laws authorizes and empowers any electric light or power corporation to furnish any city, town, or community with power and light, without any restriction as to time or other consideration, except that the corporation must first have obtained \u201cthe proper assent of the municipal authorities of said city or town, or of the county commissioners of said county under such reasonable and proper regulations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>conditions that may be prescribed by them; subject, however, also to any law or ordinance that may be passed by the municipal authorities of the city or town, or of the county commissioners, having jurisdiction, for the filling up or restoring such streets or roads to their former condition,\u201d and, by section 390 of article 23, subject to the permission and approval of the Public Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">As to the alleged lack of adequate consideration, that complaint is disposed of by <em>Dulany v. United Railways </em>Co., 104 Md. 423, 440, 65 A. 45, 49: \u201cWhatever may be said of the expediency of the granting by the legislature of franchises in the streets of the city without requiring adequate compensation therefor to be paid to the municipality, .there can be no doubt, in view of the decisions of this court, of the power of the legislature to make such grants.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In regard to the allegation of the bill that the interest of the public did not demand the passing of said ordinance, that was a question which the Legislature gave the municipality the right to determine, and, in the absence of fraud or abuse of discretion, neither of which is alleged, the court had no authority to review its determination. <em>Baltimore v. Williams, </em>129 Md. 290, 296, 99 A. 362, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The conclusion we have reached makes it unnecessary to discuss other questions raised in argument, except the motions to dismiss the appeal. These motions were based: (1) on the failure of plaintiffs to file their bill of complaint within sixty days after the entry or rendition of the order of the Public 'Service 'Commission, as provided by section 404 of article 23 of the Code; (2) the failure to enter an appeal from the decree of the chancellor \u201cwithin twenty days,\u201d as provided by section 407 of said article.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">As to the first, assuming, without deciding, that section 404 is applicable ha such an order of the commission, it does not appear from the record that objection to the jurisdiction of the trial court was made in said court. As that court has jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and the defendants were summoned and submitted to the jurisdiction of the court, the objection cannot b\u00a9 considered here. Code, art. 5, sec. 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>iAs to the second ground, section 407 seems- to contemplate that the twenty days shall begin to- run only \u201cafter service of a copy of the order or judgment.\u201d It does not appear from the record that a copy was served. We do not agree with the contention that, in the absence of such service, the appeal was premature. The provision for the service was for the benefit of a party desiring to appeal, and not a condition precedent to the right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">But there is a more substantial reason for refusing the motion. The real question raised by the ap-peal is the power of the city to grant the franchise. The appeal is from its action primarily. The approval of the commission was an incident merely, although a necessary incident. The commission had no- power to grant the franchise. It was not necessary to- appeal from its o-rder, as its approval would be nugatory if the city lacked the power. If the appeal were dismissed as to the commission, it would not affect the real question involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The motion to dismiss the appeal is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, with costs to appellees.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
