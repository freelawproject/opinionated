The policy was issued on April 27th, 1872, and the death of the insured, John J. Kennedy, occurred on February 11th, 1873. Fifty-seven years later the policy was found in a drawer of a bookcase formerly belonging to Mr. Kennedy but now in the possession of the plaintiff, who1 is the widow of his son, and wTho has brought tlds suit in the capacity of administratrix <em>de bonis non </em>of the deceased policyholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">It was testified by the plaintiff that a week or two after finding the policy she called, with her daughter, at the home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>office of the defendant company in Baltimore; that \u201cthey went in the entrance of the insurance building,\u201d where \u201can official of some kind\u201d looked at the policy and told her to \u201ctake it up' to the claim department to' Mr. Parr.\u201d Her testimony then proceeded, so far as necessary to be quoted, as follows: \u201cI went in the office and asked for Mr. Parr and Mr. Parr wasn\u2019t there, and the young lady said, 'Mr. Patten there, he will take care of you.\u2019 Q. Did she tell you who he was? A. She just said Mr. Patten \u2014 is the assistant. * * * Q. And then a gentleman came forward. Did he say he was Mr. Patten? A. Yes; he was sitting at his desk when I went in. J gave him the paper * * * just laid it down, and lie took the name and number, and went back and got the card and came out and read it and said\u2014 * * * he read off the card ''According to the Providentia, of which he was a member at this time, this policy was lapsed in February, 1873.\u2019 Q. In when? A. March, 1873. Q. Are you positive? A. Yes, sir. I said, 'The man died in February of 1873.\u2019 He said, 'Oh that is different.\u2019 He said 'Then you were within the four weeks grace period according to the rules of the insurance company\u2019; he said, [The company will be glad to pay this policy, it would be a big ad. for them, when you get the proof' of death, which you know we have to have that \u2014 the proof of death, the doctor\u2019s certificate and the cause of death.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Mr. Patten said to her that \u201cthe next day he woud get another man and go down in the vault and get the old records out of the policy; that one man could not go down there alone; they had to take two', and he would go- down the next day and get them and that she should come down there and hear what was on the records * '* She \u201cwent down later and told them she had not had an opportunity to look up the records Mr. Patten wanted \u2014 the proofs he wanted, because she was employed and that the occasion of this second visit to the office of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of Baltimore may have been two weeks after the first visit. * * * On the second occasion she saw Mr. Patten, whom she had seen on her first visit.\u201d She told him that she had not had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u201ctime to get the necessary proofs that he wanted, or to hunt them up ; and he said, there is plenty of time, there is no hurry, just take your time and when you get them come in again. He did not at that time say anything about any other records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">About two weeks later the plaintiff again visited the insurance company\u2019s office. \u201cThis was the third time,\u201d she said, and, after being informed by Mr. Patten that the matter was \u201cout of his hands\u201d and had been \u201ctransferred to Mr. Parr,\u201d she had a conversation with the latter which she thus narrated: \u201cHe said that it was lapsed in March, but could have lapsed sooner and they did not get a record of it in time to make a note of it before March. I said, Well, that wTas very strange, I thought insurance companies were more accurate than that. Then he said how could I prove that this was the same John Kennedy, that there were hundreds of Kennedys \u2014 John Kennedys. I said, there may be now but there wasn\u2019t then. He said that their attorney said I had no claim whatever. Q. That was his answer to you ? A. Yes. He said, \u2018I have no proof \u2014 he had no proof that it wTas paid up to date.\u2019 I said, \u2018You haven\u2019t any proof it wasn\u2019t paid up to date; you have proof it was lapsed four weeks after he died.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The daughter of the plaintiff, who accompanied her when she first visited the insurance company\u2019s office, corroborated the mother\u2019s testimony as to the details of the interview with Mr. Patten on that occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">A letter to the insurance company from the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, asking that he be supplied with forms for proof of death under the policy, was answered by the company\u2019s vice-president, who stated in his letter: \u201cWe presume it to be a policy issued by the old Providentia. It seems rather late to make a death claim after almost sixty years have elapsed since the supposed death. As this company recognizes no liability thereon, we cannot submit any forms for proof of claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">One of the provisions of the policy vras that, \u201cif a contract be made by the assured with the Providentia Society <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>of which he is a member, as to weekly payment is not regularly and promptly met, in accordance with the constitution and by-laws of the Providentia, that then this policy shall be null and void.\u201d There is no evidence in the record as to the terms of the relationship between the Mutual Insurance Company of Baltimore, by which the policy was issued, and the Providentia Society. The record shows that in 1873 there was administration on the estate of the insured, to whose \u201clegal representatives\u201d the policy was payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">This suit belongs to a class of actions as to which it is provided by statute that they shall be commenced within three years from the time when the cause of action accrued. Code, art. 57, sec. 1. The claim now sued on had been subject to the bar of the statute for more than,half a century when the plaintiff found the policy and presented it to the insurer for payment. During the same period the policy had been entered on the records of the insurance company as \u201clapsed.\u201d The declarations. attributed to the assistant claim agent indicate that the question as to the lapsing of the policy was to be further investigated. But he is said to have made the unqualified statement that- the company would pay the policy, and it is to be determined whether he sufficiently appears to have had authority to bind the company by such an acknowledgment of. existing liability. If he had such power, it must be inferred solely from the fact that he was an assistant claim agent serving at the. insurer\u2019s home office; there being no.proof as to the actual extent of his authority. Upon the assumption that he had the full capacity of a claim agent to deal with matters to which that official could not give his personal attention, the question would remain as to whether the claim agent\u2019s power should be presumed to be adequate for the removal of a statutory limitations bar which the company was entitled to plead.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">There are numerous cases in which the powers of agents to waive policy provisions as to the time of suit have been considered. Notations of such cases are contained in 2 <em>Couch on </em>Insurance, p. 1775, sec. 554; 63 <em>L. R. A. </em>204; 47 <em>L. R. A. </em>709; and 48 <em>L. R. A. </em>(N. S.) 912. When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>binding effect of such a waiver, as made by a competent representative of the insurer, is recognized, it is usually upon the ground of estoppel resulting from some act or declaration of the agent, which induced the claimant to delay his suit beyond the period limited in this policy. But considerations sufficient to support the theory of waiver as affecting limitations embodied in the contract of insurance may not apply with equal force to the question of authority to suspend the bar of limitations imposed by statute. That defense arises independently of the policy agreement, which is the specific subject of the agency. As a corporation can act only through its officers and agents, a waiver of the statute may be effectively accomplished through its duly authorized representatives. But the existence of such authority is ordinarily a subject of proof rather than of presumption. Its possession by a claim agent or his assistant is not necessarily inferable merely from that designation of his position. In <em>Washington Savings Bank v. Butchers\u2019 etc. Bank, </em>107 Mo. 133, 17 S. W. 644, and <em>Wells, Fargo &amp; Co. v. Enright, </em>127 Cal. 669, 60 P. 439, corporations were held bound by waivers of statutory limitations by their presidents, to whose control the corporate affairs had been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">It was said in <em>Busby v. North America Life Ins. Co., </em>40 Md. 584, and repeated in <em>Crook v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>112 Md. 268, 277, 75 A. 388: \u201cThe principle seems to be well settled, that where the authority of the agent does not extend to making a new contract of insurance, he cannot wuive a forfeiture and revive a contract that has expired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">This court, in <em>Brager v. Levy, </em>122 Md. 554, 562, 90 A. 102, 105, answering the contention that \u201cthe existence of an agency and the extent of the agent\u2019s powers are questions of fact for the jury,\u201d said that such \u201cis the general rule where the authority of the agent is not conferred upon him by a written instrument. * * * But these facts, like all other facts, must be shown by competent evidence, and the burden is on him who assumes the affirmative to produce evidence from which the existence of an agent\u2019s power or authority to do a particular act may be properly inferred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>The claim involved in this suit is not such as would customarily arise in the course of a claim agent\u2019s experience. It presented an extraordinary problem, for the solution of which the powers incident to the performance of his usual duties could not, in our judgment, be properly assumed to be adequate. There being no evidence tending to prove such authority, we concur in the ruling of the trial court to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">It is suggested in the appellant\u2019s brief that the letter of the defendant\u2019s vice-president, from which we have quoted, is susceptible of being construed as a recognition of the claim and as a denial of liability only on the ground of limitations, which would, it is argued, be sufficient to raise the bar of the statute upon the principle of the decisions in <em>Oliver v. Gray, </em>1 H. &amp; G. 204, 217, 218, and <em>Knight v. </em>Knight, 155 Md. 243, 249, 141 A. 706. But we are unable to interpret the letter in accordance with that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
