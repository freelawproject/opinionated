There were two- notes given to- this payee, one dated December 3rd, 1929, and the other dated December 20th, 1929, the maker was adjudicated insane on April 9th, 1930, and on April 28th, 1930, the judgment by confession was entered. A motion to! strike out this judgment was overruled, and on appeal the same arguments for and on behalf of the judgment have been presented, as in the last preceding case. And for the reasons stated in the opinion in that case the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-15\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs to the appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
