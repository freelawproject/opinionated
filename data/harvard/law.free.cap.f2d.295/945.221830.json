Board of Appeals affirming the rejection of claim 20, the only claim remaining in the application of Douglas H. Moret\u00f3n, Ser. No. 369,055, filed July 20, 1953 for \u201cBack Up Washer and Sealing Device.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-27\">Appellant\u2019s specification describes the invention generally as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-28\">\u201cThis invention relates to sealing or packing arrangements and more particularly to a helical back up washer either alone or in combination with standard type sealing or packing rings in order to greatly increase the efficiency and longevity of the sealing arrangement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-29\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>\u201cThe present invention, resulting from extensive development and testing, represents a completely satisfactory solution to many of the problems and weaknesses inherent in presently known types of back up washers. This result is achieved by the use of a polytetrafluoroethylene plastic polymer [\u201cTeflon\u201d] admixed with molybdenum disulfide having high surface lubricity in combination with other satisfactory properties which is machined or otherwise formed into a helical configuration comprising more than one coil. * * This plastic material is flexible yet hard and has a low coefficient of friction on itself and most other surfaces, which aids greatly in preventing fluid leakage while keeping friction to a minimum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">The claim on appeal, broken up into its elements with inserted reference characters to facilitate discussion, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-5\">\u201c20.

The Waring, Roylon and Carlotta references disclose this to be so. Roylon and Carlotta also disclose, respectively, the exact \u201cTeflon\u201d back-up washer configuration and O-ring claimed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">For the reasons hereinafter stated we feel that appellant\u2019s claimed combination of a known \u201cTeflon\u201d back-up washer with a known butyl rubber O-ring with the addition of molybdenum disulfide to the \u201cTeflon\u201d as a lubricant would have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">Appellant\u2019s specification states that a helical back-up washer is desirable because damage \u201cto the adjacent packing ring is avoided since no split is present to chew at the ring as the washer \u2018works\u2019 or expands and contracts under pressure.\u201d It is also stated that this washer configuration \u201cpermits the washer to alter its diameter as it is worked under pressure even though no \u2018split\u2019 is present.\u201d Such statements, however, are but recitations of the inherently desirable characteristics present in a helical Roylon washer in combination with any rubber O-ring. We note, moreover, that the claim refers merely to a \u201cflexible\u201d backup washer (clause [e]) so the helical form of washer is irrelevant on the issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-15\">Appellant\u2019s specification further states that the <em>back-up washer </em>of his invention</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-16\">\u201c * * * works surprisingly well with a butyl rubber \u2018O\u2019 ring which, with ordinary back up rings [i. e., washers], has an unusually high tendency to wear, due to the fact that butyl rubber has great elasticity and therefore extrudes readily but has a slow recoil or slow rate of recovery after extension, so that it <em>requires a firmer back up ring </em>[washer] under all conditions of use in the hydraulic system <em>to prevent damage to the \u2018O\u2019 ring </em>resulting from wear caused by sharp changes in direction of the pressure of the hydraulic fluid \u2022 or direction of movement of the piston head.\" [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-17\">It appears, therefore, that it was because of certain inherent disadvantages in the behavior of <em>butyl </em>rubber O-rings that they have been claimed specifically, in combination with \u201cTeflon\u201d back-up washers. Appellant does not profess to have discovered these disadvantages. Carlotta clearly teaches the desirability, if not the necessity, of using back-up rings, including \u201cTeflon\u201d rings, where such disadvantages must be overcome. The use of a butyl rubber O-ring with the claimed hydraulic fluid in eombina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>tion with a \u201cTeflon\u201d back-up washer is clearly taught by the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">A back-up washer composed of \u201cTeflon\u201d and M0S2 appears to be novel. The alleged advantages associated with the use of such a washer are set forth in clauses [e] and [f] of the claim. We feel, however, that these advantages would all be present, to a considerable degree, in a back-up washer of \u201cTeflon\u201d alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">For example, in clause [e] the back-up washer is recited to be \u201cinert to the organic hydraulic fluid.\u201d Appellant\u2019s specification states that \u201cTeflon\u201d has been \u201cboiled in many solvents, including a variety of halogenated hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, and alcohols, without swelling or any other sign of attack.\u201d Roylon, however, shows that this chemical resistance of \u201cTeflon,\u201d was not a discovery of appellant. This reference says spiral \u201cTeflon\u201d back-up washers are chemically inert, unaffected by oils or solvents, will not harden, soften, swell or shrink, have a higher operating temperature range, and have low friction as compared with common types of rings. These attributes, Roylon states, add \u201cto the long life and resulting economy of these rings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Appellant\u2019s stated reason for adding M0S2 to his back-up washer is that \u201cpolymers of tetrafluoroethylene with M0S2, act as solid lubricants.\u201d Such polymers, however, are disclosed by Roylon to have desirable \u201clow friction\u201d characteristics <em>even in the absence of MoSz. </em>Roylon says this is \u201can outstanding characteristic\u201d of its washers. In view of these considerations, it may be inferred that in composing a back-up washer of \u201cTeflon\u201d and M0S2 appellant merely intended to enhance the already existing desirable anti-friction properties of \u201cTeflon\u201d back-up washers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">No proof has been offered by appellant that the particular M0S2 range recited in clause [d] of the claim is critical. Accordingly, we have not treated it as such and have not considered this range recitation significant on the issue of patentability. In re Swenson et al., 132 F.2d 1020, 30 CCPA 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">The question of patentability in the instant case must, accordingly, be decided by determining the obviousness of forming a back-up washer of \u201cTeflon\u201d and MoS2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">Rubin is the sole reference disclosing use of molybdenum sulfide as an anti-friction agent. Rubin states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-11\">\u201cThe packing composition of this invention comprises a polymer of trifluorochloroethylene [\u201cKel-F\u201d] in admixture with * * * <em>solid anti-friction agents, such as </em>graphite and <em>molybdenum sulfide * </em>* * <em>The solid anti-friction agent </em>is employed in the form of flakes or granules or small pieces.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-13\">Appellant attacks the sufficiency of the Rubin disclosure on the ground that Rubin discloses molybdenum sulfide used with an \u201centirely different\u201d thermoplastic. We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-14\">The Rubin disclosure includes four examples of packing composition according to his invention. Example 1 is 36% by weight of graphite particles in various specified sizes and proportions as an anti-friction agent, 36% by weight of a thermoplastic \u201cKel-F\u201d polymer, 14% by weight of a waxy \u201cKel-F\u201d polymer, and about 14% by weight of asbestos. Molded \u201crings\u201d made from this composition are characterized as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-15\">\u201c * * * suitable for pump shaft and valve stem packings from very low speed applications to the highest speeds normally encountered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-16\">The compositions of examples 2 and 4 are similarly composed of graphite particles of specified sizes in specified percentages by weight, and various \u201cKel-F\u201d polymers in stated proportions. These compositions, however, are characterized as \u201csuitable for static seals.\u201d No apparent reason exists for their non-suitability for dynamic applications. Obviously, many variables exist in these compositions, making it difficult to say from the Rubin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>disclosure exactly which combination of constituents would make a particular composition suitable for dynamic applications. The most apparent differences between the compositions in examples 1, <em>2, </em>and 4 are that (1) no asbestos is used in the compositions of examples 2 and 4 and (2) the compositions of examples <em>2 </em>and 4 include in place of the waxy \u201cKelF\u201d polymer of example 1, a heavy oil \u201cKel-F\u201d polymer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Example 3 discloses a composition which also lacks asbestos and includes a heavy oil \u201cKel-F\u201d polymer. In place of graphite, however, M0S2 is used. This \u2022composition, like the compositions of examples 2 and 4, is stated to be suitable only for static applications. Referring to this part of the Rubin disclosure, appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-6\">\u201c * * * if the Kel-F [containing MoS2] cannot be used in moving shaft applications because of excessive heat build up, <em>the Teflon containing the same molybdenum sulphide will likewise be expected to be detrimental for the same purposes.\u201d </em>[Emphasis appellant\u2019s.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">The weakness of this argument lies in its inherent assumption that M0S2 caused this composition to be unsuitable in moving shaft applications. However, the lack of asbestos or presence of the heavy \u2022oil \u201cKel-F\u201d polymer, among other variables, could more reasonably be said to deprive this composition of suitability 'in dynamic seals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">When the entire Rubin disclosure is read, it is clear that Rubin did not exclude molybdenum sulfide from all moving shaft applications involving his \u201cKelF\u201d polymers. To hold otherwise would be a perversion of Rubin\u2019s obvious purpose of disclosing, as exemplary, the compositions of examples 1 through 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">We feel that the disclosure in Rubin of M0S2 as an anti-friction agent in the packing art in connection with \u201cKel-F,\u201d and the prior art disclosures that \u201cTeflon\u201d and \u201cKel-F\u201d are functionally interchangeable to a considerable degree, would suggest to one skilled in the art the use of M0S2 with other similar polymers such as \u201cTeflon\u201d if it were desired to reduce friction or add to its lubricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">For the above reasons, the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1000-25\">. The board stated that \u201cthe \u2018molybdenum sulfide,\u2019 mentioned in the Rubin patent, and appellant\u2019s \u2018molybdenum disulfide\u2019 are the same composition, these two terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>being but different names therefor.\u201d The appellant has not controverted this statement. Though this assumption does not appear to be technically correct, we accept it for the purposes of this decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
