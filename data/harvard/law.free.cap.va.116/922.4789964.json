The court instructs the jury that if they'believe from the evidence that the defendants entered into the contract of April 4, 1910, with the plaintiffs, and that J. L. Garland did not exercise the option given him in said contract to purchase the property therein described by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>offer of good faith to perform the contract of purchase on his part, and that he was not prevented from completing said contract of purchase by any act or default on the part of the plaintiffs, and that the plaintiffs made sale of said property at public auction on May 14, 1910, after advertising the sale in such manner as seemed to them best calculated to give notice of the sale to probable prospective bidders, and that said property, when sold by the plaintiffs on May 14,1910, did not sell for an amount sufficient to pay the agreed price of $9,500.00 with interest thereon from April 2,1910, and all costs and expenses incurred by the plaintiffs in the advertisement and sale of the said property, then the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the amount of the deficiency from the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b956-5\">\u201c2. The court instructs the jury that under the terms of the contract of April 4, 1910, the plaintiffs were given authority to advertise the sale to he made on May 14, 1910, in such manner as seemed best to them, and if the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiffs, in advertising the property for sale, exercised their best judgment as to the manner of advertising the sale, and acted honestly in selecting the method of advertising the sale, then the defendants cannot complain of the manner adopted by the plaintiffs in advertising the sale, notwithstanding the fact that the jury may believe from the evidence that a different method of advertising the sale should have been adopted by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b956-6\">\u201cThe jury are further instructed that under the terms of the contract of April 4, 1910, the plaintiffs had the right to advertise and sell the property therein described for cash, and the defendants cannot complain that the sale made on May 14, 1910, was a cash sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b956-7\">\u201c3. The court instructs the jury that the fact that there may have been liens on or defects in the title to the property which the plaintiffs contracted to sell to J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>L. Garland, when the contracts of April 2, 1910, and April 4, 1910, were entered into, does not invalidate said contracts or relieve the defendants from the obligations imposed on them by the contract of April 4, 1910, unless the jury believe from the evidence that J. L. Garland was ready and willing to complete the purchase, and in good faith attempted to complete the purchase of the property he contracted to buy of the plaintiffs and was prevented from doing so by reason of the inability of the plaintiffs to convey him a good title to the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b957-5\">\u201c4. If the jury believe from the evidence that J. L. Garland made an offer in good faith to pay the purchase money to one of the executors, and that said offer was coupled with a demand for an immediate delivery of a deed to the property, the jury are instructed that when said offer was made, the plaintiffs were entitled to have a reasonable time in which to deliver the deed conveying the property to J. L. Garland.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b957-6\">\u201cThe jury are further instructed that an offer by J. L. Garland to one of the three executors to pay the purchase money coupled with a demand for an immediate delivery of deed does not constitute an offer on the part of J. L. Garland to perform the contract of April 4, 1910, such as would release him from the obligations of said contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b957-7\">\u201c5. The court instructs the jury that the vendor\u2019s lien retained in the deed of November 19, 1903, from Charles E. Smith and wife to H. M. Swartz was retained for the benefit and protection of Charles E. Smith alone, and that the release of said lien dated the 27th day of March, 1906, was a complete satisfaction and discharge of said lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b957-8\">\u201c6. The court instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence that the widow of Jas. Mundy united with his executors in a deed to J. L. Garland conveying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>the mill property to him in compliance with the contract of sale and the said Garland was shown snch a deed and advised that it would be delivered to him upon compliance by him with his contract of purchase, then any objections the said Garland could make to the title on account of the right of the widow to select the mill property under the will or to renounce the will were thereby removed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b958-5\"><em>\u201c7. </em>The court instructs the jury that the executors of James Mundy had the right to bid on the property when sold under the terms of the contract of April 4, 1910, for the protection of the estate of James Mundy, and the fact that at the sale made on May 14, 1910, the property was purchased by O. T. Mundy for the benefit of said executors, does not invalidate the sale or of itself relieve the defendants from the obligations they assumed under the terms of said contract of April 4, 1910.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b958-6\">\u201c8. The court instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence that at the time the contract of sale in controversy in this case was entered into the executors of James Mundy were possessed of a complete equitable title to the property they contracted to sell J. L. Garland, and had authority to sell the same, then the fact that objections to the title or encumbrances thereon, which could be removed, existed, does not invalidate the contract of sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b958-7\">\u201cThe jury are further instructed that if such objections to the title or such encumbrances existed which the said J. L. Garland desired to have removed before completing his purchase, it was his duty to notify the executors of the defects in the title which he desired to have removed, and give them a reasonable time to remove the same. ' \u201d !\u00a11</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b958-8\">\u201c9. The court instructs the jury that it is for the jury to determine in view of all the circumstances sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>rounding the contracts entered into between the parties to this suit, and the dealings and negotiations of the parties which took place after the said contracts were entered into, whose acts, conduct or default in reality prevented the sale from being completed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b959-5\">\u201c10. If the jury believe from the evidence that at the time the contracts of sale were entered into it was under-' stood and agreed between the parties that the title to be conveyed to J. L. Garland should be free from substantial defects and that such steps would be taken by the' executors as might be necessary to convey such a title-to J. L. Garland, then the said Garland is not relieved from performing the contract of April 4, 1910, by the existence of any defects in the title which he had not pointed out to the executors and given them a reasonable time in which to remove the same, prior to the time that he demanded a deed and declined to be further bound by the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b959-6\">\u201c11. If the jury believe from the evidence that on account of the inability of J. L. Garland to raise the money to comply with his contract of purchase, that negotiations took place between him and the executors with a view of agreeing upon terms of payment different from the terms fixed by the written contract, then the executors are not bound to put themselves in a position to comply with their contract while said negotiations were going on, or until said Garland either notified them that he was in a position to comply by paying all cash or an agreement Was reached as to the terms of payment different from the terms fixed by the contract, and the executors were then entitled to a reasonable time after such notice or after such agreement was reached in which to put themselves in a position to comply, and if said Garland offered to comply before such notice had been given or such agreement had been reached 'and the lapse of such r\u00e9a<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>sonable time thereafter and thereupon repudiated his contract of purchase and declined to be further bound by it, then his said offer to comply did not relieve the defendants from the obligations imposed on them by the contract of April 4,1910.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b960-5\">\u201c12. If the jury believe from the evidence that the defect in the title to the property purchased by J. L. Garland on account of the fact that the one-third interest which was conveyed by Eogers\u2019 executors to T. J. Smith was not vested in James Mundy\u2019s executors, was not known to J. L. Garland prior to the sale on the 14th of May, 1910, then the said Garland cannot rely on that defect as an excuse for his failure to comply with his contract of purchase and it does not relieve the defendants from the liability they assumed under the contract of April 4, 1910, to make up any deficiency in the purchase price.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b960-6\">\u201c13. If the jury believe from the evidence that the existence of the lien in favor of the Eogers estate was known to J. L. Garland when the contract of purchase was entered into, and that negotiations took place with a view to Garland\u2019s assumption of said lien as a part of his purchase money, and that the understanding between him and the plaintiffs was that when Garland was ready to comply said lien would either be assumed by him or paid off by the executors as Garland might elect, then the failure of the plaintiffs to pay off said lien prior to April 20, <em>1910, </em>does not excuse Garland\u2019s failure to comply with his contract of purchase, and does not relieve the defendants from liability under the contract of April 4, 1910.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b960-7\">The court gave instructions numbered 2, 4, 6, 7,11 and 13, and refused to give the others; and upon motion of the defendants instructed the juay as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b960-8\">\u201c1. That the conveyance J. L. Garland was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>to receive was a conveyance of a perfect title, free from encumbrances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b961-5\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That the deed from Rogers\u2019 exors. to T. J. Smith, C. E. Smith and C. B. Markham conveyed to each of the said parties one-third of the Pattonsburg Mill property; that the deed from C. B. Markham to T. J. Smith and C. E. Smith conveyed his share to these parties jointly, so that T. J. Smith and O. E. Smith each owned one-half of the said property. And the court further instructs the jury that the deed from T. J. Smith and wife to H. M. Swartz, dated March 18, 1904, only conveyed to H. M. Swartz the one-sixth interest that had been conveyed to T. J. Smith by O. B. Markham, which was one-half of the one-third interest that had been conveyed to O. B. Markham by Rogers\u2019 executors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b961-6\">\u201c3. That if the jury believe from the evidence that James Mundy acquired this property from H. M. Swartz; that H. M. Swartz acquired the property from T. J. Smith and O. E. Smith; that in the deed of conveyance to H. M. Swartz he assumed the payment of all the debts for which C. E. Smith was liable as a member of the \u25a0firm of T. J. Smith &amp; Company, and that a lien was expressly reserved on the property to secure the payment of the said debts; that there were debts of said firm at the date of said deed on November 19, 1903, for which C. E. Smith was liable; then it was incumbent on the plaintiff to show, on or before May 14, 1910, that said debts had been paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b961-7\">\u201c4. That if the jury believe from the evidence that there were debts of the firm of T. J. Smith <em>&amp; </em>Company, for which C. E. Smith was liable at the date of that deed on November 19, 1903, then the deed of March 27, 1906, from C. E.

The court instructs the jury that the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>did not have on May 14, 1910, the day agreed upon for the compliance of the contract of sale, a perfect legal title to the property, which was the kind of title they had contracted to give, and J.

Markham conveyed to each of the said parties one-third of the Pattonsburg Mill property; that the deed from O. B. Markham to T. J. Smith and C. E. Smith conveyed his share to them jointly; that is, to each a one-sixth of the said property; that the deed from T. J. Smith and wife to H. M. Swartz, dated March 18, 1904, only conveyed to H. M. S:wartz the one-sixth interest in this property, which had been conveyed to T. J. Smi|th by C. B. Markham, and that T. J. Smith was still the owner of the one-third interest that had been conveyed to him by Rogers\u2019 executors so far as the record disclosed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b962-6\"><em>\u201c7. </em>The court further instructs the jury that the defendants <em>was </em>entitled to receive from the plaintiffs a perfect legal title to the property under the contracts of April 2 and April 4, 1910, and if they believe from the evidence that the records of Botetourt county showed, on May 14,1910, that T. J. Smith was the owner of a one-third interest in this property, then J. L. Garland was not required to accept the conveyance tendered bim by plaintiffs or to take and pay for the said property, and that he had the right to refuse to comply with said contracts of April 2 and April 4,1910, and is not liable to the plaintiffs for the deficiency in the price obtained for the said property at the sale of May 14, 1910, under the contract price of $9,500.00 as provided in the contract of April 4, 1910.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b963-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number><em>Hall, Woods \u00e9 Coxe, C.

The plaintiffs insist that to give the defendants the relief sought by their pleas of set off a rescission of the contract relied on was required, and that such rescission cannot be had in a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">It is well settled that a plea under that statute is not available as a defense to a bond for the purchase price of real estate, if the defense is such as to require a rescission of the contract and a reinvestment of the vendor with the title to the property. <em>Mangus </em>v. <em>McClelland, </em>93 Va. 786, 22 S. E. 364; <em>Tyson </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>96 Va. 636, 32 S. E. 42; 4 Minor\u2019s Inst. 796. The defenses set up in the special pleas filed in this case do not involve the rescission of the contract sued on, or a reinvestment of the title in the vendors. On the contrary, the vendee never acquired title to the property. The only relief, if any, which either party can have in this proceeding is for the others\u2019 failure to keep and perform the agreement sued on, and such relief does not depend upon its rescission.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">As the assignments of error based upon the action of the court in overruling the other objections to the special pleas involve largely the same questions r\u00e1ised by the assignments of error to the court\u2019s action in giving and refusing instructions and in rejecting evidence, the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>tions themselves will be considered without specific reference to the order, or the manner, in which they were raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">The defendants insist that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover upon the contract sued on because when it was entered into they did not have the right to sell the property contracted to be sold; that they did not have title to it and that there were encumbrances upon it, so that they were then unable to make such a conveyance as they contracted to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">It is true that a vendor, in order to recover for the breach of a contract by the vendee, must himself be able to keep and perform the contract on his part; but as we understand the rule it is not necessary for him, in order to maintain an action for such breach, to be able to convey such title as he contracts to convey at the time he enters into the contract, but he must be able to do so when he is required by the terms of the contract to perform on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">The doctrine on this subject is thus stated in 39 Cyc. 1983, and is sustained by the decisions: \u201cIt follows from the general rule above stated that the vendor, in order to recover for a breach by the purchaser of the contract of purchase, must have been able to convey a good title, or such as would comply with the requirements of the contract; but it is not necessary that he should have good title at the time of the contract, but only that he should be able to convey a good title at the time of performance.\u201d See also <em>Daniel </em>v. <em>Leitch, </em>13 Gratt. (54 Va.) 196, 213; <em>Goddin </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>14 Gratt, (55 Va.) 102; <em>Conover </em>v. <em>Tindall, </em>20 N. J. L. 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">It appeared that between the 4th of April, 1910, the time when the parties entered into the contract sued on, and the 14th of May following, during which the defendant, Garland, had the privilege of becoming a purchaser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>of the land, he made what was, or was intended to he, a tender of the amount required of him by that agreement in order to become the purchaser thereof, and demanded the immediate delivery of a deed conveying the property to him. This being the first notice to the executors that the defendant, Garland, intended to exercise his privilege or option and become the purchaser of the land, they were unable to comply with the demand of the said defendant for the immediate delivery of the deed. This tender by the said defendant, and the failure of the plaintiffs to deliver the deed at that time, the defendants claimed released them from all liability under the agreement sued on. This contention the court properly overruled by giving instruction No. 4 asked for by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">It was further contended on the part of the defendants that the plaintiffs were not able at any time between April 4 and May 14, following, to convey the property free from encumbrance, or to convey good title to it, as they only had legal title to a two-thirds undivided interest therein, and were therefore not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">The court properly told the jury that the defendant, J. L. Garland was entitled under his contract to a conveyance of a good title free from encumbrance. See <em>Goddin </em>v. <em>Vaughan, supra, </em>102, 117; <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>1 Va. Dec. 361. It further told them that the fact that they had good title must appear from the records of the office in which title papers are registered, or recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">The contract in this case did not require a perfect record title. Unless the contract does so require, the purchaser is not as a rule entitled to demand such title if the title is in fact good. If he could, the vendor who had acquired a perfect title by adversary possession, or under an unrecorded deed could not enforce the provisions of his contract, either at law or in equity, if the purchaser saw fit to resist on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Prof. Page in his article on Vendor and Purchaser, 39 Cyc. at page 1885, says, in discussing the defenses that may be made by a vendee: \u201cIn any case the defect of title must be such as to justify the purchaser in refusing to accept it; and if the contract does not require a perfect record title, the purchaser cannot justify a refusal to perform his part of the contract, that the title if, in fact, good, was not a perfect record title, nor is it any defense that the purchaser in refusing to accept a conveyance acted in good faith and upon the advice of counsel that the vendor\u2019s title was defective, if in fact such advice was erroneous.\u201d See also 1 Warville on Vendors, pp. 309-311; 26 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. L. (2nd ed.) 106-7, and cases cited in each; also <em>Cowdery </em>v. <em>Greenlee, </em>126 Ga. 786, 55 S. E. 918, 919-20, 8 L. R. A. (N. S.) 137; Maupin on Marketable Titles, secs. 6 and 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">To show that they had good title to the one-third undivided interest which the records did not show that their testator owned, they tendered an unrecorded deed, properly acknowledged for recordation, which showed in fact that said interest had been conveyed to and was owned by Swartz when he conveyed the property to the plaintiffs\u2019 testator, thus clothing him with the whole title. The court refused to permit the deed to go to the jury, upon the ground that it had not been recorded and that the defendants had no knowledge or notice of the existence of the deed on or before May 14, 1910, and instructed the jury that the plaintiffs did not have on May 14, 1910, the day agreed upon for the performance of the contract, a perfect legal title to the property; and that Mr. Garland \u201cwas not required to accept the title they had or offered, or to take the property, and the plaintiffs had no right to advertise and sell the property at his risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">It seems to be conceded (if not, it clearly appears) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>neither the executors nor Mr. Garland actually knew of the existence of the deed, or of the apparent defect in the title as shown by the records, nor was such fact known until some months after this proceeding was instituted. There is evidence tending to show that the deed which the executors were having signed to deliver to Mr. Garland, and also an abstract of title furnished to the executors by their counsel, which showed that it appeared from the records that there were certain encumbrances on the land, which will hereinafter be adverted to, were shown to Mr. Garland prior to the 19th of April, 1910, when he claims that he elected to acquire the property under the agreement sued on, tendered the consideration to be paid and demanded an immediate delivery of the deed, and that he made no objection to the title at either time, but declared the deal off because the executors could not make an immediate delivery of the deed; that he afterwards consulted counsel, who advised him that the executors could not make a deed, and not to accept their title. The objections made were upon other grounds, and if none of those grounds were valid and such as prevented the executors from conveying a good title free from encumbrances, the question is can the defendants defeat a recovery upon the ground that the record did not show that' the plaintiffs had a good title, when in fact they did, and when such apparent defect in the title was not actually known to either party, and did not in any way affect their action!</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">The court is of opinion that they cannot, and that the circuit court erred in not permitting the said deed to go to the jury. If the deed had been admitted in evidence, as it should have been, of course the court could not have given the defendants \u2019 instructions numbered five, six and seven, since they are based upon the same erroneous view of the law, viz: that for the purposes of this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>the plaintiff could not be regarded as having good title unless that fact appeared of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">The court is further of opinion that the construction placed upon the conveyances mentioned in instructions numbered two, three and four was correct, and that as to the incumbrance mentioned in instructions numbered three and four, the court properly told the jury that the burden was upon the plaintiffs to show that such encumbrance had been satisfied or released before the 14th of May, 1910, and that the release deed mentiond in instruction No. 4 did not show that the debt of the lien creditors secured by the deed of November 19, 1903, had been released.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 instruction No. 5, in which the court was asked to tell the jury that said release deed was a complete satisfaction of the said debts, was erroneous and properly refused by the court. There was other evidence tending to show that the said debts had been satisfied. Whether or not they had was a question for the jury upon all the evidence in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">In order to show that the sale of May 14 had been properly advertised, the plaintiffs offered to prove that the property sold for a less price in November following at a public sale largely advertised than it did on May 14. Whether the other conditions were the same or similar when the two sales were made does not appear. Unless they were it is clear that such evidence was not admissible and was propei'ly excluded. Buit even if it had been admissible, no prejudice resulted to the plaintiffs, since the court, by instruction No. 2, offered by them, properly instructed the jury, in effect, that the only question as to the sufficiency of the advertisement was the good faith of the plaintiffs in selecting the method in which it was m\u00e1de.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">The court is further of opinion that the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>instruction No. 1 correctly stated the law, and while it might have been better, perhaps, to have declared what acts or defaults on the part of the plaintiffs would have prevented the defendants from completing their purchase, its language could not have misled the jury, and the court erred in refusing to give it.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">As the judgment will have to be reversed for reasons hereinbefore stated, the verdict set aside and the cause remanded for a new trial in which the evidence will not be the same, sufficient has been said without discussing the other assignments of error to indicate the general principles of law which should govern the court upon another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">The court is of opinion to reverse the judgment, set aside the verdict, and remand the cause for a new trial to be had not in conflict with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
