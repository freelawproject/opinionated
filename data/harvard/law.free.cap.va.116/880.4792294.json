The assured will take a complete itemized inventory of stock on hand at least once in each calendar year, and unless such inventory has been taken within twelve calendar months prior to the date of this policy one shall be taken in detail within thirty days of issuance of this policy, or this policy shall be null and void from such date, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-6\">\u201c2nd. The assured will keep a set of books- which shall clearly and plainly present a complete record of the business transacted, including all purchases, sales and shipments, both for cash and credit, from the date of inventory, as provided for in the first section of this clause, and during the continuance of this policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Farris continued his business as a merchant until January 20, 1912, when the building wherein his stock of goods was situate was destroyed by fire and none of the goods of Farris therein were saved. The insured, Farris, it appears, was away at the time of the fire, but returned the next morning to Graham and immediately notified the agent of the insurance company of his loss. After an investigation and attempt to adjust the insured\u2019s loss, the insurance company notified him that there was no liability upon the company, under the policy he held and offered to return the premium of $37.00- paid thereon when the policy was issued, which Farris refused to accept; whereupon, this suit was instituted by Farris on the policy, and,at the trial thereof the defendant insurance company stated its grounds of defense, among them being the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>\u201c3rd. - The plaintiff did not take, preserve or produce an inventory of the stock of goods, nor did lie keep and preserve a set of books as provided for in the policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">This is the only ground of defense that is necessary to be considered, as we view the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">The defendant offered no evidence at the' trial, but after the plaintiff had introduced his evidence demurred thereto, in which demurrer the plaintiff joined. \"Whereupon, the jury assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages at $1,000, the full amount of the policy, and the court overruled the demurrer to the evidence and entered its judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of damages ascertained by the jury\u2019s verdict, to which judgment this writ of error was awarded the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Following the provisions in the policy sued on, quoted above, are further provisions which required the insured to produce the books, inventory, etc., stipulated for in his contract .with the insurer, evidenced by his policy, but at the trial of this cause in the court below the plaintiff made no pretense that he had complied with the \u201ciron safe clause\u201d of the policy or made any effort to do so, or offered any excuse for'not complying with it. On cross-examination as a witness in his own behalf he was asked: \u201cYou spoke in your examination in chief of having kept books showing your cash and credit sales. You had an inventory did you? A. No, sir, I had no inventory at all.\u201d His counsel in the argument before this court, while not taking issue with the contention of counsel for the defendant as to what an inventory is or should be, urges the view that \u201cunder the clauses'of the policy, the plaintiff had one year\u2019s time from the date of the issue of the policy in which to take his inventory.\u201d In other words, this contention is that as one year\u2019s time from the date of issuance of the policy had not expired when the loss occurred, plaintiff was in no default in not h\u00e1ving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>taken an inventory of his stock of goods as required by the terms of his policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">\u25a0 The requirement of the contract between the parties was that the insured \u201cshall take a complete inventory of stock on hand at least once in each calendar year, and unless such inventory has been taken within twelve calendar months prior to the date of this policy one shall be taken in detail within thirty days of issuance of this policy, or this policy shall be null and void from such date, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">\u201cIn order to expedite the proof of loss and to verify the honesty of the claim of loss, provisions are customarily inserted in policies upon stocks in trade requiring the insured to take an inventory at frequent intervals, to keep regular books, and to reserve all papers in an iron or fire-proof safe. These provisions are uniformly upheld as promissory warranties to be strictly performed to entitle the insured to recover for a loss.\u201d 19 Cyc. 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">The same authority, at p. 762, states the rule of construction to be that where the policy fixes the period of time within which the insured is to take an inventory, he has the period mentioned in which to perform this condition contained in the policy. \u201cThe inventory intended by the policy is a \u2018detailed and itemized enumeration of the articles composing the stock with the value of each.-\u2019 Consequently, an invoice of goods purchased is not a compliance with the condition requiring an inventory, nor is a mere summary of the condition of the goods sufficient. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">The policy sued on here provides that if an inventory has not been taken within twelve months prior to the date of the policy, one must be taken within thirty days of the issuance of the policy, and this court in considering this same provision in an insurance policy in <em>Homestead Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ison, </em>110 Va. 18, 65 S. E. 463, made it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>plain that the inventory must be made within thirty days of the policy, there having been no inventory of the stock of goods taken by the insured within twelve months prior to the date of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">It has been repeatedly said by this court, and by the courts in other jurisdictions, that the inventory is fair to both the insurer and the insured, and that the insurance company has the right to insist on a compliance with this provision of the policy, or at least a substantial compliance therewith. The inventory is the foundation of the system of bookkeeping required by the policy contract. \u201cThe bookkeeping had to begin only from the date of the inventory which was required to be taken . . . \u201d <em>Homestead Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ison, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">It is seriously contended for the plaintiff in this case that by reason of the fact that he started business on August 11, 1911, taking out the policy of insurance he sues on September 19,1911, and the fire, totally destroying his stock of goods which were thus insured, occurred on the morning of January 20, 1912, just four months after his policy was issued, and he had furnished the insurance company certain books kept by him, also duplicate bills of purchases he had made, which had been examined by the insurance company\u2019s agents, who had three times personally examined bim (the insured), he had- substantially complied with the provisions of the \u201ciron safe clause\u201d in his policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">This contention is without merit. It is perhaps true that in the case of a store opening with an entirely new stock of goods on or about the date of the issuance of the policy, the invoices of the first lot of goods put into it, giving quantities thereof by items, with the cost price, if preserved and kept for production upon the demand of the insurer as and for an inventory, would constitute such a list, and the insured would be considered as hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>ing substantially complied with so much of the policy as required the taking of an inventory; but that, as is readily to be observed from the facts above stated, is not this case. The plaintiff was not only under contract obligation to the defendant to take, preserve and produce \u00e1 complete inventory, but sueh a set of books as would clearly and plainly present a complete record of the business he transacted, and was also to produce, when required, all of the invoices and other vouchers showing the articles he purchased and the prices paid or to be paid for same. He did not pretend to keep a set of books, such as are contemplated and stipulated for in his policy contract, but after the fire that destroyed bis stock of goods, he produced- certain statements which he claimed were invoices and served as an explanation and verifica-tion of the books he had, in view of the fact that he had just opened up and begun his business within less than forty-five days prior to the issuing and delivery of his policy; and, furthermore, that these invoices of his purchases were entitled to the force and effect of an inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Not only are the authorities uniform in holding that \u201cinvoices\u201d cannot be substituted for \u201cinventories,\u201d but the statements which the plaintiff in this case called invoices and filed as evidence over the objection of the defendant are in fact, mere statements showing nothing but dates and figures, and were put into the case, as it would seem, without any sort of order, some of them in Hebrew or Syrian language, besides being in such a confused state that neither the jury nor anyone else could have understood their meaning. Most of them do not show to whom the goods were billed, but merely the name of the consignor and the amount of the bill, and in a number of others the goods do not even appear to have been sold to the plaintiff, Joseph Farris, but to H. Farris &amp; Bro. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>Gus, Farris, or to Graham Bargain House. The invoices which show, with reasonable clearness, that the sale of the goods was to the plaintiff in several instances, and the amount of the purchases, do not tell the kind or character or quantity of the goods\u2014in fact, give no idea as to what was the character of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">The set of books required to be kept and produced by the \u201ciron safe clause\u201d of a fire insurance policy must show \u201call purchases, sales and shipments, both for cash and credit. It is a set of books that must be kept while the events they propose to cover are transpiring, the policy not providing for a set of books made from memory after the fire.\u201d <em>Phoenix Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>110 Va. 435, 66 S. E. 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">In that case the opinion cites with approval <em>Pellican Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilkerson, </em>53 Ark. 353, 13 S. W. 1103, for the proposition that \u201cif the books do not show data necessary to enable the insurers to test the accuracy of the accounts delivered to them, or afford satisfactory idea of the amount of goods on hand and destroyed by fire, the insured cannot recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The opinion of this court in <em>Vaughan </em>v. <em>Va. F. &amp; M. Ins. Co., </em>102 Va. 541, 46 S. E. 692, says: \u201cFor nothing is better settled than that the assured must observe in dealing with the insurer, the utmost good faith, without which there can be no recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">The \u201ciron safe clause\u201d has been over and over again dealt with and approved in the decisions of this court as fair both to the insurer and the insured, and it has been held that the former has the right to insist on a compliance with this provision of the policy, for the reason that the insured contracted to do so, and that the conditions are reasonable and if the assured were not required to keep and perform these conditions it would open wide the door for the perpetration of frauds and the grossest im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>position npon insurers.\u201d <em>Phoenix Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sherman, supra; Houff </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>110 Va. 585, 66 S. E. 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">While the \u201ciron safe clause\u201d of an insurance policy, requiring the keeping and production by the insured of a set of books providing a means for ascertaining with reasonable certainty, in case of loss, what goods were lost, requires only a reasonable compliance with the terms of the contract, the insured must show a substantial compliance with the terms of his contract in order to entitle him to recover. <em>Scottish U. &amp; Natl. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Va. Shirt Co., </em>113 Va. 353, 74 S. E. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">. The fact that the agent of the insurer had gone into the insured\u2019s place of business, seemed well pleased with the situation and agreed to allow additional concurrent insurance, is entitled to little if any probative force as bearing upon the question, whether or not there had been a substantial compliance on the part of the insured with the conditions of the \u201ciron safe clause\u201d of his policy, and if not whether the insurer had waived the benefit of that clause in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">We have not undertaken to review the evidence in detail for the reason that to do so would serve no other purpose than uselessly to prolong this opinion. The plaintiff admits that he \u201chad no inventory at all,\u201d nor did he comply with the terms of the \u201ciron safe clause\u201d of his policy with respect to the set of books he agreed to keep, but relies solely upon certain statements produced by him after his loss, together with attempted explanations thereof, from which it was a matter of impossibility to form an intelligent conclusion as to what business he had transacted or what stock of goods was in the store and destroyed by the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">From an examination of the whole evidence it is clear that the jury would not have been warranted in finding that there had been even a substantial compli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>anee on the part of the plaintiff with the terms of his policy, either with respect to the inventory of the stock of goods required or the set of books stipulated for, showing a complete record of the business transacted by him; therefore, we are of opinion that the judgment of the circuit court complained of should be reversed, the demurrer to the evidence sustained, and judgment entered here for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
