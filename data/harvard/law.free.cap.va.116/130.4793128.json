Executors and <em>Administrators\u2014Defense of Suit\u2014Coxmsel </em>Fees.\u2014 The creditors and distributees of a decedent, as well as his personal representative, have the right to make defense io claims asserted against the decedent\u2019s estate, and if they fail to do so, it is the plain duty of the personal representative to make defense if he has good reason to believe that a' claim asserted is not a just or legal demand against his decedent\u2019s estate, and he has the right to employ counsel and pay him out of the estate reasonable fees for his services.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b158-11\">2.

The personal representative may employ counsel and pay him reasonable fees out of the estate to defend such claim, and if the claimant\u2019s share of the estate as distributee thereof is thereby lessened to that extent, he has no cause of complaint, as the services were rendered to the estate of the decedent and are to be first paid, no matter who is entitled to the residue, whether creditors or distributees.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b158-15\">4.

M. Pattie, sheriff of Madison county and as such administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of R. F..Lake, deceased, to his counsel had been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">The fee in question was excepted to by the appellant as administrator of Mrs. R. V. Lake, deceased, upon three grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\u201cFirst: Because no part of said fee should be charged against the distributive share of Ann Y. Lake, but all should be charged against the distributive share of the heirs at law of R. P. Lake;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">\u201cSecond: Because so far as the exceptor is concerned he received no benefit from said services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u201cThird: Because.the fee is exorbitant and excessive under all the circumstances of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">This suit, in which the said fee was allowed, was brought by the appellant as administrator of Mrs. Ann Y. Lake, deceased, for the purpose of asserting debts claimed to be due his decedent\u2019s estate from the estate of her late husband, R. P. Lake, deceased; to subject a fund arising from the sale of an interest in certain real estate conveyed by her husband to Rixey, trustee, to secure certain creditors, including his liabilities to his wife, Mrs. Ann Y. Lake, for moneys loaned and surety-ship undertaken by her; and if the moneys and choses in action, &amp;c., in the hands of Rixey, trustee, were not sufficient for that purpose, to subject the other assets of her husband\u2019s estate to their payment. The bill further asked that in the event the property in the hands of Rixey, trustee, was more than sufficient to pay the liens thereon under the deed of trust to him, the surplus of that fund should be distributed to those entitled thereto, and to that end that all the creditors of R. P. Lake\u2019s estate be convened, the assets of his estate marshalled and all of his debts paid; that all proper accounts be taken, an adequate attorney\u2019s fee to the appellant\u2019s counsel for instituting and conducting the suit be allowed, and for general relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The creditors, heirs at law and distributees of R. P. Lake, deceased, known and unknown, were made parties to the suit. Process was served upon the resident defendants, viz., Pattie, administrator of R. P. Lake, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Rixey, trustee, and Bickers, a creditor, and an order of publication made against all the other numerous defendants, known and unknown, as non-residents. So far- as the record before this court shows, which is incomplete, none of the defendants appeared except Pattie, administrator of R. P. Lake, who employed counsel and made defense to the claim asserted as creditor by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Some nine months after \u2018the suit was brought and before any depositions had been taken on either side, a compromise or settlement was effected between the appellant as administrator of Mrs. Lake and Pattie as administrator of R. P. Lake, and a consent decree entered, by which it was provided that the administrator of Mrs. Lake should receive from Rixey, trustee, out of the funds in his hands, the sum of $13,161.32, in full settlement of all his decedent\u2019s claims against her husband\u2019s estate, except as distributee thereof, and that the residue of the fund in the ' hands of Rixey, trustee, should be paid Pattie, administrator of R. P, Lake. Out of the sum so received by Pattie, administrator, he was required to pay off and discharge a bond for $5,000 executed by his decedent and Mrs. Lake, and secured on the latter\u2019s real estate and payable to Bickers; to pay the costs of administration, including the costs of this suit, any debts properly established against the estate of R. P. Lake, and to distribute the residue among those entitled thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The money and choses in action in the hands of Rixey, trustee, aggregated about $29,000. Out of this sum the appellant received, as before stated, $13,161.32, and his decedent\u2019s estate was protected against the $5,000 debt for which it was liable by requiring the administrator to pay it out of the funds which he received from Rixey, trustee, thus leaving in his hands from that source <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>something over $10,000. The only defense to the large claim, aggregating, principal and interest, to. between $50,000 and $60,000, asserted by Mrs. Lake\u2019s administrator against her husband\u2019s estate was made by his administrator, Pattie, notwithstanding the fact that the creditors and distributees of E. P. Lake were parties to the suit and had the right as well as his personal representative to make defense, 18 Cyc. 574, 575. Since none of them appeared and made defense, it was the plain duty of his personal representative to make defense to the claim asserted by the appellant if he had good reason to believe that it was not a just or legal demand against his decedent\u2019s estate. <em>Tunstall </em>v. <em>Pollard, </em>11 Leigh (38 Va.) 1; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Pattie, </em>81 Va. 654, 662-3; 18 Cyc. 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The personal representative of a decedent\u2019s estate is no mere stakeholder, as the appellant insists, but he is the legal owner for the time being of the personal estate of which the decedent died seized and possessed, 18 Cyc. 206-7. The fact that a creditor who asserts a claim against a decedent\u2019s estate and brings a suit to enforce it is also a distributee does not render it any the less the duty of the decedent\u2019s personal representative to make defense than if such creditor was not a distributee.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The compromise settlement and consent decree by which the claim asserted was reduced in amount by sixty to seventy <em>per cent, </em>show that the administrator of E. P. Lake properly defended the suit, and that he would have been derelict in his duty if he had not done so. The consent decree not only shows this, but it also shows that the appellant and the court entering the decree recognized the fact that the personal representative of E. P. Lake, as such, had authority, if acting in good faith (and his good faith is not questioned) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>bind both creditors and distributees by Ms act. <em>Boyd\u2019s Sureties </em>v. <em>Oglesby, </em>23 Gratt. (64 Va.) 686-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Tbe defense made by tbe personal representative of E. P. Lake being for tbe benefit of tbe estate as sucb, be was entitled, out of tbe assets of tbe estate in Ms bands, or wbicb came into bis bands, to pay tbe legitimate costs, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for making sucb defense before either creditors or distributees were entitled to receive anything. It is no doubt true, as stated in tbe appellant\u2019s exception No. 2 that be received no benefit from tbe legal services of tbe counsel who were paid tbe fee to tbe allowance of wbicb be excepts. Tbe fee allowed was for legal services beneficial to tbe debtor\u2019s estate, for just in tbe .proportion that those services lessened tbe appellant\u2019s recovery, in tbe same proportion it benefited the debtor\u2019s estate. It was payable and-was paid out of tbe debtor\u2019s estate wbicb it benefited.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Tbe appellant\u2019s distributive interest in E. P. Lake\u2019s estate was subject to tbe payment of all legitimate charges for admimstering it, including costs and counsel fees properly incurred. They were first to be paid, no matter who was entitled to tbe residue, whether creditors or distributees. Tbe court is of opinion, therefore, that tbe circuit court did not err in overruling tbe appellant\u2019s exceptions Nos. 1 and 2 to tbe commissioner\u2019s report, and that Pattie, administrator, is entitled to a credit in tbe settlement of bis accounts with bis decedent\u2019s estate for a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for services rendered in defending bis decedent\u2019s estate against appellant\u2019s demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">This brings us to a consideration of appellant\u2019s exception No. 3, viz., that tbe fee allowed, $3,500, \u201cis exorbitant and excessive under all tbe circumstances of tbe case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>The record before us is incomplete. Neither the answer filed in the cause by Pattie, administrator, nor the amended answer referred to in the deposition of one of his counsel as haying been prepared, is before us. The only witnesses who testify in the case as to the value of the services rendered and the reasonableness of the fee paid and excepted to are the two litigants and their counsel. While they are all gentlemen of the highest character, they differ so widely as to both these matters that the court does not feel that it could safely pass upon the question involved upon an incomplete record and such conflicting evidence. The court is therefore of opinion to remand the cause to the circuit court with direction to ascertain, by reference to one of its commissioners for further proof, or otherwise, as it may deem best, what would be a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for the services rendered by the counsel of Pattie, administrator, for his decedent\u2019s estate in this case; and with the further direction that in ascertaining the reasonableness of said fee it is not to be governed absolutely by the opinion of attorneys, the charge made by counsel or the contract of employment, but should exercise its own discretion and fix the amount of the fee with reference to the labor performed, the skill and care required and the advantages gained to the decedent\u2019s estate by the services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
