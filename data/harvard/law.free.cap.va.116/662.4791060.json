Numerous errors are assigned, but in the view we take of the case only one of them need be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Prior to the appointment of commissioners to ascertain the compensation to which the defendants were entitled for the land sought to be taken, and the damages to the residue of the tract, the defendants filed several pleas, among them one denying all the allegations of the petition and notice, and called for proof thereof. This denial placed upon the plaintiff company the burden of showing that it was entitled to exercise the right of eminent domain and to condemn the defendants\u2019 land for its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The plaintiff company was chartered by the General Assembly and authorized to construct and operate a railroad from Narrows, a point on the Norfolk and Western Railway in Giles county, and running in a westerly direction through the counties of Giles and Bland, and from thence to the Tennessee or Kentucky State line. Acts of Assembly, 1900, ch. 59, p. 65, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Upon the issues raised by the said pleas, the only evidence introduced by the railway company was that of Mr. Bastian, the manager and secretary of the railroad company. After stating that he had been performing all the duties of manager since 1904, he testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">\u201cQuestion by attorney for plaintiff railroad company:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-10\">\u201cQ. Please state if you are the Mr. P. E. Bastian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>referred to in these proceedings and how long you have been manager of the said New River, Holston and Western Railroad Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">\u201cA. I am; since 1904, practically since 1900.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">\u201cQ. Since that time, when it has become necessary to purchase land or to negotiate for land for right 'of way by the railroad, who has made these purchases and negotiation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">\u201cA. I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">\u201cQ. What effort, if any, did you make on behalf of the company to purchase this land set forth in the record of this ease from Mr. Honaker or either or both of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">\u201cA. After the road was located through the land on two or three occasions I went to see Mr. Honaker and asked him to name us a price for right-of-way and he put me off by telling me he would have to see his partner Mr. Kroll. \u2022 I finally went to Tazewell and saw Mr. Kroll myself and he told me he did not want to name a price, that he preferred to consult with Mr. Honaker. I arranged for Mr. Kroll and Mr. Honaker to meet at Rocky Cap. Mr. Kroll went there and came back and reported to me that he was unable to make any arrangement with Mr. Honaker and told nie that he had left the matter entirely in Mr. Honaker\u2019s hands. Several days after that I saw Mr. Honaker and he told me that he would take $5000.00 for the right-of-way, that of course we could put commissioners on the land and if they did not give him what he thought was right he could take the case to a higher court, because Mr. Kroll was a non-resident of the State. I shook my head, did not argue the matter, because I considered the matter beyond my reach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">\u201cQ. Please state what you mean when you stated that you considered the price beyond your reach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-10\">\u201cA. I considered the price entirely too high for the land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>\u201cQ. Who went with you to see Mi*. Kroll?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-4\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Mr. Farrier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">\u201cQ. Did you have a map or plat of the land with you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">\u201cQ. Did Kroll ever name you a price?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">\u201cA. He never named any price for the right of way hut named a price of $2500.00 for his interest for the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">\u201cQ. You say that you were elected manager of the road. W7as there any other manager?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>There was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-11\">\u201cQ. Has any, one except yourself since 1904 been performing any of the duties of manager?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-12\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-13\">\u201c Q. \u2022 I will be glad if you will state, since these proceedings were instituted or prosecuted, what officers of the said railroad company you. have reported to, or communicated with, concerning the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-14\">\u201cA. Mr. D. P. Leas, our treasurer, who had been handling the affairs for our president who is sick, and Mr. S. H. McVitty, one of the directors of the road' and son of the president, who has been in a general way representing the .president along with Mr. Leas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-15\">\u201cQ. State whether or not you communicated to Mr. D. P. Leas, the treasurer, and in conversation with Mr. S. H. McVitty the progress and status of this case, and other cases and in reference to the proposed extension of said railroad?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-16\">\u201cA. I have been keeping them both informed as to the progress and they seemed pleased with the progress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-17\">\u201cQ. Please state the amount of stock owned by Leas and McVitty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-18\">\u201cA. I am not certain, but I think they own between 80 and 90 <em>per cent.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-19\">\u201cQ. When did you have the negotiations with Honaker and Kroll to which you have referred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number><em>\u201cA. </em>Some time in January, 1912, and after the line was surveyed and before these proceedings were begun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\">\u201cQ. For what purpose does your company desire the land sought to be taken in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">\u201cA. For the construction, operation and maintenance of a railroad.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">\n<em>Cross-examination.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">\u201cQ. How do you know this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Because we surveyed the line for a matter of twenty miles and located the line for proposed extension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-9\">\u201cQ. Do you know of your own knowledge that the said company, by any action of its stockholders, ever authorized any extension of its lines, or ever authorized this proceeding to be instituted to acquire this right of way through Honaker\u2019s lands, if so, how do you know it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">\u201cA. By having reported the proceedings to Mr. D. P. Leas as well as other matters pertaining to the railroad and he not making any objection I assume that my actions were proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-11\">\u201cQ. Is this all you can say in answer to my last question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-12\">\u201cA. I might add that (I) talked the matter over with Mr. S. H. McVitty, who in a general way represents the president who is sick, and he confirmed my action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-13\">\u201cQ. Is that all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>That is all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-15\">\u201cQ. Do you of your own personal knowledge know that the board of directors of the New River, Holston and Western Railroad Company ever authorized any extension of the lines of said railroad from Rocky Gap, or that said board of directors ever authorized the proceedings to be instituted to condemn the lands of Honaker and Kroll mentioned in this case, if so, how do you know it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-16\">\u201cA. Do not know of a positive fact for the reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>that occasionally the directors have meetings in Philadelphia and the minutes are in Philadelphia for safekeping.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">\u201cQ. You say that you are secretary of said railroad company; don\u2019t you as such secretary have the custody of the hooks of the company, if not, who has?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">\u201cA. I have just stated that the hooks are kept in Philadelphia for safe-keeping.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">\u201cQ. Whose business is it to write upon the hooks of the company the minutes of the stockholders\u2019 meetings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">\u201cA. Mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">\u201cQ. When did you last attend a stockholders\u2019 meeting of said company and write up the proceedings of the meeting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-9\">\u201cA. Tuesday, April 2, 1912.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-10\">\u201cQ. Where was the meeting held?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-11\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Narrows, Giles county, Virginia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-12\">\u201cQ. State when the last meeting of the stockholders of said company was held preceding the said April meeting of 1912.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-13\">\u201cA.

If Mr. Mingea advised you to go ahead and take contracts and purchase rights of way and he being a man of good reputation you expected, of course, did you not, that Mr. Mingea would put up the money to meet your said contracts, purchases did you not, and if not, why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Prom correspondence with our Philadelphia office I was lead to believe that Mr. Mingea was acting for the railroad.

Now please state what contracts you refer to in your last answer, and how do you know that they were paid for by the railroad company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">\u201cA.

Then you are unable to name any right of way on the proposed extension from Rocky G-ap which your company has paid for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-13\">\u201cA. They have not taken up any of them yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-14\">\u201cQ. Then the said railroad company has never sent you any check to pay for any right of way on the proposed extension?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-15\">\u201cA. Not as yet.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-16\">This evidence, it is claimed, was sufficient to show that the railroad company desired the defendants\u2019 lands for its purposes as a railroad, and that it had been unable to agree with the land owners for its purchase; and that if it were necessary for the stockholders or directors to authorize an extension of the railroad-and fix its loca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>tion before condemnation proceedings were commenced, in tbe absence of any plea or proof to tbe contrary it would be presumed tbat the extension bad been authorized and tbe location adopted by tbe governing body of tbe corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Tbe court is of opinion tbat tbe railroad company is in error in its contention tbat there were no pleas filed which put in issue tbe question whether or not tbe' extension of tbe road bad been authorized, or tbe survey through tbe defendants\u2019 lands adopted by tbe railroad company. Plea No. 1 denies every allegation of fact averred in tbe petition. One of its averments is that the defendants\u2019 lands are wanted for its purposes and tbat since it cannot agree with them for their purchase it has tbe right to condemn them. If tbe company bad never authorized tbe extension proposed and had not adopted tbe location made on the defendants\u2019 lands, it cannot be said tbat tbe land is wanted by the railroad company, or tbat it has tbe right to condemn it for tbe purpose for which it was chartered. There is not only no satisfactory proof tbat tbe board of directors bad authorized tbe extension of tbe road or had adopted or approved of tbe location made, but on tbe contrary tbe evidence of Mr. Bastian, tbe general manager, tbe secretary of tbe company, and one of its directors, tends very strongly to show tbat tbe board of directors acting together bad neither authorized the.extension nor adopted or fixed its location.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">It is said in 10 Cyc. 774-6, in tbe article on Corporations, edited by Judge Thompson, in discussing the mode in which directors may act, and tbe statement seems to be sustained by tbe cases: \u201cWe may settle down with confidence upon this principle, tbat in all matters involving tbe exercise of what might be termed a legislative or judicial discretion, and which tbe directors, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>cannot delegate to others, as elsewhere shown, they can bind the corporation only by acting together as a board. A majority of them cannot undertake to act in their individual names for the board itself, and no act can be done affecting the ownership of property except by a resolution of the board when regularly constituted and sitting in consultation.\u201d 3 Thomp. on Corp., 3905, 3906, 3944; Morawetz on Corp. (1st ed.), sec. 246; 1 Elliott on Railroads, secs. 255-257, 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The determination of a railroad company to extend its line would seem clearly to involve the exercise of legislative or judicial discretion, and is a matter which should be considered and passed upon by its directors, acting together as a board, especially when the proposed extension is equal in length to the line in operation. The extension ought in the first instance to be determined upon by the board of' directors as such, or if determined upon by one of -its agents, his action to be binding upon the corporation would have to be ratified by the board of directors regularly convened and sitting as such board.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The record not only does not show that the extension determined upon by the general manager was so authorized or ratified by the board of directors as such, but the most the evidence can be said to show is that when the directors or the majority of them individually were informed of the action of the manager, they did not object, and some of them approved of his action in instituting these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The cases are not agreed as to whether, where a railroad company has determined upon building or extending its line, the location made by the engineer must be authorized or ratified by the board of directors as such. See <em>Bridewell </em>v. <em>Gate City Terminal Co. </em>127 Ga. 520, 56 S. E. 625, 10 L. R. A. (N. S.) 909, and authorities cited; <em>State </em>v. <em>Proprietors of Morris Aqueduct, </em>58 N. J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Law 303, 53 Atl. 252; <em>C. &amp; O. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Deepwater Ry. Co., </em>57 W. Va. 641, 50 S. E. 890; <em>Williamsport Co. </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, &amp;c. R. Co., </em>141 Pa. 407, 21 Atl. 645, 12 L. R. A. 220; Lewis on Em. Dom. (2nd ed.), sec. 307. But we have not been cited to any authority which holds that it is not necessary for the board of directors of a railroad company to authorize, as a board, an extension of its line; or if determined upon by one of its agents, to ratify such action as a board, before it has the right to exercise the power of eminent domain in obtaining property for such extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The court is of opinion that it was not shown upon the trial of the issue raised by plea No. 1 that the railroad company had the right to condemn the lands of the defendants when these proceedings were instituted, and the trial court should, therefore, have sustained said plea and dismissed the petition. For this error its judgment must be reversed and this court will enter such order as the circuit court ought to have entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
