The order affirmed, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s decision and order denying Chen\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal and withholding of removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-19\">Chen claims the immigration judge erred in finding he failed to present credible evidence in support of his asylum application. We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision, which was designated by the Board as the final agency determination, and find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Chen was not credible. As such, Chen failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to qualify for relief from removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.13(b) (2003). In addition, he failed to qualify for withholding of removal or withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-20\">Next, Chen claims the Board erred by using the procedure set out in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) (2003). We have reviewed Chen\u2019s challenges to the Board\u2019s use of this streamlined procedure and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-21\">Accordingly, we deny Chen\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
