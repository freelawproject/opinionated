Gatheright appeals the judgment affirming the determination by the Commissioner of Social Security that he is not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. Gatheright argues that the decision of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) applied the wrong legal standard and was contrary to the evidence. In particular, Gatheright argues that the ALJ erred in denying benefits because vocational expert testimony was required and reliance on the medical-vocational guidelines was improper, and because the ALJ erred in finding his complaints of pain incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-21\">Contrary to Gatheright\u2019s contentions, we conclude that the ALJ applied the correct legal standard, and that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that the weight of the medical evidence established that Gatheright\u2019s back condition was mild and would not prevent him from performing light and sedentary work, so that he is not disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, App. 2; <em>Ripley v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 552, 555 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-22\">As the ALJ properly relied on the medical-vocational guidelines, the ALJ did not need to determine independently that jobs that Gatheright is able to perform exist in the national economy, and that no vocational expert testimony was necessary. <em>See Pate v. Heckler, 777 </em>F.2d 1023, 1025-26 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Fraga v. Bowen, </em>810 F.2d 1296, 1304-05 (5th Cir.1987). Finally, we are satisfied that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination regarding the credibility of Gatheright\u2019s complaints of pain, entitling that determination to judicial deference. <em>See Villa v. Sullivan, </em>895 F.2d 1019, 1024 (5th Cir.1990). The decision of the district court affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision is</p>\n<p id=\"b392-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
