Although <em>pro se </em>briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even <em>pro se </em>litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Guerra does not address the bases for the district court\u2019s determination that the complaint failed to state a claim, he has abandoned any challenge to the dismissal on appeal. Accordingly, this appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-20\">The district court\u2019s dismissal and this dismissal each count as one strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). While this appeal was pending, this court affirmed the dismissal of another 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit filed by Guerra that also had been dismissed by the district court for failure to state a claim. <em>See Guerra v. Thaler, </em>73 Fed.Appx. 79 (5th Cir.2003) (unpublished). The district court\u2019s dismissal in <em>Guerra v. Thaler </em>also counts as one strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 387-88. Guerra now has accumulated three strikes, and he may not proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-21\">APPEAL DISMISSED, THREE-STRIKES BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
