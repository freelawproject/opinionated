Langston seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) motion. Langston cannot appeal this order unless a circuit judge or justice issues a certif\u00edcate of appealability, and a certificate of appealability will not issue absent a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). An appellant meets this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Langston has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny Langston\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> **\u00a7We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-18\"> In his informal brief to this court, Langston requests authorization to file a second petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Having construed this informal brief as a motion for authorization, <em>see United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003), we conclude that, under the strictures of that statute, Langston is not entitled to such authorization.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
