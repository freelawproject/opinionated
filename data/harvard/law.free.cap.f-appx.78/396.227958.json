He argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his appointed counsel did not appear at his sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal despite Nelson\u2019s appeal waiver, because our review of the plea proceedings reveals that the magistrate judge did not fulfill the Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(6) (2001) requirements, and, therefore, the waiver was not knowingly and voluntarily made. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517-18 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">We further find that the record sufficiently addresses the ineffective assistance claim and, therefore, that its merits can be addressed on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Navejar, </em>963 F.2d 732, 735 (5th Cir.1992). Nelson, however, has demonstrated no prejudice suffered from appointed counsel\u2019s absence from his sentencing proceedings. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Nelson was represented by retained counsel at the proceedings, and appointed counsel\u2019s presence was unnecessary to resolve the sentencing objection at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
