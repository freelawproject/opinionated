We have reviewed the record provided by the parties and the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Ahmed challenges the negative credibility findings made by the immigration judge and affirmed by the Board. We have reviewed the immigration judge\u2019s credibility determination and find it to be supported by specific, cogent reasoning and therefore entitled to substantial deference. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). We hold that the Board properly reviewed Ahmed\u2019s appeal under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) (2003). Accordingly, we find Ahmed\u2019s failure to establish eligibility for asylum is not manifestly contrary to the law or an abuse of discretion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(b)(4)(D) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">The standard for receiving withholding of removal is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardozar-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Ahmed failed to establish entitlement to asylum, he cannot satisfy the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
