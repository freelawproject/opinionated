He also appeals from the revocation of his supervised release, which was imposed as a result of his illegal reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">Del Valle has not raised in his opening brief any error with respect to the district court\u2019s revocation of his supervised release. Accordingly, he has abandoned that issue on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">With respect to his sentence for illegal reentry, Del Valle argues that the district court erred in going beyond the statute of conviction and the charging instrument for his prior offense to determine that a 16-level increase in his offense level was warranted under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii). As Del Valle concedes, this argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Sanchez-Garcia,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where we held that a district court is not limited to the statute of conviction and charging instrument in determining whether an increase is warranted under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii). Thus, the 16-level increase to Del Valle\u2019s offense level was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-18\">Del Valle also challenges the 16-level increase in his offense level on the basis that his 2001 conviction for transporting a certain alien within the United States is not an \u201calien smuggling offense\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). He acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Solis-Campozano,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where we held that the term \u201calien smuggling offense\u201d includes the offense of transporting aliens within the United States. Thus, the 16-level increase to Del Valle\u2019s offense level was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-19\">Finally, Del Valle argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional because a prior felony conviction is an element of the offense of illegal reentry, not merely a sentence enhancement, and should have been charged in the indictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United </em>States,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but he seeks to preserve it for possible further review in light of <em>Apprendi v. New </em>Jersey.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule Almendarez-Torres.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>rule it.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AeAf\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1023-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
