When, as in this case, the BIA adopts without opinion the IJ\u2019s decision, this court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Mikhael v. I.N.S., </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">The Attorney General \u201cmay not remove an alien to a country if the Attorney General decides that the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A), INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A). \u201c[Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary....\u201d 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(b)(4), INA \u00a7 242(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">The IJ found that there was \u201cno indication in this case that anyone persecuted the respondent for any reason, let alone for one of the five reasons set forth [in the withholding of removal statute].\u201d In addition, while the IJ acknowledged that case law had not set out the standards for determining when forced sex for money would be a basis to qualify one for withholding of removal, she opined that each case would have to be looked at on a case-by-case basis and that the age of the person seeking relief would be relevant. The IJ considered that Kesee was 20 years of age when she agreed to prostitute herself for the Valentine Massage parlor, \u201cwhich is quite mature,\u201d and that she was no longer a young girl being taken advantage of like the young girls highlighted in the many reports of forced prostitution in Thailand.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-14\">Accordingly, the IJ found that Kesee\u2019s problems with the Valentine Massage parlor stemmed not from the broader problem of forced prostitution in Thailand, but from her personal agreement with a specific establishment to prostitute herself in exchange for money paid to her parents. No reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to find to the contrary. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4), INA \u00a7 242(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-15\">An applicant seeking relief under CAT has the burden of proving that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). The IJ discussed the requirements for seeking relief under CAT, including the requirement that she consider past torture, gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights within the country of removal, and other conditions within the country. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). The IJ then discussed the facts of the case, including Kesee\u2019s agreement to prostitute herself in exchange for money paid to her parents, her inability to leave the brothel when she desired, her escape from the brothel, and the fact that, after she escaped and was living in her hometown and in Bangkok, she was never approached or harmed in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-16\">The IJ gave sufficient reasons why Kesee had not satisfied her burden of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>with respect to her CAT claim, and a reasonable adjudicator would not be compelled to find to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Based on the foregoing, Kesee\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b969-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
