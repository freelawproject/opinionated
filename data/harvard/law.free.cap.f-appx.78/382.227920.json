He argues that <em>Buford v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001), clarified an amendment to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.3). He argues that under the clarification he would not have been eligible for the sentencing enhancement he received under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), and its corresponding guideline provision at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-22\">The amendment that Young argues was clarified by <em>Buford </em>is Amendment 382, effective November 1,1991, which changed the language in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment. (n.3). Amendment 382 is not listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c), and therefore may not be applied retroactively on Young\u2019s motion. <em>See United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 218 (5th Cir.1996). The denial of Young\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was not an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion. Its order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
