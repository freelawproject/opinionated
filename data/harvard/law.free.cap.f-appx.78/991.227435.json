The BIA denied Amien\u2019s motion for reconsideration of its decision dismissing his appeal as untimely. He argues that the 30-day appeal period runs from the date that he received the decision of the Immigration Judge (IJ) on October 17, 2001, and that his notice of appeal was timely filed on November 15, 2001, within 30 days of the date he received the decision. He also argues that the application of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.38(b), the regulation establishing the 30-day appeal period, violated his equal protection rights. Because Amien did not file a petition for review within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s June 4, 2002, order which dismissed Amien\u2019s appeal as untimely, we do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s June 4, 2002, order. <em>See Karimian-Kaklaki v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 108, 111 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">Amien filed a petition for review within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s August 28, 2002, order denying his motion for reconsideration and, therefore, we have jurisdiction to review that order. <em>See id. </em>Amien has not shown that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration as untimely. Amien did not comply with the BIA\u2019s instructions to correct the defects in his filing within the 30-day appeal period pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2), and he did not file a motion requesting that the BIA accept his untimely motion by certification. Accordingly, Amien\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1022-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
