Fermin appeals the district court\u2019s grant of Direct Merchants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Fermin argues that the interest rate on the credit card issued to him by Direct Merchants was usurious under Texas, federal, and Arizona law. As a national bank located in Arizona, Direct Merchants may charge interest at the rate allowed by Arizona law. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 85; <em>Marquette Nat'l Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Serv. Corp., </em>439 U.S. 299, 308, 99 S.Ct. 540, 58 L.Ed.2d 534 (1978). Fermin does not dispute that the interest charged him was set by contract via the Cardholder\u2019s Agreement and its changes or that the credit limit exceeded $10,000. Because the interest rate charged was established by contract, it is the interest allowed by Arizona law and is not greater than that allowed by Arizona law. <em>See </em>Ariz.Rbv.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 44-1201, 44-1205(C). Thus, the interest rate charged does not violate federal or Arizona law. Arizona Revised Statute \u00a7\u00a7 44-1205(D) and 6-601 are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-23\">Fermin asserts that the Account Benefit Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d), which would forgive the credit card account balance if he died, was insurance which Direct Merchants was not licensed to sell in Texas. Fermin asserts erroneously that the district court erred by not adjudicating his claim under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\u201cGLBA\u201d). Although he asserts that the Plan was insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>anee under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 6712(e) of the GLBA, he does not argue that Texas has regulated as insurance contracts such as the Plan since January 1, 1999. Fermin\u2019s conclusional assertions do not show any error in the district court\u2019s determination that the Plan is not insurance under the GLBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Direct Merchants\u2019 motion to strike portions of Fermin\u2019s reply brief is DENIED as unnecessary. <em>See Taita Chem. Co. v. Westlake Styrene Corp., </em>246 F.3d 377, 384 n. 9 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b962-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
