Bishop appeals the district court\u2019s order accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to affirm the Commissioner\u2019s denial of social security disability and supplemental security income benefits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">Bishop makes the following arguments on appeal: (1) the administrative law judge (ALJ) failed to consider all relevant evidence; (2) the ALJ erred in his weighing of the medical evidence; (3) the ALJ erred in his credibility determination; and (4) the ALJ violated Bishop\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">We must uphold the district court\u2019s disability determination if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2000); <em>Hays v. Sullivan, </em>907 F.2d 1453, 1456 (4th Cir.1990). Contrary to Bishop\u2019s argument, the ALJ\u2019s opinion and the hearing transcript reveal that the ALJ considered all relevant evidence of record with regard to Bishop\u2019s physical and mental impairments. In fact, the ALJ\u2019s opinion reveals a thorough examination of both physical and mental impairments, as well as their combined effect on Bishop\u2019s ability to work. Likewise, the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical to the vocational expert incorporated both physical and mental limitations that are supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">Bishop also raises the following arguments with regard to his contention that the ALJ did not consider all relevant medical evidence, all of which are without merit: (1) counsel failed to explain a ten-month lack of medical treatment; (2) counsel incorrectly informed the ALJ that he had advised Bishop of the hearing procedures and his rights; (3) counsel referenced an incorrect date with regard to one of Bishop\u2019s medical records; (4) counsel should not have asked Bishop whether he wished to make the ALJ aware of anything that was not revealed through the testimony; and (5) the ALJ erred by refusing to order a consultative psychological evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">Contrary to Bishop\u2019s contention, counsel did not err by failing to explain a ten-month lapse in medical treatment. In fact, Bishop himself was afforded the opportunity at the hearing to explain such lapse. His only explanation, however, was that he had to be with his children following the death of his ex-wife. Next, counsel did not err by advising the ALJ that Bishop had been informed of the hearing procedures and his rights. Bishop did not object to his counsel\u2019s statement to the ALJ. Furthermore, even assuming that counsel had not so advised Bishop, the ALJ informed Bishop of his right to ask questions at any time necessary during the hearing. Bishop never asked counsel or the ALJ for clarification at any point during the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-16\">Bishop\u2019s argument that counsel erred by referencing an incorrect date with regard to one of his medical records likewise fails. Even if such a mistake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>occurred, the medical record at issue, which reflected the correct date, became part of the administrative record that the ALJ reviewed in reaching his finding of non-disability. Thus, any such error was harmless. Additionally, we find Bishop\u2019s argument that he should not have been asked to provide the ALJ with information not revealed through the testimony to be meritless. In particular, Bishop contends that, given his mental impairments, he was unable to intelligently respond to such a question. The record reveals that Bishop\u2019s primary mental impairments include difficulty maintaining attention and concentration for extended periods and difficulty following detailed or complex instructions. However, the question posed by counsel calls for neither of these abilities. Thus, the argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Finally, Bishop\u2019s argument that the ALJ erred by refusing to order a consultative psychological evaluation lacks merit. First, the regulations state that the ALJ has discretion in deciding whether to order a consultative examination. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1519a, 416.919a (2002). The regulations further provide that a consultative examination is required when the evidence as a whole is insufficient to support a decision. <em>See id. </em>That simply is not the case here. The ALJ had before him the opinions of Bishop\u2019s treating physician, a licensed clinical psychologist, state agency psychologists, and notes from Region Ten Community Services Board (\u201cRegion Ten\u201d). Moreover, the ALJ explained that his refusal to order a consultative evaluation was based partially on Bishop\u2019s ability to obtain an evaluation on his own from Region Ten, which he did. Thus, Bishop\u2019s argument is baseless.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Next, Bishop contends that the ALJ improperly weighed the medical evidence by granting controlling weight to the opinion of his treating physician (\u201cPugh\u201d) over that of a psychologist (\u201cMay\u201d) with regard to his mental impairment. The regulations provide that a treating physician\u2019s opinion should be granted controlling weight if it is consistent with other substantial evidence of record. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d), 416.927(d) (2002). We find that Pugh\u2019s opinion is well-supported and is consistent with substantial evidence of record. All of the medical sources, including Pugh, found that Bishop\u2019s ability to maintain attention and concentration, as well as his ability to follow detailed or complex instructions, were diminished. In no other areas was Bishop deemed significantly limited. Both Pugh and May opined that Bishop would benefit from treatment for his depression. However, no medical source placed any other restrictions on Bishop. Thus, we find that the ALJ did not err by granting controlling weight to Pugh\u2019s opinion regarding Bishop\u2019s mental impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Bishop next argues that the ALJ made an improper credibility determination. We disagree. Bishop alleges that the ALJ improperly discredited him based on his failure to testify regarding a job he briefly held as a vacuum salesman, especially given his mental impairment, as evidenced by psychological evaluations from Region Ten. Bishop contends that if the ALJ had reviewed these evaluations, the outcome would have been different. We disagree for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">First, we cannot review any evidence not contained in the record as reviewed by the ALJ in determining whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings. <em>See Huckabee v. Richardson, </em>468 F.2d 1380, 1381 (4th Cir.1972) (holding that reviewing courts are restricted to administrative record in determining whether Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence). Thus, the first inquiry is whether the Appeals Council prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>erly denied Bishop\u2019s request for review, which included the records from Region Ten he relies on in making this argument. For the following reasons, we find that the Appeals Council did not err in denying Bishop\u2019s request for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The Appeals Council must consider evidence submitted with a request for review if the evidence is new, material, and relates to the period on or before the date of the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Wilkins v. Secretary of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>953 F.2d 93, 96 (4th Cir.1991). We find that the evidence is not new because Bishop could have submitted it to the ALJ for consideration. The ALJ\u2019s decision was issued on December 3, 1999, but the letter from Region Ten indicates that Bishop began treatment on October 28, 1999, more than a month prior to the decision. Bishop provides no reason to show cause why he failed to submit such evidence to the ALJ. Moreover, the additional information is not material because it would not have changed the ALJ\u2019s decision. The letter from Region Ten merely states that Bishop was receiving treatment for major depression and panic attacks. It does not contain any limitations placed on him as a result of his depression, nor does it contain any sort of prognosis. Bishop also attached additional medical records from Region Ten to his informal brief. However, for the same reasons, we cannot consider this information in determining whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Second, contrary to Bishop\u2019s contention, we find that the ALJ did not discredit him based on his failure to testify regarding his work attempt as a vacuum salesman. Instead, the ALJ merely used this work attempt to demonstrate Bishop\u2019s belief that he was able to work. Moreover, in addition to this work attempt, the ALJ also found that the medical evidence of record did not support Bishop\u2019s subjective allegations regarding the severity of his impairment. The ALJ concluded that, at most, Bishop suffered from muscle spasms, a conclusion supported by the medical evidence of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Lastly, we find that the ALJ did not violate Bishop\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection. In a supplemental brief, Bishop argues that the ALJ refused to order a consultative psychological evaluation based on his status as an African American. First, Bishop raises this issue for the first time in this Court. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993) (holding that issues raised for the first time on appeal are waived absent exceptional circumstances). Because he fails to show the requisite exceptional circumstances for appellate review, this issue has been waived. In any event, we find that such an argument lacks merit. Bishop bases his argument on the ALJ\u2019s response to the request for the consultative evaluation. In particular, the ALJ stated as follows: \u201cAll right. Now, I\u2019m going to deny the request for another psychological examination. We, we had one in '98 and we can\u2019t keep sending these folks\u2014he, he can go to Chapter 10 or\u2014 and he goes to see his family doctor.\u201d Bishop contends that the ALJ\u2019s use of the term \u201cthese folks\u201d refers to African Americans, thereby exhibiting discrimination as the basis for the refusal. However, this is nothing more than conjecture and speculation by Bishop. As previously discussed, the ALJ has discretion to order a consultative examination and, for the reasons discussed above, that discretion was not abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying benefits. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
