We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-24\">Wilson argues that the district court committed reversible error during the plea colloquy in explaining the potential penalties he faced. Wilson did not object during the plea hearing or move to withdraw his plea. Therefore, this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). We therefore must determine (1) whether there was error; (2) whether it was plain; (3) whether it affected Wilson\u2019s substantial rights; and (4) whether, if the first three criteria are met, we should exercise our discretion to notice the error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 529 (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-25\">The Government concedes that the district court committed plain error by misstating the penalties Wilson faced. This court may consider the entire record when considering the effect of any error on Wilson\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Vonn, </em>535 U.S. at 74-75. We have examined the entire record and conclude that the district court\u2019s error did not affect Wilson\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-26\">Accordingly, we affirm Wilson\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"A6Z\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
