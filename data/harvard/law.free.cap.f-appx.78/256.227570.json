Legette, Adi Supreme God Allah, Tyler Mattress, and Antonio Abnathey seek to appeal the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to the South Carolina Department of Corrections (SCDC) and Gary Maynard, the Director of the Department of Corrections. The Appellants, along with eight other prisoners at Kershaw Correctional Institution who did not join the appeal, claimed the institution discriminated against them in violation of their First and Fourteenth Amendment Rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000), and in violation of state law. The district court granted summary judgment to the Defendants. We dismiss as moot Appellants\u2019 appeal of the denial of injunctive relief because they are no longer incarcerated at Kershaw; Hazel has been released from custody, Legette has been transferred to Evans Correctional Institution, Allah and Mattress have been transferred to Lee Correctional Institution; and Abnathey has been transferred to McCormick Correctional Institution. <em>See Williams v. Griffin, </em>952 F.2d 820, 823 (4th Cir.1991); <em>Inmates v. Owens, </em>561 F.2d 560, 562 (4th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-18\">As to Appellants\u2019 claims for monetary relief, we have thoroughly reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order as to Appellants\u2019 claims for monetary damages. <em>See Morgan v. S.C. Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>No. CA-01-2739-4-20-BC (D.S.C. Feb. 25, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-19\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
