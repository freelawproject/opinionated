California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although he was notified of counsel\u2019s motion, Hawhthorne has filed no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-19\">Our independent review of counsel\u2019s brief and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal with respect to Hawthorne\u2019s conviction. As part of his plea agreement, Hawthorne validly waived his right to directly appeal his sentence. <em>See United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-24\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cm. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
