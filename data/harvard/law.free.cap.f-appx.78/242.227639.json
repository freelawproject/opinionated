In 1990, Edwards was convicted of distribution of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a), (b)(1)(C) (West 1999 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2003). Although deportation proceedings were instituted at that time, Edwards received a \u00a7 212(c) waiver. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1182(c) (West 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">In 1996, Edwards was convicted in Maryland state court of possession of marijuana, and removal proceedings were instituted. In 2002, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s order of removal. The Board concluded that Edwards was subject to removal under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00a9 (West 1999), as an alien who has been convicted of a controlled substance offense. Edwards petitions this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">We lack jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s decision. Under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (West 1999), appellate courts do not have jurisdiction to review the final order of removal of an alien who is removable for having committed certain criminal offenses, including controlled substance offenses defined in \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00a9. Under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we have jurisdiction only to determine the relevant jurisdictional facts: (1) whether Edwards is an alien; and (2) whether he is removable for committing a criminal offense listed in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). <em>Lewis v. INS, </em>194 F.3d 539, 542-43(4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">Edwards concedes in this case that he is an alien and that he was convicted for possession of marijuana. Therefore, Edwards is removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, and, under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we are without jurisdiction to hear his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">Edwards also seeks to challenge the provisions of 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1182(h) (West 1999) on equal protection grounds. \u201cEven assuming, without deciding, that our jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) includes review of substantial constitutional challenges ... this claim does not present such a substantial issue.\u201d <em>Ramtulla v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 202, 203-04 (4th Cir.2002) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 2577, 156 L.Ed.2d 604 (2003). Similarly, we conclude that Edwards\u2019s equal protection challenge to 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229b(c)(6) (West 1999) presents no substantial constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-15\">We deny Edwards\u2019s requests to transfer this petition for review to a district court as a habeas corpus petition, or to remand the case to the Board for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-16\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
