Ortega Reyna, </em>148 F.3d 540, 543 (5th Cir.1998) (stating that standard of review is whether any reasonable trier of fact could have found that the evidence established the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-20\">Nunez next argues that direct contact -with the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) is necessary to prove the intent to defraud necessary to support convictions for conspiracy and for introduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>of an adulterated device with the intent to defraud. Even in the absence of any direct contact by Nunez with the FDA, our review of the record persuades us that Nunez\u2019s actions were \u201cmore than ... incidental infringement of governmental regulations,\u201d and that her actions established the intent to defraud necessary to support her conspiracy conviction. <em>See United States v. Haga, </em>821 F.2d 1036, 1041 (5th Cir.1987)- Introduction of an adulterated device with the intent to defraud can be established through deliberate avoidance of contact with the FDA. <em>See United States v. Arlen, </em>947 F.2d 139 (5th Cir.1991). Because there is evidence in the record that Nunez avoided contact with the FDA, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support Nunez\u2019s convictions on these counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Nunez argues that there was insufficient evidence to show that the use of cellular telephones constitutes use of wire communications under the wire fraud act. Because this contention was not raised below, our review is limited to determining \u201cwhether there was a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Laury, </em>49 F.3d 145, 151 (5th Cir.1995) (citation omitted). Nunez has not shown a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice\u201d on this issue. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">Nunez argues that two counts of the indictment were \u201calternate counts,\u201d differing only in the alleged victims; she argues her conviction and sentence on both counts violate Double Jeopardy. Because Nunez did not raise this issue below, we will consider this claim only as it relates to the sentences imposed. <em>See United States v. Dixon, </em>273 F.3d 636, 641-42 (5th Cir. 2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 829, 123 S.Ct. 125, 154 L.Ed.2d 42 (2002). We conclude that no Double Jeopardy violation occurred. <em>See id. </em>(affirming separate sentences although the two victims were robbed during a single incident).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Nunez asserts that the district court erred in imposing a special condition of supervised release that suspends supervised release if she is deported and reinstates it when she returns to the United States. Nunez misconstrues this provision; only active supervision is suspended upon her deportation and the actual term of supervised release will continue to run. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 237-39 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">Although Nunez\u2019s brief discusses several other issues, counsel concedes each of these issues is frivolous or meritless. Therefore, we do not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1020-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
