Diggs preserved the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained incident to his arrest. Finding no error, we affirm the denial of Diggs\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-22\">This court reviews the factual findings underlying the denial of a motion to suppress for clear error, while reviewing the legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). In reviewing the record, \u201cgreat deference\u201d is accorded to the district court judge\u2019s ability to assess witness demeanor and credibility. <em>See Howard v. Moore, </em>131 F.3d 399, 407 (4th Cir.1997) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-23\">Diggs argues the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing did not support the stop of his vehicle. The district court, in denying the motion, relied strictly on its assessment of the credibility of the witnesses in determining that: (1) there was reason to believe that Diggs committed a simple traffic violation by stopping his car in the middle of a roadway and impeding traffic; and (2) there was reasonable suspicion to believe that a drug crime was in progress. Thus, we find Diggs has not shown the district court clearly erred in denying his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-24\">Accordingly, we affirm Diggs\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
