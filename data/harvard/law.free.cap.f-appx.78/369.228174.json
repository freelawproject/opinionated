Yepes is currently serving a life sentence for conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute. Yepes argues that the district court erred in denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition because he is innocent of his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-18\">Yepes has not met his burden of showing that he meets the requirements for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He has neither pointed to a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been imprisoned for conduct that was not prohibited by law nor shown how his claim was foreclosed by circuit law at the time of his guilty-plea conviction, appeal, or first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
