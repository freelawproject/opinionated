Maciel, Texas prisoner # 773891, challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his application to proceed in for-ma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d) on appeal. The district court had dismissed Maciel\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 lawsuit because he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. By moving to proceed IFP on appeal, Maciel is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that he should not be granted IFP status because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-24\">Maciel asserts that he was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing a civil rights action for a variety of reasons. Exhaustion of prison grievance procedures is mandatory. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 524, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-25\">Maciel has failed to show that his complaint presented a non-frivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith. Maciel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Maciel\u2019s motion for appointment of appellate counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
