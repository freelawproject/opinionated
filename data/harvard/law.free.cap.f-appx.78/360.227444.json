Hines, a prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights complaint as frivolous and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>failing to state a claim on which relief can be granted. Hines also appeals the district court\u2019s refusal to accept and review his amended complaint. Hines sued Robert Helms and H.M.R. Properties pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. He alleged that Helms, his landlord, invaded his privacy by allowing the police to enter his residence and take his property. He also alleged that H.M.R. Properties, his employer, denied him back pay and the cost of a broken tooth. The district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice because Helms and H.M.R. Properties are not state actors as required by \u00a7 1983. The district court denied Hines\u2019s motion to amend the complaint, which would have added a state detective as a defendant. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">A district court must dismiss a prisoner\u2019s claim if it is malicious, frivolous, or fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A complaint is frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis either in law or fact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint as frivolous is reviewed for an abuse of discretion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failing to state a claim is reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The judge did not err by dismissing Hines\u2019s original complaint as frivolous and failing to state a claim. Any action brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983 requires the plaintiff to show a federal-rights deprivation by a state actor. Hines\u2019s original complaint made no allegation of state action. Reviewing this dismissal under either standard of review, the district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">A party may amend its pleading \u201conce as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff moved to amend before being served with a responsive pleading. The judge denied Plaintiffs Motion to Amend.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We affirm because any error that resulted was harmless.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s proposed amended complaint makes only a conclusory allegation of conspiracy between the defendants and a state actor; it provides no factual basis for the allegation. This bare allegation of conspiracy does not suffice to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court\u2019s refusal to accept Plaintiffs amended pleading was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
