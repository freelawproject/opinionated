Cummings argues that his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119(2) violated the Supreme Court decision in <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 251-52, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), because his indictment failed to allege that serious bodily injury resulted during his offense. He states that he should be allowed to file the claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Cummings has not shown that he was convicted of an offense which is now nonexistent based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 831 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). <em>Jones </em>has no effect on whether the facts of Cummings\u2019s case support his conviction for carjacking during which serious bodily injury resulted. <em>See Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary, Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 348 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1241, 123 S.Ct. 1374, 155 L.Ed.2d 212 (2003). Cummings has not met the requirements to file his claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
