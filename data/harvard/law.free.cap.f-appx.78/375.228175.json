Smalley argues on appeal that his conviction and guilty plea should be vacated because a magistrate judge, rather than an Article III judge, presided over his Fed. R.Crim. P. 11 colloquy; that the district court impermissibly delegated its authority to require payment for drug testing to the probation office; and that the terms of supervised release contained in the written judgment entered by the district court conflict with the court\u2019s oral pronouncement at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Smalley correctly acknowledges that his first two arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent and states that he raises them merely to preserve the issues for Supreme Court review. <em>See United States v. Dees, </em>125 F.3d 261, 264-66 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Warden, </em>291 F.3d 363, 364-66 (5th Cir.2002). We find no abuse of discretion in the written terms of supervised release imposed by the district court. <em>Warden, </em>291 F.3d at 364-65; <em>United States v. Vega, </em>332 F.3d 849, 851 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
