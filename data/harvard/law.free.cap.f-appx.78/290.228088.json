He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the docket sheet reveals that the district court dismissed Etienne\u2019s motion without prejudice on September 5, 2003. Accordingly, although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny Etienne\u2019s mandamus petition as moot because the district court has recently decided Etienne\u2019s case. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
