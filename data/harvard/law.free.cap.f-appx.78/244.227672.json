Goist has noted an appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying Leland M. Bryson\u2019s petition of third party interest in forfeited property. Goist attempted to assert his interest in the forfeited property within the proceeding filed by Leland Bryson. Despite his attempts\u2014both in the district court and in this court\u2014Goist was not made a party to the proceedings. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(k), (n) (2000); <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>185 F.3d 183, 186 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201cSection 853(n) provides the exclusive means by which a third party can assert his interest in forfeited property.\u201d). Accordingly, we deny the United States\u2019 motion to strike Goist\u2019s informal brief and dismiss Goist\u2019s appeal for lack of standing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
