He argues (1) that his prior removal was invalid, and the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment was error and (2) that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s sentencing provisions are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He acknowledges that his arguments are foreclosed, and he seeks to preserve them for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-24\">Garcia-Saldivar\u2019s argument that the failure to inform him of his eligibility to apply for relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (INA \u00a7 212(c)) rendered the prior removal proceedings fundamentally unfair is without merit. <em>United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1135, 123 S.Ct. 922, 154 L.Ed.2d 827 (2003). Also without merit is his argument that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi. See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b957-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
