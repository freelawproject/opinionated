McNeil was convicted of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine base and aiding and abetting possession with the intent to distribute cocaine base. McNeil argues that the district court erroneously increased his base offense level for possession of a firearm, and he contends that he was entitled to a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-23\">A district court may reduce a term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 when it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if the reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is discretionary, and this court reviews a district court\u2019s refusal to lower a defendant\u2019s sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-24\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying McNeil\u2019s motion because his arguments are outside the scope of a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 motion. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582; <em>United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 217-18 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
