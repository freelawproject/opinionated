An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit judge or justice issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(e)(l)(2000). This court will not issue a certificate of appealability as to claims dismissed by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>district court on procedural grounds unless the movant can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v.

Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
