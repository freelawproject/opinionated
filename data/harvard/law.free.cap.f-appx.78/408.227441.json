California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Vinzant was sent a copy of counsel\u2019s motion and brief, but has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-22\">Vinzant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appeal rights except with respect to any sentence imposed in excess of the statutory maximum or any upward departure from the applicable sentencing guidelines range as determined by the district court. Our independent review of the brief and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
