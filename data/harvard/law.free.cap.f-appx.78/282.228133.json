We dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\"><em>As </em>to the district court\u2019s order denying Greene\u2019s requests for appointment of counsel and motion for default judgment, these are not final orders, and are not appeal-able. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000); <em>see Miller v. Simmons, </em>814 F.2d 962, 967 (4th Cir.1987). We therefore dismiss the appeal as to those orders as interlocutory.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">To the extent Greene appeals the denial of a temporary restraining order, such denial is not ordinarily appealable. <em>Virginia v. Tenneco, Inc., </em>538 F.2d 1026, 1029-30 (4th Cir.1976). Because the case presents no exceptional circumstances, we decline to review the denial of a temporary restraining order, and dismiss the appeal as it pertains to that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Finally, to the extent that Greene appeals the denial of his request for a preliminary injunction, we have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we affirm that part of the order on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Greene v. Johnson, </em>No. CA-02-611-2 (E.D.Va. July 7, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
