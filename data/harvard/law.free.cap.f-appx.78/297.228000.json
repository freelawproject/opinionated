The IJ found Hamza\u2019s testimony not credible. The Board corrected the IJ\u2019s finding of inconsistency on a few points that were either not sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>ported by the record or explained by Hamza on appeal. The Board then affirmed the IJ\u2019s credibility finding and concluded that this lack of credibility, considered with \u201cthe lack of specific corroboration,\u201d constituted a failure to meet Hamza\u2019s burden of proof establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1158 (West 1999 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2003); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). We have reviewed the credibility determination at issue. As we conclude that it is supported by specific, cogent reasoning, it is entitled to substantial deference. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Hamza\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for asylum. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). To qualify for \"withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430-31, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Because Hamza fails to show that he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Hamza also complains of the retroactive application of streamlining procedures put in place after the date he conceded removability. This court has already rejected this claim as to the procedures set out in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(h) (2003). <em>Khattak v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 250 (4th Cir.2003). We perceive no relevant distinction from the provision applied in Hamza\u2019s case, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5) (2003). Therefore, we conclude that this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\"> We note that, as Hamza made no claim before the IJ or the Board for withholding under the Convention Against Torture, he has not exhausted his administrative remedies as to this claim and this court lacks jurisdiction to review it. <em>Bernal-Vallejo v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 56, 64 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
