Berhane\u2019s claim for asylum centered on the border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea that arose in 1998 and Ethiopia\u2019s deportation of Ethiopians of Eritrean origin, such as Berhane, to Eritrea and Eritrea\u2019s persecution of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses who refused to fight. Berhane acknowledges that the countries have entered into a cease-fire agreement but contends that their past persecution of Ethiopians of Eritrean origin and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses warranted a finding that he had a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to Ethiopia. Berhane also seeks review of the dismissal of his asylum application as frivolous 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(6), and he argues that he did not know that the letter allegedly from Ethiopia submitted with his application had been fabricated.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">The IJ\u2019s determination that Berhane did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to Ethiopia is supported by substantial evidence, and Berhane has not shown that the evidence presented was so compelling to require a finding of the requisite fear of persecution. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 350-51 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see also Rojas v. INS, </em>937 F.2d 186, 190 n. 1 (5th Cir.1991). Nor has he made such a showing with respect to the denial of his request for withholding of removal or for relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>188 (5th Cir.1994); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). The IJ\u2019s determination that Berhane knowingly submitted a fabricated document with his application and the dismissal of the application as frivolous are supported by the record. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 908 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
