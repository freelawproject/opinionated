Thaler, </em>211 F.3d 953, 957 (5th Cir.2000). Although disciplinary action resulting in an inmate\u2019s loss of previously earned \u201cgood time\u201d must be accompanied by procedural safeguards, <em>see Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 564-65, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), Starks was not deprived of good-time credits. Moreover, he has no constitutional right to be housed in any particular facility, and he concedes that he was never placed in administrative segregation. <em>See Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 244-45, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983); <em>Tighe v. Wall, </em>100 F.3d 41, 42 (5th Cir.1996); <em>see also Luken v. Scott, </em>71 F.3d 192, 193 (5th Cir.1995). He therefore has not been deprived of a liberty interest and has not stated a cognizable \u00a7 2241 claim. <em>See Malchi, </em>211 F.3d at 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b456-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
