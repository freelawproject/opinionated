Williams fails to show that the district court abused its discretion when it dismissed his due process claims surrounding a disciplinary hearing as frivolous because Williams lacked a liberty interest in the punishment he received. <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Madison v. Parker, </em>104 F.3d 765, 767 (5th Cir.1997). Williams likewise fails to show that the district court abused its discretion when it dismissed his personal injury claim as frivolous inasmuch as allegations of negligence do not implicate the Constitution. <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 328, 106 S.Ct. 677, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986); <em>Salas v. Carpenter, </em>980 F.2d 299, 306-07 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-21\">This appeal is without arguable merit. It should therefore be dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of the instant case as frivolous and for failure to exhaust and this court\u2019s dismissal of Williams\u2019s appeal as frivolous count as two strikes against him for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Therefore, Williams is WARNED that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b439-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
