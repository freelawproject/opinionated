This court must raise, sua sponte, the issue of its own jurisdiction, if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). We have jurisdiction of \u201cappeals from all final decisions of the district courts.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \u201c[A] district court\u2019s denial of a claim of qualified immunity, to the extent that it turns on an issue of law, is an appealable \u2018final decision\u2019 within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). The rationale of the Supreme Court in extending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>the collateral order doctrine to appeals from denials of qualified immunity was that the \u201centitlement is an <em>immunity from suit </em>rather than a mere defense to liability\u201d and would be \u201ceffectively lost if a case [was] erroneously permitted to go to trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806. <em>Mitchell </em>was an appeal from a denial of qualified immunity raised in a motion for summary judgment. A district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity \u201cconclusively determines the defendant\u2019s claim of right not to <em>stand trial\u201d </em>and that is the basis for the court\u2019s decision to allow an immediate appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 527, 105 S.Ct. 2806.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">That rationale does not apply in this case. Sabater has not avoided trial; she has already been adjudged liable for Bias\u2019s injuries, although damages have not yet been determined. \u201cAn order that determines the liability but leaves unresolved the assessment of damages is not final within the meaning of [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 1291.\u201d <em>Southern Travel Club v. Carnival Air Lines, Inc., </em>986 F.2d 125, 129-30 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">The policy of the final judgment rule against piecemeal and duplicative litigation, as embodied in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, is offended by Sabater\u2019s attempted appeal in this case. <em>Matter of U.S. Abatement Carp., </em>39 F.3d 563, 567 (5th Cir.1994). Sabater\u2019s arguments can be considered and reviewed in an appeal from any final judgment that follows the district court\u2019s assessment of damages. We therefore DISMISS this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">Bias has moved for appointment of counsel and has filed two motions for leave to file an out-of-time brief. These motions are DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b981-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
