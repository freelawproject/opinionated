Moutche contends that 1) the Board\u2019s determination that he did not establish \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d justifying reopening of his removal hearing was an abuse of discretion; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>and 2) that the ineffective assistance of counsel rendered by his prior attorney constituted exceptional circumstances. Finding no reversible error, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">This Court\u2019s review of the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen is extremely deferential, and the decision will not be reversed absent abuse of discretion. <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999). Motions to reopen are disfavored. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c) (2003). We find the Board did not abuse its discretion in finding that Moutche failed to establish exceptional circumstances warranting granting a motion to reopen. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), (e)(1) (2000). Moutche contends for the first time on appeal that ineffective assistance of counsel was the exceptional circumstance warranting reopening of the removal proceedings. Because Moutche failed to make a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel to the Board, this Court cannot consider the claim. <em>Stewart, </em>181 F.3d at 595. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
