Hernandez-Marquez\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue but stating that he finds no meritorious grounds for appeal. Although notified of his right to do so, Hernandez-Marquez has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-19\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel questions whether the district court abused its discretion in sentencing Hernandez-Marquez at the high end of the appropriately calculated guideline range. However, this court does not review a sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) (2000); <em>United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990). Therefore, we \u201ccannot address appellant\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s exercise of sentencing discretion.\u201d <em>Porter, </em>909 F.2d at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-20\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Hernandez-Marquez\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
