Because White\u2019s motion directly attacked his conviction and sentence rather than any alleged defect in the collateral review process, it amounted to a successive \u00a7 2255 motion that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 207 (4th Cir.2003). In accordance with <em>Winestock, </em>we construe White\u2019s notice of appeal and m-formal brief on appeal as an application to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See id. </em>at 208. We have reviewed the record and find that White fails to meet the requirements for authorization to file such a successive motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In order to obtam authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a movant must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence sufficient to establish that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) (2000). WMte does not satisfy either of these conditions. Aceordmgly, we affirm the order of the district court and deny White\u2019s implicit application for leave to file a second \u00a7 2255 motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented m the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
