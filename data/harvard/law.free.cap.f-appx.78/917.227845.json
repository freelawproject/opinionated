The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended that Fitzgerald be sentenced as a career offender based on the instant offense, his prior felony conviction for selling cocaine, and his two prior felony convictions for escape. The district court adopted the findings in the PSR and sentenced Fitzgerald to forty-three months of imprisonment, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-21\">Fitzgerald\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising two issues: (1) whether the district court erred in finding Fitzgerald to be a career offender under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2001), by determining that the instant offense of escape and Fitzgerald\u2019s prior escape convictions constituted crimes of violence; and (2) whether Fitzgerald received ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to move for a downward departure based on an overstated criminal history. Fitzgerald was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-22\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court properly sentenced Fitzgerald as a career offender. <em>See United States v. Dickerson, </em>77 F.3d 774 (4th Cir.1996). Furthermore, Fitzgerald\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be brought, if at all, in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), because the record in this appeal does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-23\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Fitzgerald\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>sel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
