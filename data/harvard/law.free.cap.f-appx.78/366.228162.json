The district court\u2019s dismissal is reviewed <em>de novo. Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 734 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-24\">Vardas renews his challenge to the reduced time-earning classification he received as a penalty for a prison disci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>plinary conviction and contends that the district court\u2019s dismissal under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), was error because he is not attacking his conviction or sentence but the unconstitutional denial of parole and the way his sentence is being calculated. Vardas\u2019 challenge to his reduced time-earning classification implicates the validity of his disciplinary conviction, and, because he has not shown that the proceedings have been overturned or invalidated, it is barred by <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87; <em>cf. Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Even if it is assumed that the <em>Heck </em>bar did not apply, dismissal of the suit was proper because Vardas has failed to state a constitutional claim as he has no liberty interest in his time-earning classification or in parole. <em>See Johnson v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist. </em>38 F.3d 198, 200 (5th Cir.1994) ; <em>see also Luken v. Scott, </em>71 F.3d 192, 193 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Madison v. Parker, </em>104 F.3d 765, 768 (5th Cir.1997). Consequently, his due-process claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Vardas\u2019 appeal is wholly without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Both the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of the instant appeal count as \u201cstrikes\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir. 1996). Vardas has also acquired at least two other strikes. <em>See Vardas v. Texas Dep\u2019t Crim. Justice, </em>No. 95-40059, 62 F.3d 394, 1995 WL 452061 (5th Cir. June 30, 1995) (unpublished); <em>see also Vardas v. City of Dallas, </em>No. 02-10616, 54 Fed.Appx. 592, 2002 WL 31730282 (5th Cir. Nov. 21, 2002) (unpublished). Because Vardas has now accumulated more than three strikes, he is BARRED from proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED; THREE-STRIKES BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
