He argues for the first time on appeal that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional because it does not require the prior aggravated felony conviction used to increase his sentence to be proven as an element of the offense. He contends that his conviction should be reformed to the lesser included offense in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and that he should be resentenced to no more than two years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-20\">Martinez acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review in light of the decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-23\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Martinez\u2019s argument is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>foreclosed. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AGz\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
