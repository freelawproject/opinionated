We have reviewed the administrative record, the Board\u2019s order and the IJ\u2019s decision and find substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that Karamalla failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution necessary to qualify for relief from deportation. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b) (2003). We conclude the record supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that Karamalla failed to establish his eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-20\">The standard for receiving withholding of deportation is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Karamalla failed to establish refugee status, he cannot satisfy the higher standard for withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-21\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
