His conviction was affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>on appeal, but his 360-month sentence was vacated and his case was remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>United States v. Coombs, </em>26 Fed.Appx. 198 (4th Cir.2002) (unpublished). On remand, the district court determined that Coombs was responsible for distributing more than nine kilograms of crack and imposed the statutory maximum sentence of 240 months imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (2000). In this appeal, Coombs challenges the district court\u2019s determination of the drug quantity attributed to him. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The indictment charged a conspiracy extending from \u201cin or about 1996, up to and including June 1997, the exact dates ... unknown.\u201d The district court found that Coombs sold 315 ounces (8.93 kilograms) of crack to Stephen Bines between October 1996 and November 1998. Coombs was also held responsible for five ounces of crack that co-defendant Michael Shirley sold to Bines, and for smaller amounts sold to co-conspirator Winston Simpson by Coombs, Shirley, and Robinson. Because he was held responsible for more than 1.5 kilograms of crack, Coombs\u2019 base offense level was 38. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (2002) (1.5 kilograms of crack or more). Coombs contends that the crack he sold to Bines between October 1996 and November 1998 was not relevant conduct because this conduct was neither part of the charged conspiracy nor part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The district court\u2019s determination of the quantity of drugs attributable to a defendant as relevant conduct is a factual question reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 210 (4th Cir.1999). We find no error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">First, the sales to Bines were never separate from the charged conspiracy. Bines began buying crack from Shirley and Coombs in 1996 when the charged conspiracy was ongoing, and Bines continued to buy crack regularly from Coombs until November 1998. Bines testified that he met or was aware of a number of the others involved in the conspiracy and said that Coombs even invited Bines to transport drugs from Florida and explained how the drugs were hidden in the cars used. Moreover, the end date in an indictment does not determine when the actual conspiracy ended because a defendant \u201cis presumed to continue in a conspiracy until he withdraws from the conspiracy by affirmative action.\u201d <em>United States v. Barsanti, </em>943 F.2d 428, 437 (4th Cir.1991) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Even if Coombs were correct on this point, the crack sales to Bines would still be relevant conduct. For drug offenses, relevant conduct includes conduct that was part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the count of conviction. USSG \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2). \u201cSame course of conduct\u201d and \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d are defined in Application Note 9 to \u00a7 1B1.3. Under Application Note 9(B), an offense may be part of the same course of conduct as the offense of conviction if it is part of \u201can ongoing series of offenses.\u201d Factors to be considered in making this determination are: \u201cthe degree of similarity of the offenses, the regularity (repetitions) of the offenses, and the time interval between the offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Coombs\u2019 sales of crack to Bines easily meet this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Coombs also argues that the quantities of crack he sold to Bines were not part of the offense of conviction because these amounts were not attributed to other members of the conspiracy for sentencing purposes. However, the calculation of Coombs\u2019 co-defendants\u2019 sentences is not relevant to the determination of the sentence in Coombs\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Finally, Coombs contests the 12.7 kilograms of cocaine powder attributed to him in the presentence report arguing that the testimony of witnesses Winston Simpson and Michelle Shelf was not sufficiently credible or reliable to support a finding that he was responsible for this amount of cocaine powder. This issue is moot because the district court did not make a finding concerning cocaine powder at Coombs\u2019 sentencing. In light of the court\u2019s determination that more than 1.5 kilograms of crack was properly attributed to Coombs\u2014which gave him the highest possible base offense level of 38 under \u00a7 2D1.1\u2014the quantity of cocaine powder Coombs distributed was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
