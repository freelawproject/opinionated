We dismiss the appeal for lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing DeVaughn\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>action was entered on the docket on July 3, 2002, and its order denying his motion for reconsideration under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) was entered on August 16, 2002. On February 14, 2003, DeVaughn filed his notice of appeal and a motion to reopen the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the district court granted DeVaughn\u2019s motion to reopen the appeal period, we find DeVaughn is not entitled to that relief. DeVaughn\u2019s motion of December 19, 2002 demonstrates that he learned of the district court\u2019s order denying reconsideration by that date. The plain language of Rule 4(a)(6) requires a motion to reopen be filed \u201cwithin 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 7 days after the moving party receives notice of the entry, <em>whichever is earlier\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Because DeVaughn\u2019s motion to reopen was filed more than seven days after he received notice of the order denying reconsideration, the district court lacked authority to reopen the appeal period. <em>See Hensley v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co., </em>651 F.2d 226, 228 (4th Cir.1981) (noting expiration of the time limits in Rule 4 deprives the court of jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal as untimely.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-19\">. <em>Bivens v.
