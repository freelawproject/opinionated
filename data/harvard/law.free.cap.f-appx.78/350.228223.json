Watts argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction because (1) of a break in the chain of custody of the heroin, (2) there was no evidence of intent to distribute, and (3) there was no evidence that he possessed the heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The determination of the authenticity of the heroin was within the province of the jury, and the jury apparently was satisfied as to the integrity of the chain of custody. <em>See United States v. Sparks, </em>2 F.3d 574, 582 (5th Cir.1993). Moreover, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, the testimony of Officers Gordon and Garnica and Melissa Taylor was sufficient to establish the authenticity of the heroin. <em>See id.; United States v. Bell, </em>678 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir.1982) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Although, under normal circumstances, a small amount of heroin would be indicative of personal use, a rational juror could have found based on the testimony of Gordon and Bernard Jones that, in a prison setting, the evidence established Watts\u2019 intent to distribute the heroin. <em>See Bell, </em>678 F.2d at 549. Watts\u2019 argument regarding the possession element is essentially a challenge to Gordon\u2019s credibility. As \u201c[t]he jury is the ultimate arbiter of witnesses\u2019 credibility and is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence,\u201d Watts\u2019 challenge to the possession element also fails. <em>United States v. Garza, </em>990 F.2d 171, 175 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Based on the foregoing, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
