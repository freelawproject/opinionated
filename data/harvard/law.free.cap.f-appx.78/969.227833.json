INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">The IJ ruled that Maqsood did not timely file his application for asylum. This ruling, which Maqsood has not challenged, is not reviewable by a court. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Accordingly, regarding denial of the asylum, the petition is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">Maqsood argues that the IJ erred in determinating that he was ineligible for withholding of removal, contending that the IJ did not correctly assess his testimony and mistook confusion for a lack of credibility. Maqsood has not demonstrated that the record compels a conclusion contrary to that of the IJ and therefore has not provided a basis for us to substitute our determination for that of the IJ concerning credibility or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 904 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">Maqsood also argues that the IJ erroneously denied his application for withholding of removal because evidence shows that he will suffer persecution if he returns to Pakistan. The IJ\u2019s conclusion that Maqsood did not establish a clear probability that he will be persecuted if he returns to Pakistan is supported by substantial record evidence. <em>See Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">Maqsood further argues that his case did not meet the BIA\u2019s requirements for issuance of an affirmance without opinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), and that the BIA\u2019s use of such summary procedure violated his due process rights. The due process argument is without merit. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003) (rejecting due process challenge to a similar summary affirmance procedure set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003(a)(7)). Furthermore, as the decision of the IJ was correct and does not raise any substantial factual or legal questions on appeal, that decision meets the criteria for a summary affirmance pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">DISMISS IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b999-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
