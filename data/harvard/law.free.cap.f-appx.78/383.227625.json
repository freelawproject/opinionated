The district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-24\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint. Taylor\u2019s allegations amounted to claims for negligence or medical malpractice, which are not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-25\">The district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous counts as one strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); <em>see Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996).
