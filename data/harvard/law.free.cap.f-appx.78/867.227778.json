(\u201cVATRO\u201d), filed an action against the Commonwealth of Virginia seeking a declaratory judgment that Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 46.2-1233.1 (Michie 2002), which limited the applicable fees for non-consensual towing, violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The district court granted Virginia\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground the action was barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-20\">VATRO argues neither the Eleventh Amendment nor the doctrine of sovereign immunity prohibits a claim in federal court that alleges a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause. While \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment can provide constitutional authorization for Congress to abrogate the States\u2019 immunity, <em>see Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, </em>517 U.S. 44, 59, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996), we reject VATRO\u2019s arguments that a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment may proceed against the State even in the absence of appropriate legislation under \u00a7 5. <em>See Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, </em>531 U.S. 356, 364, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001) (\u201c[H]owever, we held that \u2018the Eleventh Amendment, and the principle of state sovereignty which it embodies, are necessarily limited by the enforcement provisions of \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u2019 \u201d (citing <em>Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, </em>427 U.S. 445, 456, 96 S.Ct. 2666, 49 L.Ed.2d 614 (1976))).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-21\">To the extent VATRO argues it may proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 (2000), we reject these arguments. Lastly, VATRO argues it may proceed under the doctrine of <em>Ex parte Young, </em>209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908) (allowing for suit seeking injunctive or declaratory relief against state officials). However, the only defendant VATRO sued was the Commonwealth of Virginia, consequently <em>Ex parte Young </em>does not apply. <em>See Puerto Rico Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., </em>506 U.S. 139, 146, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993). Nor do we find the Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Verizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., </em>535 U.S. 635, 122 S.Ct. 1753, 152 L.Ed.2d 871 (2002), affects this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
