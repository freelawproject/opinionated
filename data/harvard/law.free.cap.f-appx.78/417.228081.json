Edwards argues that his initial search and seizure was illegal and that the indictment in his case was \u201cfatally flawed.\u201d Edwards also argues that the Attorney General and the Bureau of Prisons lack the authority to \u201cconstrain We the People.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-26\">Edwards has failed to identify a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense. His claims, therefore, do not satisfy the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and thus he is not entitled to utilize 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893 (5th Cir.2001). This appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). It is therefore dismissed. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-27\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
