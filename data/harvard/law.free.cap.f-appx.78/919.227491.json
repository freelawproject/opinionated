Ijogun argues the immigration judge misapplied the relevant burden of proof in reaching this conclusion and that the evidence did not support this finding. For the following reasons, we deny Ijogun\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-22\">First, we are unpersuaded that Ijogun preserved his objection to the immigration judge\u2019s characterization of the relevant burden of proof. Although the immigration judge indicated during Ijogun\u2019s hearing that the burden was on Ijogun to contest removability once the United States had made a \u201cprima facie case\u201d of abandonment, the record does not reflect an objection to this formulation either before the immigration judge or the BIA. Hence, review of this alleged error is waived. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-23\">Second, even if review of Ijogun\u2019s objection is appropriate, the materials in the joint appendix provide clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that Ijogun abandoned his permanent resident status, such that he did not qualify as a returning resident alien. <em>See Woodby v. INS, </em>385 U.S. 276, 286, 87 S.Ct. 483, 17 L.Ed.2d 362 (1966) (providing standard); <em>Khodagholian v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 1003, 1006 (9th Cir. 2003). The immigration judge\u2019s findings, which Ijogun has failed to contradict with compelling evidence, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>\u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000), demonstrate Ijogun\u2019s substantial ties to Nigeria and a dearth of ties to the United States, despite the fact that Ijogun received permanent resident status in 1984. Hence, Ijogun fails to demonstrate that the immigration judge\u2019s abandonment determination is \u201cmanifestly contrary to law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(C) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Accordingly, Ijogun\u2019s petition for review is denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
