They argue: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions; (2) the district court erred in allowing a federal agent\u2019s testimony about a co-defendant\u2019s admission in violation of <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 126-27, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), and Fed.R.Evid. 803(b)(3); (3) the district court abused its discretion in allowing expert testimony that amounted to impermissible opinion evidence; and (4) the prosecutor commented on the defendants\u2019 failure to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-24\">Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, there was sufficient evidence that both Lucio and Trevino knowingly participated in the marijuana conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Ortega Reyna, </em>148 F.3d 540, 543 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Dean, </em>59 F.3d 1479, 1485 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Inocencio, </em>40 F.3d 716, 720-21, 726 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-25\">Agent Michael Rubalcaba\u2019s testimony about co-defendant Juan Escamilla\u2019s confession, as redacted, did not pose a <em>Bruton </em>violation. <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 211, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987). Also, the testimony was admitted as evidence against only Escamilla and not Lucio or Trevino. <em>See United States v. Sarmiento-Perez, </em>633 F.2d 1092, 1096 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-26\">Agent Rubalcaba and Agent Ruben Garza\u2019s testimony about their experience with drug traffickers and the scout-car-cargo-car scenario did not amount to inadmissible opinion evidence and the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the testimony. <em>See United States v. Riddle, </em>103 F.3d 423, 429 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. Gutierrez-Farias, </em>294 F.3d 657, 662-63 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1114, 123 S.Ct. 869, 154 L.Ed.2d 789 (2003). Lastly, the prosecutor did not impermissibly comment on the appellants\u2019 failure to testify. <em>See Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number><em>ed States v. Dula, </em>989 F.2d 772, 776 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b970-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
