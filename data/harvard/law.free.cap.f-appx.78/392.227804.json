Coleman concedes that there is no constitutionally protected liberty interest in visitation but argues that his Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated by not being allowed to attend the disciplinary hearing after which he lost his visitation rights. Coleman also argues that, although he had no constitutional liberty interest in his prison job, prison regulations created a liberty interest. Because Coleman\u2019s claims that he was denied due process during the disciplinary proceedings call into question the validity of the punishment Coleman received, those claims are not cognizable in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. <em>See Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997); <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Coleman also argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint without an opportunity to amend or an evidentiary hearing. The district court did not err because Coleman has stated no viable claim. <em>See Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 326-27 (5th Cir.1999). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
