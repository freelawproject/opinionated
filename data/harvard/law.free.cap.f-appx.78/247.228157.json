Herriott\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the issues as to whether the district court complied with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Herriott\u2019s guilty plea, and whether the district court improperly sentenced Herriott as a career offender under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2001). Herriott has filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-25\">Following a de novo review of the record, we find that the district court complied with all the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Herriott\u2019s guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 402 (4th Cir.1995) (providing standard); Fed. R.Crim.P. 11. We also find that the district court did not commit reversible error in sentencing Herriott as a career offender under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. He was over eighteen years old when he committed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>instant felony offense, which involved a controlled substance, and he had two qualifying prior felony convictions. USSG \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record for potential error and have found none. We further find no merit to the claims raised in Herriott\u2019s pro se supplemental brief. Therefore, we affirm Herriott\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
