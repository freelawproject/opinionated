Wolete challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that his asylum application was untimely and that he failed to demonstrate a change in circumstances or extraordinary circumstances excusing the late filing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) (2000); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4), (5) (2003). We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this claim pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Castellano-Chacon v. INS, </em>341 F.3d 533, 544 (6th Cir.2003); <em>Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 185-86 (3rd Cir.2003); <em>Tsevegmid, v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1231, 1235 (10th Cir.2003); <em>Fahim v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217-18 (11th Cir.2002); <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Ismailov v. Reno, </em>263 F.3d 851, 854-55 (8th Cir.2001). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of Wolete\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-18\">Accordingly, we deny Wolete\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-19\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
