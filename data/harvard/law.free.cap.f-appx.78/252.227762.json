Galloway claims that the Government breached its plea agreement with him by failing to move for a downward departure or by failing to make a determination regarding Galloway\u2019s assistance to the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-22\">Our review of the plea agreement discloses that Galloway has specifically waived his right of appellate review in regard to this issue. As a consequence, we are without jurisdiction to consider the appeal, and we are compelled to dismiss it. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
