In June 1997, while Tercero was a pretrial detainee in Texas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>on state charges of burglary of a habitation, the Immigration and Naturalization Service lodged a detainer against him. Tercero filed a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 alleging that, by the terms of the detainer lodged against him, he should have been released from state custody into the custody of the INS within 48 hours of the detainer having been lodged. He also alleged that the Attorney General took technical custody of him at that time and that the Attorney General has engaged in affirmative misconduct by failing to remove him to Mexico within 90 days of having taken custody of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Tercero contends that the district court failed to liberally construe his <em>pro se </em>pleadings. We conclude that this contention is unsupported by the record. We further conclude that the INS detainer lodged against Tercero did not have the effect that he understood it to have. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.7(a) and (d). Tercero has not shown that the district court erred in dismissing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(4)(A); <em>Warren v. Miles, </em>230 F.3d 688, 691 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1003-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
