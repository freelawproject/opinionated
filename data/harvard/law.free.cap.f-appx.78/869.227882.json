We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Wright\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-18\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-21\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on December 9, 2003. Although the district court granted two thirty-day extensions, the court was without jurisdiction to extend the appeal period beyond the times provided in Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5). Wright\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on March 20, 2003,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> beyond the excusable neglect period for which the district court could properly grant an extension. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5)(C). Because Wright failed to file a timely notice of appeal, we dismiss the appeal. Moreover, because we lack jurisdiction over Wright\u2019s appeal, we decline to grant a certificate of appeal ability. We also deny Wright\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b899-19\"> For the purposes of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. <em>See </em>Fed.
