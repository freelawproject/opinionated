Ramos filed his motion based on Amendment 505 to the sentencing guidelines. Ramos\u2019s premise for his argument that his sentence would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>been lower had Amendment 505 been applied because this court determined on direct appeal that the district court committed harmless error when it enhanced his base offense level for possession of firearms is mistaken. In fact, this court held that the Government proved a sufficient nexus between Ramos\u2019s activities and the firearms to warrant the increase. <em>United States v. Ramos, </em>71 F.3d 1150, 1157 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Because the range of imprisonment that Ramos could have received would have remained the same had Amendment 505 been applied, he fails to show that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his motion. <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1009 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-42\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
