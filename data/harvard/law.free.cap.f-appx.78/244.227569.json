The order denied his motion to reconsider the Board\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen his deportation proceedings before the immigration judge whose previous denial of Addis\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal the Board affirmed. We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Addis\u2019s motion to reconsider. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2003). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review on the reasoning of the Board. <em>See In re: Addis, </em>No. A29697-658 (B.I.A. Mar. 4, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-18\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
