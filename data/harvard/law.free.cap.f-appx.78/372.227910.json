The district court determined that the suit was both untimely and barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-24\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, the district court is required to dismiss <em>sua sponte </em>any frivolous complaint filed by a prisoner against a \u201cgovernmental entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Rodriguez argues that dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A was error because the named defendants are two confidential informants who, though state actors for purposes of <em>Bivens, </em>were not \u201cgovernmental employees\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Even if the district court\u2019s dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A was error, it was harmless. The suit is clearly time-barred. <em>See Jacobsen v. Osborne, </em>133 F.3d 315, 319 (5th Cir.1998) (applicable limitations period is borrowed from the forum state); <em>see also </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.003(a) (West 1999) (Texas\u2019 applicable limitations period is two years). Rodriguez\u2019s cause of action accrued at the latest on the date of his conviction in 1993, but he waited to file the instant suit until 2002, nine years later. Thus, as the district court determined, the suit is untimely, and Rodriguez does not argue that it is not. Consequently, even if the district court erred in employing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A as the procedural vehicle for its dismissal, the error was harmless, and Rodriguez has not shown otherwise. <em>See Bazrowx v. Scott, </em>136 F.3d 1053, 1054 (5th Cir.1998). The district court\u2019s judgment is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
