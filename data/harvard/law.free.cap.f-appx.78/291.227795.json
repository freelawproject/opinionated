After reviewing the record, we hold that the IJ\u2019s finding of removability is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Mendes v. INS, </em>197 F.3d 6, 12-13 (1st Cir.1999) (IJ\u2019s denial of petition to remove conditional status on grounds of fraudulent marriage is reviewed for substantial evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-24\">We reject Shehu\u2019s argument that the Attorney General erred in allowing her to file a second Form-I-751 petition, as we conclude that the statute allows the Attorney General some flexibility in construing the applicable time limits. <em>See Matter of Nwokoma, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 899, 902 (BIA 1994). We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of a request for voluntary departure, as affirmed by the Board. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We grant the Attorney General\u2019s unopposed motion to strike a portion of the reply brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
