Burnett argues that the district court erred in including as relevant conduct for sentencing purposes his subsequent October 2000 arrest for possession of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-24\">Burnett has not shown that the district court clearly erred in including the October 2000 offense as relevant conduct; the offenses were sufficiently connected to warrant a conclusion that they were part of the same course of conduct. <em>See United States v. Ocana, </em>204 F.3d 585, 589-90 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
