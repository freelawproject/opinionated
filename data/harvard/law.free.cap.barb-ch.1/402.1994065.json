To authorize the filing of a creditor\u2019s bill, the execution must have been duly returned and filed with the clerk of the court from which such execution issued.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b402-9\">After the return of an execution unsatisfied, the plaintiff filed a creditor\u2019s bill against the judgment debtor, and thereupon the defendant and a third person gave a noto as collateral security for the payment of the debt and costs, but without discharging the judgment, or discontinuing the creditor\u2019s suit; the note not having been paid at maturity, a new judgment was recovered thereon against the judgment debtor and his surety; <em>Held </em>that it was improper to file an original creditor\u2019s bill, upon the last judgment, and to continue the proceedings in the first suit; but that the proper course was to file a supplemental bill.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-10\">The complainant recovered a judgment, and upon the return of an execution issued thereon unsatisfied, he filed a creditors bill against the defendant. The defendant thereupon procured the other defendant in the present suit to sign a note with him as collateral security for the debt and costs, or a part thereof, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the complainant agreed to stay the proceedings upon the creditor\u2019s bill until such note became due. The note not having been paid at maturity, the complainant brought a suit upon the note and recovered judgment in the superior court of the city of New-York against both defendants. He afterwards procured the judgment to be docketed in Queens county, and issued an execution to the sheriff of that county, who returned the execution tc the office of the clerk of Queens county, unsatisfied.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-6\"><em>R.

He also said that this was not a proper case for the filing of an original bill, upon the last judgment, and at the same time continuing the original suit in this court for the recovery of the same debt; that the complainant should either have dismissed his original bill, against one of these defendants, or have filed a supplemental bill, founded upon such original bill and upon the new facts; so that the whole matter could be disposed of together, in the original and supplemental suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Motion for receiver denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
