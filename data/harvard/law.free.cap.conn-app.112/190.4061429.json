We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The record reflects the following facts and procedural history. The defendant was operating a moped with a motor of less than fifty cubic centimeters on a public highway in the town of Lisbon on the evening of August 20, 2006. State police troopers observed the defendant traveling northbound on Route 12 in Lisbon on a moped at a speed of approximately thirty miles per hour. The moped was traveling in the right shoulder of the road and crossed over into the travel lane of the roadway several times. Trooper Mark Roberts testified that there appeared to be a light attached to the rear of the moped, but the light was difficult to see because it was hanging loosely off the back of the moped.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The troopers followed the moped for approximately one mile until the defendant turned into a restaurant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>parking lot, at which point the troopers drove into the same parking lot and approached the defendant. As Roberts spoke with the defendant about the taillight being a public safety concern, he noticed that the defendant had bloodshot eyes and an odor of alcohol on his breath. Roberts performed a series of field sobriety tests and placed the defendant under arrest. He was charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs under \u00a7 14-227a, operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license under \u00a7 14-215 and improper visibility of reflectors under \u00a7 14-96i.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Prior to his arrest, the defendant had been placed on probation for a second operating under the influence conviction and sentenced to two years incarceration, execution suspended after 120 days, and an unspecified period of probation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> One of the conditions of his probation was that the defendant was not to operate a motor vehicle while his license was suspended. A violation of probation hearing was held on November 21, 2006, at which time the court found that the defendant was under the influence at the time of his arrest. This finding was based on the officers\u2019 testimony about their observations of the defendant\u2019s performance on the field sobriety tests, his general demeanor and his refusal to take a Breathalyzer test. The court did not reach the ultimate issue of whether the defendant had violated his probation; instead, the court asked both parties to submit briefs on the issue of whether a moped with a motor of less than fifty cubic centimeters is a motor vehicle within the meaning of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">After the parties submitted their briefs, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>30, 2007, and issued an oral decision on February 9, 2007. The court concluded that the general definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 applied and that the vehicle at issue was not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under the operating under the influence and the operating under suspension statutes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The state claims that the court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Specifically, the state argues that a moped falls within the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 14-212, and, as such, the defendant could in fact be convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs and operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license while driving a moped on a public road. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\u201cAs a preliminary matter, we set forth the standard of review. A motion to dismiss . . . properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the [state] cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court. . . . A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction. . . . [0]ur review of the trial court\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [decision to] grant . . . the motion to dismiss will be de novo.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>98 Conn. App. 369, 377, 908 A.2d 1145 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">We note the well established principles of statutory interpretation. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case, including the question of whether the language does so apply. . . . When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Custer, </em>110 Conn. App. 836, 840, 956 A.2d 604 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The two statutes at issue are \u00a7 14-227a, pertaining to the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs, and \u00a7 14-215, pertaining to the operation of a motor vehicle while one\u2019s license or registration is refused, suspended or revoked. Section 14-227a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both. A person commits the offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both if such person operates a motor vehicle (1) while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both, or (2) while such person has an elevated blood alcohol content. . . .\u201d Section 14-215 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person to whom an operator\u2019s license has been refused, or, except as provided in section 14-215a, whose operator\u2019s license or right to operate a motor vehicle in this state has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>been suspended or revoked, shall operate any motor vehicle during the period of such refusal, suspension or revocation. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\u201cMotor vehicle\u201d is defined in \u00a7\u00a7 14-1 and 14-212. Section 14-1 is contained in chapter 246, which concerns the department of motor vehicles, the licensing and registration of motor vehicles and drivers\u2019 schools. Section 14-212 is contained in chapter 248, the \u201cvehicle highway use\u201d chapter. Sections 14-215 and 14-227a are also located in chapter 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Section 14-1 (a) (50) provides: \u201c \u2018Motor vehicle\u2019 means any vehicle propelled or drawn by any nonmus-cular power, except aircraft, motor boats, road rollers, baggage trucks used about railroad stations or other mass transit facilities, electric battery-operated wheel chairs when operated by physically handicapped persons at speeds not exceeding fifteen miles per hour, golf carts operated on highways solely for the purpose of crossing from one part of the golf course to another, golf-cart-type vehicles operated on roads or highways on the grounds of state institutions by state employees, agricultural tractors, farm implements, such vehicles as run only on rails or tracks, self-propelled snow plows, snow blowers and lawn mowers, when used for the purposes for which they were designed and operated at speeds not exceeding four miles per hour, whether or not the operator rides on or walks behind such equipment, <em>bicycles with helper motors as defined in section 14-286, </em>special mobile equipment as defined in subsection (i) of section 14-165, mini-motorcycle, as defined in section 14-289j, and any other vehicle not suitable for operation on a highway . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Section 14-212 (1) lists a series of terms that \u201cshall be construed as they are defined in section 14-1 . . . .\u201d The term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is not included in that list and is defined separately in \u00a7 14-212 (5), which provides: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u201c \u2018Motor vehicle\u2019 includes all vehicles used on the public highways . . . .\u201d Section 14-212 also provides that \u201c[t]erms used in this chapter shall be construed as follows, unless another construction is clearly apparent from the language or context in which the term is used or unless the construction is inconsistent with the manifest intention of the General Assembly . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A_l\">The state asserts that <em>State </em>v. <em>Knybel, </em>281 Conn. 707, 916 A.2d 816 (2007), which concerned whether all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) were covered by the operating while under suspension statute and which was published after the court\u2019s decision was issued, is controlling and that the broad definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d found in \u00a7 14-212 should be applied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court in <em>Kny-bel </em>held that an ATV, when used on a public highway, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 14-215 (c), concluding that the applicable definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d was found in \u00a7 14-212 (5) and not in \u00a7 14-1. Id., 716. The defendant asserts that the logic applied in <em>Knybel </em>does not apply to a moped and that the much narrower definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in \u00a7 14-1 should apply and should be found to exclude a moped. We disagree and find <em>Knybel </em>to be controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The defendant in <em>Knybel </em>claimed that \u00a7 14-215 (c) was unconstitutionally vague as it applied to the use of an ATV because it did not reasonably apprise him that operating an ATV constituted operating a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for the purposes of the statute. Id., 715. The court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim, initially noting that an ATV is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 14-215 (c) if it is a \u201cvehicle.\u201d Id. The court examined the two other definitions of ATV found in other chapters of the General Statutes, both of which define an ATV as a \u201cvehicle,\u201d and noted that the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d per \u00a7 14-212 (5), includes all vehicles used on the public highways. The court concluded that an ATV, when used on a public highway, is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 14-215 (c). Id., 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The court emphasized that \u201c[o]n its face, it is clear that the definition of \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 found in \u00a7 14-1 (a) (50) is applicable <em>only to the provisions in chapter 246 of the General Statutes. . . . </em>The statute at issue in the present case, \u00a7 14-215 (c), however, is contained in chapter 248 and thus is not implicated by the definition of\u2018motor vehicle\u2019 found in \u00a7 14-1 (a) (50). The limitation on the application of \u00a7 14-1 to chapter 246 is underscored by \u00a7 14-212. Section 14-212 defines the term \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 for purposes of chapter 248 generally and \u00a7 14-215 (c) specifically but incorporates by reference other definitions contained in \u00a7 14-1 in providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>that certain terms enumerated therein \u2018shall be construed as they are defined in section 14-1 . . . .\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 14-212 (1). The term \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 is not included in the list of terms found in \u00a7 14-212 (1) that shall be construed as they are defined in \u00a7 14-1. In fact, as we have noted, \u00a7 14-212 contains its own broad definition of \u2018motor vehicle.\u2019 In light of the conspicuous absence of the term \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 from the list of terms in \u00a7 14-212 (1) that are to be construed as they are defined in \u00a7 14-1, and the broad definition of \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 contained in \u00a7 14-212, which is specifically applicable to \u00a7 14-215 (c), it is clear that the definition of the term \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 in \u00a7 14-1 is not applicable to \u00a7 14-215 (c).\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Knybel, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 716-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">There is nothing in the <em>Knybel </em>court\u2019s reasoning that leaves any room to distinguish an ATV from a moped. In the present case, the court reasoned that the state could not prove that the defendant had violated the operating under the influence and operating while under suspension statutes because \u00a7\u00a7 14-227a and 14-215 (c) make reference to the operation of a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d while under the influence or while under suspension. The court concluded that because the defendant was operating only a twenty-nine cubic centimeter moped, and such vehicles were exempted from the definition of motor vehicle found in \u00a7 14-1, the defendant could not be convicted of operating a <em>motor vehicle </em>while under the influence or while under suspension.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>As the <em>Knybel </em>decision makes clear, however, the relevant definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d to be applied when determining if someone has violated \u00a7 14-215 is the much broader definition found in \u00a7 14-212. \u201c[T]he purposes of the two chapters in question are very different, thus requiring the need for a broader definition of the term \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 under the chapter concerning vehicle highway use, namely, chapter 248. Chapter 246 requires the registration of a certain class of vehicles that are to be operated within the state. Section 14-1 therefore contains a very limited definition of \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 that excludes most vehicles that are not traditionally operated on a public road. On the other hand, chapter 248 regulates the use of motor vehicles on public highways, and that necessarily requires a definition of \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 that includes all \u2018vehicles.\u2019 Therefore, the definition of \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 in chapter 248, when read in the context of the General Statutes as a whole, not only suggests a broad definition of the term \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 for purposes of chapter 248 but also that all \u2018vehicles\u2019 in the various chapters of the General Statutes are included within that term.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Knybel, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 717. This same logic applies to a conviction under \u00a7 14-227a, as that provision is also found in chapter 248, the vehicle highway use chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The defendant contends that mopeds should be distinguished from ATVs because ATVs are defined as \u201ca self-propelled vehicle\u201d; see General Statutes \u00a7 14-379; while a moped is not wholly self-propelled and in some cases must be propelled by the rider\u2019s own feet. This distinction makes no difference. Whether a vehicle is wholly self-propelled does not change whether it is a \u201cvehicle,\u201d and thus a \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d for the purposes of chapter 248; per \u00a7 14-212 (5), any vehicle that is driven on the public highways is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under chapter 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Furthermore, the defendant ignores the fact that a moped, or a bicycle with a helper motor, is <em>intended </em>to be used on the public highways, while the primary purpose of an ATV is to be driven off-road.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A bicycle with a helper motor is subject to licensing requirements and other regulations that do not apply to an ATV and which make the conclusion that the operating while under the influence statute, if applicable to an ATV, is most certainly applicable to a moped.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The judgment dismissing the charges against the defendant is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-96 provides: \u201cAppeals from the rulings and decisions of the Superior Court, upon till questions of law arising on the trial of criminal cases, may be taken by the state, with the permission of the presiding judge, to the Supreme Court or to the Appellate Court, in the same manner and to the same effect as if made by the accused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b216-10\"> The defendant also was charged with a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-96\u00cd, requiring visible lamp or reflectors on a vehicle, but the state entered a nolle prosequi on that charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b216-11\"> The parties and the court used the terms \u201cmoped\u201d and \u201cbicycle with a helper motor\u201d interchangeably. Because the parties stipulated that the defendant was operating a moped, for the purpose of consistency it will be referred to as a moped throughout this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">The defendant, however, contested at oral argument in this court that the parties had stipulated to the type of conveyance the defendant was operating, and claimed that \u201c[t]he record is ambiguous as to what the vehicle was\u201d and, as a result, that the record may be inadequate. The defendant claims that there was no stipulation that he was operating a bicycle with a helper motor and that the only stipulation was that the motor was less than fifty cubic centimeters. In fact, the transcript makes clear that defense counsel (who we note is different from the defendant\u2019s appellate counsel) did in fact stipulate that the defendant was operating a moped with a motor under fifty cubic centimeters. The transcript reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-13\">\u201cThe Court: And we\u2019ve\u2014we\u2019re going to\u2014my understanding is, also there\u2019s a stipulation that [the defendant] was operating a moped that was under fifty [cubic centimeters].

On December 15, 2006, the court had found that the defendant was not in violation of his probation because a moped was not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under the operating under the influence and the operating under suspension statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\"> The defendant asserts that <em>Knybel </em>cannot be applied retroactively to the facts of this case because it had not been published at the time the court issued its decision on his motion to dismiss. The defendant has not alleged that the state\u2019s proposed statutory construction is a violation of the due process vagueness principle, which occurs when \u201cunforeseeable state-court construction of a criminal statute is applied retroactively to subject a person to criminal liability for past conduct, the effect [of which] is to deprive him of due process of law in the sense of fair warning that his contemplated conduct constitutes a crime.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McGann, </em>199 Conn. 163, 177, 506 A.2d 109 (1986); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 439, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Merely because our courts have never been called on to decide this issue does not make the defendant not culpable. Regardless, it should have been foreseeable to the defendant that driving his moped on the public highways would have subjected him to the operation while under the influence and operation while under suspension laws. \u201c[T]he touchstone is whether the statute, either standing alone or as construed, made it reasonably clear at the relevant time that the defendant\u2019s conduct was criminal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vakilzaden, </em>272 Conn. 762, 769, 865 A.2d 1155 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">The statutes, which make clear that any vehicle on the public roads is subject to the driving while under the influence and driving while under suspension laws, gave the defendant fair notice that his conduct was, or at the very least may have been, prohibited at the time that he engaged in it. Furthermore, the <em>Knybel </em>court held that \u201c\u00a7 14-215 (c) affords a person of ordinary intelligence with fair warning that he is prohibited from operating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>an ATV on a public highway while his license is suspended. \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Knybel, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 717-18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\"> The court noted in its oral decision that the language in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dotson, </em>34 F.3d 882 (9th Cir. 1994), was instructive. In <em>Dotson, </em>the defendant was arrested while driving his moped under the influence of alcohol, and the court found that mopeds are vehicles only for the purposes of the Washington certificate of ownership, statute and not the driving while under the influence statute. Id., 883, 886. As the language and legislative history of the Washington statute are not similar to the statutes in question, we find the court\u2019s reliance on <em>Dotson </em>misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\"> \u201c \u2018All-terrain vehicle\u2019 means a self-propelled vehicle designed to travel over unimproved terrain and which has been determined by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles to be unsuitable for operation on the public highways which is not eligible for registration under chapter 246 . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-379.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">This definition is found in chapter 255 of the General Statutes, which is entitled \u201cSnowmobiles and All-Terrain Vehicles.\u201d We look to other chapters in this instance under the axiom that \u201c[i]n construing a statute, the court may look to other statutes relating to the same subject matter for guidance.\u201d <em>Petco Insulation Co. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>231 Conn. 315, 324, 649 A.2d 790 (1994). Our reference to statutes in other chapters of the General Statutes does not change our conclusion that the definitions found in \u00a7 14-212 apply to chapter 248, as we look first for guidance to the definitions in the chapter in which the statutes in question are located. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-212 (\u201c[t]erms in . . . chapter [248] shall be construed as follows, unless another construction is clearly apparent from the language or context in which the term is used\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b226-10\"> See General Statutes \u00a7 14-286 (b) (\u201c[n]o person shall ride a bicycle with a helper motor unless that person holds a valid motor vehicle operator\u2019s license. No person shall operate a bicycle with a helper motor at a rate of speed exceeding thirty miles per hour; nor shall any bicycle with a helper motor be operated on any sidewalk, limited access highway or turnpike\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">By contrast, an ATV is not permitted to be operated on a public highway except to cross it. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-387 (\u201c[n]o person shall operate a snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle in the following manner: (1) On any public highway, except such snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle, if operated by a licensed motor vehicle operator, may cross a public highway if the crossing is made at an angle of approximately ninety degrees to the direction of the highway and at a location where no obstruction prevents a quick and safe crossing, the snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle is completely stopped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>before entering the traveled portion of the highway and the driver yields the right-of-way to motor vehicles using the highway\u201d). The statutes do not require that a person hold a valid motor vehicle operator\u2019s license to drive an ATV, unless, as <em>Knybel </em>makes clear, it is driven on a public road.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
