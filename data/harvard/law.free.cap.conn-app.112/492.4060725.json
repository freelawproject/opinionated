The plaintiff, Sharon Brown, appeals from the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board (board) vacating the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner (commissioner) granting her application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The following facts and procedural history are necessary for our resolution of the plaintiffs appeal. The plaintiff, who began working for the defendant United Technologies Corporation, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Division (Pratt &amp; Whitney)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in 1978, was taking a walk on the Pratt &amp; Whitney grounds during her one-half hour unpaid lunch break on July 8, 2005, when she fell and sustained an injury to her right shoulder. The plaintiff, an employee of the shipping department, had been walking this particular path every day during her lunch break for ten years unless there was rainfall or the temperature was less than forty-eight degrees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff testified before the commissioner that she walked daily for the purpose of improving her health; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>she is a borderline diabetic and her physician recommended that she exercise. She also testified that her walking is purely voluntary, that she does not associate with any other Pratt &amp; Whitney employees during her walk, that when she walks she chums her arms up and down to get her heart rate higher and that she makes a concentrated effort to elevate her heart rate by walking at a rapid pace. She does not have to ask permission of her supervisor or anyone else at Pratt &amp; Whitney to take a lunchtime walk.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The plaintiff reported her injury to a supervisor and immediately sought medical attention at work. She was sent to the emergency room at Middlesex Hospital and a few days later visited her physician. She eventually learned that she had a tom tendon in her shoulder, and she received physical therapy for her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The plaintiff presented evidence at the hearing before the commissioner that she was totally incapacitated from July 9 through August 20, 2005. In his September 26, 2006 finding and award, the commissioner found that \u201c [t]he health of Pratt &amp; Whitney workers was surely enhanced by any type of reasonable physical activity pursued on company grounds during unpaid breaks by its employees.\u201d The commissioner further found that the plaintiffs walking on company grounds during her lunch break \u201cwas, under the within facts, \u2018incidental\u2019 to her employment, and, therefore, her right shoulder injury is found to be a compensable event,\u201d and also was not barred from compensation under the social-recreational exception to the act. Pratt &amp; Whitney filed a petition for review and a motion to correct the commissioner\u2019s decision; the motion to correct was denied by the commissioner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>On October 23, 2007, the board issued its opinion and vacated the commissioner\u2019s finding and award, concluding that the plaintiffs injury was not compensable. The board rejected the commissioner\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs injury was incidental to her employment and found no mutual benefit to both parties from the plaintiffs activities. The board further found that the commissioner\u2019s finding that \u201c[t]he health of Pratt &amp; Whitney workers was surely enhanced by any type of reasonable physical activity\u201d was \u201cunsupported by any probative evidence on the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The plaintiff argues that the board improperly concluded that her activities were not incidental to her employment. She did not address the issue of whether her injury arose out of her employment because she claims that Pratt &amp; Whitney concedes this; Pratt &amp; Whitney, however, disputes it. The plaintiff further argues that the social-recreational exception in \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (i) does not apply to bar compensation for her injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm the decision of the board not for the reason enunciated by the board but on the ground that the social-recreational exception of \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (i) bars coverage for the plaintiffs injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">We initially set forth the applicable standard of review. A party aggrieved by a commissioner\u2019s decision to grant or deny an award may appeal to the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The board \u201cis obliged to hear the appeal on the record and not retry the facts. . . . [T]he power and duty of determining the facts rests on the commissioner, the trier of facts. . . . The conclusions drawn by him from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spatafore </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>239 Conn. 408, 419, 684 A.2d 1155 (1996). \u201cOur scope of review of the actions of the board is similarly limited. . . . The role of this court is to determine whether the . . . [board\u2019s] decision results from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Parisi </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>89 Conn. App. 716, 722, 874 A.2d 852 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The plaintiff argues that she has satisfied the causal connection between her employment and her injury because she has established that her injury both arose out of her employment and in the course of her employment. Pratt &amp; Whitney asserts that the plaintiff has failed to satisfy both the \u201carose out of\u2019 and \u201cin the course of\u2019 prongs because her injury did not occur as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>a proximate cause of her employment and because she has failed to demonstrate that her daily walks were incidental to her employment. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">For her injury to be compensable, the plaintiff had to prove that it arose both out of her employment and in the course of her employment. \u201cIt is well settled that, because the purpose of the act is to compensate employees for injuries without fault by imposing a form of strict liability on employers, to recover for an injury under the act the plaintiff must prove that the injury is causally connected to the employment. To establish a causal connection, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the claimed injury (1) arose out of the employment and (2) in the course of the employment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spatafore </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 417-18. \u201cThe personal injury must be the result of the employment and flow from it as the inducing proximate cause. The rational mind must be able to trace resultant personal injury to a proximate cause set in motion by the employment and not by some other agency, or there can be no recovery.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ryker </em>v. <em>Bethany, </em>97 Conn. App. 304, 309, 904 A.2d 1227, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 932, 909 A.2d 958 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">We first conclude that the plaintiffs injury arose out of her employment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cProof that the injury arose out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>the employment relates to the time, place and circumstances of the injury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spatafore </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 418. \u201cSpeaking generally, an injury arises out of an employment when it occurs in the course of the employment <em>and </em>as a <em>proximate cause </em>of it. [Therefore] [a]n injury which is a natural and necessary incident or consequence of the employment, though not foreseen or expected, arises out of it. . . . [Conditions that arise out of employment are peculiar to [it], and not such exposures as the ordinary person is subjected to. It is therefore immaterial where the exposure originates, whether from the employment, or outside of it.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Labadie </em>v. <em>Norwalk Rehabilitation Services, Inc., </em>274 Conn. 219, 237-38, 875 A.2d 485 (2005). In <em>Spatafore, </em>our Supreme Court stated: \u201cA finding of a fact of this character [whether the injury arose out of the employment] is the finding of a primary fact. . . . This ordinarily and in this case presents a question for the determination of the commissioner and we have no intention of usurping his function. . . . This rule leads to the conclusion that unless the case lies clearly on the one side or the other the question whether an employee has so departed from his employment that his injury did not arise out of it is one of fact. . . . The [board] is, therefore, bound by the findings of fact made by the commissioner, unless additions, corrections or modifications of findings of fact are made . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spatafore </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>supra, 419-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Although the commissioner did not make an explicit finding that the plaintiffs injury arose out of her employment, it is implicit in the commissioner\u2019s finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the plaintiffs injury was compensable because compen-sability requires a finding that the injury arose both out of and in the course of employment. The board did not explicitly address the issue of whether the plaintiffs injury arose out of her employment in overturning the finding and award. On the basis of the facts found by the commissioner<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the great deference afforded to the commissioner, we cannot say that this case clearly lies on one side or the other of the issue of whether the plaintiff had so departed from her employment as to conclude that her injury did not arise out of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">We next address the issue of whether the plaintiffs injury occurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 her employment. The plaintiff asserts that her injury occurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 her employment because it occurred in the period of her employment, at a place that she may reasonably have been and while she was doing something \u201cincidental\u201d to her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">To satisfy the \u201cin the course of\u2019 test, the plaintiff must prove that the injury occurred \u201c(a) within the period of the employment; (b) at a place the employee may reasonably be; and (c) while the employee is reasonably fulfilling the duties of the employment or doing something incidental to it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 418. The plaintiffs injury occurred during the period of her employment<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and on her employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>premises, a place that she might reasonably have been, both of which Pratt &amp; Whitney concedes. Furthermore, the plaintiffs injury was sustained while she was doing something that was incidental to her employment, and she is, therefore, able to satisfy all three prongs of the \u201cin the course of\u2019 test. Pratt &amp; Whitney concedes that the plaintiff has satisfied the first two prongs of the \u201cin the course of\u2019 test but disputes that she was doing something \u201cincidental\u201d to her employment when she was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u201c[W]hen determining whether the activity is incidental to the employment, the following rule should be applied: If the activity is regularly engaged in on the employer\u2019s premises within the period of the employment, with the employer\u2019s approval or acquiescence, an injuiy occurring under those conditions shall be found compensable.\u201d <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>176 Conn. 547, 556, 398 A.2d 1161 (1979). \u201c[T]he term of art \u2018incidental\u2019 embraces two very different kinds of deviations: (1) a minor deviation that is \u2018so small as to be disregarded as insubstantial\u2019 . . . and (2) a substantial deviation that is deemed to be \u2018incidental to [employment]\u2019 because the employer has acquiesced to it.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Kish </em>v. <em>Nursing &amp; Home Care, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 379, 389, 727 A.2d 1253 (1999). \u201c[E]mployer acquiescence is a prerequisite to compensability <em>only </em>if the deviation previously has been determined to be substantial. Otherwise, [i]f the deviation is so small as to be disregarded as insubstantial, then the lack of acquiescence is immaterial.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kolomiets </em>v. <em>Syncor International Corp., </em>252 Conn. 261, 268, 746 A.2d 743 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In determining whether an activity is incidental to employment, \u201c[n]o exact statement, applicable in all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>cases, can be made as to what is incidental to an employment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kish </em>v. <em>Nursing &amp; Home Care, Inc., </em>supra, 248 Conn. 389. \u201cThe meaning of the term \u2018incidental\u2019 need not be defined as compulsion by or benefit to the employer in all cases.\u201d <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>supra, 176 Conn. 553. Although the act of eating lunch itself is considered to be incidental to employment; see <em>Vitas </em>v. <em>Grace Hospital Society, </em>107 Conn. 512, 516, 141 A. 649 (1928); as it is considered to be within the category of activities the \u201cperformance of which while at work are reasonably necessary to [the employee\u2019s] health and comfort\u201d; <em>Lovallo </em>v. <em>American Brass Co., </em>112 Conn. 635, 639, 153 A. 783 (1931); not every injury that occurs during a lunch period is necessarily incidental to one\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In this case, the commissioner found that \u201c[t]he [plaintiffs] injury was sustained on Pratt &amp; Whitney grounds during her work hours. . . . The employer was well aware and acquiesced in the fact that many of its employees and supervisors walked daily around the Pratt &amp; Whitney campus on lunch breaks. . . . The health of Pratt &amp; Whitney workers was surely enhanced by any type of reasonable physical activity pursued on company grounds during unpaid breaks by its employees.\u201d The board concluded that the commissioner improperly found that the plaintiffs injury was incidental to her employment. The board noted that \u201c[w]hile such activity may well be beneficial, the trial commissioner did not reach any subordinate finding of fact that the [plaintiffs] purpose in undertaking her physical fitness regimen was intended to benefit her employer.\u201d The board further concluded that \u201cthe subordinate facts and evidence in the record do not support a finding that the [plaintiffs] injury was incidental to her employment,\u201d noting that the commissioner\u2019s finding that the health of Pratt &amp; Whitney workers was surely enhanced by reasonable physical activity pursued on company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>grounds was inconsistent with the evidence in the record and unsupported by any probative evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">We find <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Connecticut Transit Co., </em>240 Conn. 788, 694 A.2d 1230 (1997), to be instructive on this issue. In <em>Mazzone, </em>the plaintiff, who was employed as a mechanic for the defendant transit company, was injured during his unpaid lunch break while he was eating his lunch on an out of service bus parked on the defendant\u2019s premises. Id., 790. Our Supreme Court found that the commissioner had incorrectly determined that the plaintiffs injuries were not incidental to his employment, noting that \u201c[e] a,ting in the lunch hour, and other personal acts . . . <em>are incidental </em>to the employment .... [I]t is not dispositive that the activity of eating lunch did not further the claimant\u2019s employment directly. Acts of ministration by a servant to himself, such as . . . relieving his hunger . . . performance of which while at work are reasonably necessary to his health and comfort, are incidents to his employment . . . though they are only indirectly conducive to the purpose of the employment.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Likewise, although the plaintiffs injury occurred while she was walking at an accelerated pace during her lunch break, which is not an activity that is directly conducive to her employment at Pratt &amp; Whitney, the activity was reasonably necessary to her personal comfort while at work. In addition, Pratt &amp; Whitney was aware that the plaintiff, and many other of its employees, walked during their lunch hour on its premises. When the activity in question is related to personal comfort, recreation, or horseplay and occurs regularly on the employer\u2019s premises, the activity becomes incidental if it is approved of or acquiesced in by the employer. See <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>supra, 176 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>555 (\u201c[I]t should not be necessary [in such cases] to bolster the case by adding proof of employer sponsorship of the activity or employer benefit therefrom. It is generally held sufficient that the activity is an accepted and normal one, since it thereby becomes a regular incident and condition of the employment.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Connecticut Transit Co., </em>supra, 240 Conn. 795 (noting other cases in which employer sanctioned activities were found to be incidental to employment). In light of the circumstances, we conclude that the commissioner correctly determined that the plaintiffs activities were incidental to her employment, and the board incorrectly determined that there were not sufficient subordinate facts to support this finding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Having determined that the plaintiffs injury satisfied the \u201carises out of\u2019 and \u201cin the course of\u2019 tests for compensability, we must next determine whether the social-recreational exception of \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (i) applies to preclude coverage for the plaintiffs injury. Even when a plaintiff has established that the injury arose out of and in the course of employment, the injury will not be compensable if \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (i) bars coverage. We conclude that the exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">\u201cIt is well established that [although not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and review board. ... A state agency is not entitled, however, to special deference when its determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>judicial scrutiny. . . . Where [a workers\u2019 compensation] appeal involves an issue of statutory construction that has not yet been subjected to judicial scrutiny, this court has plenary power to review the administrative decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Labadie </em>v. <em>Norwalk Rehabilitation Services, Inc., </em>supra, 274 Conn. 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">To determine whether the exclusion of \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (i) applies, we must determine whether the major purpose of the plaintiffs activity was recreational.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Neither this court nor our Supreme Court has had previous occasion to interpret the meaning of the term \u201crecreational\u201d in this context. \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hardt </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>95 Conn. App. 52, 57, 895 A.2d 846 (2006), aff'd, 281 Conn. 600, 917 A.2d 26 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">We look first to the text of the statute. Section 31-275 (16) (B) (i) provides that for the purposes of the act, \u201cpersonal injury\u201d or \u201cinjury\u201d shall not be construed to include \u201c[a]n injury to an employee that results from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the employee\u2019s voluntary participation in any activity the major purpose of which is social or recreational, including, but not limited to, athletic events, parties and picnics, whether or not the employer pays some or all of the cost of such activity . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">\u201cThe test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alexson </em>v. <em>Foss, </em>276 Conn. 599, 605, 887 A.2d 872 (2006). Neither party claims that the statute is ambiguous on its face; instead, both argue that \u00a7 1-2z should apply and that the plain meaning of the statute supports both of their claims. The plaintiff argues that because \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (i) plainly does not include the terms \u201chealth\u201d or \u201cexercise\u201d as specifically excluded activities, the statute should not be interpreted to exclude her activities. Pratt &amp; Whitney argues that the statute on its face excludes the plaintiffs injury but goes on to discuss an extratextuai definition of \u201crecreation\u201d in its analysis of how the statute plainly excludes the plaintiffs activity. Because the plain meaning of the statute cannot support both contentions, we conclude that the statute is ambiguous as to whether the recreational exception encompasses power walking or the like. Section 31-275 (16) (B) (i) does not define recreational, nor does it give an exhaustive list of which activities fall within that category. Because we conclude that the statute is ambiguous, we may consider extra-textual evidence to ascertain its meaning. See id., 606; see also <em>In re Kevin K., </em>109 Conn. App. 206, 213, 951 A.2d 39 (\u201c[hjaving concluded that the text is not clear and unambiguous, we now must turn to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter for intexpretive guidance\u201d [internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>marks omitted]), <em>cert. </em>granted on other grounds, 289 Conn. 930, 958 A.2d 159 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">We then turn to the legislative history of \u00a7 31-275. Section 31-275 is the definitions section of the act. The entire section was overhauled in 1991, and in 1993 subdivision (16) (B) was added to refine how not to construe the terms \u201cpersonal injury\u201d or \u201cinjury\u201d for the purposes of the act. See Public Acts 1991, No. 91-32; Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228. The discussion in the House of Representatives did not center on this particular change; it was focused on other aspects of the proposed amendments. The discussion was primarily one of striking the appropriate balance between ensuring that employees who are legitimately injured while at work are provided with sufficient coverage and not placing employers in the position of being forced to pay astronomical workers\u2019 compensation premiums. Representative Lucien A. DiMeo stressed that the amendment \u201cis a balance of equities.\u201d 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 18, 1993 Sess., p. 6202. It was also noted that the amendment \u201cchanges the compensability in some respects similar- to the bill that emerged from the Labor Committee but it goes far beyond those, involving . . . voluntary participation in sporting activities . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., p. 6147.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Representative DiMeo pointed out how this amendment would respond to a situation like the one in <em>McNamara, </em>in which the employee\u2019s injuries were deemed compensable when he was injured while playing Ping-Pong before work on his employer\u2019s premises. Representative DiMeo, presumably referring to <em>McNamara, </em>noted that with this amendment, the legislature was \u201ceven controlling that aspect of whether you have come to work and you are engaged in some sports activities. I can recall as Mayor, that we had, in our public works garage, some men brought in a Ping-Pong table. And they would come in a half-hour earlier or so before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>they had to punch in and no one really commented about it, one way or another and they would play a little Ping-Pong and it seemed pretty harmless for them to amuse themselves. One of them twisted his ankle and we thought, administratively, it was a little unusual that we would have the town to pay for his recreational injury, but we ended up having to pay for it. And we fought it. I thought it was ridiculous, but we did.\u201d Id., pp. 6201-6202. These remarks make clear that the amendment was intended to exclude <em>voluntary </em>participation in sporting activities, regardless of the specific nature of such activities. Coverage does not turn on whether the activity in question was group or solitary in nature. The legislature expressed no intention to preclude coverage for certain types of activities, such as softball games, but to allow coverage for similarly voluntary forms of exercise, such as running, simply because the former happens to take place as part of a group.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">We also look to the \u201ccommonly approved usage\u201d of \u201crecreational\u201d because the term is not defined in the statute. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Groton </em>v. <em>Mardie Lane Homes, LLC, </em>286 Conn. 280, 288, 943 A.2d 449 (2008). \u201cIf a statute or regulation does not sufficiently define a term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>283 Conn. 644, 656, 931 A.2d 142 (2007). Random House Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary defines \u201crecreation\u201d as \u201crefreshment by means of some pastime, agreeable exercise, or the like. ... [A] pastime, diversion, exercise, or other resource affording relaxation and enjoyment.\u201d Random House Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary (2d Ed. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">On the basis of the legislative history of the statute and the dictionary definition of \u201crecreation,\u201d we conclude that \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (i) precludes coverage for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>the plaintiffs injury in this case. The statute was enacted after <em>McNamara </em>and was clearly intended to eliminate coverage under the act for injuries that occurred in a similar manner, i.e., those that occurred while the employee was engaged in an act for his or her relaxation or enjoyment on the employer\u2019s premises, even when there was employer approval or acquiescence to do so. Section 31-275 (16) (B) (i) shifts the focus of the inquiry from employer approval or acquiescence, as in <em>McNamara, </em>to an examination of the purpose of the employee\u2019s actions before the employee\u2019s injury will be compensable. As noted on the floor of the House of Representatives, the act as a whole, and this subdivision in particular, is a difficult, but necessary, balance of equities. In addition, although the statute states that social or recreational activities include, but are not limited to, athletic events, parties and picnics, this illustrative list does not exclude walking or power walking as recreational activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Furthermore, the dictionary definition supports excluding coverage for the plaintiffs injury. The definition of \u201crecreation\u201d twice mentions the word \u201cexercise.\u201d The plaintiff was undisputedly engaged in \u201cexercise\u201d when she chose to spend her daily lunch breaks, weather permitting, walking at a rapid pace and churning her arms up and down to increase her heart rate. This exercise was also unquestionably solely for the plaintiffs benefit. The plaintiff testified before the commissioner: \u201cI\u2019m a borderline diabetic, so I walk for my health and to get exercise instead of sitjting] all day. \u201d She further testified: \u201cI walk for my health because it\u2019s in my family. My mother died and my sister has diabetes. And my doctor recommended that I do exercise.\u201d The plaintiff admitted, and the board found, that her decision to walk during her lunch hour was purely voluntary, and there was no evidence in the record that Pratt &amp; Whitney promoted this activity or encouraged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>employees to participate. The plaintiff was surely afforded \u201crefreshment\u201d from her daily walks.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">A review of the case law from other jurisdictions, while not binding, is also instructive. In <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>70 S.W.3d 468, 469 (Mo. App. 2001), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Hampton </em>v. <em>Big Boy Steel Erection, </em>121 S.W.3d 220 (Mo. 2003), the employee, who had been walking during his lunch break for eight years on the employer\u2019s premises, tripped and was injured during one of his daily walks.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court found that the employee sustained his injuries while participating in a recreational activity and, therefore, that the injuries were not compensable. Id., 472. Where the plaintiff, a salesperson for an automobile dealership, was injured riding a co-worker\u2019s motorcycle on the sales lot while waiting for customers, the Oregon Supreme Court noted that \u201cthere [was] little dispute that, in the context of this case, riding the motorcycle was a \u2018recreational activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>SAIF Corp., </em>341 Ore. 48, 52, 136 P.3d 1105 (2006) (precluding coverage for injury where statute provided that compensable injury did not include \u201c[i]njury incurred while engaging in or performing, or as the result of engaging in or performing, any recreational or social activities primarily for the worker\u2019s personal pleasure\u201d). Other cases have referred to a daily walk during one\u2019s lunch break as \u201can act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>recreational diversion of [one\u2019s] own free choice . . . .\u201d <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Commission, </em>39 Cal. 2d 529, 535, 247 P.2d 707 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">We are also not persuaded by the plaintiffs argument that it is \u201cunimaginable that the legislature intended to exclude coverage for an activity that benefits one\u2019s health yet maintain coverage for smoking.\u201d The plaintiff is referring to cases such as <em>Puffin </em>v. <em>General Electric Co., </em>132 Conn. 279, 282, 43 A.2d 746 (1945), in which an employee\u2019s injury was held to be compensable when it occurred while the employee was smoking during a designated rest period. This argument ignores that coverage does not turn on whether the activity is beneficial to one\u2019s health; coverage in such cases turns on whether the activity in question is incidental to one\u2019s employment and has nothing to do with whether the activity is recreational in nature.

The commissioner did not make a specific finding as to whether the plaintiffs injury arose out of her employment, and the board addressed only the issue of whether the plaintiffs injury occurred in the course of her employment and did not discuss whether her injury arose out of her employment. The plaintiff alleges that Pratt &amp; Whitney conceded that the plaintiffs injury arose out of her employment, but Pratt <em>&amp; </em>Whitney disputes this. As noted in footnote 3, one of the proposed findings in Pratt <em>&amp; </em>Whitney\u2019s motion to correct was a finding that the plaintiff did not sustain an injury that \u201carose in the course of her employment . . . We are unclear if this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>proposed finding was intended to address the \u201carose out of\u2019 prong or the \u201cin the course of\u2019 prong.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\"> The commissioner found that the plaintiff was walking during her lunch break on the grounds of Pratt &amp; Whitney and remained on the grounds at all times.
