Moore, appeals from the judgment of the trial court revoking his probation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32, following his arrest on charges of sale of narcotics in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a), possession of marijuana in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (c), use of drug paraphernalia in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-267 (a) and possession of narcotics within 1500 feet of a school in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (d). On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) a search of his apartment by his probation officer violated his rights under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution, (2) the evidence was insufficient for the court to conclude that the defendant had violated his probation and (3) the court abused its discretion in revoking the defendant\u2019s probation. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>disagree and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Our review of the defendant\u2019s appeal is based on the following facts. The defendant pleaded guilty on July 14, 2005, to sale of narcotics in violation of \u00a7 21a-277 (a). On October 14, 2005, the court convicted the defendant of the charge and sentenced him to five years incarceration, execution suspended, and five years probation. The standard conditions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the defendant\u2019s probation included that he refrain from violating \u201cany criminal law of the United States, this state or any other state or territory\u201d and required him to \u201c[s]ubmit to any . . . urinalysis, alcohol and/or drug testing, and or counseling sessions as required by the Court or the Probation Officer.\u201d The conditions of probation further required the defendant to \u201c[s]ubmit to a search of [his] person, possessions, vehicle or residence when the Probation Officer has a reasonable suspicion to do so.\u201d In addition to these standard conditions, the court ordered various special conditions, including that the defendant participate in \u201csubstance abuse evaluation and/or treatment.\u201d On three separate occasions, the defendant signed a form detailing the conditions of his probation and indicating that he understood and agreed to abide by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">On July 11, 2006, the defendant voluntarily submitted a urine sample to his probation officer, Thomas Yoxall, who collected the sample for purposes of a random drug test. The test results showed the presence of cocaine and marijuana. Yoxall determined that the defendant was not attending substance abuse treatment contrary to the defendant\u2019s conditions of probation and the defendant\u2019s reports to Yoxall. In mid-August, 2006, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>a colleague of Yoxall, while conducting a home visit with the defendant\u2019s wife, observed the defendant acting nervously and attempting to conceal drug paraphernalia present in the apartment. On the basis of the test and his colleague\u2019s report, Yoxall and two additional probation officers conducted a search of the defendant\u2019s apartment on August 29, 2006, the date of the defendant\u2019s next scheduled reporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Yoxall\u2019s search of the defendant\u2019s apartment revealed nine bags of a substance later determined to be crack cocaine, a digital scale and bags commonly used for distributing narcotics and additional drug paraphernalia. The probation officers contacted local law enforcement. Officer Joseph Dews of the Waterbury police department arrived and arrested the defendant on a charge of possession of narcotics with intent to sell. In a search of the defendant\u2019s person, Dews found a small plastic bag containing what was later confirmed to be marijuana. Yoxall testified that when the narcotics initially were found, the defendant\u2019s wife, who was present during the search, told the defendant that she was \u201csick of this stuff\u2019 and that the defendant \u201chung his head\u201d in response. Dews testified that the defendant told him that the drugs belonged to him and that they did not belong to his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">On March 2 and 8, 2007, the court, <em>Trombley, J., </em>held a violation of probation hearing. Following the hearing, during which Yoxall and Dews testified, the court rendered judgment finding that the defendant had violated his probation. The court held that Yoxall\u2019s search of the defendant\u2019s apartment was justified by the defendant\u2019s failed drug test and the colleague of Yoxall\u2019s observation of drug paraphernalia in the defendant\u2019s apartment. The court further noted that the defendant was aware of the conditions of his probation, having acknowledged them on three previous occasions in writing. The court revoked the defendant\u2019s probation and sentenced him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>to five years incarceration. The defendant subsequently appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The defendant first claims that Yoxall violated his fourth amendment rights when Yoxall searched his apartment without a search warrant. The defendant contends that as a result, the exclusionary rule should have applied to bar the state from introducing evidence discovered during the search at his violation of probation hearing. The defendant failed to preserve this issue for appeal and seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We afford the defendant\u2019s claim review because the record is adequate for review, and the claim is of constitutional magnitude, as it implicates the defendant\u2019s right to be free of unreasonable searches. See <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>207 Conn. 565, 570, 541 A.2d 504, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 898, 109 S. Ct. 242, 102 L. Ed. 2d 230 (1988). However, because we conclude that no constitutional violation exists, the defendant\u2019s claim fails to satisfy Golding\u2019s third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The defendant\u2019s terms of probation required that he refrain from violating any criminal laws and that he \u201c[s]ubmit to a search of [his] person, possessions, vehicle or residence when the Probation Officer has a reasonable suspicion to do so.\u201d Thus, to justify his search of the defendant\u2019s apartment, Yoxall needed a reasonable suspicion that the defendant had violated the terms of his probation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 174, 540 A.2d 679 (1988). \u201cThe reasonable suspicion standard requires no more than that the authority acting [here the defendant\u2019s probation officer] be able to point to specific and articulable facts that, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant a belief . . . that a condition of [probation] has been or is being violated.\u201d (Internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>omitted.) Id. Prior to searching the defendant\u2019s apartment, Yoxall knew that the defendant had used cocaine and marijuana due to the defendant\u2019s failed urinalysis. He also was aware that the defendant had not attended substance abuse treatment in accordance with the terms of his probation. In addition, in the week prior to the search, Yoxall\u2019s colleague had observed the defendant attempting to hide drug paraphernalia present in his apartment. Considering the foregoing, Yoxall had ample basis for a reasonable suspicion that the defendant had violated the terms of his probation. The defendant was aware of and had signed and agreed to the standard term of his probation that provided that his probation officer could search his premises any time the officer had a reasonable suspicion to do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the search of the defendant\u2019s apartment pursuant to the terms of the defendant\u2019s probation was reasonable given the circumstances and did not violate the defendant\u2019s fourth amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Even if we were to determine that Yoxall did not have a reasonable suspicion for his search, the defendant\u2019s suppression claim is unavailing because the exclusionary rule does not apply to revocation of probation hearings. This court has considered the question of whether a trial court properly applied the exclusionary rule to suppress evidence in a probation revocation hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuessenich, </em>50 Conn. App. 187, 190, 717 A.2d 801 (1998), cert. denied, 247 Conn. 956, 723 A.2d 813, cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1004, 119 S. Ct. 2339, 144 L. Ed. 2d 236 (1999), the defendant\u2019s probation officer required the defendant to submit to a urinalysis, which ultimately showed the presence of cocaine in the defendant\u2019s system. The conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation required him to refrain from violating \u201c \u2018any criminal law.\u2019 \u201d Id. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the subsequent violation of probation charge and to exclude evidence of the test results, claiming that the probation officer had violated his fourth amendment rights in requiring him to submit to the test. Id. The trial court agreed with the defendant, excluded evidence of the test results and dismissed the violation of probation charge. Id., 191. Thereafter, the state appealed, arguing that the exclusionary rule did not apply to revocation of probation proceedings and, therefore, that the court improperly excluded the evidence. Id., 196-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Our analysis in <em>Fuessenich </em>was guided by our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 565. In <em>Payne, </em>the court considered whether the exclusionary rule applies to probationary proceedings when the evidence sought to be excluded was obtained by a police officer acting unaware of the defendant\u2019s probation status and without a search warrant. The <em>Payne </em>court noted that \u201c[t]he purpose of the exclusionary rule is not to redress the injury to the privacy of the search victim .... Instead, the rule\u2019s prime purpose is to deter future unlawful police conduct and thereby effectuate the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 570, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 347, 94 S. Ct. 613, 38 L. Ed. 2d 561 (1974). The court held that the exclusionary rule would have only a marginal effect at best in deterring illegal police activity in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>circumstances presented because the use of evidence in a revocation of probation hearing is outside the officer\u2019s zone of primary interest. <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 571. The court specifically did not reach the question of \u201cwhether the exclusionary rule would apply in probation revocation proceedings when the police officer who had conducted the search was aware or had reason to be aware of the suspect\u2019s probationary status.\u201d Id., 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">After recounting the salient portions of <em>Payne, </em>this court distinguished the circumstances under review in Fuessenich: \u201cHere, it was not a police officer, but, rather, the defendant\u2019s probation officer who required the defendant to submit a urine sample for drug testing. The fact that the probation officer obviously knew of the defendant\u2019s probationary status does not make this case analogous to that of a police officer who is aware that a person is on probation. There was no police participation in requiring the defendant to submit to urinalysis, and the probation officer was acting in accordance with conditions to which the defendant had agreed at the initial meeting of the defendant and the probation officer. Probation officers act under the auspices of the judicial branch in requiring the defendant to submit to conditions of probation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>[229 Conn. 385, 393, 641 A.2d 1351 (1994)]. Indeed, as <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith </em>[supra, 207 Conn. 162-69] makes clear, the probation process operates as an arm of the judiciary, not of the police or prosecution. . . . Thus, when aprobation officer demands aprobationer\u2019s compliance with a condition of probation, he or she is acting as a representative of the judicial branch and not as a police officer. Applying the exclusionary rule to probation revocation hearings would make it more difficult for probation officers to perform properly their job of helping to ensure the rehabilitation of offenders. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>\u201cThe purpose of the exclusionary rule, to discourage improper police procedure, would not be furthered by applying the exclusionary rule to probation revocation hearings and is inapplicable to the present case. Because <em>Payne </em>instructs that the exclusionary rule does not apply to probation revocation hearings, the trial court\u2019s suppression of the urinalysis was improper.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuessenich, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 198-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In the present case, although the police were present eventually and did arrest the defendant, the primary search was performed by Yoxall, the defendant\u2019s probation officer, and two other probation officers. Further, the present case presents circumstances similar to those in <em>Fuessenich. </em>In that case, we determined that under our Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Payne </em>and the circumstances presented, the exclusionary rule did not apply to probation revocation hearings. Here, the defendant seeks to apply the rule to exclude from his violation of probation hearing evidence obtained during the course of his probation officer\u2019s search of his apartment. Under our holding <em>in Fuessenich, </em>the defendant\u2019s claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">We conclude that the defendant\u2019s probation officer possessed a reasonable suspicion to search the defendant\u2019s apartment, and, therefore, the search did not violate the defendant\u2019s right under the fourth amendment to be free from unreasonable searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">The defendant next claims that the evidence was insufficient for the court to find that he had violated his probation. He argues that the record does not support the court\u2019s conclusion that he possessed narcotics because there was no evidence that he was in exclusive control of the apartment where the narcotics were discovered. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>\u201c[A] trial court may not find a violation of probation unless it finds that the predicate facts underlying the violation have been established by a preponderance of the evidence at the hearing\u2014that is, the evidence must induce a reasonable belief that it is more probable than not that the defendant has violated a condition of his or her probation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>229 Conn. 285, 302, 641 A.2d 370 (1994). \u201cIn making its factual determination, the trial court is entitled to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McElveen, </em>69 Conn. App. 202, 205, 797 A.2d 534 (2002). \u201cA challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is based on the court\u2019s factual findings. The proper standard of review is whether the court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous based on the evidence. ... A court\u2019s finding of fact is clearly erroneous and its conclusions drawn from that finding lack sufficient evidence when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hooks, </em>80 Conn. App. 75, 80-81, 832 A.2d 690, cert. denied, 267 Conn. 908, 840 A.2d 1171 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The evidence before the court was sufficient for its finding that the defendant had violated the terms of his probation. First, the state offered evidence that the defendant had failed a urinalysis. Second, Yoxall testified that the defendant had not been attending substance abuse treatment as required by the terms of his probation. Third, Yoxall\u2019s search of the defendant\u2019s apartment revealed narcotics and evidence of an intention on the part of the defendant to sell those narcotics. The defendant also was found to have marijuana on his person. In addition, Dews testified that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>admitted that the narcotics belonged to him, and specifically did not belong to his wife, the other occupant of the apartment. The court also heard testimony as to the reaction of the defendant\u2019s wife upon the finding of the narcotics, from which the court was entitled to draw the reasonable and logical conclusion that the contraband belonged to the defendant. We conclude that the court\u2019s finding that the state had proven that the defendant had violated his probation by a preponderance of the evidence was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court abused its discretion in revoking his probation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">\u201cThe standard of review of the trial court\u2019s decision at the [dispositional] phase of the revocation of probation hearing is whether the trial court exercised its discretion properly by reinstating the original sentence and ordering incarceration. ... In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling. . . . Reversal is required only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>286 Conn. 367, 377, 944 A.2d 276 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">\u201cOn the basis of its consideration of the whole record, the trial court may continue or revoke the sentence of probation . . . [and] . . . require the defendant to serve the sentence imposed or impose any lesser sentence. ... In making this second determination, the trial court is vested with broad discretion. ... In determining whether to revoke probation, the trial court shall consider the beneficial purposes of probation, namely rehabilitation of the offender and the protection of society. . . . The important interests in the probationer\u2019s liberty and rehabilitation must be balanced, however, against the need to protect the public.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hedge, </em>89 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>App. 348, 351, 873 A.2d 254, cert. denied, 274 Conn. 917, 879 A.2d 894 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our review of the defendant\u2019s claim. Yoxal testified at the violation of probation hearing that despite the defendant\u2019s failure to attend the substance abuse treatment previously detailed, he was provided an additional opportunity in another treatment program. Yoxall indicated that the defendant again failed to attend required treatment sessions. Yoxall also testified that the defendant had had multiple positive tests indicating drug use over the course of his probation. Evidence of the defendant\u2019s criminal record, which included multiple narcotics convictions and two prior violations of probation, was also before the court. On the basis of this evidence, including the pending charges facing the defendant, the court concluded that neither further probation nor a lesser sentence would serve any useful rehabilitative purpose. Accordingly, the court revoked the defendant\u2019s probation and reinstated the five year sentence originally imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Our review of the record leads to our determination that the court did not abuse its discretion in revoking the defendant\u2019s probation and reinstating his original sentence of incarceration. The court had substantial evidence that while the defendant was on probation, he was engaged actively in the criminal activity for which he had been convicted in October, 2005: possession of narcotics with the intent to sell. The evidence that the defendant had tested positive for drug use on multiple occasions demonstrated that he was not abiding by the terms of his probation. Affording every reasonable presumption to the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling, as we must, we conclude that the court\u2019s decision was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-8\"> Standard conditions of probation are imposed on ail probationers. The probationer must sign a form detailing these conditions, indicating that the probationer has read, understood and agreed to abide by them. See JD-AP-110 (Rev. July, 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b599-7\"> In Ms reply brief, the defendant argues that the standard conditions of probation are a contract of adhesion. He contends that because \u201cthe conditions of probation are set either by a prosecutor or the court . . . the defendant is in a weak position and has little choice about the terms or conditions of his probation.\u201d The defendant was convicted after he pleaded guilty to the charges against him, knowing that he would be placed on probation and that the standard conditions of such probation would apply. He was free to accept this plea agreement or to reject it and to proceed to trial. Under these circumstances, we do not believe that a contract of adhesion analysis is appropriate. Such analysis is generally reserved for contractual agreements in business situations in which one party to the contract is left with virtually no choice but to agree to its terms due to the party\u2019s substantially lesser bargaining power.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
