It is undisputed that, because this restriction was an encumbrance on the property, the plaintiff buyer is entitled to recover damages for breach of warranty under the warranty deed. See <em>Aczas </em>v. <em>Stuart Heights, Inc., </em>154 Conn. 54, 60, 221 A.2d 589 (1966). The defendant maintains, however, that the trial court improperly declined to hold that discovery of the restrictive covenant by the plaintiffs attorney prior to the closing barred the plaintiff from recovering additional damages for breach of the warranty contained in the contract for the sale of the property. In the absence of any evidence that this discovery was disclosed to the plaintiff until many years after the closing, the court rejected this contention. We agree with this ruling and the court\u2019s assessment of damages against the defendant. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>In an amended two count complaint filed July 7,2005, the plaintiff, Janice Anne Kosinski, brought an action against the defendant, Angela O. Carr, to recover damages and attorney\u2019s fees for breach of warranty and breach of contract with respect to the conveyance of certain residential real estate in Norwalk. The plaintiff sought monetary damages to compensate for the failure of the defendant\u2019s warranty deed and of the underlying contract of sale to disclose the existence of a restrictive covenant that barred the plaintiff from subdividing the property into two building lots. The defendant denied her liability and filed a number of special defenses and a counterclaim including an allegation that timely discovery of the restrictive covenant by the plaintiffs attorney barred the plaintiffs reliance on this defect in the title. In response, the plaintiff denied that her attorney had disclosed his title review to her before the closing. After a trial to the court, the court found the issues in favor of the plaintiff. It awarded her damages of $100,000 for breach of warranty in the warranty deed and $96,041.74 in attorney\u2019s fees for breach of contract. In addition, the court awarded interest and costs to the plaintiff with respect to an offer of judgment filed by the plaintiff on June 22, 2004. See Practice Book (2004) \u00a7 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Although the defendant purports to be challenging many parts of the court\u2019s judgment, in this appeal she has pursued only three specific claims, none of which challenges the propriety of the court\u2019s award of $100,000 to the plaintiff on her claim of breach of warranty under the deed that conveyed the property to her.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Contesting only the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees for breach of contract, the defendant maintains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>that the court improperly (1) declined to hold that the plaintiff had constructive knowledge of the restrictive covenant of which her attorney had actual knowledge, (2) rejected her claim that the contract was unenforceable because there was no meeting of the minds with respect to the undisclosed restrictive covenant and (3) abused its discretion in setting the amount of attorney\u2019s fees that it awarded to the plaintiff. We disagree with each of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The court\u2019s careful and detailed memorandum of decision contains the following undisputed findings of fact. The defendant took title to the property in dispute following the death of her husband, Howard Carr. The property had been conveyed to her husband and his former wife in a 1955 deed that included a proviso that \u201cthe premises . . . shall not be subdivided for the purposes of sale . . . .\u201d Attorney Howard Ignal represented the defendant during the settlement of her husband\u2019s estate and, in that connection, received a copy of the 1955 deed. Ignal also represented the defendant when she decided to sell the property to the plaintiff and largely prepared both the contract of purchase and sale and the subsequent warranty deed. Neither of these documents made any reference to the restrictions contained in the 1955 deed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The plaintiff and her husband, Robert Kosinski, were represented by attorney Paul D. Plotnick in this real estate transaction. Plotnick reviewed the contract for purchase and sale and added a rider thereto. Prior to the closing, when he searched the title to the property in the Norwalk land records, Plotnick noted the restrictive covenants in the 1955 deed. He did not, however, disclose the existence of this restriction to his clients, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>the defendant or to Ignal. Ignal never asked Plotnick for this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In preparing the warranty deed conveying the property to the plaintiff, Ignal relied on a \u201ctitle report\u201d from Plotnick that referred to a lis pendens and to taxes, but did not contain any information about the subdivision restriction. Ignal did not review the terms of the 1955 deed that he had received from the defendant when she inherited the property, and he did not perform a title search.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Following the plaintiffs purchase of the property, her husband made efforts to subdivide it. Although he succeeded in getting the necessary approval from the local planning and zoning commission, he subsequently learned about the deed restrictions in the plaintiffs chain of title. He then, for the first time, was informed about these restrictions by Plotnick. Fearing litigation, the plaintiff and her husband abandoned their subdivision plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">In a determination that has not been challenged in this appeal, the court concluded that the plaintiff had sustained her burden of proof that the restriction in the 1955 deed was valid and enforceable. That showing entitled the plaintiff to recover damages of $100,000 for breach of the warranty deed to reflect the diminished value of property that cannot be subdivided. The court declined, however, to award either consequential or incidental damages to the plaintiff on this count of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The court also determined that the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages on the second count of her complaint, in which she sought attorney\u2019s fees and costs in accordance with a provision for such damages in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>the contract of sale.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court\u2019s award of $96,041.74 reflected its decision to reduce the recoverable amount to reflect the legal work that did not arise out of enforcement of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The defendant\u2019s appeal challenges this award of attorney\u2019s fees on two grounds. She maintains that the court improperly (1) rejected her contention that Plotnick\u2019s actual knowledge of the undisclosed restriction on subdivision barred any contractual recovery by the plaintiff and (2) awarded attorney\u2019s fees that were excessive. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The defendant has proffered two arguments for reversal of the court\u2019s award of <em>any </em>attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff. She maintains that the court improperly faulted the manner in which she asserted her defense of \u201cunclean hands,\u201d in which she argued that the discovery of the restrictive covenant by Plotnick before the closing justified denial of a remedy to the plaintiff for breach of contract. She further maintains that, if the court properly had addressed the issue, she should have prevailed on the merits of her argument that the plaintiff should be held to have had constructive knowledge of information known to her attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">In its memorandum of decision, the court expressly declined to consider the merits of the defense of unclean hands because, in the operative pleadings, the defendant had alleged that Plotnick\u2019s title search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>improperly \u201cfailed to disclose\u201d the encumbrance on the land records. The court observed that this allegation was the opposite of the argument \u201cbeing made for the first time in the posttrial papers that attorney Plotnick did know of the encumbrance.\u201d The court further noted the absence of any posttrial effort by the defendant to amend her pleadings. Finally, on the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, the court observed that there might be \u201ccountervailing arguments.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">On appeal, the defendant faults the court\u2019s decision by asserting that the defense of unclean hands need not be pleaded specially and by suggesting, at even greater length, that the court abused its discretion by failing, sua sponte, to order amendment of the pleadings to conform to the proof. The plaintiff properly disputes these claims by referring to the absence of supporting authority in the cases on which the defendant relies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>We agree that the defendant has cited no persuasive authority for the proposition that, in the absence of a request on her own part, the court had an obligation to take the corrective action that she was warned to take and yet failed to take.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The court\u2019s memorandum of decision does not identify the \u201ccountervailing arguments\u201d that the court also considered in declining to rule on the defense of unclean hands. We note, however, that this defense is premised on the contention that the plaintiff had timely constructive knowledge of the restrictive covenant because Plot-nick discovered the restrictive covenant prior to the execution of the <em>contract </em>for the sale of the property. We agree with the plaintiff that the record does not support this contention. Plotnick testified that he conducted the title search <em>after </em>he had received the fully executed contract of sale.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Consistent with this testimony, the court found that Plotnick conducted the search before the <em>closing. </em>There is, therefore, no finding that Plotnick\u2019s search predated the signing of the contract. If, in the defendant\u2019s view, there was evidence of record that would have supported such a finding, the defendant could have filed a motion for articulation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>but she did not do so. See Practice Book \u00a7 66-5. Because it is the appellant\u2019s responsibility to provide this court with an adequate record for review, an appellate court will not remand a case to correct a deficiency the appellant should have remedied. <em>Miskimen </em>v. <em>Biber, </em>85 Conn. App. 615, 624, 858 A.2d 806 (2004), cert. denied, 272 Conn. 916, 866 A.2d 1287 (2005). We conclude, therefore, that the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to address the merits of the defendant\u2019s argument that the doctrine of unclean hands provides a basis for denying the plaintiff a remedy for the defendant\u2019s breach of warranty in the contract of sale. The defendant\u2019s claim of error has neither legal nor factual support.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">This conclusion is equally dispositive of the defendant\u2019s claim, raised for the first time on appeal, that the contract of sale was unenforceable because there was no meeting of the minds. Like the claim of unclean hands, this claim also depends on the defendant\u2019s unproven assertion that the plaintiff had constructive knowledge of the restrictive covenant at the time of her execution of the contract of sale. In light of the defendant\u2019s failure to establish the factual premise on which this contention is based, this belated attack on the validity of the contract of sale is unsustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">The defendant\u2019s second principal claim challenges the propriety of the court\u2019s calculation of the attorney\u2019s fees to which the plaintiff was entitled pursuant to the terms of the contract of sale. After excluding fees for time spent by the plaintiffs attorneys in pursuing her claims under the warranty deed, the court awarded fees of $96,041.74 to the plaintiff. The defendant argues that these fees were excessive. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The court awarded attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the plaintiff in accordance with paragraph twelve of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>contract of sale. It arrived at its award by reviewing a sworn affidavit by the plaintiffs chief counsel, documenting that she and another attorney at her firm had worked 608.8 hours on this case. The court found that the rates charged and the bills generated for the services rendered were \u201creasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It reduced the chargeable fees by 30 percent, however, \u201cto reflect the work not arising out of enforcement of the contract.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u201cIt is well established that we review the trial court\u2019s decision to award attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. . . . This standard applies to the amount of fees awarded . . . and also to the trial court\u2019s determination of the factual predicate justifying the award. . . . Under the abuse of discretion standard of review, we will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . [Thus, our] review of such rulings is limited to the questions of whether the trial court correctly applied the law and reasonably could have reached the conclusion that it did.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 210, 252-53, 828 A.2d 64 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">In this case, the defendant does not challenge the accuracy of the data on which the court relied in making its award. She asserts, instead, that because this case involved only a simple two count complaint raising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>issues that the court itself characterized as \u201cstraightforward and routine,\u201d the court improperly found that the number of hours expended by counsel was reasonable. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">In its memorandum of decision, the court addressed the reasonableness of the fees billed. It noted \u201cnumerous instances where the plaintiff was not charged for the performance of relatively routine work.\u201d It further opined that \u201c[wjhile it is possible to cavil at certain time entries of the attorneys and the time spent preparing this case seems extensive, it is well to remember that hindsight is not the proper test of reasonableness and that attorneys are not hired to leave stones unturned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">We agree with the plaintiff that this record does not demonstrate a manifest abuse of discretion by the court. As the court noted in a footnote to its opinion, although the defendant was supplied with unredacted copies of the billing statements of the plaintiffs attorneys, the defendant did not avail herself of the opportunity at trial to conduct further discovery or otherwise to respond to these documents. Under the circumstances of record, the court\u2019s conscientious efforts to make a fair award belie the defendant\u2019s unsupported claim that the court merely \u201crubber-stamped\u201d the billings of the plaintiffs attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-7\"> As the court properly observed, even proof of the plaintiffs actual knowledge of the existence of a restrictive covenant at the time of the closing would not have barred her recovery for breach of warranty. See <em>Berube </em>v. <em>Nagle, </em>81 Conn. App. 681, 687, 841 A.2d 724 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\"> In paragraph four of the contract of sale, the defendant promised to convey to the plaintiff at the closing \u201cmarketable title to the premises free from all encumbrances and defects not excepted in this contract.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b231-10\"> The court noted in its memorandum of decision that \u201c[f]or reasons not made known to the court, [a] third party complaint [against Ignal and his law firm] was withdrawn in the middle of the trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b232-10\"> Pursuant to paragraph eighteen of the contract of sale, \u201ccovenants and agreements contained herein relating to rights, obligations or acts of the parties or either of them which are expressly to exist or be performed after delivery of the deed, shall survive such delivery.\u201d Pursuant to paragraph twelve of the contract of sale, \u201c[t]he parties further agree that the party who is in default shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by the other party as a result of such other party\u2019s enforcement of this contract in Court, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d As noted previously, the contract was drafted by the defendant\u2019s attorney, Ignal, and modified by Plotnick.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\"> Although the defendant filed a motion to reargue on other grounds, she did not further challenge the court\u2019s ruling on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\"> The defendant notes that Practice Book \u00a7 10-50 \u201cspecifically does not require that the special defense of \u2018unclean hands\u2019 be specially [pleaded] . . . .\u201d We agree, however, with the plaintiffs observation that the list of special defenses in \u00a7 10-50 is illustrative rather than exhaustive. See, e.g., <em>Violano v. Fernandez, </em>280 Conn. 310, 321, 907 A.2d 1188 (2006) (\u201cgovernmental immunity must be raised as a special defense in the defendant\u2019s pleadings\u201d). \u201cThe purpose of pleading is to apprise the court and opposing counsel of the issues to be tried, not to conceal basic issues until the trial is under way. . . . Practice Book \u00a7 120 [now \u00a7 10-50] lists <em>some </em>of the defenses which must be specially pleaded and proved.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Pawlinski </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>165 Conn. 1, 6, 327 A.2d 583 (1973). We agree with the plaintiff that the court properly determined that, because the defendant\u2019s claim is consistent with the allegations of the complaint, she was required to plead it as a special defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">We recognize that in <em>Gest </em>v. <em>Gest, </em>117 Conn. 289, 300-301, 167 A. 909 (1933), our Supreme Court noted, in dicta, that \u201c[t]he application of the clean-hands maxim does not depend upon an averment in pleadings or the claims of the parties; it may and should be applied by the court of its own volition when a situation calling for it is disclosed on the trial by evidence or otherwise.\u201d As the plaintiff points out, however, <em>Gest </em>is distinguishable from the present case because that court made its statement in the context of an improper jury charge that had been given <em>despite </em>the plaintiffs explicit request for the proper charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\"> Cases that uphold a trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion to order an amendment of the pleadings do not establish that the court was required to undertake such action sua sponte. See <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Middletown Savings Bank, </em>122 Conn. 362, 369-70, 189 A. 172 (1937); <em>Cheskus </em>v. <em>Christiano, </em>120 Conn. 596, 599, 182 A. 131 (1935). Cases addressing a trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a <em>litigant\u2019s </em>request for amendment of the pleadings, such as <em>Miller v. Fishman, </em>102 Conn. App. 286, 293-94, 925 A.2d 441 (2007), cert. denied, 285 Conn. 905, 942 A.2d 414 (2008), <em>Jacob </em>v. <em>Dometic Origo AB, </em>100 Conn.
