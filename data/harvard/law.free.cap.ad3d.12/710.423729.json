Defendant appeals and we affirm. As defendant was not arraigned \u201cin a local criminal court upon a currently undisposed of felony complaint\u201d charging the subject offense (CPL 190.50 [5] [a]), the People had no duty to inform him of his right to testify before the grand jury <em>(see People v Mathis, </em>278 AD2d 803 [2000], <em>lv denied </em>96 NY2d 785 [2001]; <em>People v Munoz, </em>207 AD2d 418, 419 [1994], <em>lv denied </em>84 NY2d 938 [1994]; <em>People v Anderson, </em>127 AD2d 885, 886 [1987]). Because the police took no action to affect an arrest of defendant and did not violate his constitutional due process rights, <em>People v Smiley </em>(111 Misc 2d 236 [1981]), relied on by defendant, does not suggest a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Mercure, J.P., Spain, Carpinello and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
