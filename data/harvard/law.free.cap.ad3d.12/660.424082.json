The court properly declined to give an interested witness charge with regard to certain managerial personnel formerly employed by one of the defendants, as those individuals were not directly involved in the alleged underlying negligence at issue in the case <em>(see generally Coleman v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>37 NY2d 137 [1975]; <em>Kalam v K-Metal Fabrications, </em>286 AD2d 603 [2001]). Furthermore, the court\u2019s charge with regard to negligence, while not ideal, nevertheless conveyed to the jury the duty owed by the defendants and the appropriate standard to be applied to the facts of the case <em>(see Espriel v New York Downtown Hosp., </em>298 AD2d 165 [2002]).</p><p id=\"b693-7\">The remaining contentions alleged by the plaintiff either are unpreserved for appellate review, without merit, or do not warrant reversal under the circumstances presented. Florio, J.P., Schmidt, Mastro and Fisher, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
