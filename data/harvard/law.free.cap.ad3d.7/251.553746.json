Defendant\u2019s evidence that plaintiff fell on ice simply raises an issue of fact as to causation, and her evidence that plaintiff called the dog over, as she often did upon seeing him, simply raises an issue of fact as to comparative negligence. An issue of fact as to causation is also raised by plaintiffs evidence that the accident occurred in a public park and that the length of the leash exceeded six feet in violation of 56 RCNY 1-04 (i) <em>(cf. McCullough v Maurer, </em>268 AD2d 569 [2000]). Concur\u2014Buckley, EJ., Tom, Sullivan and Marlow, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
