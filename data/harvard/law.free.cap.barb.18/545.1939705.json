The bank, at the time the bills were passed to the plaintiffs, had already failed, and the loss actually existed at that time, but unknown to both parties ; and it is a well settled principle of law, that the loss is upon him who was the owner at the time such loss happened, if both parties were ignorant of the loss at the time of making their contract. II. Upon well settled principles of equity, applicable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>mutual mistake of facts, the defendant should have redeemed the bills, and have made good the loss to the plaintiffs. <em>(Markle </em>v. <em>Hatfield, 2 John. </em>455. 1 <em>Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. </em>\u00a7 140, 142,143 <em>and </em>144. <em>Hitchcock </em>v. <em>Giddings, </em>4 <em>Price, </em>135. 1 <em>Pothier on Obligations, </em>495, <em>margin.

III. The law is well settled, that when the note of a third person is received for a pre-existing debt or a contemporaneous consideration, the risk of his insolvency is upon the payer, unless there is an agreement express or implied that the payee takes it at his own risk. <em>(Story on Prom. Notes, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 104, 117. <em>Chitty on Bills, 9th ed. </em>1840, <em>pp. </em>244-247.) This same principle is applicable to bank potes, except that the transferree, if they are good when received, takes them subject to all future risk. IY. That the loss should be borne by the transferrer, and not the transferree, is a correct principle of public policy, and is most consistent with the substantial interests of the community. <em>(See Mr. Gallatin\u2019s Essay on Currency and Banking of the U. S., p. </em>29.) Y. This doctrine has long since been established and settled in this state in the case of <em>Lightbody </em>v. <em>The Ontario Bank, </em>decided by Ch. J. Savage, (11 <em>Wend. </em>1,) and affirmed by the court of errors, (13 <em>Wend. </em>101.) This is the doctrine of our ablest elementary writers. <em>(See Story on Prom. Notes, </em>\u00a7 110. <em>Chitty on Bills, 9th ed. pp. </em>384, 385.) It has also \u2022been adopted by the supreme court of Hew-Hampshire. <em>(See Hogg </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>9 <em>N. H. Rep. </em>365.) And also by the unanimous opinion of the court of appeals in South Carolina. <em>(See Harley </em>v. <em>Thornton, 2 Hill, </em>500.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b546-5\"><em>T.

The transaction was not the payment of a debt, nor the purchase of valuable articles, with these bills as money, but a sale of them as choses in action for money. (1.) These bills were foreign bank bills, and therefore are not regarded as money. (2.) They were at a greater rate of discount than even other Maryland bills. (3.) They paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>for these depreciated bills in New-York state money, which our courts treat as cash, in distinction from foreign bank notes. <em>(Leiser </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>5 Cowen, 186.) II. These bills were and are of some value. It was admitted, on the trial, that during the year 1852, Havre De Grace money had sold for 15 per cent. III. Being of value, they formed a good consideration for a safe ; and there being no fraud, nor warranty, the doctrine of <em>caveat emptor </em>applies ; and the transaction was therefore valid. This case is to be distinguished from those in which counterfeit or broken bank bills are given <em>as cash </em>in payment of a precedent debt, or on a new purchase. These were not <em>paid as cash, </em>but \" <em>were sold for cash. </em>This disposes of the case of <em>Lightbody </em>v. <em>Ontario Bank, </em>in 11th and 13th Wendell, and other similar cases. This distinction is recognized in these cases. <em>(See also Story on Bills, </em>\u00a7 225. <em>Ex parte Blackburne, </em>10 <em>Ves. </em>204, <em>and note. Chitty on Bills, </em>243. <em>Hornblower </em>v. <em>Proud, </em>2 <em>B. &amp; Al. </em>327. <em>Rudderow </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>3 <em>Sand. </em>256. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>18 <em>Wend. </em>453,) IV. Whether this be called a sale or not, it is plain, from the greater discount, that it was the <em>intent </em>of the parties that the <em>risk </em>should be on the <em>plaintiffs. </em>And they therefore cannot recover. Y. The parol promise, which it is averred the defendant made, to take back the bills, was void by the statute of frauds. (1.) The bills had been <em>sold. </em>They had been paid for in current money, been received by plaintiffs, and been transmitted to a foreign state on their account. (2.) The promise, therefore, was to <em>repurchase </em>them. (3.) Not being in writing, it was void by the statute of frauds. (2 <em>R. S. </em>136, \u00a7 3. <em>Artcher </em>v. <em>Zeh, </em>5 <em>Hill, </em>200. <em>Shindler </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>1 <em>Comst. </em>268. <em>Whitbeck </em>v. <em>Van Ness, </em>11 <em>John. </em>414. <em>Coggill </em>v. <em>Am.

The plaintiffs were exchange brokers in Wall street. On the 27th of August, the defendant sold and delivered to them, in the ordinary course of business, \u00a7190 of the bills of the bank, allowing a discount, which was the then usual rate, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>one per .cent, or one dollar and ninety cents on the whole parcel. The hank, it appears, redeemed its notes regularly throughout the previous day. It did not open on the 27th ; it had failed at or before 10 o\u2019clock of that day, in Maryland. Its bills, those in controversy, were sold by the defendant to the plaintiffs a littM after 3 P. M. of the same day. Heither party knew, or, considering the distance, could well have known, of the failure at the time. And the defendant soon after, upon learning the true state of the ease and that there\" had been a mutual mistake, promised, and of course acknowledged the moral obligation, to refund. That promise, he now insists, not having been reduced to writing,- is not legally binding. But although not binding in law as a promise of payment, it is conclusive evidence in law as an: admission of fact. It shows, beyond dispute, that it was no part of the original contract-^a contract which being simultaneaously executed required no writing\u2014that for the small consideration of one dollar and ninety cents, the brokers' were to take, not only the trouble of collecting the notes of a distant bank, but the risk of their being at the time actually \u201c bad.\u201d \u201c Broken bank notes,\u201d by a sort of universal understanding, are a different commodity from merely \u201c uncurrent money.\u201d And when a person pays out, or sells, a bank note as merely uncurrent, and at ..a rate corresponding,- he expects and understands that in ease it turns out that the bank at the time was not only distant but defunct, he is to refund, as in justice and equity he obviously ought, the consideration received.</p>\n<court id=\"b548-8\">[New-York General Term,</court>\n<decisiondate id=\"Aio\">November 6, 1854.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The <em>understanding </em>of the parties, in this as in other cases, when clearly shown, and when there is no formal' writing and none required, is the1 <em>contract </em>of the parties ; and that contract, there being nothing unlawful in it, is the judicial measure of the parties\u2019 rights. In this view of the case, the report of the referee, in its legal conclusions, against the plaintiff, is erroneous ; and the judgment consequent upon it should therefore be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event: The trial, unless both parties consent to another reference, to be by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"ALS\"><em>Mitchell, Roosevelt </em>and <em>Clerke, </em>Justices.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
