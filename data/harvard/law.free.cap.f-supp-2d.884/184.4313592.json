BRODY, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Direct and Indirect Purchasers of a steroid nasal spray containing the active ingredient fluticasone propionate (\u201cFP\u201d), along with Roxane Laboratories, Inc. (\u201cRoxane\u201d), a generic FP manufacturer, have brought actions against Defendant Smith-Kline Beeeham Corporation, doing business as GlaxoSmithKline PLC (\u201cGSK\u201d), the manufacturer of the branded version of FP (\u201cFlonase\u201d), alleging various violations arising from GSK\u2019s conduct delaying market entry of generic FP. In its defense, GSK asserts, <em>inter alia, </em>that its conduct\u2014 particularly the filing of citizen petitions with the Federal Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) regarding issues related to Roxane\u2019s Abbreviated New Drug Application (\u201cANDA\u201d) \u2014 is protected from antitrust liability under the First Amendment and the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine, and, additionally, is not the actual cause of generic delay into the market.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">Under the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine, a party that exercises its First Amendment right to \u201cpetition! ] the government for redress generally is immune from antitrust liability.\u201d <em>Cheminor Drugs, Ltd. v. Ethyl Corp., </em>168 F.3d 119, 122 (3d Cir.1999) (citing <em>E. R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., </em>365 U.S. 127, 81 S.Ct. 523, 5 L.Ed.2d 464 (1961); <em>United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, </em>381 U.S. 657, 85 S.Ct. 1585, 14 L.Ed.2d 626 (1965)). However, one exception to the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine is when the conduct \u201cis a mere sham to cover ... an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor....\u201d <em>Noerr, </em>365 U.S. at 144, 81 S.Ct. 523. The Supreme Court has established a two-pronged test to determine whether a party\u2019s conduct is a sham and therefore not entitled to <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>immunity. <em>See Prof'l Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc. </em>[hereinafter <em>\u201cPRE </em>\u201d], 508 U.S. 49, 113 S.Ct. 1920, 123 L.Ed.2d 611 (1993). Under the first prong, known as the objective prong, plaintiffs must show that \u201ca reasonable petitioner could not realistically expect that the petition will succeed on its merits.\u201d <em>In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., </em>795 F.Supp.2d 300, 311 (E.D.Pa.2011) (citing <em>Cheminor, </em>168 F.3d at 122-23; <em>Bryant v. Military Dep\u2019t of Miss., </em>597 F.3d 678, 693 (5th Cir.2010)). The second prong, labeled the subjective prong, is only reached if the challenged conduct is deemed objectively meritless. It requires the court to examine the defendant\u2019s \u201csubjective motivation\u201d to determine if the conduct \u201cconceals \u2018an attempt to interfere directly with the business ... of a competitor.\u2019\u201d <em>PRE, </em>508 U.S. at 60-61, 113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>S.Ct. 1920 (quoting <em>Noerr, </em>365 U.S. at 144, 81 S.Ct. 523).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The parties in these three related actions have retained numerous experts to opine on issues relating to liability, including the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine and causation, as well as damages. In 2010, the parties filed several motions to exclude the reports and testimony of certain expert witnesses. In June 2011, I denied without prejudice all those motions that did not relate to Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs\u2019 (\u201cIndirect Purchasers\u201d) then-pending motion for class certification. In early 2012, the parties re-filed their respective motions to exclude, but then subsequently withdrew the majority of the motions by stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Before me now are two motions to exclude the reports and testimony of expert witnesses: (1) GSK\u2019s Motion to Exclude in Part the Expert Report and Testimony of Leslie Benet and (2) Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Exclude the Proposed Expert Testimony of Mary Pendergast. These experts are proffered to opine on, <em>inter alia, </em>issues related to the objective prong of <em>PRE </em>test (i.e., whether a reasonable petitioner could realistically expect that GSK\u2019s citizen petitions will succeed on its merits) and causation. Pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993) and <em>Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999), a hearing was held on April 18 and 19, 2012 to determine whether the testimony of Benet and Pendergast is admissible under Federal Rules of Evidence 702 and 703.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, I will deny both of these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">II. Legal Standard for Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">The party offering an expert must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the expert\u2019s qualifications and opinions comply with Federal Rule of Evidence 702. <em>See Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 592-93, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (citation omitted). Rule 702 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if: (a) the expert\u2019s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">Fed.R.Evid. 702. Rule 702 has \u201ca liberal policy of admissibility.\u201d <em>Pineda v. Ford Motor Co., </em>520 F.3d 237, 243 (3d Cir.2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">The Third Circuit has explained that to survive a <em>Daubert </em>challenge, an expert must satisfy three \u201crestrictions on expert testimony: qualification, reliability, and fit.\u201d <em>Schneider ex rel. Estate of Schneider v. Fried, </em>320 F.3d 396, 404 (3d Cir.2003) (citations omitted). The qualification inquiry examines whether a witness possesses specialized expertise. The Third Circuit \u201chas interpreted this requirement liberally, holding that a broad range of knowledge, skills, and training qualify an expert.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., </em>35 F.3d 717, 742 (3d Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>For an expert\u2019s testimony to be reliable, it \u201cmust be based on [ ] methods and procedures ... rather than subjective belief or speculation.\u201d <em>In re TMI Litig., </em>193 F.3d 613, 670 (3d Cir.1999). \u201c[T]he admissibility inquiry thus focuses on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions generated by principles and methodology.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665. Furthermore, an \u201cexpert\u2019s testimony must be accompanied by a sufficient factual foundation before it can be submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>Elcock v. Kmart Corp., </em>233 F.3d 734, 754 (3d Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Finally, Rule 702 requires that the expert testimony fit the issues in the case. Testimony \u201cfits\u201d a case when it is \u201crelevant for the purposes of the case and ... assist[s] the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Schneider, </em>320 F.3d at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">A. Plaintiffs\u2019 Expert Leslie Benet</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">At trial, Plaintiffs intend to introduce the expert testimony of Dr. Leslie Benet, a professor of bioengineering and therapeutic sciences at the University of California at San Francisco in the Schools of Pharmacy and Medicine for the last forty-three years. Benet has also worked as a consultant to numerous generic and brand drug manufacturers and been a member of several FDA advisory committees. <em>See </em>Expert Report of Leslie Benet, May 11, 2010 (\u201cBenet Report\u201d) \u00b6\u00b6 1-7; <em>Daubert </em>Hr\u2019g Tr. 16, April 19, 2012 (\u201cBenet H\u2019rg Tr.\u201d). Benet is proffered to opine generally on bioequivalence issues and specifically as to the merits of GSK\u2019s citizens petitions. Benet Report \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">At the hearing on April 19, 2012, Roxane<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> withdrew those portions of Benet\u2019s report and testimony that related to causation and GSK\u2019s intent in filing the citizen petitions. <em>See </em>Benet Hr\u2019g Tr. 9. As a result, the parties acknowledged, at the hearing and in subsequent supplemental briefing, that they had reached an agreement on the admissibility or lack of admissibility of nearly all of Benet\u2019s report and testimony. The lone outstanding dispute concerns Benet\u2019s opinion, found in paragraphs 42 to 48 of his expert report, on GSK\u2019s knowledge, awareness, or understanding regarding whether a final guidance from the FDA needed to be issued prior to approval of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (\u201cANDA\u201d) for generic FP.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Benet opines, <em>inter alia, </em>on the merits of GSK\u2019s request to the FDA, in its May 2004 citizen petition, that a final guidance document be issued before any approval of an ANDA for generic FP. Specifically, he states in his expert report: \u201cIt is well understood by participants in the pharmaceutical industry that the FDA-may approve an ANDA prior to the issuance of a final guidance, and that the FDA is not precluded from approving ANDAs merely because it has issued a draft guidance that relates to a proposed drug product.\u201d Benet Report \u00b6 41. Benet further opined that \u201cthere was no reasonable basis to believe that the FD\u00c1 would grant GSK\u2019s request that it refrain from approving ANDAs for fluticasone propionate pending issuance of a final guidance document relating to nasal suspension products.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Benet explained that the information forming the basis of this opinion is his \u201csignificant experience with both brand name companies and generic companies,\u201d his academic knowledge, and his understanding of applying and utilizing FDA guidance documents. Benet Hr\u2019g Tr. 25. As an additional basis for his opinion, and the subject of the instant dispute, Benet performed a review of certain GSK internal documents produced in this litigation to demonstrate that GSK\u2019s knowledge, awareness, and understanding regarding FDA practice in approving ANDAs with or without final guidance was consistent with his opinion. <em>See </em>Benet Report \u00b6\u00b6 42-48. For example, Benet cites to a report by a consulting firm retained by GSK that noted that the FDA \u201croutinely approves ANDAs before final Guidances are published....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b645. As another example, Benet opines that \u201cGSK further understood that because it used the draft guidances to develop its own products that FDA would expect an ANDA sponsor to use the same draft guidance in developing its products,\u201d and cites to GSK internal documents as support. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Benet, however, has offered differing explanations for how his review of GSK internal documents, in paragraphs 42-48 of his report, fits with his opinion about the reasonableness of GSK\u2019s FDA final guidance request. When asked about this fit at his deposition, Benet stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">[I]t\u2019s just to support my contention that GSK was well aware that this argument that they\u2019re making would not be approved and was not what FDA would- \u2014 \u25a0 the procedures that FDA would follow, both from their own experience and their own products and from general knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Benet Dep. 155:13-18, June 11, 2010; <em>see also </em>Benet H\u2019rg Tr. 31 (\u201c[These are] documents confirming that at least some individuals within GSK held the same opinion that I did, [and] that there was no basis for believing that this final guidance would be necessary before products were approved.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">At the <em>Daubert </em>hearing, Benet explained what he meant by GSK\u2019s \u201cawareness\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">[A]ll I\u2019m saying is aware means that there\u2019s information that is available to the company in terms of that final guidances are not necessary for approval of an ANDA. And this is well known within the pharmaceutical industry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">Benet Hr\u2019g Tr. 39. Similarly, when he opines that \u201cGSK understood\u201d that the FDA could, and often did, approve ANDAs without a final guidance document, Benet stated that he used \u201cunderstood\u201d to mean \u201cthat there\u2019s information that\u2019s available within the company that is not secret, and there\u2019s a number of individuals [in the company] that understand[ ] this.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40; <em>see also id. </em>at 41 (stating that when saying \u201cGSK knew\u201d something, he meant \u201c[t]here\u2019s information within the company, at high levels within the company, related to Regulatory Affairs with the FDA, [and] that this is information that is consistent with my position\u201d on GSK\u2019s final guidance request).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">In seeking to exclude Benet\u2019s opinion\u2014 using GSK internal documents \u2014 on GSK\u2019s knowledge or awareness regarding FDA practice in approving ANDAs without final guidance, GSK makes two arguments: (1) this opinion is irrelevant to the jury\u2019s inquiry on whether the petition is entitled to <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>immunity, and (2) Benet\u2019s interpretation of GSK\u2019s state of mind via GSK\u2019s internal documents is not appropriate expert testimony. In response, Roxane contends that: (1) Benet\u2019s opinion is relevant to the objective prong of the <em>PRE </em>test, and (2) Benet does not opine on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>GSK\u2019s state of mind, but on information and knowledge available to GSK.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The objective prong of the <em>PRE </em>test requires plaintiffs to show that \u201ca reasonable petitioner could not realistically expect that the petition will succeed on its merits.\u201d <em>In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., </em>795 F.Supp.2d 300, 311 (E.D.Pa.2011) (citations omitted). \u201cIf an objective [party] could conclude that the [petition] is reasonably calculated to elicit a favorable outcome, the [petition] is immunized under <em>Noerr, </em>and an antitrust claim premised on the sham exception must fail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>PRE, </em>508 U.S. at 60, 113 S.Ct. 1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Both parties offer competing definitions of, or least limitations for, the \u201creasonable petitioner.\u201d GSK contends that a reasonable petitioner\u2019s knowledge or understanding cannot include GSK\u2019s knowledge or understanding, which, instead, is more appropriately directed toward the subjective prong of the <em>PRE </em>test.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Roxane, meanwhile, claims that \u201cwhether a reasonable petitioner in GSK\u2019s situation would have expected success on the merits is circumscribed by what information and knowledge was available to GSK.\u201d Roxane\u2019s Post-Hr\u2019g Mem. 2. It further asserts that \u201c[w]hat other pharmaceutical companies knew at the time is not relevant to the [objective prong] inquiry,\u201d but that GSK\u2019s knowledge and available information \u201cat the time is crucial to an understanding of whether a reasonable petitioner in GSK\u2019s shoes would have had a reasonable expectation of success on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">The information and knowledge available and possessed by GSK at the time of its filing the citizen petitions can be relevant to the determination of the objective prong, not because GSK is the defendant in this matter, but because GSK is an active and important player in the pharmaceutical industry. GSK\u2019s knowledge and understanding can inform an opinion as to the state of knowledge in the pharmaceutical industry as a whole, which is relevant in determining whether a reasonable petitioner could realistically expect that GSK\u2019s citizen petitions will succeed on their merits. In that same light, though, what other pharmaceutical companies knew at the time of GSK\u2019s petitioning activity is also relevant to the objective prong inquiry. Therefore, Roxane\u2019s argument is also flawed, as it attempts to narrow the \u201creasonable petitioner\u201d standard to such a degree that it merges with the subjective prong inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">As such, Benet will be permitted to opine, relying on internal GSK documents, on the information that was available to GSK regarding FDA practice and policy for approving ANDAs without final guidance documents, as set forth in paragraphs 42-48 of his report.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To the extent that GSK disagrees with Benet\u2019s opinion on GSK\u2019s knowledge and awareness to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the state of knowledge in the pharmaceutical industry, the appropriate method for challenging such testimony is through cross-examination or the introduction of its own expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">GSK argues that this opinion will be Benet\u2019s interpretation of GSK\u2019s \u201cstate of mind\u201d and, therefore, is inappropriate expert testimony. Benet\u2019s testimony in his report does not speak to the intent, motive, or state of mind of GSK in filing its citizen petitions. I understand GSK\u2019s concern, however, given Benet\u2019s statement at his deposition regarding his use of these GSK internal documents: \u201c[I]t\u2019s just to support my contention that GSK was well aware that this argument that they\u2019re making would not be approved.\u201d Benet Dep. 155:13-18. Such a statement goes beyond opining on the information and knowledge available to a key entity in the pharmaceutical industry (GSK) regarding the necessity of final guidances prior to ANDA approval, and instead evidence by which GSK\u2019s state of mind in filing the May 2004 citizen petition may be inferred. This is impermissible, and should Benet offer such testimony at trial, GSK can object at that time. See <em>In re Rosuvastatin Calcium Patent Litig., </em>No. 07-805, 2009 WL 4800702, at *8 (D.Del. Dec. 11, 2009) (\u201cGenerally, expert witnesses are <em>not </em>permitted to testify regarding \u2018intent, motive, or state of mind, or evidence by which such state of mind may be inferred\u2019 \u201d) (citing <em>Oxford Gene Tech., Ltd. v. Mergen Ltd., </em>345 F.Supp.2d 431, 443 (D.Del.2004)); <em>In re Rezulin Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>309 F.Supp.2d 531, 547 (S.D.N.Y.2004) (\u201cInferences about the intent or motive of parties or others lie outside the bounds of expert testimony.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">B. GSK\u2019s Expert Mary Pendergast</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">GSK proffers Mary Pendergast, an expert in the field of pharmaceutical regulation, to opine on three issues: (1) \u201cthe merit, from a FDA regulatory perspective, of the issues raised\u201d in GSK\u2019s citizen petitions; (2) \u201cthe date on which FDA was prepared to approve\u201d Roxane\u2019s generic FP for marketing; and (3) \u201cthe effect, if any\u201d of the citizen petitions and supplements filed by GSK and two law firms on behalf of two generic manufacturers<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201con the consideration and timing of approval by FDA of Roxane\u2019s ANDA for fluticasone.\u201d Expert Report of Mary K. Pendergast, August 13, 2010 (\u201cPendergast Report\u201d) 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">In forming her opinions, Pendergast relied on the citizen petitions filed by GSK and two generic drug manufacturers, and the comments and supplements to those petitions; FDA\u2019s response to the petitions; documents produced in discovery by several generic companies seeking approval for generic FP; FDA statutes, regulations, and regulatory documents; deposition transcripts; documents produced by FDA in discovery; and certain publicly available documents. Pendergast Report 3. In addition, she relied on her professional background, which I briefly review below.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">As for her background, Pendergast has worked in the field of pharmaceutical regulation for over thirty years. Pendergast Rep. 1. From 1979 to 1997, she worked for the FDA. <em>Id. </em>at 1-2; Deck of Mary K. Pendergast, December 9, 2010 (\u201cPendergast Deck\u201d) \u00b6 3. During her first eleven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>years at the FDA, she worked at the FDA\u2019s Office of General Counsel, where she was an Associate Chief Counsel for Enforcement. Pendergast Report 1. In that capacity, Pendergast became familiar with the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the \u201cHatch-Waxman Amendments\u201d), as she was part of a small team that reviewed the legislation while pending in Congress, interpreted the law for the FDA, and examined FDA statements about the law. <em>Id.; see also Daubert </em>Hr\u2019g Tr. 11, April 18, 2012 (\u201cPendergast Hr\u2019g Tr.\u201d). She also assisted in the development of regulations, guidance documents, litigation, and FDA interpretations pertaining to the HatchWaxman Amendments. Pendergast Rep. 1; Pendergast Hr\u2019g Tr. 12-13. During this process, Pendergast supported the Office of Generic Drugs (\u201cOGD\u201d)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in developing ANDA regulations and guidance documents \u2014 for example, establishing the similarities and differences between ANDAs and New Drug Applications. Pendergast Hr\u2019g Tr. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In 1988 and 1989, while in the Office of General Counsel, Pendergast was part of a \u201ccleanup\u201d team that addressed significant problems at the OGD, as certain employees were benefitting some generic drug companies in the timing and substance of them ANDA reviews. Pendergast Hr\u2019g Tr. 14. During this process, she assisted OGD \u2014 both senior management and the substantive experts in the various fields (i.e., bioequivalence, chemistry) \u2014 in developing policies, practices, procedures, and standards to prevent such behavior from occurring again. <em>Id. </em>at 14-15. Specifically, for example, her team developed systems and standards to help ANDA reviewers manage their large workloads by creating an amendment system that helped differentiate ANDA amendments that could be addressed immediately from those that would require placing an applicant \u201cto the back of the line for consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15-16; <em>see also </em>Pendergast Decl. \u00b6 3(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">From 1990 to 1997, Pendergast was the Deputy Commissioner of the FDA, the most senior, non-political official within FDA.

During this time she \u201cauthored what was later adopted as the [FDA\u2019s] standard 180-day response letter to citizen petitions.\u201d Pendergast Decl. \u00b6 3(b).

When asked how the importance of a citizen petition was determined, Pendergast explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">It\u2019s measured by the agency\u2019s mission, and by its policies and practices and what it needed to do, what it needed to think about when it was working on something ... when the citizen petition came in and it was important and relevant to a decision that the FDA had to make, that was substantively relevant, and that it was something that the agency needed to grapple with to make a decision, it got a lot of attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">When it was something within the agency\u2019s purview that [ ] was of less public health importance, or it was something that really wasn\u2019t gonna be important for another 10 or 20 years, then we gave it much more short shrift and just said thank you, we don\u2019t have the resources to deal with it, or some other short answer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 21-22.

I will address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">i. <em>Relevance of \u201cAppropriate\u201d and \u201cRegulatory Merit\u201d Opinions to Objective Prong of </em>PRE</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">GSK intends to introduce Pendergast at trial to opine on the merits of GSK\u2019s citizen petitions from a regulatory perspective. In her report and testimony, Pendergast opines generally that the issues raised in GSK\u2019s citizen petitions, from an FDA policy and regulatory perspective, are \u201cappropriate\u201d and have \u201cregulatory merit.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>Pendergast Report 4 (\u201cGSK\u2019s May and November Citizen Petitions had regulatory merit and were an appropriate use of the Citizen Petition process .... \u201d). Much of the parties\u2019 dispute regarding Pendergast\u2019s testimony and report centers on the definition, and effect, of these words.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">At the April 19, 2012 hearing, Pendergast explained her meaning of \u201cappropriate\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">Appropriate ... means anything that is properly considered in the citizen\u2019s petition, in a citizen\u2019s petition so it\u2019s got to be within the FDA\u2019s jurisdiction. [The petitions are not] used to ask the FDA to take specific enforcement action, but [they are] within the regulatory framework [of the FDA].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Pendergast Hr\u2019g Tr. 153. At her deposition, she explained that \u201cappropriate,\u201d in the context of a citizen petition, means that the subject matter was \u201cwell within the ballpark of the kinds of things that the Citizen Petition process should be used for.\u201d Pendergast Dep. 48:2-5, September 22, 2010. She also explained that \u201cappropriate\u201d could mean that a petition raises questions \u201cthat may be of interest to the FDA\u201d and addresses matters \u201cthat could benefit from FDA consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44:22-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">By comparison, Pendergast testified at the hearing that in opining on the citizen petitions, her use of the word \u201cappropriate\u201d evoked a \u201cbroader\u201d concept than the words \u201cregulatory merit.\u201d Pendergast H\u2019rg Tr. 152-3. She explained that by \u201cregulatory merit\u201d she meant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-11\">What I\u2019m saying is that ... it\u2019s a question that was raised by GSK that is relevant because the FDA has to make a regulatory decision. It\u2019s relevant to that decision. It\u2019s necessary for the FDA to resolve the matter before it makes a decision, and that the FDA should come to a conclusion on that [question].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-12\"><em>Id. </em>During cross-examination, she explained the term further: \u201cWhen I said that a position had regulatory merit, that is a summary way of saying that it was quite possible, in fact more than possible, a qualitatively good idea for the FDA to accept that petition \u2014 accept that position when it was reviewing ANDAs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107; <em>see also id. </em>at 106 (\u201cWhat I was trying to convey when I said things had regulatory merit was that it was a position that the FDA could well have adopted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">Direct Purchasers assert that Pendergast\u2019s opinion that the petitions were \u201cappropriate\u201d and possessed \u201cregulatory merit\u201d eviscerates the legal standard under <em>PRE, </em>will not assist the trier of fact in assessing the objective prong of <em>PRE, </em>and will confuse the jury. To buttress these assertions, Direct Purchasers claim that Pendergast\u2019s entire opinion \u201camounts to nothing more than a statement that the issues raised in the petitions] are the kind of matters covered by an ANDA review and are within the purview of the FDA.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Direct Purchasers\u2019 Post-Hr\u2019g Mem. 3. As a result, \u201cPendergast opines that petitions have \u2018regulatory merit\u2019 and are entitled to <em>[Noerr-Pennington] </em>immunity regardless of whether they meet the standard set by <em>PRE, </em>i.e. regardless of whether the petitioner was likely to succeed on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Although Pendergast\u2019s labeling the petitions \u201cappropriate\u201d \u2014 or within the FDA\u2019s jurisdiction \u2014 is of little assistance in establishing whether the petitions were likely to succeed on the merits, at trial, Pendergast will be permitted to explain that the petitions were \u201cwithin the FDA\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d or raised topics properly considered in the citizen petition process, as a predicate to the rest of her opinions on each citizen petition. I am concerned, though, that Pendergast\u2019s labeling the citizen petitions \u201cappropriate,\u201d considering her definition(s) of the word, could confuse the jury in its consideration of the <em>PRE </em>objective test. As such, she will <em>not be </em>permitted to use this word to describe the citizen petitions at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Direct Purchasers Plaintiffs mischaracterize the remaining scope of Pendergast\u2019s opinion by conflating her definitions of \u201cappropriate\u201d and \u201cregulatory merit.\u201d The scope of Pendergast\u2019s opinion, as Plaintiffs even concede, goes beyond simply opining that the petitions raised issues within the FDA\u2019s purview. <em>See, e.g., </em>Direct Purchasers Post-H\u2019rg Mem. 9-10 (quoting testimony from Pendergast calling the questions raised in GSK\u2019s citizen petitions \u201cserious,\u201d \u201csubstantive,\u201d and \u201cimportant for the FDA to consider\u201d). For example, in discussing GSK\u2019s November 2004 Petition, Pendergast stated in her report: \u201cIn my judgment, GSK\u2019s request for FDA to impose equivalent quality standards [for brand and generic drugs] was meritorious, and FDA should have granted that part of GSK\u2019s Citizen Petition, since it actually followed GSK\u2019s request and required Roxane to set manufacturing quality specifications on [droplet size distribution] and [spray pattern].\u201d. At the April 18 hearing, Pendergast explained that, in using the term \u201cregulatory merit\u201d, she meant that GSK\u2019s citizen petitions asserted policy positions which \u201cthe FDA could well have adopted.\u201d Pendergast Hr\u2019g Tr. 106. Pendergast also opines that GSK\u2019s citizen petitions actually influenced the FDA\u2019s ANDA standards. <em>See </em>Pendergast Rep. at 29 (\u201c[T]he Citizen Petitions caused FDA to consider, and then change, its standards for approval of fluticasone nasal spray generics.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 43 (\u201cGSK\u2019s November Citizen Petition changed OGD\u2019s behavior .... [and GSK got some of the relief it requested\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">As such, I do not think her opinion as to the \u201cregulatory merit\u201d of GSK\u2019s petitions is entirely divorced from the objective prong determination of <em>PRE, </em>i.e. whether a reasonable petitioner could realistically expect a petition to succeed on its merits. In detailing the parameters of <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>immunity, the <em>PRE </em>Court explained that the sham exception did not apply to \u201ca valid effort to influence government action.\u201d <em>PRE, </em>508 U.S. at 58, 113 S.Ct. 1920 (citing <em>Allied Tube &amp; Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., </em>486 U.S. 492, 500 n. 4, 108 S.Ct. 1931, 100 L.Ed.2d 497 (1988)); <em>see also In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig., </em>No. 08-2431, 2012 WL 1657734, at *25 (E.D.Pa. May 11, 2012) <em>(\u201cPRE </em>does not define success in the context of a citizen petition, but it does state that the petition must be calculated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u2018elicit\u2019 a favorable outcome or to \u2018influence\u2019 government action.\u201d) (citing <em>PRE, </em>508 U.S. at 58, 60, 113 S.Ct. 1920). Policy considerations, therefore, are not irrelevant in assessing the applicability of the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine. <em>See In re Gabapentin Patent Litig., </em>649 F.Supp.2d 340, 360-61 (D.N.J.2009) (\u201cThe <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine protects activities by parties to influence government <em>policy </em>or legislation from antitrust claims.\u201d (emphasis added) (citations omitted)); <em>see also In re Prograf Antitrust Litig., </em>No. 11-md-2242, 2012 WL 293850, at *4 (D.Mass. Feb. 1, 2012) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The petitions at issue were addressed and responded to by the FDA, a regulatory body. FDA decisions are informed not only by science, but also by FDA policy, procedure, and practice. Therefore, as even Plaintiffs have noted, the objective prong determination can be informed by predicate factual questions <em>beyond </em>just the strength and weaknesses of GSK\u2019s scientific positions in its petitions. Direct Purchasers\u2019 Memorandum in Support of Their Mot. to Exclude the Proposed Expert Testimony of Defs. Expert Mary K. Pendergast 11 (\u201cThe predicate factual questions are whether an objective filer, knowing the applicable <em>law and regulations </em>of ANDA approvals, <em>FDA practices, </em>and the objective strengths and weaknesses of the scientific preconditions for ANDA approval urged by GSK, could conclude that the petitions ... were calculated to elicit a favorable outcome for GSK ....\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Pendergast\u2019s background underscores this reality. As a lawyer in the Office of General Counsel, she was involved in reviewing and responding to numerous citizen petitions, as well as developing systems and standards to more efficiently respond to citizen petitions based on their importance to FDA policy and practice. <em>See generally </em>Pendergast Hr\u2019g Tr. 19-22. Relying on her substantial FDA and related experience, Pendergast opines on how the FDA grappled with certain policy questions raised in GSK\u2019s petitions and was, in certain instances, subsequently influenced by these positions. Such regulatory policy and practice cannot simply be ignored in the consideration of whether an objective party could conclude that GSK\u2019s citizen petitions were reasonably calculated to elicit a favorable outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Therefore, I find that Pendergast\u2019s testimony on the merit of GSK\u2019s citizen petitions in the context of FDA regulatory policy and practice is relevant and helpful to the trier of fact in assessing the objective prong of the <em>PRE </em>test.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Whether it is as relevant as GSK claims\u2014 which plaintiffs strongly dispute \u2014 is not a question to decide in the context of a <em>Daubert </em>motion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ii. <em>Unqualified to Address Scientific Positions in GSK\u2019s Citizen Petitions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Direct Purchasers have continually asserted that Pendergast is unqualified to opine on the scientific positions set forth in GSK\u2019s citizen petitions. Neither GSK nor Pendergast dispute this assertion. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pendergast Hr\u2019g Tr. 90-91, 98, 105 (acknowledging that she is not holding herself out as an expert in biostatistics, bioequivalence standards, or <em>in vivo </em>studies that assess bioequivalence); Pendergast Dep. 52:16-53:11 (\u201cI do not give an opinion as to whether or not one scientific standard or another scientific standard should be adopted by the FDA.\u201d). Direct Purchasers claim that, despite these admissions, \u201cPendergast opines about the merits of GSK\u2019s positions that require a scientific understanding or technical knowledge that she does not possess.\u201d Direct Purchasers\u2019 Posb-Hr\u2019g Mem. 8. As an example, they cite to the following exchange during the hearing on April 19:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">Q: Okay. And what overall opinion did you reach as to the May petition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">A: My overall conclusion was that it was a good citizen\u2019s petition that had regqlatory merit, which means that it was raising questions that the FDA had to consider that were substantive and that should be addressed by the agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8i\">Q: And was your opinion that that would be the view of the agency or that would be just sort of your view?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">A: No, I was putting myself in the shoes of the agency. Because the citizen petition is going to the agency before the agency has to make a decision. So if you focus on it from the agency\u2019s point of view, was it important for the FDA to consider these issues, think about them, and come to a conclusion before it took the step of approving products.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 9 (citing Pendergast Hr\u2019g Tr. 54).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">Direct Purchasers argue that opining that the petitions asked questions that \u201cthe FDA had to consider,\u201d were \u201cimportant for the FDA to consider,\u201d and were \u201cserious\u201d or \u201csubstantive\u201d requires an understanding of the scientific merit of GSK\u2019s positions. Direct Purchasers\u2019 position is unfounded for two reasons. First, to formulate this position, they again misconstrue the scope of Pendergast\u2019s opinion. <em>See </em>Direct Purchasers\u2019 Post-Hr\u2019g Mem. 9 (\u201cPendergast\u2019s opinion that the petition asked \u2018questions the FDA had to consider\u2019 ... or were \u2018serious\u2019 ... go well beyond her opinion that the topic of GSK\u2019s requests were within the FDA\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>supra </em>Section IILB.l.i (discussing how Direct Purchasers mistakenly conflate Pendergast\u2019s definition of \u201cappropriate\u201d and \u201cregulatory merit\u201d in an attempt to confine the scope of her opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">Second, Pendergast\u2019s use of words like \u201cimportant,\u201d \u201csubstantive,\u201d \u201cgood,\u201d or \u201cserious\u201d does not automatically transform her opinion into a scientific one. Pendergast has consistently acknowledged that is she is not opining on the <em>scientific </em>merits of GSK\u2019s citizen petitions. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pendergast Dep. at 53:17-21 (\u201cI am not giving an opinion, for example, take this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>whether or not the right scientific standard for the statistical analysis of in vitro studies is population bioequivalence or geometric mean.\u201d); Pendergast Hr\u2019g Tr. 108 (\u201cI\u2019m not qualified to talk about the science. I\u2019m only qualified to talk about the regulatory process and procedure that is part and parcel of FDA coming to a scientific conclusion.\u201d). Pendergast distinguished her regulatory, policy-focused opinion from a scientific opinion during her deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6O\">I do not give an opinion as to whether or not one scientific standard or another scientific standard should be adopted by the FDA. That\u2019s not ... something I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m only addressing the question of whether ... there should be a scientific standard and whether the scientific standard should be addressed before [ANDAs] are assessed. That\u2019s what I\u2019m discussing. So it\u2019s not science per se. It is the manner and timing of asking the question about the science.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASNi\">Pendergast Dep. 52:22-53:11. In its post-hearing brief, GSK points to several different opinions of Pendergast\u2019s to further highlight this distinction. For example, in examining GSK\u2019s request in its May 2004 citizen petition that generic ANDAs include data for the most difficult to treat condition Pendergast opines that GSK\u2019s request was consistent with prior FDA <em>policy </em>based on her review of previous citizen petitions and the FDA\u2019s response to GSK\u2019s citizen petition. Pendergast Rep. 35-36, 73-75. As another example, Pendergast opined that GSK\u2019s citizen petitions raised \u201cimportant\u201d questions for the FDA because, based on her experience with citizen petitions, the FDA rarely issues such a lengthy response to the petitions (twenty-four single-spaced pages) signed by the Associate Commissioner for Policy and Planning (instead of the Director of ODER) unless \u201cit\u2019s important to the [FDA].\u201d Pendergast Hr\u2019g Tr. 57-59. Neither of these opinions, based on her review of previous FDA policy statements and her knowledge of FDA practices and regulations, requires Pendergast to opine on the merits of the scientific issues raised in the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">I am satisfied that Pendergast is offering opinions from an FDA regulatory and policy perspective, and not delving into the merits of any scientific position in GSK\u2019s citizen petitions. However, I do understand plaintiffs\u2019 concern. If Pendergast should cross this line, and opine on scientific merit, I will inform the jury that this witness is not qualified to testify as to the scientific merits of GSK\u2019s citizen petitions. By way of example of when this line will be crossed \u2014 -and the lone example pointed out by Direct Purchasers \u2014 Pendergast\u2019s using the phrase \u201cstrongest science,\u201d as she did in her report, will not be permitted. <em>See </em>Pendergast Report 44.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">For the foregoing reasons, I will not exclude Pendergast\u2019s opinions regarding the merits of GSK\u2019s citizen petitions from a regulatory and FDA policy perspective, as set forth in her report and testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">2. <em>Opinions as to Causation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\"><em>Daubert </em>motions against Pendergast were originally filed in October 2010. In those motions, Plaintiffs sought to exclude Pendergast\u2019s report and testimony relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>ing to causation issues because they were contrary to law and FDA practice, and because she was unqualified to offer such opinions. Plaintiffs re-filed these same motions and accompanying memoranda in January 2012. On April 18, 2012, a <em>Daubert </em>hearing was held regarding the admissibility of Pendergast\u2019s report and testimony. At that all-day hearing, Direct Purchasers did not ask Pendergast any questions concerning her causation-related opinions. <em>See </em>Pendergast Hr\u2019g Tr. 147 (\u201cI do not intend to ask any questions [concerning causation] direct [sic], although I would appreciate an opportunity to address our causation argument in argument or a post hearing submission.\u201d). Moreover, in post-hearing briefing, Direct Purchasers failed to mention her opinions regarding causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Considering this silence from Plaintiffs and Pendergast\u2019s FDA and related experience involving citizen petition consideration and response, as well the development of methods for ANDA approval with OGD, I will not exclude Pendergast\u2019s opinions related to causation as set forth in her report and testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The Federal Rules of Evidence clearly illustrate a preference for admitting any evidence which might assist the trier of fact and indicate that this policy extends to the admissibility of expert testimony. <em>See Kannankeril v. Terminix Intern., Inc., </em>128 F.3d 802, 806 (3d Cir.1997). In determining the reliability of expert testimony, the standard is lower than one of correctness, and need not be right, only based on good grounds. <em>See Schieber v. City of Philadelphia, </em>No. CIV.A. 98-5648, 2000 WL 1670888, at *2 (E.D.Pa. November 7, 2000). I am satisfied that both Plaintiffs and GSK have demonstrated that their respective expert\u2019s qualifications and opinions comply with Federal Rule of Evidence 702, subject to the limitations noted above. Therefore, I will deny GSK\u2019s Motion to Exclude in Part the Expert Report and Testimony of Leslie Benet, and deny Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Exclude the Proposed Expert Testimony of Mary Pendergast.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">AND NOW, this 23rd day of July 2012, for the reasons set forth in the accompanying memorandum of this same date, it is ORDERED that:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">\u2022 GSK\u2019s Motion to Exclude in Part the Expert Report and Testimony of Leslie Benet (No. 08-3149, ECF No. 288; No. 08-3301, ECF No. 350; No. 09-1638, ECF No. 183) is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">\u2022 Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Exclude the Proposed Testimony of Mary K.

A more detailed discussion of the parties\u2019 arguments, and applicable legal standards, regarding causation and <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>is provided in my opinions denying GSK's motions for summary judgment on these grounds. <em>See In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., </em>795 F.Supp.2d 300 (E.D.Pa.2011) <em>(Noerr-Pen</em>nington); <em>In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., </em>798 F.Supp.2d 619 (E.D.Pa.2011) (causation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b229-7\">. Plaintiffs' expert Rochelle Kimmel also testified during these hearings. However, all plaintiffs later withdrew their designation of Kimmel as an expert in these actions. Therefore, her testimony will not be discussed in this Memorandum, and, in the accompanying Order, I deny GSK's motion to exclude her report and testimony as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\">. While Indirect Purchasers joined Roxane's opposition to GSIC's motion against Benet, at the hearing Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs (\"Direct Purchasers\u201d) stated that they took no position on GSK\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>Benet H'rg Trs. 5-7, 67. Roxane was the only plaintiff to file a post-hearing brief opposing GSK\u2019s motion. Therefore, for purposes of brevity, I will only refer to Roxane in the section of this opinion addressing GSK\u2019s motion against Benet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\">. During the course of this litigation, I have explained that expert testimony on GSK\u2019s intent in filing its citizen petitions would be inadmissible. See, e.g., Tr. of Telephone Conference 6, 9-10, April 12, 2012; <em>see also In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>MDL No. 1203, 2000 WL 876900, at *9 (E.D.Pa. June 20, 2000) (\u2019\u2019[T]he question of intent is a classic jury question and not one for experts.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b232-7\">. GSK argues that Benet's use of GSK internal documents is inappropriate expert testimony because the jury will be fully capable of reading and comprehending the documents themselves. Although the jury can certainly read the documents for themselves, Benet's opinions, utilizing the documents, will be helpful to the jury in assessing whether a reasonable petitioner would realistically expect that GSK citizen petitions would succeed on their merits. This is so especially considering Benet's qualifications and the complexities surrounding the ANDA approval and citizen petition response processes at the FDA,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b233-6\">. Instructions to the jury to clarify this may be necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\">. Specifically, the petitions filed by the law firm Bell Boyd &amp; Lloyd on behalf of the generic drug manufacturer, Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. on May 1, 2004, and by the law firm Frommer Lawrence &amp; Haug LLP on behalf of the generic drug manufacturer, Dey, L.P. on July 26, 2004 (including the June 16, 2005 supplement). <em>See </em>Expert Report of Mary K. Pendergast, August 13, 2010, 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b234-5\">. The OGD is a department within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (\"CDER\u201d) at the FDA. Pendergast Decl. \u00b6 3(c). It is responsible for evaluating and approving ANDAs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b234-6\">. Presently, the Office of Regulatory Policy (\"ORP\u201d) is the department within CDER that is generally responsible for preparing answers to citizen petitions. Pendergast explained that the ORP did not exist during the time she worked in the Office of General Counsel; as a result, she \"served in ... multiple different roles,\u201d including being involved with citizen petition responses. Pendergast Hr'g Tr. 150.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b235-9\">. Direct Purchasers and Roxane re-filed motions to exclude Pendergast\u2019s report and testimony in January 2012. Indirect Purchasers re-filed their motion for joinder and adoption of Direct Purchasers\u2019 motion at the same time.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">At the April 18, 2012 hearing, counsel for Direct Purchasers cross-examined Pendergast and represented Roxane and Indirect Purchasers in so doing. <em>See </em>Pendergast Hr\u2019g Tr. 83. In addition, only Direct Purchasers filed a post-hearing brief in support of the motion against Pendergast. Therefore, for purposes of brevity, I will only refer to Direct Purchasers in the section of this opinion addressing Plaintiffs' motions against Pendergast.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b237-7\">. I recognize that plaintiffs dispute Pendergast's characterization of the requests made in GSK's citizen petitions. However, what the petitions were requesting is a question of fact that the parties will have to establish, and the jury will have to decide, at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b238-5\">. It should be noted that another federal district court, in addressing a post-trial motion for judgement as a matter of law, found that sufficient evidence existed to support a jury verdict that a citizen petition filed with the FDA was not objectively baseless under <em>PRE. See La. Wholesale Drug Co., Inc. v. Sanofi-Aventis, </em>No. 07-cv-7343, 2009 WL 2708110 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 28, 2009). In so finding, the court repeatedly cited to the testimony of Pendergast, who opined on the issues raised in a citizen petition considering FDA policy, practice, and regulations. <em>Id. </em>at *5. Although plaintiff in that case did not lodge a <em>Daubert </em>challenge to Pendergast, the ruling in <em>Louisiana Wholesale </em>provides additional support for my finding Pendergast\u2019s report and testimony relevant to the objective prong of <em>PRE.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b238-10\">. In the alternative, Direct Purchasers argue that because of Pendergast\u2019s using the term \"regulatory merit,\u201d the jury will confuse her opinions with the objective standard under <em>PRE. </em>However, Pendergast\u2019s opinion should not be excluded simply because she used one word' \u2014 merit\u2014that is also located in a legal standard. Plaintiffs\u2019 own expert, James Mor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>rison, has used the word \"merit\u201d in his own opinions. <em>See, e.g., </em>Morrison Dep. 106:15-25, July 1, 2010 (stating, regarding one of GSK's citizen petitions, that it had \"no merit, meaning that it doesn\u2019t even wildly pertain to anything that would possibly be related to a review\u201d). Pendergast explained at the hearing that by \"regulatory merit\" she meant that GSK\u2019s citizen petitions asserted policy positions which \"the FDA could well have adopted\u201d and which were \"qualitatively good idea[s] for the FDA to accept.\u201d Pendergast H\u2019rg Tr. 106-7. The best route for Plaintiffs to rectify any confusion \u2014 between \"regulatory merit\u201d and \"succeed on the merits\u201d \u2014 is through cross-examination at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b240-5\">. Direct Purchasers additionally contend that the jury will confuse Pendergast's regulatory and policy-based testimony with testimony on the scientific merits of the issues in GSK\u2019s citizen petitions. In doing so, they repeat many of the same arguments I have previously rejected. As detailed above, Pendergast has not hidden the fact that she is not a scientific expert and is not opining on the merits of any scientific positions. Rigorous cross-examination, combined with my above-mentioned admonition, should alleviate any concerns regarding jury confusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-8\">. This motion, filed by Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs, contains two parts, as it was a motion for joinder of Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' motions to exclude Mary Pendergast and GSK Expert Gunther Hochhaus. That portion of the motion relating to Dr. Hochhaus was previously withdrawn by stipulation. <em>See </em>No. 08-3301, ECF No. 427.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b241-16\">. The plaintiffs have withdrawn their designation of Rochelle Kimmel as an expert in each of the above-captioned actions. <em>See </em>No. OS-3149, ECF No. 337; No. 08-3301, ECF No. 410; No. 09-1638, ECF No. 209.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
