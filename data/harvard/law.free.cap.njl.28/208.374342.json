This suit was brought by the plaintiff against the defendants, as administrators of the estate of John S. Smith, deceased, to recover the cost and expenses of erecting a dwelling house and cow shed by plaintiff upon a farm of the deceased, situate in the township of Blairstown, in the county of Warren. The declaration, besides several special counts, contained the ordinary common counts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-9\">It appeared on the trial that the said deceased, in his lifetime, was the owner' of several farms situate in the county of Warren; that the plaintiff, who was a son of the deceased, had lived on one of the said farms, as a tenant from year to year, for upwards of twenty-three years prior to the death of the said John S. Smith, first farming the same on shares, and afterwards at a low money rent, which lie liad paid regularly to within a short time of the death of his father; that tho other farms of the deceased were -also occupied Jby his other sons at low rents; that during the tenancy of the plaintiff the dwelling house on the said farm became greatly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>dilapidated and out of repair. It was testified to by tbe plaintiff\u2019s son and son-in-law, that in tbe year 1854 the plaintiff applied to tbe deceased to put up a new dwelling bouse and cow sbed on tbe premises, and that tbe deceased said, that tbe bouse was getting old, and a new one was needed; and that a cow sbed was also needed, but that be was getting too old to build, and had no horses and wagon to build with, and told tbe plaintiff to go on and build a house and cow sbed to suit himself; and that tbe plaintiff replied that be would not build on an uncertainty, and that tbe deceased told tbe plaintiff to go on and build, and tbe farm should be his: and it was further testified to by Mary Synder, that tbe deceased, in a conversation with her, said that tbe plaintiff wanted him to build a better bouse, and be thought the plaintiff ought to have a better bouse, but be was getting old, and bad done all tbe building be would ever do\u2014if tbe plaintiff wanted a better bouse be should build it himself ; that tbe plaintiff bad replied to that, that be, tbe plaintiff, did not want to build on an uncertainty, and be did not know who be was working for, and that be, tbe deceased, bad told tbe plaintiff to go on and fix what be bad a mind to\u2014that be bad left it to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-5\">It further appeared in evidence that, during tbe year 1855, tbe plaintiff built on tbe said farm, at bis own expense, a dwelling bouse and cow shed at a considerable cost, and continued to occupy tbe farm as a tenant from year to year until tbe death of bis father; that tbe said John S. Smith died, in December, 1856, intestate, without conveying or devising the said farm to the plaintiff, and that the said farm, with tbe other lands of tbe deceased, descended to bis six heirs at law, of whom tbe plaintiff was one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-6\">It did not appear in evidence that tbe said agreement was reduced \u201cto wilting, or that tbe said deceased specified tbe size of tbe buildings or tbe materials to be used, but it was shown in evidence that tbe 'deceased was occasion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ally on the promises while the house was being built, and that he expressed himself pleased with the manner in which the plaintiff was putting up the building; and it further appeared that the said house was a suitable one for the farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-5\">It also appeared in evidence that the said farm, as occupied by plaintiff when the said buildings were erected, contained about one hundred acres of land, and was worth, without the plaintiff\u2019s improvements, from $3000 to $3500, and that the estimated cost of the said building was from $600 to $1200.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-6\">It further appeared in evidence that, after the death of the said John S. Smith, a dispute arose concerning the granting of letters of administration upon Ms estate, and that, for the purpose of settling this dispute and dividing the real estate of the deceased among his heirs, the heirs at law and widow of deceased entered into the following agreement:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-7\">\u201cMemorandum of an agreement', made this sixteenth day of February, eighteen hundred and fifty-seven, between Rachel Smith, widow of John S.

Whelpley, judge of the Circuit Court of the county of Warren, certify the case to the Supreme Court, for its advisory opinion upon the following points :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-10\">1. Whether there was any evidence in the cause from , which the jury could lawfully infer a promise by John S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Smith deceased, or his administrators, since his death, to pay for the improvements in money or out of the personal estate of said Smith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-5\">2. Whether the agreement to leave the plaintiff the farm, or give it to him by will or otherwise, was within the statute of frauds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">8. Whether plaintiff entering into the agreement set out, and receiving from the part set off to him more than the cost of his improvements, does not prevent the arising of any implied promise by the administrators to pay for the improvements which might have been raised if the intestate had, and the plaintiff lost, the value of his labor and materials.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-7\">4. Whether the vesting of the land on which the buildings were erected in the plaintiff by descent and the division made is not so far a performance of the intestate\u2019s contract with the plaintiff as to he a bar to any action for the nonperformance of the contract, or to recover back the consideration of it, to wit, the value of the plaintiff\u2019s work, labor, and materials put and expended upon the land of which he had the possession.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-8\">Argued at November term, 1859, before the Chibe Justice and Justices Hainei, Ybedenbuboh, and Yan Dyke.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-9\"><em>JDepue </em>and <em>Shipman, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-11\"><em>Kermedy </em>and <em>Sherrard, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b219-12\">The opinion of the court was delivered by the</p>\n<author id=\"b219-13\">Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Acg\">The contract proved upon the trial of tins case, or which the evidence tended to prove, was clearly within the statute of frauds and perjuries. It was a contract for the transfer of an interest in land. The plaintiff, who was tenant from year to year of his father <em>(the </em>defendant\u2019s intestate), erected new buildings upon the demised premises upon the authority of his father, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>who told the plaintiff \u201c to go on and build, and the farm should be his,\u201d or, as another witness testified, <em>\u201c </em>to go on and fix what he had a mind to\u2014he had left it to him.\u201d The evidence in the cause would have warranted the jury J.i finding that the plaintiff erected the buildings with the consent and approbation of his father, upon his express promise that the farm should be his upon his father\u2019s death, by deed or devise. The contract to transfer the land, being within the statute of frauds, was void, and cannot form the foundation of an action. The plaintiff, therefore, clearly could not sue upon the special contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">May the jury lawfully infer a promise to pay for the improvements in money out of the personal estate of the deceased <em>% </em>It is clear, from the evidence, that the erection of the buildings was not a voluntary service, nor a service rendered relying upon the generosity of the intestate to make compensation. The son expressly refused to proceed with the buildings till he had his father\u2019s promise that the farm should be his. The case, therefore, does not fall within the familiar principle, that no promise can be implied to pay for gratuitous services or services rendered in expectation of a legacy. <em>Grandin </em>v. Reading, 2 <em>Stock. </em>370 ; <em>Johnson </em>v. Hubbell, 2 <em>Stock. </em>332 ; <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>Ex'rs of Le </em>Grange, 3 <em>Johns. R. </em>199; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>13 <em>Wend. </em>460; <em>Little </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>4 <em>Dall. </em>111.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">I But will the law raise an implied promise to pay money when there was an express promise to pay in land ? The answer is, that the promise to pay in land was void, and therefore no 'promise If the plaintiff had erected the' buildings upon the intestate\u2019s land at his request, the law would have implied a promise to pay for them. The plaintiff is in no worse situation because the defendant made an express promise to pay for the services in a particular mode, which promise is itself a nullity. The true principle, says Mr. Chief Just. Nelson, is this: \u201cThe contract being void and incapable of enforcement in a court of law, the party paying the money or rendering the ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>vices in pursuance thereof may treat it as a nullity, and recover the money or the value of the services rendered under the common counts. This is the universal rule in cases where the contract is void for any cause not illegal, if the defendant be in default.\u201d <em>King </em>v. Brown, 2 <em>Hill </em>486.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The principle seems to be perfectly well settled, and is sustained by very numerous authorities, that where a party to an agreement void by the statute of frauds fails to execute it, the price advanced, or the value of the article delivered in part performance of the contract, whether in money, labor, or chattels, may be recovered back, <em>Mavor </em>v. <em>Pyne, </em>3 <em>Bing. </em>285; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Hill, Ryan &amp; Moody </em>42; <em>Gillet </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>5 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>85 <em>and eases cited in note a </em>; <em>Shute </em>v. <em>Dorr, </em>5 <em>Wend. </em>204; <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>3 <em>Hill </em>128; <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Draper, </em>4 <em>Denio </em>51.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In all such cases the law raises, by implication, a promise to repay advances made upon the faith of the contract, and for which no consideration has been paid. If, as a consideration for the improvement, the intestate had agreed to devise to the plaintiff a different tract of land from that upon which the improvement was made the case would be clear of difficulty. But as the improvement is made upon the farm agreed to be devised, it may be urged that the improvement was made not for the benefit of the intestate, but for the plaintiff\u2019s own benefit, inasmuch' as ho resided upon the farm during his life, and expected to receive it after his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">It is true that where the vendee in possession under a parol agreement for the purchase of land makes improvements upon the premises, he cannot recover the value of such improvements in an action at law upon the refusal of the vendor to fulfil the contract. <em>Gillet </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>5 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>85; <em>Shreve </em>v. <em>Grimes, </em>4 <em>Littell's Rep. </em>224.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The improvements in such case are not made at the instance or request of the vendee, nor for his benefit, but for the benefit of the party making them. The law, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>foie, will imply no promise by tbe vendee to pay for them. But this case does not fall within that principi\u00e9. The plaintiff was not in possession under a contract for the land, but as tenant from year to year paying rent. The improvements enured to the benefit of the intestate. -He might, upon the completion of the 'improvements, have turned the plaintiff out of possession, or demanded and received an increased rent for the premises during his life. He was instrumental in having the improvements made. The plaintiff refused to make them until he had his father\u2019s promise that the land should eventually be his. The improvements were not only made by the procurement of the intestate, and for his use, but his estate has actually received the increased value of the improvements made by the money and the labor of the plaintiff. There seems no good reason, either in law or equity, why the jpry may not infer a promise to pay for them. If it be objected that the evidence in the cause admits of a different interpretation, and that the terms of the contract were different from those above stated, the answer is, that what is really proved by the evidence was a question of fact, and should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">3. The legal rights of the plaintiff under the contract were in nowise affected by the agreement entered into among the heirs, after the death of John S. Smith, for the settlement of the intestate\u2019s estate. It was expressly stipulated that nothing in the agreement should bar or release any claim which either of the heirs might have against the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">4. Neither the vesting of the title to the land upon whieh the buildings were erected in the plaintiff, as one of the heirs at law of the intestate, nor the assignment of a portion of the farm upon which the buildings were erected to the plaintiff under the agreement among the heirs, can be regarded as a performance of the intestate\u2019s contract with the plaintiff. The plain sense of the agreement was, that the plaintiff should be paid for his im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>provoments; that their value should be added to his portion of the estate ; that he should have the farm and the buildings. The agreement among the heirs contemplates an equal division of the intestate\u2019s estate among all the heirs, allowing the plaintiff no compensation whatever for his improvements more than he would have received as an heir at law had the improvements been made by him gratuitously and exclusively for his father\u2019s benefit. An allowance, it is true, might have been made in the division of the estate by the commissioners, with the assent of the heirs, to the plaintiff for his improvements. But it is not contemplated in the agreement, and whether made or not, would be a question of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The verdict should be set aside ; and a new trial granted and the Circuit Court should bo advised accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Cited <em>in Updike </em>v. <em>Ten </em>Breock, 3 <em>Vr. </em>115, 117 ; <em>Freeman </em>v.
