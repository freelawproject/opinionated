SCHEINDLIN, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b566-20\">1. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b566-21\">In this consolidated multi-district litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d), plaintiffs seek relief from contamination, or threatened contamination, of groundwater from various defendants\u2019 use of the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (\u201cMTBE\u201d) and/or tertiary butyl alcohol, a product formed by the natural degradation of MTBE in water. In this case, plaintiff Orange County Water District (\u201cOCWD\u201d or the \u201cDistrict\u201d), which is responsible for maintaining groundwater quality within its geographic region, alleges that defendants\u2019 use and handling of MTBE has resulted in contamination and threatened future contamination of groundwater within that region.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-22\">In two previous decisions I dismissed a large number of OCWD\u2019s common law claims as time-barred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The claims that survived included common law claims for injuries suffered due to MTBE releases occurring after May 6, 2000 (including nuisance and trespass), statutory claims under the Orange County Water District Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>(\u201cOCWD Act\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d) \u201cto recover reasonable costs actually incurred since May 6, 2000,\u201d and \u201cdeclaratory relief with respect to future expenses OCWD may incur.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">OCWD now moves for partial summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a) on three claims against <em>certain </em>defendants associated with fourteen gasoline service station sites<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that share four common, undisputed characteristics: <em>first, </em>at each of the fourteen sites, MTBE has been detected in groundwater samples drawn mainly from \u201cShallow\u201d aquifers<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at levels exceeding five parts per billion (\u201cppb\u201d);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>second, </em>each defendant either owned or leased the station <em>and </em>any on-site underground storage tanks (\u201cUSTs\u201d) associated with the station; <em>third, </em>each defendant supplied MTBE gasoline to the station; and <em>fourth, </em>each defendant has conducted remediation at the site.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While deferring the issue of <em>damages </em>for trial, OCWD argues that these undisputed facts establish defendants\u2019 <em>liability </em>(1) under the OCWD Act and for (2) public nuisance and (3) trespass. For the reasons set forth below, OCWD\u2019s motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">A. Defendants\u2019 Remediation Activities</p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">The defendants implicated in this motion are performing remediation under agency supervision pursuant to Chapter 6.7 of the California Health and Safety Code, which relates to unauthorized UST releases.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A \u201crelease\u201d is broadly defined as \u201cany spill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>ing, leaking, emitting, discharging, escaping, leaching, or disposing from an underground storage tank into or on the waters of the state, the land, or the subsurface soils.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Spills and overfills \u201cdue to the use of improper equipment, faulty equipment, operator error, or inattention or overfilling\u201d that take place while gasoline is being placed in a UST also qualify as unauthorized releases.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When a release is detected, the owner or operator of the UST is responsible for reporting the occurrence to the local designated agency (not OCWD <footnotemark>11</footnotemark>) and describing the details of the spill and any corrective or remedial actions undertaken and any further remedial actions necessary to clean up the release.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The owner or operator then performs any necessary corrective action as identified in a work plan approved by the agency, under the supervision of the agency, until closure.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">B. OCWD</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">OCWD is a statutorily-created \u201cspecial water agency\u201d charged with the responsibility to \u201cmaintain, replenish, and manage groundwater resources\u201d within its geographic area.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> OCWD is statutorily authorized to \u201cprevent interference [with] ... [or] diminution ... [or] pollution or contamination\u201d of that groundwater.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> OCWD is also empowered \u201cto conduct any investigations of the quality of the surface and groundwaters within the district ... to determine whether those waters are contaminated or polluted\u201d and to \u201cexpend available funds to perform any cleanup, abatement, or remedial work required under the circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although OCWD owns many <em>monitoring </em>wells <em>(ie., </em>wells used to monitor groundwater contamination), unlike other plaintiffs in this MDL, OCWD does not own any <em>production wells (ie., </em>wells used to provide water to the public).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-16\">Earlier in this litigation, OCWD argued, and this Court accepted, that OCWD has usufructuary rights in the groundwater that it alleges defendants have contaminated.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> I held that on the basis of these property rights, OCWD is able to pursue its common law claims, such as public nuisance and trespass.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In a later Opinion, I held that, for the purposes of determining when the statute of limitations for those common law claims began to run,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201cwhether OCWD has suffered an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>injury turns on whether [ ] contamination caused or should have caused OCWD to act in furtherance of its charge[ ][of] protecting all groundwater within the District\u2019s territory.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> I concluded that \u201cOCWD was appreciably harmed as a matter of law when MTBE was detected at or above five ppb at any monitoring well within OCWD\u2019s territory.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">C. OCWD\u2019s Regulatory Context</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">OCWD is one of at least two other agencies with concurrent oversight of the water supply in and around its service area. <em>First, </em>California\u2019s State Water Resources Control Board comprises nine regional water boards, one of which is the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board (\u201cRegional Board\u201d). The Regional Board\u2019s territory encompasses several water districts, including OCWD. <em>Second, </em>the Orange County Health Care Agency (\u201cOCHCA\u201d) is a regional public health agency tasked with, <em>inter alia, </em>investigation and remediation of certain MTBE spill sites. Both the Regional Board and OCHCA have been active in remediation of MTBE at spill sites within OCWD\u2019s service area, including those owned by defendants, but neither agency has undertaken MTBE remediation efforts beyond those spill sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">In a previous decision, I held that OCWD\u2019s usufructuary rights in its groundwater were not subservient to the rights of other agencies such as the Regional Board, and denied defendants\u2019 motion to stay or remand based on a theory of primary jurisdiction.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> That motion was based in part upon defendants\u2019 contention that various other regulatory agencies were already active in the on-site remediation at various sites within OCWD\u2019s territory, and that California\u2019s regulatory scheme had already provided or would provide the relief sought by OCWD in this suit.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In denying that motion, I noted that \u201c[wjhile other agencies such as the Regional Board or OCHCA may engage in <em>spill-site </em>remediation, they do not attempt remediation or containment of MTBE <em>plumes that may have escaped the spill site before remediation efforts began </em>(or may persist despite such efforts) ....\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">D. OCWD\u2019s Efforts</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">\u201cOCWD became acquainted with MTBE contamination in 1995 .... Soon after, OCWD began systematic testing for MTBE contamination within its district.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Since then, the District has retained environmental consultants to prepare reports regarding MTBE contamination at gas stations in the District\u2019s service area, including the stations that are the subject of this motion.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The consultants\u2019 reports generally characterize MTBE levels, movement in groundwater, migration pathways, and potentially vulnerable production wells near each of the sites.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The District has not yet performed any actual MTBE cleanup at or around any of the sites involved in this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">III. LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u201cAn issue of fact is genuine if \u2018the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u2019 A fact is material if it \u2018might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he burden of demonstrating that no material fact exists lies with the moving party ....\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> \u201cWhen the burden of proof at trial would fall on the nonmoving party, it ordinarily is sufficient for the movant to point to a lack of evidence ... on an essential element of the nonmovant\u2019s claim.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In turn, to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must raise a genuine issue of material fact. To do so, the non-moving party must do more than show that there is \u201c \u2018some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and \u201c \u2018may not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> However, \u201c \u2018all that is required [from the non-moving party] is that sufficient evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>dence supporting the claimed factual dispute be shown to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties\u2019 differing versions of the truth at trial.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AJIG\">\u201cIn ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a court must resolve all ambiguities and draw all factual inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> However, \u201c[i]t is a settled rule that \u2018[credibility assessments, choices between conflicting versions of the events, and the weighing of evidence are matters for the jury, not for the court on a motion for summary judgment.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Summary judgment is therefore \u201cappropriate only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Summary judgment is not an all-or-nothing proposition; Rule 56(a) permits a party to move for summary judgment as to a claim, defense, or part of a claim or defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">I address in turn each of the claims for which OCWD moves for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">A. Orange County Water District Act 1. The Act</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Section 40-8 of the OCWD Act (\u201cInvestigations of quality of surface and ground-waters; cleanup; liability\u201d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">(a) The district may conduct any <em>investigations of the quality of the surface and groundwaters within the district </em>which the district determines to be necessary and appropriate to determine whether those waters are contaminated or polluted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-11\">(b) The district may expend available funds to perform any <em>cleanup, abatement, or remedial work </em>required under the circumstances which, in the determination of the board of directors, is required by the magnitude of the endeavor or the urgency of prompt action needed <em>to prevent, abate, or contain any threatened </em>or existing <em>contamination </em>of, or pollution to, the surface or groundwaters of the district. This action may be taken in default of, or in addition to, remedial work by the person causing the contamination or pollution, or other persons. The district may perform the work itself, by contract, or by or in cooperation with any other governmental agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-12\">(c) If, pursuant to subdivision (b), the contamination or pollution is cleaned up or contained, the effects thereof abated, or <em>in the case of threatened contamination or pollution, other necessary remedial action is taken, </em>the person causing or threatening to cause that contamination or pollution shall be liable to the district to the extent of the reasonable costs actually incurred in cleaning up or containing the contamination or pollution, abating the effects of the contamination or pollution, <em>or taking other remedial action. </em>The amount of those costs, together with court costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, shall be recoverable in a civil action by, and paid to, the district. In any such action, the necessity for the cleanup, containment, abate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>ment, or <em>remedial work, </em>and the reasonableness of the costs incurred therewith, shall be presumed, and the defendant shall have the burden of proving that the work was not necessary, and the costs not reasonable.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Thus, the OCWD Act sets forth a three-step right to recovery for OCWD. <em>First, </em>the District conducts <em>\u201cinvestigations </em>of the quality of the surface and groundwaters within the district ... to determine whether those waters are contaminated or polluted.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> <em>Second, </em>the District may \u201cexpend funds to perform any <em>cleanup, abatement, or remedial work </em>required under the circumstances,\u201d discovered in the initial investigation.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> <em>Third, </em>the District can seek reimbursement for the \u201creasonable costs actually incurred\u201d in cleaning up or containing <em>actual contamination, </em>or for \u201cother necessary remedial action\u201d in the case of <em>threatened contamination</em><footnotemark><em>42</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">2. Application</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">OCWD moves for recovery of costs incurred under the OCWD Act.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> According to OCWD, as a result of the contamination at the service stations at issue on this motion, \u201cthe District Board determined, pursuant to the Act, that it is necessary to remediate MTBE contamination, and the threat of contamination, in order to prevent, abate, and contain threatened and existing contamination of groundwater supplies in the District\u2019s service area.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Allegedly acting pursuant to that determination, the District (1) \u201chas conducted testing for MTBE at drinking water production wells associated with stations where MTBE was released\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and (2) \u201cretained consultants to investigate and characterize the groundwater impacts from MTBE ... released at gasoline stations within the District\u2019s service area\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> at a cost of at least six-hundred thousand dollars.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Those consultants \u201chave now completed their initial assessment and vulnerability analysis for each of the stations for which the District now seeks partial summary judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">The District is seeking to recover for the costs associated with these two endeavors. Recognizing that these costs are not \u201ccosts actually incurred\u201d in remediating <em>actual </em>contamination, OCWD argues that they are reimbursable as \u201cother necessary remedial action\u201d taken in response to <em>threatened </em>contamination.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-14\">The plain language of the Act clearly prohibits recovery for these costs. The Act expressly distinguishes between \u201cinvestigations ... to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>[water] [is] contaminated\u201d and subsequent efforts to remediate water found to be contaminated or threatened.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The costs incurred for remediation are recoverable, but the costs incurred for investigation are not. Testing and report-commissioning constitute <em>investigatory-work, </em>not \u201cremedial action.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The District conducts testing as part of its regular course of business. As for the consultant reports, creating summaries of the activities of others at the sites at issue in this motion<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> has nothing to do with remedying threatened contamination. Nor is there any evidence that the District\u2019s consultants\u2019 file review has led or will lead to remedial action at these sites, or off-site.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> In fact, there is no evidence that the District has done anything with these consultant reports outside of this litigation.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> For these reasons, and because the words of the statute are unambiguous, summary judgment is denied as to the costs incurred by OCWD in testing production wells for MTBE and in commissioning the reports.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> OCWD is directed to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>cause within twenty-one days of this Order why summary judgment on this claim should not be granted to defendants.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">B. Public Nuisance</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Under OCWD\u2019s theory of public nuisance, defendants have \u201csubstantially interfered with and obstructed the District\u2019s ability to provide a water supply free from unacceptable health risk, taste, odor, color, pollution and contamination, and to protect groundwaters within its territory from such harm.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> According to OCWD, \u201cthe MTBE causing the District appreciable harm is in the groundwater immediately beneath each of the defendants\u2019 stations, a fact which defendants admit makes the MTBE \u2018almost always traceable to\u2019 the overlying gasoline stations.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> OCWD prays for \u201ccompensatory and exemplary damages, ... including, but not limited to, equitable relief in the form of an order requiring Defendants to abate the nuisance properly <em>as to the District\u2019</em><footnotemark><em>59</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The groundwater \u201cimmediately beneath\u201d each of defendants\u2019 stations is the nuisance of which OCWD complains\u2014the interference that has \u201cappreciably harmed\u201d it. However, OCWD is not seeking to investigate, clean up, or abate contamination at any one of the fourteen sites at issue in this motion. Instead, OCWD\u2019s alleged \u201cdamages\u201d will relate to the costs associated with investigating and abating <em>off-site </em>groundwater contamination allegedly caused by the migration of contaminated water from the fourteen sites at issue in this motion.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Although OCWD (apparently) does not believe proof of off-site groundwater or drinking water contamination is necessary for summary adjudication as to liability on its public nuisance claim, it nevertheless <em>asserts\u2014once </em>in its brief\u2014 that it has \u201cdetermined that MTBE has escaped on-site remediation and moved off-site at each of the stations\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> As evidence, it cites the Declaration of David Bolin, a certified hydrogeologist for OCWD, submitted in opposition to a previous motion for summary judgment filed by defendants in this case.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> However, it does not direct the Court to any specific statement within that declaration proving that MTBE has \u201cescaped on-site remediation and moved off-site at each of the stations.\u201d Moreover, a close examination of the declaration reveals that any \u201cdeter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>minations\u201d as to off-site contamination were inconclusive at best.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Certainly, nothing in the Bolin Declaration states with any specificity what level of contamination has been detected off-site or is threatened. Meanwhile \u2014 and perhaps not surprisingly in light of the ambiguity surrounding OCWD\u2019s bold, unsupported factual assertion \u2014 defendants contend that \u201c[discovery has shown\u201d that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\">[t]he drinking water wells that the District associates with the fourteen stations at issue in its Motion have never had a detection of MTBE above the California 5 ppb secondary MCL or even the 3 ppb California \u201cdetection level for reporting\u201d (meaning the District has never reported a detection to the State for any of these wells). [OCWD\u2019s] case rests on \u201cmierodetections,\u201d which are of questionable validity and are legally \u201cnon-detects.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Defendants, in turn, cite no evidence for <em>this </em>assertion. This is all to say that, if there is evidence that on-site contamination is affecting groundwater off-site (or drinking water), OCWD has not submitted that evidence in support of <em>this </em>motion, apparently believing such evidence to be irrelevant to establishing a public nuisance in light of the other facts it has established as to each site.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">1. Applicable Law</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Nuisance is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFR\">[a]nything which is injurious to health ... or is indecent or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to <em>interfere with </em>the comfortable enjoyment of life or property, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin, or any public park, square, street, or highway____<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">A <em>public </em>nuisance is \u201cone which affects at the same time an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, although the extent of the annoyance or damage inflicted upon individuals may be unequal.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao-\">Of course, not every interference with collective social interests constitutes a public nuisance. To qualify, and thus be enjoinable [or abatable], the interference must be both <em>substantial and unreasonable. </em>It is substantial if it causes significant harm and unreasonable if its social utility is outweighed by the gravity of the harm inflicted.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">\u201cThe remedies against a public nuisance are: [\u00b6] 1. Indictment or information; [\u00b6] 2. A civil action; or, [\u00b6] 3. Abatement.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">To prove its public nuisance claim, OCWD must show, <em>first, </em>that defendants, by acting or failing to act, <em>created </em>a condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>tion that (1) was harmful to health <em>or </em>(2) was indecent or offensive to the senses <em>or </em>(3) was an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property <em>or </em>(4) unlawfully obstructed the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin, or any public park, square, street, or highway; <em>second, </em>that the condition affected a <em>substantial </em>number of people at the same time <em>(ie., </em>caused <em>significant </em>harm<footnotemark>69</footnotemark>); <em>third, </em>that an ordinary person would be reasonably annoyed or disturbed by the condition; <em>fourth, </em>that the <em>seriousness of the harm </em>outweighs the social utility of defendants\u2019 conduct <em>(ie., </em>that the interference is unreasonable<footnotemark>70</footnotemark>); <em>fifth, </em>that OCWD did not consent to defendants\u2019 conduct; <em>sixth, </em>that OCWD suffered harm that was different from the type of harm suffered by the general public;<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> and <em>seventh, </em>that defendants\u2019 conduct was a <em>substantial factor in causing </em>OCWD\u2019s harm (causation).<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">Defendants argue that OCWD has not shown (1) that defendants\u2019 alleged interference was \u201csubstantial and unreasonable\u201d or (2) that defendants\u2019 conduct was a substantial factor in causing OCWD\u2019s alleged harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">2. Application</p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">a. Substantial and Unreasonable Interference</p>\n<p id=\"b576-14\">OCWD contends that my previous finding that <em>\u201cOCWD </em>was appreciably harmed as a matter of law when MTBE was detected at or above five ppb at any monitoring well within OCWD\u2019s territory\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> proves \u201csubstantial and reasonable\u201d interference as a matter of law.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> But that finding was made in the context of determining when the statute of limitations for OCWD\u2019s common law claims began to run. The reason I found <em>OCWD </em>to be \u201cappreci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>ably harmed\u201d when MTBE was detected at or above five ppb in any monitoring well within its territory was because, at that level, the contamination \u201ccaused or should have caused OCWD to act in furtherance of its charge[ ][of] protecting all groundwater within the District\u2019s territory.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> But a finding that <em>OCWD </em>\u201cshould have responded to that contamination\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> does not establish that the MTBE contamination \u201csubstantially and unreasonably\u201d interfered with <em>the </em>public\u2019s collective social interests such that OCWD has proven a <em>public </em>nuisance as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">While subtle, this distinction is important \u2014 and OCWD gives it scant attention in its briefing.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Although a required element of OCWD\u2019s public nuisance claim (given its prayer for damages) is a showing of special injury to <em>its </em>property interest\u2014 its usufructuary interest in groundwater independent of the State or the People\u2019s general interest in groundwater<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> \u2014 the primary \u201cinjury\u201d that it must show to sustain its public nuisance claim is an in injury to the <em>public </em>\u2014 an \u201coffense[ ] against, or interference with, <em>the exercise of rights common to the public.</em><footnotemark><em>79</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The fact that OCWD <em>the regulatory body </em>is harmed by MTBE detection at five ppb in shallow aquifers beneath gasoline service stations \u2014 to the extent such detection causes it to incur costs while acting in furtherance of its charge to protect all groundwater within its territory \u2014 does not prove, as a matter of law, that such contamination has substantially and unreasonably interfered with <em>the </em>public\u2019s use of the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">I am not holding that OCWD <em>cannot </em>prove that MTBE contamination or threatened contamination constitutes a public nuisance. Rather, the evidence submitted in support of the instant motion for partial summary judgment does not support it. OCWD submits no evidence, for example, that the contamination at any of the fourteen sites has prevented the public from using the District\u2019s water, or has offended the senses of a substantial number of individuals in the district. The contamination at five ppb found at each monitoring well identified by OCWD was drawn from shallow aquifers \u2014 water which is <em>already unusable, </em>as OCWD has conceded.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Indeed, on a previous motion in this case, the District submitted a declaration claiming that \u201cvirtually all drinking water wells within the District\u2019s area draw from several hundred feet below ground surface, and certainly none draw water from shallow depths close to service stations.\u201d <footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Thus, although a secondary MCL <em>in drinking water </em>\u201cmay adversely affect the odor or appearance of the water and may cause a substantial number of persons served by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>the public water system to discontinue its use,\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> strongly supporting a finding of public nuisance, a finding of secondary MCLs in water drawn from <em>shallow aquifers </em>does not prove the existence of such a nuisance.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">OCWD directs the court to <em>State of California v. Campbell, </em>where the Ninth Circuit upheld a district court decision granting summary judgment to the State on its public nuisance claim against a manufacturer that had dumped trichloroethylene on its property (the \u201c20th Street Property\u201d), resulting in the contamination of groundwater at the site itself and also in municipal and private wells located down-gradient from the site.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> According to OCWD, Campbell stands for the proposition that \u201c \u2018[polluted water is a public nuisance.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> Leaving aside for the moment whether this is an accurate statement of California law,<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> it is certainly taken out of context, for OCWD has offered no undisputed evidence that the water in its district is \u201cpolluted\u201d as the <em>Campbell </em>court used that word:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">Where ... it is claimed that a substance underlying [defendants\u2019] land creates a public nuisance, it is not enough that some water on or in'the land may come into contact with the substance. Rather, it must be shown that the substance has, or at least is likely to have, invaded the water supplies of the public or of a considerable number of persons with one or more of the effects set forth in Civil Code section 3479.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuH\">Such a showing was made in <em>Campbell. </em>After the California Department of Toxic Substance's Control detected the presence of trichloroethylene and other hazardous chemicals in the soil beneath the 20th Street Property,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-12\">[subsequent testing indicated that high concentrations of trichloroethylene and other hazardous substances were present not only in the soil but also in the groundwater at the 20th Street Property. The Department tested the groundwater in municipal and private wells that are located downgradient from the 20th Street Property and determined that trichloroethylene had contaminated that groundwater as well. One of the polluted wells was located at Stanley Park, a housing subdivision located about a mile downgradient from the 20th Street Property.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Here, unlike in <em>Campbell </em>\u2014 but as in <em>Beck </em>\u2014 OCWD has presented \u201cno evidence that the [MTBE] under [defendants\u2019] property has invaded other property or the water supplies of other persons\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> or that drinking water has been contaminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Nor has the District presented evidence of \u201cthe potential for <em>future contamination </em>of public water supplies,\u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> a separate basis for its public nuisance claim. As in <em>Beck,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">[t]he evidence is that any contamination of the soil on [defendants\u2019] property ... is at relatively shallow depths The shallow groundwater in the area is of poor quality and water users draw their supplies from much deeper sources .... <footnotemark>91</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au8p\">Moreover, all fourteen sites are undergoing remediation and, as I discussed earlier, OCWD has presented no undisputed evidence that the contamination has migrated off-site, or the extent of that contamination. But when a plaintiff pursues a public nuisance claim based on a fear of future harm, \u201cthe burden must be on the plaintiff to establish some measure of such things as the magnitude and likelihood of the danger and it cannot be enough to merely suggest a danger and assert that it has not been ruled out.\u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> In other words, proving that \u201csignificant amounts of [ ] MTBE moved off-site long before groundwater remediation efforts began, and that on site remediation efforts have been too little, too late\u201d is not an issue for \u201cthe damages phase of this case\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark>; it is a crucial component of perhaps the most important element of OCWD\u2019s public nuisance claim, and a component that OCWD did not support with sufficient evidence on this motion. Thus, although I cannot conclude as a matter of law that \u201cit is unlikely that the contamination under [defendants\u2019] property will invade public water supplies,\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> I certainly cannot grant partial summary judgment to OCWD on the substantial and unreasonable harm element of its public nuisance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">b. \u201cSubstantial Factor\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">While OCWD has not offered undisputed evidence that the interference of which it complains is substantial and unreasonable, it <em>has </em>proven, as a matter of law, that the acts of defendants associated with the fourteen sites implicated in this motion were a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in causing the MTBE contamination detected beneath those sites, thereby satisfying the causation requirement for a public nuisance claim.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-14\">A substantial factor in causing harm is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>a factor that a reasonable person would consider to have contributed to - the harm. It must be more than a remote or trivial factor [, but it] does not have to be the only cause of the harm. Conduct is not a substantial factor in causing harm if the same harm would have occurred without that conduct.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">i. UST-Operated Sites</p>\n<p id=\"At7\">In addition to sharing three of the four primary characteristics based on which OCWD argues <em>all </em>defendants may be held liable \u2014 namely, (1) ownership of (or a lease on) a now-contaminated site and any on-site USTs, (2) responsibility for supplying MTBE gasoline to the station, and (3) responsibility for remediation at the site \u2014 the defendants associated with five of the fourteen sites implicated in this motion also (4) <em>operated </em>the USTs located on-site.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> Under these facts, the possibility that these defendants were <em>not </em>a substantial factor in causing the MTBE contamination detected on-site amounts to \u201cmetaphysical doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> <em>First, </em>because each defendant is engaged in remediation at each site pursuant to Chapter 6.7 of the California Health and Safety Code, and because an unauthorized release from a UST precipitates any cleanup under Chapter 6.7, it follows that an unauthorized release from a UST caused at least <em>some </em>of the contamination at each site. (Thus, defendants\u2019 contention that a \u201ccustomer drive-off [or] tank over-fill\u201d could be responsible for the contamination<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> is untenable.) <em>Second, </em>the defendants associated with these stations supplied the gasoline stored in the leaking USTs, owned the leaking USTs, and operated the leaking USTs. Thus, there can be no explanation for the UST leaks that \u201ccreated or assisted in the creation of the [alleged] nuisance\u201d other than some act by these defendants.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> Accordingly, partial summary judgment as to these five sites on the issue of causation is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">ii. Non UST-Operated Sites</p>\n<p id=\"AC6\">However, defendants proffer evidence that nine of the fourteen stations at issue on this motion were <em>operated </em>by independent dealers during periods when MTBE was detected beneath them \u2014 some of whom testified at their depositions that they were responsible for all daily duties at the sites, including gauging USTs for inventory loss, verifying inventory, recording product deliveries, inspecting island and tank fill areas, and monitoring for alarms.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> Defendants argue that this evidence \u201craises a factual issue as to whether the non-Defendant operators or someone other than the station owner may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>been responsible for the contamination.\u201d<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> But under California law, one party\u2019s contribution to the creation of a nuisance does not preclude another party\u2019s (joint) liability for \u201ccausing\u201d it; both can be \u201csubstantial factors\u201d in causing the harm alleged. And here, the undisputed fact remains that the defendants associated with these nine sites \u201ccreate[d] or assisted] in creating a system that cause[d] hazardous [chemicals] to be disposed of improperly.\u201d<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> Whatever part the independent dealers may have played in causing the UST leaks, there can be no genuine dispute that these defendants\u2019 conduct in setting up the systems that caused the contamination was \u201cmore than a slight, trivial, negligible, or theoretical factor in producing [the contamination].\u201d <footnotemark>104</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\">\u201c[A plaintiff] is not required to eliminate entirely all possibility that the defendant\u2019s conduct was not a cause Conduct can be considered a substantial factor in bringing about harm if it has created a force or series of forces which are in continuous and active operation up to the time of the harm ....\u201d<footnotemark>105</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Defendants emphasize this Court\u2019s previous decision holding that ownership and supply alone are not enough to establish liability for nuisance.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> But that decision, as well as the decision on which it was based, addressed (1) manufacturer liability for nuisance in the absence of property ownership<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> as well as (2) landowner liability for nuisance in the absence of any affirmative conduct on the part of the landowner.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> They are inapposite. These defendants not only manufactured MTBE and owned the land that was contaminated, but supplied MTBE to the stations and owned the USTs where it was stored \u2014 the USTs that leaked, necessitating remedial action on their part. As the <em>City of Modesto </em>court explained, \u201cliability for nuisance does not hinge on whether the defendant owns, possesses or controls the property, nor on whether he is in a position to abate the nuisance; the critical question is <em>whether the defendant created or assisted in the creation of the nuisance. </em>\u201d<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> Because \u201creasonable minds could not dispute\u201d this question as to the defendants associated with these nine sites,<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> even <em>if </em>the independent dealers\u2019 actions may also have been a substantial factor in causing the nuisance, partial summary judgment on the issue of causation is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>3. \u201cContinuing\u201d or \u201cPermanent\u201d Nuisance</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">OCWD moves for partial summary judgment not only as to <em>liability for </em>public nuisance, but also that the nuisance is \u201ccontinuing\u201d such that the claim is timely (i.e., the statute of limitations has not run). In a public nuisance cause of action in which the plaintiff prays for damages incidental to the abatement of the public nuisance (as OCWD does here), the nuisance must be characterized as either \u201ccontinuing\u201d or \u201cpermanent.\u201d If the nuisance is permanent, a plaintiff must bring one action for all past, present, and future damages within the three-year statute of limitations after the permanent nuisance is created.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> On the other hand, if the nuisance is continuing, then \u201c \u2018[e]very repetition of [the] continuing nuisance is a separate wrong,\u2019 subject to a new and separate limitation period, \u2018for which the person injured may bring successive actions for damages until the nuisance is abated, even though an action based on the original wrong may be barred.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> \u201cThe classic example of a continuing nuisance is an ongoing or repeated disturbance, such as ... one ... caused by noise, vibration or foul odor.\u201d <footnotemark>113</footnotemark> To show a continuing violation, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the damage is \u201creasonably abatable,\u201d which means that the condition can be removed \u201cwithout unreasonable hardship and expense.\u201d <footnotemark>114</footnotemark> However, the fact that an abatement \u201cmay take considerable time and may never be wholly successful\u201d does not dictate a finding that it is not abatable.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> \u201cWhether contamination ... is a permanent or continuing injury is ordinarily a question of fact turning on the nature and extent of the contamination.\u201d<footnotemark>116</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">In support of its motion, OCWD presents three arguments intended to prove the reasonable abatability of the contamination at the sites at issue.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> <em>First, </em>OCWD argues that the contamination must be abatable because the defendants are engaging in remediation.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> <em>Second, </em>the defendants\u2019 Master Answers state that gasoline leaks are generally remediable.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> <em>Third, </em>the District is authorized by law to determine whether MTBE can and should be abated, and has made the decision that it should be.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Abatability is not proven by defendants\u2019 on-site remediation efforts, however, because the District\u2019s theory of damages is based on <em>offsite contamination, </em>and the tactics used to remediate MTBE vary depending on where it is being conducted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>For instance, remediation at the spill site might involve the excavation of contaminated soil. But the successful excavation and treatment of contaminated soil from the spill site does not prove that a recovery well designed to treat an off-site MTBE plume will be similarly successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">OCWD\u2019s argument that abatability is established by defendants\u2019 Answers is also unconvincing, for two reasons. <em>First, </em>not every defendant\u2019s Answer contains the assertion that gasoline spills can generally be remediated.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> <em>Second, </em>the California Supreme Court has rejected the contention that \u201cmere technological feasibility proves abatability.\u201d<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> Thus, there must be a determination that remediation is not merely possible, but reasonable in light of all the circumstances of the contamination at issue. The broad, general language contained in the Answers is insufficient evidence of the abatability of the contamination at each site at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Finally, OCWD\u2019s reliance on its own determination that MTBE can and should be abated is unavailing. The District points to minutes from a 2005 Board of Directors meeting adopting a resolution that funds should be expended \u201cto perform investigation, cleanup, abatement, and remedial work to address MTBE.\u201d<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> This general resolution does not constitute a <em>determination </em>that MTBE can be reasonably abated at the fourteen sites at issue in this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">In the absence of any expert reports demonstrating that the groundwater contamination can be remedied at a reasonable cost by reasonable means at these sites, and because I must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor, I must conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact whether the contamination is reasonably abatable at all fourteen sites at issue in this motion, and that the nuisance is therefore continuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">C. Trespass</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">1. Applicable Law</p>\n<p id=\"b583-14\">\u201cA trespass is an invasion of the interest in the <em>exclusive </em>possession of land, as by entry upon it .... \u201d<footnotemark>124</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-15\">2. Application</p>\n<p id=\"b583-16\">The theory of OCWD\u2019s trespass claim is that defendants\u2019 alleged contamination of on-site groundwater constitutes an invasion of OCWD\u2019s usufructuary interests\u2014 interests I held, on a previous motion for summary judgment, to be possessory property rights.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> In opposing that motion, OCWD had argued that through its replenishment of the groundwater basin, it acquired a corollary \u201c \u2018legal [usufructuary] right to withdraw an equivalent amount of water from the basin.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> I agreed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>OCWD, explaining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\">OCWD\u2019s enabling Act specifically charges it with the power to [a]ppropriate and acquire water and water rights within or outside of the district. In accordance with this mandate, OCWD has acquired a usufructuary right through its replenishment activities under California law.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">On this basis, I rejected defendants\u2019 argument \u2014 in support of its motion to dismiss OCWD\u2019s trespass claim \u2014 that OCWD has no \u201c \u2018possessory interest in real property\u2019 with which the alleged MTBE contamination has interfered.\u201d<footnotemark>128</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Defendants now argue that OCWD\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment as to liability for trespass must fail because \u201c[t]he District\u2019s usufructuary right to water \u2014 to the extent it has one \u2014 is subordinate to other water users, and as such, the District does not have <em>exclusive </em>control of the water and cannot assert a trespass claim.\u201d<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> In California, \u201cthe right of property in water is usufructuary, and consists not so much <em>of the </em>fluid itself as the advantage of its use.\u201d<footnotemark>130</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aye\">Courts typically classify water rights in an underground basin as <em>overlying, appropriative, </em>or prescriptive. An <em>overlying </em>right, analogous to that of the riparian owner in a surface stream, is the owner\u2019s right to take water from the ground underneath for use on his land within the basin or watershed; it is based on the ownership of the land and is appurtenant thereto.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1j\">Conversely, an <em>appropriative </em>right is based not on the ownership of land above the groundwater, but on the <em>taking </em>of groundwater.<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> \u201cOne with <em>overlying </em>rights has rights superior to that of other persons who lack legal priority [such as appropriative rights-holders], but is nonetheless restricted to a reasonable beneficial use.\u201d <footnotemark>133</footnotemark> The right of an appropriator (like OCWD) is thus subordinate to an overlying right-holder. This is true for groundwater rights even if the overlying right-holder is not exercising its right.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">To the extent the District has <em>any </em>usufructuary rights,<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> those rights are ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>propriative, and are therefore subordinate to the State (acting pursuant to the public trust), any overlying right holders (such as the defendants as owners of the sites), and the purveyors that actually pump the water out of the ground and provide it to customers.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> Thus, OCWD does not have <em>exclusive </em>\u2014 or even <em>primary </em>\u2014 possession of the property interest allegedly invaded by the MTBE contamination, and therefore cannot assert a claim for continuing trespass.<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> Accordingly, as with the OCWD Act claim, OCWD is directed to show cause within twenty-one days of the date of this Order as to why summary judgment should not be granted to defendants on the trespass claim.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">For the aforementioned reasons, OCWD\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment of liability on all three of the claims at issue in this motion is denied.
