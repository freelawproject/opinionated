D. 1869, against Robert Porter, acting sheriff of said county, in trespass for the value of certain goods, drugs and merchandise, seized by said sheriff, by virtue of a writ of sequestration issued out of the District Court of Galveston county, commanding said sheriff to seize said goods, drugs and merchandise as the property of W. H. Dial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-18\">At the Fall Term of said District Court of Robertson county, the plaintiff filed a supplemental petition, making James Davidson, A. Robira, and appellant, T. E. Tull\u00eds, parties defendant in said suit, by alleging that said defendants aided and assisted said sheriff, Porter, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the commission of the trespass, and prayed that said Davidson, Robira and Tull\u00eds be served with proper citations and copies of the original and supplemental petitions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\">A judgment by default was rendered against the defendant, T.

Tull\u00eds, and the cause proceeded to trial against the other defendants upon the issues joined in their pleadings. <em>\\</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-6\">The demurrer of defendants, Davidson and Robira, to-the petition was sustained by the court, and plaintiff then filed an amendment, after the judgment by default-was rendered by the court against Tull\u00eds, the appellant. The cause was then submitted to the jury as to the other defendants, under the evidence and charge of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-8\">Verdict rendered in favor of the other defendants, against the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Auq\">Under instructions of the court damages were assessed against the appellant, in favor of appellee, for the sum of $3472, and final judgment entered against him for that amount by the court.

(Graves v. Robertson, <em>22 </em>Texas, 130; Ib., 175; see Underhill v. Lockett, 20 Texas, 131.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-11\">This court has in repeated decisions deprecated in strong language any departure from the plain requirements of the statute regulating sheriff\u2019s return of process. (See 19 Texas, 115 ; 22 Texas, 130.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-12\">In appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial, he shows that he has a just defense to the plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-13\">We submit that the motion should have prevailed, as he showed a good and equitable defense to the action, and sufficient reason for not making it in time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-14\">There cannot be a several verdict for damages in a joint trespass, but the judgment must be joint against all the parties; and if the verdict be inconsistent the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>will be set aside.

Paige, 7 Monroe, 401; Cunningham v. Dyer, 2 Monroe, 50; Dormer v. Flint, 2 Williams\u2019 (Vermont) R., 530; Bowman v. Noyes, 12 New Hampshire, 307; Hilliard on Torts, p. 180, \u00a7 25.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-8\">And that the plea of the defendants, in which they set up the writ of sequestration as a defense, was not sufficient, and should not have protected them, and is therefore not available for the defaulting defendant, etc., etc., even if the jury should have found on it, about which we know nothing, there being several pleas. (Hilliard on Torts, p. 30, \u00a7| 3 and 5, and authorities cited ; 1 Hilliard on Torts, pp. 492, 494, 495, 498, 516, 517, 518 ; 2 Hilliard on Torts, pp. 194, 195, 229, 243, 244.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-9\">We insist that the case cannot be examined, except on the merits of Tull\u00eds\u2019 motion, and that shows no excuse for his failure to appear and answer; and as the cause of action against him is good, the judgment is conclusive against him. (Long and another v. Wortham, 4 Texas, 381; Niblett v. Shelton, 28 Texas, 548; Power v. Gillespie, 27 Texas, 370; Vardeman v. Edwards, 21 Texas, 737; Spencer v. Kinard, 12 Texas, 180; Cook v. De La Garza, 13 Texas, 431.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b552-13\">Ogden, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYD\">This action was originally brought against B. Porter, sheriff of Bobertson county, Texas, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>the seizure of certain drugs and medicines; and by an amended petition, appellant, Tull\u00eds, and Davidson and Robira were made defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"AJy\">Porter, Davidson and Robira answered, setting up their defenses; but Tull\u00eds failed to answer, and judgment was taken against him by default, with a writ of inquiry. The cause was submitted to a jury, who found in favor of Porter, Davidson and Robira, but, under the positive instructions of the court, found a verdict against Tull\u00eds, for the full value of the drugs seized by the sheriff. He filed a motion for a new trial, which was overruled by the court, and he has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"AKh8\">The charge of the court, in effect, instructed the jury to find against the defendant, Tull\u00eds, the value of the goods seized by the sheriff. This, we think, was error. It was in proof that at the time of the alleged trespass of appellant, the drugs were not the property of the plaintiff. That Tull\u00eds had no other connection with the drugs than to assist the sheriff in taking an inventory of the same; that he was not present at the time the drugs were seized, and that he in no way aided in the- seizure, removal or conversion of the same. Most clearly, then, under the evidence, the value of the drugs subsequently seized by the sheriff could form no measure of damage as against Tull\u00eds. If he had trespassed upon the property of plaintiff, he might have been liable for damages; but his liability should bear some relation to the injury committed. The evidence negatived any combination on the part of Tull\u00eds to seize or convert the goods; and he should not therefore be held to answer for others\u2019 trespasses or damages inflicted by them.</p>\n<p id=\"AGJ\">We think the court also erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial. He was not present by himself or counsel, and made no defense, but in his motion for a new trial he showed that he had a defense, and that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>absence from the court, and his failure to appear, in obedience to the process of the court, were caused by his compulsory attendance on the Federal Court at Austin. Under the authority of Thomas v. Womack, 13 Texas, 585, we think this a sufficient showing to entitle appellant to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">In the case of Portwood v. Wilburn, 33 Texas, 713, this court held, that it was error in the District Court to permit a plaintiff to amend his petition, after a default taken, without having that default set aside; and we have only to repeat that opinion, in order to decide one of the causes of complaint in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-15\">We are also of the opinion that there is a defect in the sheriff\u2019s return of service on Tull\u00eds, which will require a reversal of the judgment. The sheriff certifies that he executed the same \u201cby delivering to the within named, T. E. Tull\u00eds, in person, a certified copy of this writ, and a copy of petition.\u201d What petition? The return fails to inform us whether the copy of petition served was a copy of the petition in this or any other particular case. In Graves v. Robertson, 22 Texas, 130, and in Underhill v. Locket, in Robert v. Stockslager, 4 Texas, 307, this court has held that no presumptions will be indulged to aid the sheriff\u2019s return in order to support a judgment by default. The statute is plain and mandatory, and if parties will take judgment by default, without requiring a$correct and specific return by the sheriff of the service of the citation, as the law directs, they should not complain if their judgment is set aside on an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-29\">For the reasons above given we think the court erred in overruling the motion for a new trial. The judgment of the District Court is therefore reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-30\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
