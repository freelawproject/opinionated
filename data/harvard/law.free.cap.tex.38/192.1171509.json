Tried below before the Hon. J. M. Onins.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-12\">This is a suit by R. M. Compton, executrix, as holder of a promissory note of date ninth of January, 1860, for \u00a7975, executed by King, Sledge <em>&amp; </em>Co. to P. W. McNeese or bearer. The loss of the note was alleged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-13\">The .defendant, Sledge, plead payment in full.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-14\">The testimony showed that J. D. Giddings, A. G. ompton (plaintiff\u2019s testator), P. W. McNeese and \u00c1. M. Lewis had hired certain negroes from one Applewhite to work on the W. C. Railroad. The work was afterwards let by contract to King, Sledge <em>&amp; </em>Co., who assumed the liability incurred for the hire of the Applewhite negroes. To secure the amount assumed, they executed to P. W. Mc-Heese the note sued on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-15\">About the maturity of the note Sledge found it in the hands of A. M. Lewis, and paid it to him by transferring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>a note on one Johnson, secured by a lien on land, Johnson being solvent. Lewis endorsed the note, \u201cPaid in full,\u201d and surrendered it to Sledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-5\">Subsequently, McNeese parted with his claim to the note to Compton, the appellant\u2019s testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-6\">The testimony was somewhat conflicting between Mc-Neese and Sledge, both of whom were examined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-7\">The judge instructed the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-8\">\u201cIf you believe that A. M. Lewis was one of the beneficiaries of the note executed by King, Sledge &amp; Co., he had the authority to settle it in any manner that might be agreed upon between him and Sledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-9\">\u201cIf you find that the defendant, Sledge, paid the note to A. M. Lewis, and that it was delivered by Lewis to Sledge, or settled in full, it is immaterial how or in what it was paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-10\">Verdict and judgment for defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-11\">Appeal by plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-12\"><em>Giddings &amp; Morris, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbK7\">There is a marked distinction between partners and joint owners.

Compton, deceased, brought this suit on a promissory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>note for the sum of $975, executed to Parrott W. McNeese, and transferred by Mc\u00d1eese to appellant\u2019s'testator. The plaintiff below, in her petition, alleged the loss of the note sued on.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The defendant set up full payment, satisfaction and cancellation of the note, and on the trial produced tbe note, endorsed satisfied and cancelled by A. M. Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">It was in proof that the defendant, Sledge, had paid the note to Lewis by transferring the note of Johnson in lieu thereof, and that Lewis thereupon receipted the note sued on. It is contended for appellant that as the note was placed in the hands of Lewis, an attorney, for collection, he had no authority to receive anything in payment therefor but money, and that the exchange of this for the Johnson note is not binding on her, and that she now has the right to demand payment on the Sledge note. The note, however, is payable to bearer, and it is in proof that Lewis at one time at least had an interest in the note, and the maker swears that at the time of payment, or exchange of notes, he knew that Lewis was interested in the note, and knew nothing of its being placed in his hands for collection. In view of this testimony, we think it wholly immaterial whether the note was placed in Lewis\u2019 hands for collection or not, since the maker had no notice of any such facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The cause was submitted to a jury under proper instructions from the court, and they found a verdict for the defendant, and under the facts proven we think they were authorized in their finding. The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Afeibmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
