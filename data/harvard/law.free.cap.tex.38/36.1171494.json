(Art. 3931, P. D.) Nor was a bill of review the proper remedy. The case should have been brought up on error. (Art. 1489, P. D.; Larson v. Moore, 1 Texas, 27; Seguin v. Maverick, 24 Texas; Lewis v. San Antonio, 26 Texas, 317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">There is no prayer in the petition for a new trial on the merits.
