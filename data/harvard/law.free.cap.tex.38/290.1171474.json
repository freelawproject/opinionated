Walsh, November 19, 1867, for five hundred dollars; and the other for three hundred dollars, executed December 24, 1867, by T. D. Gilbert. Plaintiff alleged the notes were given for borrowed money, to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>used in the partnership business of Walsh <em>&amp; </em>Gilbert.

Moser sued the firm of Walsh &amp; Gilbert. The notes are not given by the firm, nor is there any evidence to prove that the money loaned by Moser went into the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The evidence in this case, so far as it was material to make out the plaintiff\u2019s case, does not support the verdict. Appellee\u2019s counsel virtually admits that the weight of evidence is against him. This is so apparent that the court below should have granted a new trial; and for the error in refusing a new trial, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
