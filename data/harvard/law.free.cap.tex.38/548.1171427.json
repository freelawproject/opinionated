Tried below before the Hon. J. B.

In refusing a trial by jury.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b564-8\"><em>Davis &amp; </em>Beall, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApN\">This was a proceeding in the nature of impeachment, instituted in the District Court under the provisions of the Tax Act of 1870 (see Laws of Twelfth Legislature, p. 304), to remove the defendant from his office of justice of the peace. And we submit, that the District Court had no proper jurisdiction, because the provisions of the Tax Act of 1870, in so far as they sought to confer the power of rem oving justices of the peace from office in the summary manner prescribed in said act, is obnoxious to the 13th Article of the State Constitution, Section 17, which provides \u201cthat every law enacted by the Legislature shall embrace but one object, and that shall be expressed in the title.\u201d This section of the organic law has been judicially construed to be <em>mandatory </em>in its terms. (See Cannon v. Hemphill, 7 Texas, 308.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-10\">If, however, said provisions ever had any force, they were repealed, either expressly or by necessary implication, by the Tax Act of 1871. (See Laws of Twelfth Legislature, 1871, page 43.) Whenever a statute is revised, or one act framed from another, some parts being omitted, the parts omitted are not revived by construction, but are annulled. (Ellis v. Paige, 1 Pick., 43, 45; 7 Mass., 140; 10 Pick., 39 ; 5 Texas, 433.) And when the new statute comprehends th\u00e9 subject matter of the old, the latter is repealed. (34 Texas, 478.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-11\">If we regard this proceeding as criminal in its charac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>acter, then the exceptions ought to have been sustained, because the petition does not contain the essentials of an information, tested by the Criminal Procedure, Articles 2869, 2870 and 2871. If is neither supported by the accompanying \u201coath of some credible person,\u201d nor does it conclude, \u201cagainst the peace and dignity of the State.\u201d The latter is a requirement of the Constitution of the State, and, by the express decision of the Supreme Court, cannot be dispensed with. (See 7 Texas, 74.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-4\">But regarding this proceeding in the light of a civil or criminal action, we hold that our second assignment of error must be sustained. We respectfully submit that we were entitled to a jury trial upon the truth or falsity of the facts in said information alleged against the defendant. This constitutional right was denied him, and he appeals to this court to extend to him the aegis of its protection, with no other citation of authority on this point than the plain provisions of the Constitution, securing the right of trial by jury, in aE cases, civil and criminal. (Article 5, Section 16; Article 1, Sections 8 and 12.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b565-5\">McAdoo, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxR\">This case was brought into this court upon a writ of error from the Robertson County District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The action was brought in the court below somewhat in the nature of a prosecution by presentment. The paper filed, however, by the district attorney does not conform \u2022 to the legal requirements of a presentment. In one material particular at least it is defective, in that it does not conclude, \u201cagainst the peace and dignity of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The instrument charged, substantially, malfeasance and misfeasance in office, and in competency to discharge the duties of the office of justice of the peace, which he, the plaintiff in error, held, and prayed that he be removed from office, and that he pay the cost of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>The defendant plead to the jurisdiction of the court, the insufficiency of the presentment, a general denial of the allegations in the information, and not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The trial, if such it may be called, is thus chronicled in the record: \u201cThis day came the parties, by their attorneys ; and the above cause coming on to be heard, and the matters in controversy being brought before the court, and the evidence and argument of counsel on either side having been heard and fully understood, it is considered by the court that Marks Wilson, justice of the peace of Precinct Ho. 1, and for the county of Robertson, and member of the police court in and for said county, be adjudged incompetent to discharge the duties of his said office. It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the said Marks Wilson be, and the said Marks Wilson is hereby, forthwith removed from his said office as justice of the peace aforesaid, for incompetency and misconduct in office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">It appears that there was no trial by a jury, and no verdict of conviction for any offense for which a justice of the peace can be removed from office.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The presentment sets out no charges in such form as would have supplied a verdict of a jury or a judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">The proceedings were void; and in accordance with' the ruling of this court in the case of Thomas E. Hogg, <em>ex parte, </em>decided at the last term of this court, the judgment in this case is reversed and the case dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">Reversed and dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
