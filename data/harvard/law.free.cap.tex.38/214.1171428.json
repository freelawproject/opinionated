Burnett.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-7\">Suit instituted in the County Court of Walker county by the defendants in error against the plaintiff in error on the instrument set out in the opinion. Judgment went against the plaintiffs in that case, because the instrument was sued on as a moneyed demand, and the value of the cash note, which was the primary element of the promise, was not alleged and therefore not proven. The case was taken to the District Court by appeal, where the petition was amended, and the value of a good, solvent, cash note, due the estate of A. G. Grant, deceased, on the twenty-third of November, 1861 (date of note sued on), alleged to be $217.87, and prayed for judgment for that amount, with interest. Judgment was rendered against them in the District Court, from which they appealed to this court. In this court the judgment of the District Court was reversed and judgment rendered here for $217.87, with interest. ' On application for rehearing in this court the judgment was reformed by remanding the case, instead of rendering judgment. The case came on for trial again in the District Court at the July term, 1872, when judgment was rendered for the plaintiff for $407.43, the amount specified in the instrument sued on, with interest.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b226-8\"><em>Abercrombie &amp; Banton, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2m\">cited Ward &amp; Martin v.

Gr. Grrant, deceased, to count interest from the first of September last.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">We held that on failure to deliver the note called for by this instrument within a reasonable time, it became a moneyed demand, and as such the holder might sue upon it. This ruling in nowise interferes with that of the case referred to in 2 Texas. We make the same ruling now, and therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">Affirmed .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
