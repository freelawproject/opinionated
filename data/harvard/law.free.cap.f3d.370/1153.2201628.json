(\u201cNVT\u201d), appeals from a final decision of the United States Court of Federal Claims, denying NVT\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting the government\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment on the administrative record, in NVT\u2019s protest over the final cost comparison determination of a bid evaluation process. <em>NVT Techs., Inc. v. United States, </em>54 Fed.Cl. 330 (2002). The Court of Federal Claims concluded that the solicitation at issue in this case was not ambiguous, that the government\u2019s interpretation of the solicitation was correct, and that the agency\u2019s bid evaluation determination would stand. The trial court further opined that, in the alternative, if the solicitation was ambiguous, the ambiguity was patent and NVT could not prevail for that reason. Because we hold that the solicitation was ambiguous and the ambiguity was patent, we affirm the judgment of 'th\u00e9 Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b840-15\">On November 15, 2000, the United States Department of the Navy (\u201cNavy\u201d or \u201cagency\u201d) issued solicitation number N68711-01-R-5101 to obtain bids for facility maintenance and utility services, including facilities maintenance and repair, utilities operations and maintenance, facilities planning, engineering, and environmental support services, for the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego, California. The Depot is used by a population of up to 9,600 people, including 2,600 permanent personnel and between 3,500 and 7,000 Marine recruits. The appearance of the facility is key, and subject to a policy that \u201cthe unique buildings/faeilities ... be maintained in a professional manner as a projection of Marine Corps pride that is world renowned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-16\">The solicitation was issued as part of a government cost comparison effort to determine whether it was more efficient to accomplish the specified maintenance and services for the Depot under an outside contract or by government performance of the tasks. Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d) Circular No. A-76 sets forth an elaborate mandatory process for comparing the costs of in-house and private production. In performing the cost comparison under OMB A-76, the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>is to compare the bid of the private sector source with the cost of providing the good or service with government facilities and personnel, or the agency\u2019s \u201cMost Efficient Organization\u201d or \u201cMEO.\u201d <em>See Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees v. United States, 258 </em>F.3d 1294, 1296 (Fed.Cir.2001). The MEO is not necessarily an existing organization, but the organization the agency would establish if it were competing for the work. <em>Id. </em>at 1296 n. 1. If government performance is determined to be more economical, no award is made under the request, and the solicitation may be canceled.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">The bid process was to consist of three steps. First, interested bidders from the private sector would submit \u201cstatements of qualifications.\u201d These submissions would be evaluated and the agency would inform each offeror, based on that evaluation, whether it was considered to be a \u201cviable competitor.\u201d Bidders, however, would be able to continue to the second step of the bid process regardless of the evaluation results. Next, each offeror would submit technical and price proposals. These proposals would be reviewed, and a competitive and acceptable offer would be selected as the private-sector offer to compete against the agency\u2019s in-house proposal. Finally, the selected private-sector offer would be compared to the in-house proposal to ensure that both offers offered the same level of performance and the proposed costs would be compared. The initial award would then be given to the lowest cost bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">In response to the solicitation, the Navy received statements of qualifications from three offerors, including NVT. After evaluation, only NVT was determined to be a viable competitor, and NVT alone elected to continue in the remainder of the competition. Prior to the closing date for receipt of NVT\u2019s technical and price proposals, the Naval Audit Service certified that the agency\u2019s management plan satisfied the Performance Work Statement requirements and that the in-house cost estimate was reasonable. The agency\u2019s bid was then sealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">After NVT\u2019s technical and price proposals were submitted, the agency conducted two rounds of discussions with the company. The agency determined that NVT\u2019s final revised proposal was acceptable, and a price evaluation board further found NVT\u2019s proposed price to be realistic, complete, and reasonable. The agency thus selected NVT\u2019s proposal as the private-sector offer to compete against the government\u2019s in-house plan. A Navy quality comparison team then evaluated the agency\u2019s in-house plan \u201cto ensure that the technical proposals of NVT and the government offered the same level of performance and performance quality.\u201d The team found that the in-house plan was \u201cbalanced in performance and quality to that proposed by [NVT].\u201d The Navy then proceeded to a cost comparison and concluded that in-house performance of the specified work would cost less than performance by NVT. Specifically, NVT\u2019s adjusted cost at $43,025,120 was found to be $3,937,980 higher than the agency\u2019s proposed cost of $39,087,140. The initial award went to the in-house MEO on July 26, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">On August 27, 2001, NVT appealed the cost comparison decision to the administrative appeal authority (\u201cAAA\u201d), alleging <em>inter alia </em>that the in-house estimate for materials was too low, but identifying no particular provision it believed was misinterpreted. On August 30, 2001, the agency revised its estimate in response to other allegations in NVT\u2019s appeal, increasing its cost proposal. However, the agency\u2019s revised estimate was still less than NVT\u2019s proposal. On September 27, 2001, the AAA issued a final determination, accept<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>ing the agency\u2019s amended estimate and denying the remainder of NVT\u2019s allegations, including the low materials estimate. On October 4, 2001, NVT protested the AAA\u2019s final decision to the General Accounting Office (\u201cGAO\u201d). In addition to raising several issues it had raised before the AAA, NVT also argued that the government\u2019s estimate was too low with respect to roof leak repairs, raw labor estimates, and performance of ceramic tile repair. On January 3, 2002, the GAO issued a decision denying NVT\u2019s protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">On January 24, 2002, NVT filed a complaint in the Court of Federal Claims, alleging that the government had unlawfully concluded that it should continue base operations and maintenance services in-house. In particular, NVT contended that the government\u2019s interpretation of the volume of ceramic tile repair specified by the solicitation was wrong, and that if the proper interpretation had been used in the in-house estimate, NVT\u2019s bid would have been lower, entitling NVT to the award. The government responded that NVT\u2019s reading of the solicitation is not supported, that the government\u2019s interpretation is reasonable, and that the award to the MEO should be affirmed. On June 5, 2002, the Court of Federal Claims heard oral argument on these issues. At argument, the trial court questioned whether NVT had made a mistake of bid and whether the AAA had an obligation to \u201cferret out that mistake\u201d and allow NVT to correct it. The trial court then ordered supplemental briefing on the bid mistake issue and on the government\u2019s obligation to inform NVT of NVT\u2019s misreading of the required specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">At the heart of the proceedings before the trial court, and on appeal to this court, is Solicitation Attachment J-C 2(a), a table containing hundreds of line-item work-load estimates. The table includes a \u201cParagraph Number\u201d reference to the text of the solicitation; a \u201cTitle,\u201d identifying the item; and three columns, headed: \u201cNumber,\u201d \u201cUnit of Measure,\u201d and \u201cFrequency,\u201d reflecting the scope of work for that line-item. An exemplary entry related to Preventative Maintenance (\u201cPM\u201d) for the Motor Vehicle Wash Facility is reflected in the following line item:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-6\">Paragraph Number Title Number Unit of Measure Frequency</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKc\">C-5.2.3.2.8.5 PM Spray Nozzles 41 EA Monthly</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">This line item requires the contractor to assign sufficient staff at the appropriate skill level and pay grade to perform preventative maintenance on each of 41 spray nozzles once a month. The contractor also was required to include costs of materials to perform the stated tasks. Because the bids were to be based on a one-year cost proposal, the Frequency column provided an indication of how often, in a year, each of the listed tasks were to be performed. For example, based on the above line item, the offeror\u2019s price would be determined by multiplying the cost of spray nozzle maintenance times 41 nozzles, times the twelve \u201cmonthly\u201d occurrences required. It is undisputed that this is the proper interpretation for all but thirteen line items in Attachment J C 2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-16\">The specific table entries in dispute in this case are the first twelve of the thirteen line items in Attachment J-C 2(a), headed \u201cMISC CERAMIC TILE REPAIR.\u201d All thirteen line items in this category are reproduced below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>Paragraph Number Title Number Unit of Measure Frequency</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9k\">C-5.2.3.2 MISC CERAMIC TILE REPAIR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-6\">C-5.2.3.2 Form, Place &amp; Finish Concrete 119 SF 12</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-7\">C-5.2.3.2 Lay 8\"x8\"xl6\" Concrete Cinder Block 52 SF 6</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-9\">C-5.2.3.2 Lay Brick 7 SF 5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-10\">C-5.2.3.2 Miscellaneous Concrete Repairs 60 SF 16</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-11\">C-5.2.3.2 Prepare, Place &amp; Finish Plaster 48 SF 19</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-12\">C-5.2.3.2 Prepare, Place &amp; Finish Stucco 48 SF 18</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-13\">C-5.2.3.2 Replace l\"xl\" Ceramic Wall Tile 59 SF 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-14\">C-5.2.3.2 Replace 12\"xl2\" Ceramic Marbleized Floor Tile 98 SF 9</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-16\">C-5.2.3.2 Replace 2\"x2\" Ceramic Wall Tile 59 SF 8</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-17\">C-5.2.3.2 Replace 4\"x4\" Ceramic Wall Tile 387 SF 89</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-18\">C-5.2.3.2 Replace 6\"x6\" Ceramic Quarry Floor Tile 365 SF 97</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-20\">C-5.2.3.2 Replace 6\"x6\" Ceramic Wall Tile 52 SF 5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-21\">C-5.2.3.2 Cyclic Maint to Repair Ceramic Tile in Messhalls, etc. 6 HRS Daily</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-23\">The last of the thirteen items listed in this category is like the example noted above, and its interpretation is not in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-24\">In calculating its estimate for the twelve disputed line items, NVT multiplied the \u201cNumber\u201d column by the \u201cFrequency\u201d column and prepared its technical and price proposals based on a total of 76,209 square feet of tile and 28,647.85 man-hours of labor. MEO\u2019s bid instead took the figures in the \u201cNumber\u201d column to represent the total square feet of tile for each line item. The MEO did not use the \u201cFrequency\u201d column as a multiplier, and its cost estimate was thus based on 1,354 square feet of the and 1,354 man-hours of labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-25\">Before the Court of Federal Claims, both parties argued that the solicitation plainly supported their respective interpretations. The trial court concluded that the solicitation was not amenable to two reasonable interpretations, that only the government\u2019s reading was reasonable, and that the solicitation was therefore unambiguous. The trial court went on to conclude that, even if NVT\u2019s reading of the provisions at issue was also reasonable\u2014 making the solicitation ambiguous \u2014 any ambiguity was patent, and NVT could not prevail. On the issue of mistake in bid, the trial court\u2019s analysis focused on whether a different rule for mistake in bid should apply in A-76 cases if the agency had notice of the error. The trial court rejected NVT\u2019s contention that the solicitation was defective, which would require a rebid of the solicitation, concluding that NVT should have instead sought clarification about the solicitation. For these reasons, the Court of Federal Claims granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the administrative record and denied NVT\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-27\">NVT timely appealed to this court, asserting that the Court of Federal Claims erred in concluding that: 1) the government\u2019s interpretation was reasonable; 2) that NVT\u2019s interpretation was not reasonable; 3) that the solicitation was not ambiguous; and 4) that the ambiguity, if any, was patent. NVT also appeals the mistake in bid issue. Jurisdiction over this A-76 bid protest case was proper before the Court of Federal Claims. <em>See Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, </em>258 F.3d at 1297-1298. We have jurisdiction over final decisions of the Court of Federal Claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Bid protest actions are subject to the standard of review established under section 706 of title 5 of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(4) (2000), by which an agency\u2019s decision is to be set aside only if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (2000). <em>See Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United States, </em>238 F.3d 1324, 1332 (Fed.Cir.2001); <em>Advanced Data Concepts, Inc. v. United States, </em>216 F.3d 1054, 1057 (Fed.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">We review a trial court\u2019s determinations on summary judgment de novo, <em>Impresa, </em>238 F.3d at 1330, independently examining the administrative record to determine whether any \u201cgenuine issue[s] as to any material fact\u201d are present and whether the \u201cmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Because no genuine issues of material fact exist here, we review the trial court\u2019s decision as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">The interpretation of a contract or solicitation is a question of law which we review de novo. <em>Wickham Contracting Co. v. Fischer, </em>12 F.3d 1574, 1577 (Fed.Cir.1994); <em>Fortec Constructors v. United States, </em>760 F.2d 1288, 1291 (Fed.Cir.1985). Whether a contract provision is ambiguous is also a question of law. <em>Cmty. Heating &amp; Plumbing Co. v. Kelso, </em>987 F.2d 1575, 1579 (Fed.Cir.1993). Whether an ambiguity is patent or latent is likewise a question of law. <em>Interwest Constr. v. Brown, </em>29 F.3d 611, 614 (Fed.Cir.1994). This determination is made on a case-by-case basis. <em>Interstate Gen. Gov\u2019t Contractors, Inc. v. Stone, </em>980 F.2d 1433, 1435 (Fed.Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">B. Was the solicitation ambiguous?</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">The threshold question in this appeal is whether the solicitation plainly supports only one reading or supports more than one reading and is ambiguous. \u201cTo show an ambiguity it is not enough that the parties differ in their respective interpretations of a contract term. Rather, both interpretations must fall within a \u2018zone of reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Metric Constructors, Inc. v. NASA, </em>169 F.3d 747, 751 (Fed.Cir.1999) (citations omitted). Before this court, each party argues that there is no ambiguity because its respective interpretation of the solicitation is plainly supported, and thus reasonable, while the other party\u2019s interpretation is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">Contract interpretation begins with the language of the written agreement. <em>Foley Co. v. United States, </em>11 F.3d 1032, 1034 (Fed.Cir.1993). When interpreting the contract, the document must be considered as a whole and interpreted so as to harmonize and give reasonable meaning to all of its parts. <em>McAbee Constr., Inc. v. United States, </em>97 F.3d 1431, 1434-35 (Fed.Cir.1996). An interpretation that gives meaning to all parts of the contract is to be preferred over one that leaves a portion of the contract useless, inexplicable, void, or superfluous. <em>Gould, Inc. v. United States, </em>935 F.2d 1271, 1274 (Fed.Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-15\">In preparing its estimate, NVT multiplied the figures in the \u201cNumber\u201d column by the corresponding figures in the \u201cFrequency\u201d column for all of the hundreds of items in the Solicitation Attachment J C 2(a), including each of the twelve disputed line items in the \u201cMISC CERAMIC TILE REPAIR\u201d portion. For example, NVT interpreted the first disputed line item, \u201cForm, Place &amp; Finish Concrete,\u201d to call for 1,428 square feet of concrete, or 119 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>square feet of concrete poured and finished twelve times per year (119 x 12 = 1428).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">NVT argues that its interpretation was reasonable. NVT notes that the words \u201cmonthly,\u201d \u201cquarterly,\u201d or \u201cweekly\u201d appeared in the \u201cFrequency\u201d column for most of the hundreds of line items in Attachment J-C 2(a) and that to prepare the estimate for each of these line items, the value in the \u201cNumber\u201d column needed to be multiplied by the number 12, 4, or 52, respectively, representing the number of times in a calendar year that the work was to be performed. NVT used the same approach for the twelve line items in question, using the number in the Frequency column as a multiplier as it had for the numerical equivalent of the words in the Frequency column for all of the other line items. NVT argues that its interpretation, applying the same logic to the line items in question as to the other line items in the schedule, is a harmonious reading of all of the provisions of the contract. NVT further notes that nothing in the specification suggests that a different methodology be used for the line items in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Finally, NVT argues that its price estimate is reasonable. Although NVT calculated a total of 76,209 square feet of tile to be replaced, NVT contends, over the government\u2019s objections, that while that figure was large, the total floor space of the Depot is over 3 million square feet. Thus, NVT\u2019s figure is only 2% of the total floor space. Moreover, NVT notes that the solicitation emphasized the importance of the appearance of the Depot and the heavy volume of traffic. For these reasons, although NVT\u2019s bid of over $6 million for the miscellaneous ceramic tile work alone is a significant portion of the $43 million total bid, NVT contends that there is nothing to indicate or suggest that this was not what was called for in the solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The government argues that NVT\u2019s interpretation is incorrect and unreasonable because it is inconsistent with other portions of the solicitation. In particular, the government notes that NVT\u2019s construction results in a disproportionate amount of tile, given that the corpus of the solicitation only refers incidentally to ceramic tile. Further, the government asserts that NVT\u2019s interpretation is contrary to the terms \u201cmaintenance\u201d and \u201cpreventative maintenance,\u201d as defined in the solicitation. \u201cMaintenance\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he recurrent day-to-day, periodic or scheduled work required to preserve or restore a facility to such condition that it may be effectively utilized for its designed purpose.\u201d \u201cPreventative maintenance\u201d means \u201c[sjervicing accomplished on a scheduled or recurring basis to lengthen the equipment life. The effort involves visual inspection, operational tests, lubrication, adjustments and the repair or replacement of minor defective component parts.\u201d Given these definitions, the government argues that NVT\u2019s interpretation, resulting in the installation of 1.3 football fields worth of replacement tile per year, is unreasonable, while the government\u2019s estimate, resulting in much less replacement tile, is reasonable. The government further contends that NVT\u2019s interpretation is unreasonable given the information available to each bidder in the solicitation in the form of explanatory facility history files, technical library materials, and a software database file. The government argues that this information would have informed NVT\u2019s bid and that NVT failed to take advantage of these resources. For these reasons, the government asserts that NVT\u2019s interpretation is inconsistent with the corpus of the solicitation and therefore is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">The government interprets the line items in question as not requiring multipli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>cation of the \u201cNumber\u201d and \u201cFrequency\u201d columns as was done by NVT. Rather the government\u2019s interpretation considers only the Number column and does not use the numbers in the Frequency column as multipliers. The government contends that this was reasonable because it was apparent that these line items should be treated differently, based on the presence of numbers rather than words in those line items, as well as the fact that the numbers bear no relationship to the regular and periodic repetitions signaled by the words. The government asserts that its reading is consistent with the rest of the solicitation, because the ceramic tile repair is denoted as \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d and because if the disputed line items were intended to represent such a large portion of the contract, more information would have been given about these tasks in the specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">NVT contends that the government\u2019s interpretation, where the figures in the Frequency column for the disputed line items are simply ignored, violates the contract interpretation canon that a reading that renders terms superfluous is disfavored. NVT argues that for the government\u2019s interpretation to be consistent with the remainder of the document, the Frequency column should have read \u201cAnnually\u201d or been left blank, which is not the case. NVT also argues that the government\u2019s interpretation renders meaningless the thirteenth line item \u201cCyclic Maint to Repair Ceramic Tile in Messhalls, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">We conclude that both NVT\u2019s and the government\u2019s interpretations are within the \u201czone of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Metric Constructors, </em>169 F.3d at 751. NVT\u2019s interpretation is reasonable, because it applies the same logic to the thirteen disputed line items as applied to the hundreds of other line items present in the schedule. The schedule nowhere, indicated that the data in the \u201cNumber\u201d and \u201cFrequency\u201d columns were to be treated differently for the thirteen items in question or that the frequency numbers for those items should be ignored. Moreover, although NVT\u2019s interpretation resulted in an extensive amount of tile replacement, the amount was not wholly unreasonable: (a) given that the amount only represents a small percentage of the total floor space of the facility; (b) given the extensive use of the facility; and (c) given the mandate in the solicitation that the appearance of the Depot is of great importance. Further, despite the emphasis that the government places on the fact that NVT failed to avail itself of the external resources provided by the Navy, the government points to no particular portion of the external resources that would be inconsistent with NVT\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">&gt; We also find the government\u2019s interpretation to be reasonable. The government\u2019s interpretation is consistent with the notion of incidental repair and maintenance, as noted in the corpus of the solicitation. Moreover, the portion of the price attributable to tile repair and maintenance in the government\u2019s estimate is proportional to what would be expected for a small set of line items that received no special treatment in the solicitation. There was no evidence in the record illuminating the government\u2019s understanding of the significance of the numbers in the \u201cFrequency\u201d column for the disputed line items, and in fact, at oral argument, government\u2019s counsel admitted that he was unaware of the significance of those numbers; however, the point is not what the numbers in that column meant, but rather whether it was unreasonable for the government to treat them differently from the words used in the Frequency column for all of the other line items. Recognizing that on their face, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>the numbers in the Frequency column are different from the words used elsewhere in the attachment, and further recognizing that those numbers do not have any apparent correlation to the regular and periodic repetitions signaled by the words used for the other line items, we do not think it was unreasonable for the government not to use them as multipliers, especially because the use of the numbers as multipliers results in such seemingly disproportionate totals and the non-use of the numbers as multipliers yields totals that are entirely consistent with the corpus of the solicitation and the attention given in the solicitation to the line items in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">Because \u201cboth interpretations ... fall within a zone of reasonableness,\u201d <em>Metric Constructors, </em>169 F.3d at 751, we conclude that the solicitation, with respect to these disputed line items, was ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">C. Was the ambiguity patent?</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Because we hold that the solicitation was ambiguous, we turn now to the question of whether the ambiguity was patent. An ambiguity will only be construed against the government if it was not obvious on the face of the solicitation and reliance is shown. <em>See, e.g., Edward R. Marden Corp. v. United States, </em>803 F.2d 701, 705 (Fed.Cir.1986). If the ambiguity is patent, it triggers a duty to inquire. A patent ambiguity is one that is \u201cobvious, gross, [or] glaring, so that plaintiff contractor had a duty to inquire about it at the start.\u201d <em>H &amp; M Moving, Inc. v. United States, </em>204 Ct.Cl. 696, 499 F.2d 660, 671 (1974). If an ambiguity is obvious and a bidder fails to inquire with regard to the provision, his interpretation will fail. <em>Triax Pac., Inc. v. West, </em>130 F.3d 1469, 1475 (Fed.Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">NVT argues that while the line items in question used numbers unrelated to the calendar in the Frequency column, and differed in that respect from the remaining hundreds of line items that made reference to regular and periodic calendar occurrences as Frequency entries, these differences do not create a patent ambiguity. Rather, NVT contends that instead of focusing on the uniqueness of the disputed line items, it is more important to understand that there is nothing about those line items that prohibits a reasonable reading consistent with the remainder of the solicitation. The government argues that the fact that numbers were used in the Frequency column for these twelve line item entries, and not for the others, should have raised a red flag for NVT, requiring NVT to inquire. The government also argues that in tallying its estimate and noting that these thirteen line items accounted for a large portion of its total price estimate\u2014 approximately $6 million out of a $43 million bid, or some 14% \u2014 despite their being treated as incidental in the solicitation, NVT was also put on notice that it should have inquired. Where, as here, a certain set of line items is expressed in a manner so different from hundreds of other line items, yielding totals disproportionate to the remainder of the solicitation, we find the differences to be \u201cobvious, gross, [or] glaring,\u201d <em>H &amp; M Moving, </em>499 F.2d at 671, requiring NVT to inquire. Because the solicitation was ambiguous, but any ambiguity was patent, and because it is undisputed that NVT did not inquire into such ambiguity, NVT cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">D. Mistake in Bid</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">Finally, NVT argues that even if we find the solicitation ambiguous, its bid mistake argument may still prevail, based on <em>In re IT Corporation, </em>2002 WL 1476286 (Comp.Gen. July 10, 2002). The government counters that the trial court correctly denied NVT\u2019s mistake in bid claim because NVT failed to avail itself of the full infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>mation available and referenced in the specification. Moreover, the government notes that it was unaware of any solicitation defect at a time when a correction would be appropriate \u2014 i.e., before the selection of the private sector\u2019s best proposal \u2014 because the significance of the disputed line items was not raised until NVT\u2019s appeal before the GAO. The government also distinguishes the <em>IT Corporation </em>case, because in that case, the agency concluded that all of the information available to the offerors did not adequately identify the work required to meet the needs of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\"><em>IT Corporation, </em>which does not bind this court, stands for the proposition that if a solicitation is defective, such that bidders cannot know on what they are bidding, the solicitation must be rebid. After receiving supplemental briefing from the parties, the trial court carefully analyzed this issue and concluded that the fact that this was an A-76 solicitation did not affect the analysis of this issue, because the associated FAR provisions give no additional rights to bidders of A-76 offers. The trial court further concluded that because NVT failed to inquire, its contention that the solicitation was defective must fail, citing <em>Comtrol, Inc. v. United States, </em>294 F.3d 1357, 1363-65 (Fed.Cir.2002) (stating that a contractor cannot rely on a defective specification where the contractor failed to access all of the information available and incorporated into the specification). The trial court made no findings as to whether the external information referenced in the solicitation would have provided NVT with complete knowledge, unlike the situation in <em>IT Corporation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion, if not its basis, and hold that NVT\u2019s mistake in bid argument must fail. In particular, \u201c[i]f a contractor enters into a contract aware of the fact of defective specifications, it is not entitled to recover on a claim based on these defective specifications.\u201d <em>Robins Maint., Inc. v. United States, </em>265 F.3d 1254, 1258 (Fed.Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Johnson Controls, Inc. v. United States, </em>229 Ct.Cl. 445, 671 F.2d 1312, 1320 (Ct.C1.1982)). Here, we have concluded that the ambiguity in the solicitation, which is one and the same with the defect alleged by NVT, was patent, and the contractor should have thus inquired. NVT, in failing to inquire as to an ambiguity, cannot then claim that the specification was defective to absolve itself of that failure. Therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of NVT\u2019s mistake in bid claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Because both NVT and the government have proffered interpretations of the disputed line items that are reasonable, we conclude that the solicitation was ambiguous. However, because the ambiguity in the disputed line items was patent, and should have prompted an inquiry by NVT that it failed to make, we conclude that NVT cannot prevail. Further, due to NVT\u2019s failure to inquire, NVT\u2019s mistake in bid claim must fail. Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Federal Claims is</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b848-11\">PROST, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AWJm\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">The majority concludes that the solicitation was ambiguous and that this ambiguity was patent. I respectfully dissent from both of these conclusions. Instead, I find the solicitation unambiguous because only NVT\u2019s interpretation thereof falls within a zone of reasonableness. In the alternative, I find any ambiguity to be latent. Thus, because NVT\u2019s, bid would have been lower than the government\u2019s bid under the proper interpretation, I believe NVT should have been awarded the contract. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>would therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that the solicitation was ambiguous is based on its finding that both NVT\u2019s and the government\u2019s interpretations were reasonable. While I agree as to NVT, I disagree with respect to the government. As a general matter, each of the hundreds of lines in the solicitation gave details for the listed task under columns titled \u201cNumber,\u201d \u201cUnit of Measure,\u201d and \u201cFrequency.\u201d In addition, these bids were to be based on a one-year cost proposal, meaning that the \u201cFrequency\u201d column provides an \u201cindication of how often, in a year, each of the listed tasks were to be performed.\u201d Opinion at 1157. Accordingly, for each line item \u2014 including the twelve line items in question \u2014 NVT performed the same calculation, multiplying the value in the \u201cNumber\u201d column by the value in the \u201cFrequency\u201d column to arrive at a yearly total. This, I believe, was reasonable for a number of reasons. To begin, NVT\u2019s reading of the twelve disputed line items was consistent with its reading of the more than 800 other line items. In addition, NVT\u2019s interpretation does not read out material parts of the solicitation, i.e., the column headings. NVT used the frequency values for these twelve line items just as it did for all the other line items; it did not ignore them.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Further, as the majority notes, the end result of NVT\u2019s bid calculation method was also reasonable. The 287 identified buildings at the depot were built between 1918 and 1984, cover approximately 3,221,472 square feet of floor space on 433 acres, and are used by a population of up to 9,600 people. Thus, I agree with the majority that NVT reasonably interpreted the solicitation to require 76,209 square feet of tile replacement and 28,647.85 man-hours of labor. The estimated amount of tile replacement only amounted to a small percentage \u2014 two percent \u2014 of the total floor space. Opinion at 1161. This included 36,287 square feet of floor tile, approximately one percent of the total facility floor space, and 37,187 square feet of wall tile, plaster, or stucco. Moreover, these numbers also appear reasonable in light of the high maintenance standards stressed in the solicitation. Marine Corps policy dictated that \u201cthe unique buildings/facilities ... be maintained in a professional manner as a projection of Marine Corps pride that is world renowned.\u201d To that effect, the Performance Work Statement required contractors to ensure that \u201call buildings, surfaces, and component parts remain in a serviceable condition and are free of warping, bucking, cracks, ... loose, missing or chipped tiles; noticeable surface imperfections, ... and other damage or defects.\u201d Given the contract\u2019s high standards, the majority correctly concluded that NVT\u2019s bid did not call for a disproportionate amount of tile repair and was therefore reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the government\u2019s interpretation of the solicitation was also reasonable (and therefore demonstrates the existence of an ambiguity). According to the majority, because \u201cthe numbers in the Frequency column are different from the words used elsewhere,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1161-62, and because they bear no relationship to any regular and periodic repetition, it was reasonable for the government to treat these twelve disputed line items differently. Specifically, in contrast to the more than 800 other line items that appear under identical column headings, the government did not use the value under the \u201cFrequency\u201d column as a multiplier for the value in the \u201cNumber\u201d column. <em>Id. </em>In addition, the majority finds the government\u2019s inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>pretation reasonable because the relevant estimate was consistent with the notion of incidental repair as well as proportional to what would be expected for a small set of line items that received no special treatment in the solicitation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">I disagree for several reasons. First, given that the solicitation uses many different frequency indicators in a broad spectrum of formats, the fact that the disputed line items contained solely numbers did not justify the government\u2019s (and the majority\u2019s) dissimilar treatment thereof. This variety includes different primarily verbal, periodic indicators such as the following: every # years, Annually, # X Year, Semi-Annually, Quarterly, BiMonthly, Monthly, 2X Monthly, Bi-Weekly, Weekly, Daily, 2X Daily. But some line items give no specifics whatsoever, simply noting that the work needs to be performed \u201cAs needed\u201d or \u201cAs-Req.\u201d Moreover, the solicitation includes line items that express frequency in terms of the number of \u201ctreatments a year\u201d and the number of \u201ctimes a year.\u201d In addition, the solicitation contains line items that give frequency in terms of hours and days, without any indication of periodicity. For example, with respect to hours, the solicitation contains line items calling for \u201c20,-000 hours,\u201d \u201c6000 hrs,\u201d and \u201c2500 hrs.\u201d With respect to days, the solicitation contains line items given in terms of \u201c18 days,\u201d \u201c60 Days,\u201d \u201c90 Days,\u201d and \u201c180 days.\u201d It even includes a line item with the \u201cFrequency\u201d given as \u201c7/30 Days.\u201d Finally, in the twelve disputed line items, the solicitation uses purely numerical figures in the \u201cFrequency\u201d column.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">No matter what format the line item may have been in, the solicitation clearly required the multiplication of the \u201cNumber\u201d by the \u201cFrequency\u201d to arrive at the estimated annual cost. The fact that the twelve disputed line items do not contain any words does not make them any different. As demonstrated above, the line items come in <em>many </em>different formats, including words, a combination of words and numerals, and solely numerals. Moreover, the line items list frequency in both periodic and non-periodic terms. Accordingly, the twelve disputed line items do not differ from any standard format used throughout the solicitation because the solicitation has no such clear standard format. As with all these other line items, the government should have simply applied the default presumption that the value in the \u201cFrequency\u201d column represents a yearly (per year) number because the bid price was to be based on the cost for one year\u2019s worth of maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">Second, as a legal matter, the government\u2019s interpretation violates the canons of contract interpretation that require (a) consistency, and (b) giving meaning to each contract term. First, the government\u2019s interpretation is unreasonable because it does not apply consistently to the entire solicitation. The solicitation called for the multiplication of the \u201cNumber\u201d and the \u201cFrequency\u201d to arrive at the amount of work or materials required. For more than 800 line items, as the government acknowledges, bidders had to use this methodology to assemble their bid. But the government did not similarly treat the twelve disputed line items. In order to interpret the contract terms consistently, the government should have multiplied these \u201cFrequency\u201d figures by the \u201cNumber,\u201d applying the per-year presumption. As a corollary to the consistency issue, if the government did not intend the numbers given in the \u201cFrequency\u201d column to be a frequency multiplier, it could have drafted the solicitation to indicate such repairs were to be done \u201cAnnually,\u201d thereby requiring multiplication by one. This would have been consistent with the remainder of the solicitation, which has hun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>dreds of \u201cAnnually\u201d line iteras. By using a different value in the \u201cFrequency\u201d column for these twelve line items, however, the government clearly meant something different.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">Further, by ignoring the \u201cFrequency\u201d value with respect to the disputed line items, the government also violated the canon of contract interpretation that disfavors rendering terms superfluous. If these numbers had no purpose, as government counsel suggested at oral argument, they should not have been listed in the \u201cFrequency\u201d column. Moreover, by ignoring these numbers, the government not only unreasonably ignored the values given in the individual line items, but also the column heading, which clearly indicates that the numbers themselves represent a \u201cFrequency\u201d to be used for purposes of assembling a bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">In sum, the solicitation unambiguously required the multiplication of the \u201cNumber\u201d and \u201cFrequency\u201d columns for each line item to arrive at a yearly figure for purposes of bid assembly, including the twelve disputed line items. As such, I find NVT\u2019s interpretation of the solicitation the only reasonable interpretation, and, for the reasons given above, disagree with the majority that the government\u2019s interpretation was also reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Even if I agreed with the majority that an ambiguity existed here, I do not find that ambiguity patent. The majority concludes that the ambiguity is patent because the line items are \u201cexpressed in a manner so different from hundreds of other line items, yielding totals disproportionate to the remainder of the solicitation.\u201d Opinion at 1162. Yet in reaching this conclusion, the majority abandons the reasons why it concluded an ambiguity existed in the first place. In particular, the majority disregards, in my view, the reasons it found NVT\u2019s interpretation reasonable, all of which point in the direction of finding a latent rather than patent ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">In my opinion, the ambiguity was latent. It was not, as the majority concludes, obvious, gross or glaring. As discussed above, the disputed line items do not differ dramatically from the other more than 800 line items; there are many other formats in which the solicitation lists \u201cFrequency.\u201d NVT likely entered these line items, as with the hundreds of others, into a spreadsheet program, multiplying them out to arrive at a bid price. A look at NVT\u2019s proposal reveals that only two percent of the total floor space requires retiling every year. Yet the facility includes at least 287 buildings built between 1918 and 1984 on 433 acres with 3,221,472 square feet of floor space heavily used by up to 9,600 people at a time. Furthermore, the mandate in the solicitation requires that contractors maintain the facilities at the highest standards in order to project Marine Corps pride. Given this context, it is the government\u2019s and not NVT\u2019s estimates that seem disproportionately low, calling for replacement of only 1,354 square feet of tile. This represents only 0.04% of the total square footage of the facility. Assuming an ambiguity existed, therefore, NVT\u2019s interpretation was far more reasonable, reflecting the fact that any defect in the solicitation was latent.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">The government drafted the solicitation and should bear the burden of any mistakes contained therein. In this case, the solicitation unambiguously called for bidders to multiply the \u201cNumber\u201d and \u201cFrequency\u201d columns for each line item. Even if there was an ambiguity, the law requires that it be resolved against the drafter. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>discussed, the patent ambiguity exception to this rule does not apply here. Because NVT\u2019s bid would have been lower than the government\u2019s bid had they been calculated using the same methodology, I respectfully dissent and would reverse the Court of</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Federal Claims decision granting the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
