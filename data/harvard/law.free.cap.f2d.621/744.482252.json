Willis was convicted of thirteen counts of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends on appeal that his conviction must be reversed due to insufficiency of the evidence and prosecutorial misconduct. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">Appellant\u2019s insufficiency of the evidence argument is clearly without merit. In reviewing whether the prosecution presented sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction, the evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. DeJean, </em>613 F.2d 1356, 1358 (5th Cir. 1980). There is overwhelming circumstantial evidence of Willis\u2019 guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">Appellant was charged with opening a post office box in the name of a Dallas hospital and submitting inflated and totally false insurance claims to various insurance companies, using the post office box address as the place to which the insurance checks were to be sent. When the checks were received, the required endorsements were either forged or the payees were induced to sign the checks, which were then deposited in one of the numerous bank accounts maintained by Willis under the name \u201cHaze Fashion Jewelry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-19\">Appellant does not challenge the fact that a scheme to defraud the hospital, insurance companies, and certain hospital patients actually existed, he merely contends that he was innocently \u201cduped\u201d into participating in the scheme by the scheme\u2019s organizers. He contends there is insufficient evidence to show he willfully, intentionally and knowingly participated in the mail fraud. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-20\">A hospital employee testified at trial that Willis attempted to induce her to participate in an insurance fraud scheme, but she refused. Appellant\u2019s checking account deposits consisted almost entirely of checks made payable to the hospital and endorsed to his account. A post office handwriting expert identified appellant\u2019s writing on a fraudulent claim form. The post office box used in the scheme was opened using appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license as identification. Postal authorities testified that the person opening the box was required to submit proper identification. Finally, at least one person testified that Willis induced him to endorse an insurance check that was to pay for the witness\u2019 bill at the hospital. Such circumstantial evidence is clearly sufficient to show appellant\u2019s knowing and willful participation in the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-21\">Willis next contends that certain comments of the prosecutor during his trial require reversal. We have examined each of these comments, and conclude that individually or collectively they do not affect substantial rights of the appellant when evaluated in the context of the trial as a whole. <em>Cobb v. Wainwright, </em>609 F.2d 754, 755 n.1 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>United States v. Risi, </em>603 F.2d 1193, 1195-96 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. Greene, </em>578 F.2d 648, 653-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>54 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1133, 99 S.Ct. 1056, 59 L.Ed.2d 96 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-15\">. Frances Henderson and Barbara Kelly were also indicted for their participation in the mail fraud scheme. Henderson, tried jointly with appellant Willis, was found guilty on three counts but is not a party to this appeal. Kelly was tried and convicted separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
