Count 3 charged Hazeltine with unlawfully receiving, concealing and facilitating the transportation of a narcotic drug, namely, the aforementioned 67 packets of heroin, knowing that the drug had theretofore been imported and brought into the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174. For these several convictions Hazeltine was sentenced to an additional five years imprisonment and he now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>This indictment resulted from a shakedown of Hazeltine\u2019s cell, or at least what the prosecution contended was Ha-zeltine\u2019s cell, in the federal prison at Leavenworth. The shakedown disclosed $640 in United States currency and 67 packets of heroin, currency and heroin both being prison contraband. As concerns the 67 packets of heroin, one packet was found in the pocket of a prison shirt hanging on the wall of the cell, which shirt bore Hazeltine\u2019s prison number, and the remaining 66 packets were found in a locked locker in the cell thus searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">Hazeltine\u2019s defense was that neither the cell thus searched nor the locker located therein was his. Without detailing the very considerable amount of evidence introduced by the prosecution in its effort to establish that this was in fact Hazeltine\u2019s cell and locker, the prosecution offered as a part of its case certain testimonial evidence to the effect that various and sundry letters and envelopes addressed to Hazeltine were found in the locker along with the 66 packets of heroin. Specifically, two officers who conducted the search testified that they saw some 50 to 100 letters and envelopes addressed to Hazeltine in the locker. All of this correspondence was apparently returned to Hazeltine except two items and upon trial the two thus retained were offered in evidence as exhibits 5 and 6. Exhibit 5 was an envelope bearing Hazeltine\u2019s name and address as the addressee and bearing a return address to Hazeltine\u2019s wife. Exhibit 6, which was found inside exhibit 5, was a card, referred to by counsel as a \u201cspicy\u201d card, from Hazeltine\u2019s wife. Over objection, exhibits 5 and 6 were received into evidence on the ground that such was relevant and material to the issue as to whether the cell in question and more particularly the locker located therein were Hazeltine\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-5\">The specific objection made upon trial to exhibits 5 and 6 was that each constituted hearsay, the authenticity of neither the envelope (ex. 5) nor the card contained therein (ex. 6) having been established. The trial court overruled the objection, apparently being of the view that the very fact that correspondence addressed to Hazeltine was found in the locker was germane to the issue as to whether the locker and the cell in which the locker was located were Hazeltine\u2019s. We perceive no error in this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-7\">The particular issue posed was whether this was Hazeltine\u2019s locker; hence in this setting the authenticity of the letter as concerns its purported author or the correctness of its contents were not in issue. Rather, it was the very fact that correspondence bearing Hazeltine\u2019s name and address as addressee was found in the locker in the cell assigned to Hazel-tine which made such documents relevant and material to the precise issue at hand. In such circumstance documents such as exhibits 5 and 6 are admissible without authentication and are therefore not subject to objection on the ground of hearsay. <em>See </em>Wigmore on Evidence 3d ed. 1940, \u00a7 2132.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-8\"> In this court counsel takes a different tack and in effect concedes that exhibits 5 and 6 \u201cmay well have been relevant to the issue of Mr. Hazel-tine\u2019s connection with the cell.\u201d It is now argued in this court that the <em>content </em>of exhibit 6, the so-called spicy card, was highly suggestive and prejudicial. As indicated, this particular argument was not addressed to the trial court and is raised for the first time in appellant\u2019s opening brief. Ordinarily a matter not raised in the trial court will not be considered by us on appeal. United States v. Fairchild, 435 F.2d 972 (10th Cir.). This general rule is of course subject to our overriding duty to notice plain error or defects affecting substantial rights at any time or stage of the proceedings. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). Suffice it to say that we deem the particular matter now sought to be raised not to be a matter of great import affecting the substantial rights of Hazeltine. Upon trial Hazeltine was vigorously defended by not one, but two retained counsel. When exhibits 5 and 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>were received counsel were invited by the trial court to submit a \u201climiting\u201d instruction if such they desired. No such limiting instruction was thereafter submitted by counsel, indicative that counsel at least did not deem the matter to be one of great import. Now appointed counsel for Hazeltine in this court would have us reverse the ease because the content of exhibit 6 is said to have unfavorable sexual connotations which indeed are said to have double meanings associated with the traffic of drugs. The argument is too conjectural to permit a reversal. A review of the record reveals much evidence tending to establish that the cell thus searched was Hazeltine\u2019s, and therefore any possible error in this regard would under such circumstance be only harmless error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-4\">While the present appeal was pending in this court, counsel for Hazel-tine sought an order of this court that the arraignment proceedings, of which there were apparently two, be transcribed and made a part of his record on appeal. This request was denied by us. From Hazeltine\u2019s brief we learn that he now suggests that his constitutional right to immediate assistance of counsel was, if not denied, at least delayed by action of the trial court and by various actions of penitentiary employees who thwarted his efforts to retain counsel. In his brief Hazeltine further elaborates by claiming that such delay was prejudicial in that one of his potential witnesses died before trial and that the deposition of this person would have been taken had he been able to retain counsel more speedily than he did. Suffice it to say that a matter of this nature cannot be raised in the manner now proposed by counsel. There is nothing to indicate that this particular matter, i. e., prejudice resulting from delay in Hazeltine\u2019s retention of counsel because of conduct of the trial court or the penitentiary officials, was ever presented to the trial court. In declining to pass upon the matter, we do so without prejudice to the right of Hazeltine to seek such post-conviction relief as may be available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
