Upon their arrival, the quintet stopped at the Capital Plaza Shopping Center, wherein the Citizens National Bank is located. Having assured themselves that the bank \u201clooked all right\u201d through the reconnoitering efforts of Constance Patterson, the group proceeded to an apartment complex in close proximity to the bank. They there located a late model red Pontiac automobile, which the evidence indicates was used by the defendants as transportation to and from the immediate scene of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Three witnesses to the Citizens National Bank robbery testified that the bank was held up at gunpoint by three Negro males wearing multi-colored ski masks and dark colored one-piece jumpsuits. It was further revealed that the trio departed the bank with the holdup money contained in a corrugated cardboard box.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">An off-duty policeman testified that he observed defendants Reed and Lundy together with a light colored Negro female (Constance Patterson) standing near a dark colored Pontiac which was parked immediately in front of a late model red Pontiac, and that defendant Lundy appeared to be preparing to enter the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Constance Patterson and Beverly Parker, having previously pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting their male companions in the commission of the offense, were called by and testified for the prosecution. Their testimony revealed that the three defendants, dressed in dark colored one-piece jumpsuits, left the apartment complex in the red Pontiac and returned a few minutes later. Upon their return, they were observed to be in possession of multi-colored ski masks, pistols and a corrugated cardboard box containing money. At this point, the defendants left the red Pontiac and transferred to the dark colored Pontiac (Lundy\u2019s ear) with Reed and Lundy riding with the two females and defendant Breedlove riding in the trunk. Thereafter, they drove from the city of Austin in a northerly direction on Interstate Highway T-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">While on patrol, Texas Department of Public Safety Officer David Hicks received a police radio broadcast at 1:36 P.M., informing him of the Citizens National Bank robbery. The broadcast described the \u201cget away\u201d car as a red Pontiac and the robbery suspects, attired in coveralls and ski masks, as three Negro males accompanied by two females, one possibly white. Within minutes of the first broadcast, Officer Hicks received a second radio message from the police dispatcher advising him that the suspects had changed cars and were now in a dark colored Pontiac.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Having received the above information, Officer Hicks set up a checkpoint approximately 18 miles north of Austin on Interstate 35 and began observance of the northbound traffic. Approximately 100 vehicles passed the checkpoint before Officer Hicks observed the automobile occupied by the appellants. Officer Hicks testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">\u201c[T]he driver and the female were sitting deep to the left under the wheel, as if they were necking, and the two in the rear were the same way, other than I could see the light-colored subject in the back, as I wasn\u2019t forty feet from them * * * <em>\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">To further verify the description of the automobile, Officer Hicks radioed Austin and inquired if it was possible that the automobile in question was dark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>green \u2014 such inquiry eliciting an affirmative response. The officer then pursued, stopped and arrested the occupants of the vehicle. The revolvers, clothing and money obtained in the ensuing search were not introduced in evidence at appellants\u2019 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">An arrest without a warrant is not constitutionally infirm if at the moment the arrest was made the arresting officer had probable cause to make it. Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964). \u201cIn dealing with probable cause, * * * as the very name implies, we deal with probabilities. These are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of every day life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u201d Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 175, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1310, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1948). \u201cProbable cause exists where \u2018the facts and circumstances within their [the arresting officers\u2019] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that\u2019 an offense has been or is being committed. Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 162, 45 S.Ct. 280 [69 L.Ed. 543].\u201d Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307, 313, 79 S.Ct. 329, 333, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1958). Of particular moment in the instant case is the commission of an armed robbery followed by flight to avoid police detection. The exigencies of the situation made Officer Hicks\u2019 course of action imperative. See McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 457, 69 S.Ct. 191, 93 L.Ed. 153 (1948). Moreover, the emergency nature of the arrest militates rather heavily, we think, in determining its reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\"> Appellants do not question the controlling principles of law, but rather contend that the description of the automobile and the information possessed by Officer Hicks at the time of the arrest was not sufficient to constitute probable cause. We are compelled, under the circumstances presented, to reject that contention. Officer Hicks had an accurate, albeit general, description of the automobile and its occupants. The arrival of the appellants\u2019 automobile at the checkpoint was at a time and distance from the robbery consistent with its being the get away car. Moi'eover, there is no suggestion that Officer Hicks attempted or contemplated a random stopping of innocent highway travelers. He knew what he was looking for, and he found it. That appellants\u2019 automobile was the only one stopped of the more than 100 that passed through the checkpoint attests to this fact. There was no arbitrary or capricious action on the part of the arresting officer predicated on mere suspicion. Quite to the contrary, there was exhibited effective and vigilant police work. Under these circumstances, we do not hesitate to hold that probable cause for the arrest existed. We likewise reject appellants\u2019 arguments that the testimonial evidence of the two female accomplice witnesses was the fruit of an unlawful search incident to an illegal arrest. Even assuming, arguendo, the lack of probable cause for the arrest, appellants have no standing to challenge the invasion of another\u2019s rights. As the Supreme Court has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">\u201cThe established principle is that suppression of the product of a Fourth Amendment violation can be successfully urged only by those whose rights were violated by the search itself, not by those who are aggrieved solely .by the introduction of damaging evidence. Coconspirators and codefend-ants have been accorded no special standing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 171, 89 S.Ct. 961, 965, 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969). Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights which may not be vicariously asserted. <em>Alderman, supra, </em>at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-14\">. Officer Hicks was called as a witness by the defense in support of its motions to suppress. On direct examination, the officer testified that he believed the word \u201cPontiac\u201d was used to describe the dark colored automobile, as well as the first mentioned red automobile,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
