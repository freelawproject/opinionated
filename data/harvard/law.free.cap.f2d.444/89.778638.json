App. \u00a7 462(a) (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-23\">At a hearing on the motion, the district judge, under the mistaken impression that the matter was one to be han-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>died by appellant\u2019s draft board, denied the motion but adjourned appellant\u2019s surrender for 30 days to allow him time to contact his board. When the board disclaimed jurisdiction the district judge recognized his error and ruled on the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">\u201cWhen this matter came to me first, I felt that it presented a question of law alone and that I was without power. That was my curbstone reaction. But upon reflection since that time, which was well over a month ago, I have concluded that it is a matter of discretion, and I am acting upon it in the exercise of discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">\u201cI have come to the conclusion that I should not change the sentence according to your motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">\u201cI have been prompted by the fact that if we are going to permit a change of sentence in all these cases because of change of circumstances between the time of the imposition of sentence and the time that an appeal or an application for a writ is exhausted, we are never going to get permanency of sentence and a final determination in criminal prosecution, which is so desirable and necessary for proper administration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that the judge\u2019s action constituted a refusal to consider changed circumstances because of the desirability of \u201cpermanency of sentence.\u201d Such a refusal would be contrary to the purposes of Rule 35 and would be erroneous. \u201cRule 35 is intended to give every convicted defendant a second round before the sentencing judge, and at the same time, it affords the judge an opportunity to reconsider the sentence in the light of any further information about the defendant or the case which may have been presented to him in the interim.\u201d United States v. Ellenbogen, 390 F.2d 537, 543 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 918, 89 S.Ct. 241, 21 L.Ed.2d 206 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">We believe that in the present case the district judge did consider the changed circumstances but, weighing them against the desirability of permanence of sentence, decided that <em>in this case </em>the interest in \u201cpermanency of sentence\u201d was entitled to more weight than the changed circumstances. This result was within the scope of the broad discretion permitted district judges on Rule 35 motions. United States v. Kee Ming Hsu, 424 F.2d 1286, 1291 (2d Cir. 1970); U. S. v. Birnbaum, 402 F.2d 24, 30 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 922, 89 S.Ct. 1181, 22 L.Ed.2d 455 (1969); 2 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 588 at p. 576 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
