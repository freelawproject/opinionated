Mich.Comp.Laws \u00a7 600.5807(8) (1963). Appellant, however, contends that since the suit was filed one day prior to the running of the six years, service of process (even three and one-half years later) serves to toll the statute of limitations if diligent efforts to accomplish service of process have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">The United States Supreme Court has decided that state limitations laws must be applied by federal courts in diversity cases. Ragan v. Merchants Transfer and Warehouse Co., 337 U.S. 530, 69 S.Ct. 1233, 93 L.Ed. 1520 (1949); Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">The sole question on this appeal is whether or not under applicable Michigan law and all of the facts and circumstances of this ease the Michigan Statute of Limitations should be held to have been tolled for three and one-half years. Applying Michigan law, the District Judge held \u201cthat the Statute of Limitations has run and that the case should be dismissed,\u201d saying that, \u201cI can\u2019t hold three years, and a half as reasonable time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">The legal issues involved herein have been considered recently by the Michigan Court of Appeals in Guastello v. Citizens Mutual Insurance Co., 11 Mich.App. 120, 160 N.W.2d 725 (1968), and decided adversely to appellant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-16\">Michigan case law appears to have required \u201cdue diligence to give notice to the defendant\u201d and \u201creasonable promptitude in serving the original summons and alias summonses.\u201d Yeager v. Mellus, 328 Mich. 243, 248, 43 N.W.2d 836, 838 (1950). These two standards were in force by case law at the times applicable to the instant litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Since then a Michigan statute has specifically defined the time for service under the circumstances of this case as a maximum of 90 days. The applicable section of the Michigan Compiled Laws states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">\u201cSec. 5856. The statutes of limitations are tolled when</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\">(1) the complaint is filed and a copy of the summons and complaint are served on the defendant, or when</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-11\">(2) jurisdiction over the defendant is otherwise acquired, or when,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-13\">(3) <em>the complaint is filed and a copy of the summons and complaint in good faith, are placed in the hands of an officer for immediate service, but in this case the statute shall not be tolled longer than 90 days thereafter.\u201d </em>Mich. Comp.Laws \u00a7 600.5856 (1963). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-17\">While this specific language is clearly not applicable to this case, the Committee Comment following the section serves effectively to define the existing law, prior thereto:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-18\">\u201cThe section does not constitute any radical departure from presently accepted principles, but it prescribes a definite procedure to be utilized wherein counsel are informed of the necessary steps which will guarantee the tolling of the statute of limitation. The adoption of this section will greatly increase predictability.\u201d Mich. Comp.Laws Ann. \u00a7 600.5856 (Author\u2019s Comment).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-19\">We believe the District Judge was correct in holding that failure of service for three and one-half years after expiration of the six-year limitation period under the facts of this case could not be held to be \u201creasonable time\u201d under Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-20\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
