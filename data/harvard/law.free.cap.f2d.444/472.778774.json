They are charged first with violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241 relative to conspiracy to injure a citizen in the free exercise of any right secured under the Constitution or laws of the United States, to-wit, the right to attend school without regard to race or color, pursuant to which defendants dynamited the School District\u2019s buses to prevent transportation of Negro students to school; and secondly, with violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1509 relative to a wilful attempt by threats or force to interfere with the exercise of rights under any decree of a court of the United States in that they interfered with the School District by dynamiting its buses and preventing the transporting of Negro students to school.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-17\">Appellants were part of a group of white residents of Longview, Texas, who allegedly feared a \u201crevolution\u201d of black members of the community, and were concerned with events in connection with public school integration. The group met frequently to discuss and prepare for their defense against the purported forthcoming Negro uprising. Lethal weapons, such as cannon, mortar, hand grenades, Molotov Cocktails, gun powder, and dynamite, were secured by the group for future use. The ammunition was secreted in large quantities in appellant Hayes\u2019 garage and at an outlying farm area. Several experiments were conducted by members of the group in the use of the explosives.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-18\">At the trial evidence was adduced through fellow members of the Long-view group and other Longview residents about appellants\u2019 participation in the conspiracy to prepare for the counterattack. It was shown that defendant Hayes, on June 25, 1970, dynamited a house purchased by a Negro woman in a white neighborhood. There was also testimony that defendant Hayes and one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>of the coconspirators constructed \u201cbooby traps\u201d by placing dynamite in flashlight cases, wiring an electric cap to a battery which was then connected to the flashlight switch. The device was designed to explode when the switch was turned on. Hayes, McMaster and two cocon-spirators then took the devices and drove to a Negro residential neighborhood in Nacogdoches, Texas, where Hayes and one of the other men placed two of the \u201cbooby traps.\u201d The evidence also showed that following the issuance of a federal court order by Judge Fisher on June 17, 1970, approving the busing of Negro students to all-white schools, appellants and other members of the group formulated a plan to impede the transportation of the students to the Longview schools by dynamiting the buses. The plan was carried out and on July 4, 1970, under cover of darkness, charges of dynamite were set beneath the buses and exploded, causing serious damage to the vehicles and the parking area.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Appellants contend that evidence relative to extraneous events prior to the bus bombings, which we have heretofore discussed, was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Evidence of bombing of the dwelling and the placing of \u201cbooby trap\u201d flashlights was properly admitted for the purpose of proving a consistent pattern of conduct relevant to the issue of intent. United States v. Pittman, 5 Cir., 1971, 439 F.2d 906; United States v. Justice, 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 30, 32-33; United States v. Smith, 5 Cir., 1970, 433 F.2d 1266, 1270; Gilstrap v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 389 F.2d 6, 9. The incidents referred to were closely related in time and character to the school bus dynamiting incident. See United States v. Justice, supra; Miller v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 397 F.2d 272, 273; Lindsey v. United States, 5 Cir., 1955, 227 F.2d 113, 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Appellants also urge that error was committed by alleged prejudicial remarks of the prosecutor in his final argument to the jury. He remarked that a child had asked him, \u201cWhy did those men bomb those buses?\u201d Later in his argument the prosecutor said, \u201cThere is no doubt in anybody\u2019s mind in this court room that they are guilty.\u201d An objection was made and sustained to the latter remark. In his charge, the District Judge instructed the jury that statements and arguments of counsel are not evidence, and that they were to consider only evidence in the case. In regard to the prosecutor\u2019s reference to a child\u2019s question, there was no testimony by any child at the trial. However, no timely objection to the remark was made by defense counsel. Since we find no plain error in the prosecutor\u2019s comments, any alleged impropriety was waived by counsel\u2019s failure to object. See United States v. Fuentes, 5 Cir., 1970, 432 F.2d 405, 409; Rotolo v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 404 F.2d 316, 317, Because of the overwhelming evidence of guilt, it can hardly be said that appellants were prejudiced in the minds of the jury by the prosecutor\u2019s comments. Even taking the view most favorable to appellants, such remarks do not constitute the type of \u201cobvious and substantial\u201d error which would be grounds for reversal. Sykes v. United States, 5 Cir., 1966, 373 F.2d 607, 612; United States v. Fuentes, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Finally, appellants complain of ineffective and incompetent trial counsel. Their principal' defense attorney, Mr. Tunnell, was admitted to the Texas Bar in 1948, elected County Attorney in 1950, in which capacity he served for eight years, appointed Assistant United States Attorney in 1958, and then United States Attorney in 1961. Co-counsel, Mr. Gibson, was admitted to the Texas Bar in 1927. He testified that he served part of four terms as a county judge. The record negates the contention of incompetent or ineffective counsel. On the contrary, it shows that defendants were vigorously represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\"> A decision was made that defendants were not to testify at the trial. They now contend that the decision was made by their defense counsel contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>to their wishes. They contend, through new counsel on appeal, that original defense counsel failed to prepare adequately for trial, briefed no law, did not ascertain \u201creadily available\u201d impeaching evidence of government witnesses, and failed to call available character witnesses for defendants. Both attorneys were retained counsel, thoroughly experienced and competent in the law. That their trial strategy was unsuccessful is no reason for appellants to prevail here in their request for a new trial. The rule is that effective counsel \u201cdoes not mean error-less counsel or counsel judged ineffective by hindsight, but counsel reasonably likely to render and rendering reasonably effective assistance.\u201d Williams v. United States, 5 Cir., 1971, 443 F.2d 1151; MacKenna v. Ellis, 5 Cir., 1960, 280 F.2d 592, 599. Applying this criteria to the facts in this case, we cannot conclude that appellants were deprived of effective representation of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">We have reviewed each and every error complained of on this appeal and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment and conviction is as to each defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
