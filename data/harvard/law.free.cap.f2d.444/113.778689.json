His sole contention on appeal is that the evidence introduced at his trial was legally insufficient to support his conviction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number> While it is true, as the State points out, that allegations of insufficient evidence in a state court trial are not reviewable by writ of habeas corpus, Fernandez v. Klinger (9 Cir. 1965) 346 F.2d 210, 211, cert. den. 382 U.S. 895, 86 S.Ct. 191, 15 L.Ed.2d 152, we must examine the record to determine if \u201cthe charges against petitioner were so totally devoid of evidentiary support as to render his conviction unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Thompson v. City of Louisville, 362 U.S. 199, 80 S.Ct. 624, 4 L.Ed.2d 654 (1960). See Garner v. Louisiana, 368 U.S. 157, 163, 82 S.Ct. 248, 7 L.Ed.2d 207 (1961); Barquera v. California (9 Cir. 1967) 374 F.2d 177, 179-180.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">We have examined the record and conclude that there was ample evidence supporting the charge that petitioner participated in the robbery by driving the get-away car. While the evidence was entirely circumstantial, we cannot say that there was no evidence pointing to petitioner\u2019s involvement or that the jury acted unreasonably in drawing that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
