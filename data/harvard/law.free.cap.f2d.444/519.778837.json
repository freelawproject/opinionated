Richardson, in California penal custody under a 1954 conviction for armed robbery and murder, petitioned the district court for a writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following an eviden-tiary hearing at which Richardson was represented by appointed counsel, the district court denied the application. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-23\">In the district court, Richardson contended that, at his state trial, he was denied his constitutional right, announced in Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), to have the determination of the voluntariness of his extrajudicial statements made by other than the convicting jury. The district court upheld this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-24\">According to Jackson, when such a violation is established, the appropriate procedure is to allow the state a reasonable time to afford the petitioner a hearing on the question of voluntariness or a new trial, failing which the petitioner is entitled to his release. Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. at 395-396, 84 S.Ct. 1774. In this case the district court chose to make its own determination on the question of voluntariness, and this course was apparently agreeable to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>The district court held that the statements were the product of petitioner\u2019s free choice and were not involuntary. Richardson\u2019s challenge to this determination presents the only issue before us on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">In its memorandum and order, the district court announced that in arriving at its determination of voluntariness, it was \u201c[a]pplying the standards set out in Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568 [81 S.Ct. 1860, 6 L.Ed.2d 1037] * * * (1961) * * *.\u201d Richardson attacks this standard as \u201cobsolete,\u201d and urges that the application of that test requires reversal. He calls attention to more recent Supreme Court decisions passing upon the question of voluntariness in which great significance was attached to the prosecution\u2019s failure to honor defendant\u2019s requests for the assistance of counsel during prearraignment questioning, and to failure to advise defendant of his right to remain silent, and in which emphasis was placed upon the necessity of considering the totality of the circumstances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">However, the <em>Culombe </em>court specifically referred to the denial of counsel and failure to advise the defendant of his rights as \u201crelevant\u201d factors in determining voluntariness. The Court said that \u201crefusal to permit communication with friends and legal counsel at stages in the proceeding when the prisoner is still only a suspect,\u201d and \u201cfailure to caution a prisoner \u2014 enjoined by the Judges\u2019 Rules\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> must be considered. <em>Culombe, </em>at 601, 81 S.Ct. at 1878. While <em>Culombe </em>does not expressly articulate the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d concept, the opinion lists an extensive set of factors which are to be considered in the determination of voluntariness. <em>Culombe, </em>at 601-602, 81 S.Ct. 1860.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">It may be, as Richardson urges, that the Supreme Court decisions since <em>Cu-lombe </em>have become increasingly meticulous in the articulation of factors to be considered in determining voluntariness of extrajudicial statements. But we are convinced that the district court read and applied the <em>Culombe </em>test in a sufficiently broad manner to comport with the latest Supreme Court pronouncements in this field.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">Richardson also argues that, applying the appropriate test, his \u201cconfessions\u201d were involuntary as a matter of law. Richardson gave the police four pretrial statements, the first two exculpatory and the last two inculpatory.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While Richardson, by referring to his \u201cconfessions,\u201d directly questions only the volun-tariness of his last two pretrial statements, he also appropriately calls attention to the circumstances under which the two exculpatory statements were made, these being part of the totality of circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-16\">In arguing that the two inculpatory statements were involuntary as a matter of law, Richardson calls attention to the eleven factors listed in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>the extent that proof was offered concerning these factors, it consisted primarily of Richardson\u2019s testimony. Some of the factors were established without conflict in the evidence; as to others, the evidence is in conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We have examined the entire record. It reveals that the witnesses had some difficulty in reconstructing events which had occurred more than fifteen years previously. Adding to this Richardson\u2019s obvious self-interest in presenting his own version of past events, and whatever assistance the district court judge gained from his personal observation of the witnesses, we are unable to say that the district court erred in discounting Richardson\u2019s testimony and in finding that his extrajudicial statements were voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AJe\">. The state conviction was affirmed in People v. Richardson, 136 Cal.App.2d 342, 288 P.2d 521 (1955).
