(Company) from violating the minimum wage, overtime, and record keeping provisions of the Act, and to require the Company to pay back wages owed to the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">The District Court decided that from January, 1964 until February, 1967 the Company had not been subject to the Act\u2019s requirements, but thereafter, as a result of the 1966 amendments to the Act, the Company came within the enlarged scope of the Act, because the 1966 amendments reduced the economic criteria for coverage. Accordingly, the District Court granted the relief sought by the Secretary of Labor for the years following 1967 only. The Government appealed, and the Company filed a cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">The facts have been stipulated. The Company manages eight office buildings and one apartment house located in the greater Pittsburgh area. The Company does not own these buildings except for a minor interest in one of them, but operates them under a management contract. Pursuant to the contract, the Company obtains tenants, negotiates and signs leases, institutes legal actions regarding these leases when necessary, alters and redecorates the buildings according to its own judgment, obtains utility contracts, and pays taxes and other bills relating to the properties. The Company collects the rent receipts for each building and deposits them in a separate bank account established for each building. The funds deposited in these accounts are the property of each building\u2019s owner, and expenses for each building are paid from the bank account established for that building. Any loss suffered in regard to a particular building is the loss of the owner of such building and not of the Company. Likewise, the profits belong to the respective owners of the buildings and not to the Company. Periodically, the Company withdraws the balance of funds having accrued in each account and forwards them to the respective owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">The Company hires, discharges and supervises all employees necessary for the operation and maintenance of the buildings. Such employees include building superintendents and their assistants, cleaning ladies, custodians, watchmen, and elevator operators. Subject to the approval of the building\u2019s owner, the Company assigns each worker to his particular duties, fixes hours of work, and negotiates rates of pay and fringe benefits. In each building at least two employees operate elevators which carry postmen and messengers who deliver mail and packages to the building\u2019s tenants; a portion of such mail and packages originate from points outside of Pennsylvania. In one of the buildings, the Buhl Building, two employees personally deliver to tenants parcels, some of which originate outside of Pennsylvania. At another building, 319 Fifth Avenue, the elevator operators transport freight from the tenants, a portion to be delivered to points outside of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>\u201cStaff managers\u201d employed by the Company maintain records relating to these buildings and submit periodic reports to the owners of each building. Some of the owners are located in states other than Pennsylvania. In 1964, the aggregate gross receipts from the nine buildings was approximately two million dollars, and from 1956 until the present the gross receipts have exceeded one million dollars per year.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>The Company\u2019s commissions have varied from year to year, but at no time have they exceeded five hundred thousand dollars in any one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The Fair Labor Standards Act requires employers covered by the Act to pay their employees a fixed minimum wage,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> forbids employers to require their employees to work more than a forty hour week unless they receive one and one half times their regular wages for such work, and mandates that records of wages and hours be maintained by the employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">In reaching its ultimate conclusions regarding the scope of the Act\u2019s coverage before and after the 1966 amendments, the District Court made several subsidiary legal determinations. Each has been attacked, either by the Secretary or the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The District Court decided that the Company, notwithstanding the fact that it was acting as an <em>agent </em>in hiring employees to maintain the buildings, was an \u201cemployer\u201d as defined by the Act. In so deciding the District Court rejected the Company\u2019s contention that the term \u201cemployer\u201d was to be given its common law or its traditional meaning. Instead, the Court applied the standard contained within the Act itself. The Act provides \u201cthat the term \u2018employer\u2019 includes any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee * * *\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203(d). On its face the statute adopts a definition of the term \u201cemployer\u201d broader than that of the common law, and applicable under the present facts to the Company. Thus, in Greenberg v. Arsenal Bldg. Corp., 50 F.Supp. 700 (S.D.N.Y.1943), aff\u2019d 144 F.2d 292 (2nd Cir. 1944), rev\u2019d on other grounds <em>sub nom. </em>Brooklyn Sav. Bank v. O\u2019Neil, 324 U.S. 697, 65 S.Ct. 895, 89 L.Ed. 1296 (1945), it was held that a real estate management company is an employer for purposes of the Act despite the agency relationship of the management company to owners of the managed buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">The fact that the owners of the buildings may also be considered \u201cemployers\u201d as a result of their ultimate right to review policies and hiring practices followed by the Company does not preclude a finding that the Company is also an \u201cemployer.\u201d The Act contemplates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>possibility of several simultaneous \u201cemployers\u201d, any one of which may be liable as an employer under the Act. Wirtz v. Hebert, 368 F.2d 139 (5th Cir. 1966); Mid-Continent Pipe Line Co. v. Har-grave, 129 F.2d 655 (10th Cir. 1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The Company argues that Bartels v. Birmingham, 332 U.S. 126, 67 S.Ct. 1547, 91 L.Ed. 1947 (1947), provides the applicable test \u2014 one of economic reality \u2014to determine whether it is an \u201cemployer.\u201d As support for this contention, the Company stresses certain language of the <em>Bartels </em>opinion: \u201cObviously control is characteristically associated with the employer-employee relationship but in the application of social legislation employees are those who as a matter of economic reality are dependent upon the business to which they render service.\u201d 332 U.S. at 130, 67 S.Ct. at 1550. The District Court read this language in conjunction with United States v. Silk, 331 U.S. 704, 67 S.Ct. 1463, 91 L.Ed. 1757 (1947), decided a week before <em>Bartels, </em>which held that in social legislation the term \u201cemployer\u201d was not to be given a restrictive common law construction. 331 U.S. at 712, 67 S.Ct. 1463. Thus the courts are required to avoid technical concepts of the employment relationship and are admonished to examine the economic realities presented by the facts of each case. Goldberg v. Whitaker House Coop., 366 U.S. 28, 33, 81 S.Ct. 933, 6 L.Ed.2d 100 (1961). Applying the \u201ceconomic reality\u201d test to the present facts, there can be no doubt of the appropriateness of treating the Company as -an employer. The Company\u2019s business is that of maintaining and managing real property for the individual owners of such property. Such activity provides economic benefit to the Company\u2019s clients as well as to the Company itself. Unsatisfactory work will harm both the Company and the building owners. Since the Company hires these employees and provides the conditions of their employment, it appears that the Company is \u201cacting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee.\u201d The District Court correctly decided that the Company was an \u201cemployer\u201d of the various persons working at the buildings, as such term is defined by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">A second test imposed by the Act concerns the amount of \u201cgross volume of sales of [the] enterprise.\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203(s) (3) before the 1966 Amendments; 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203(s) (1) after the 1966 Amendments. The District Court, over the objections of the Company, decided that the economic test contained in the Act applied to the gross rental receipts of the buildings and not to the gross commissions earned by the Company. We agree with the District Court. The statute clearly refers to the gross sales of an \u201centerprise,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which term is defined as \u201crelated activities performed * * * by any person or persons for a common business purpose. * * *\u201d \u00a7 203 (r). Thus, in Wirtz v. Jernigan, 405 F.2d 155 (5th Cir. 1968), it was squarely held that in deciding whether the seller of bus tickets came within the Act\u2019s coverage, the gross dollar volume of ticket sales, <em>not </em>the seller\u2019s commission, was the appropriate indicia of coverage. Since rentals are sales within the meaning of the Act, Wirtz v. First National Bank and Trust Company, 365 F.2d 641 (10th Cir. 1966), it logically follows that the gross rentals of buildings managed by the Company, and not merely the Company\u2019s commissions are to be considered in applying the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">Although the Company is an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning of the Act, and the gross rentals rather than the gross commissions govern, we think the District Court erred when it aggre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>gated the rental income of all nine buildings in applying one of the Act\u2019s criteria for coverage, the economic test. In addition to the \u201cemployer\u201d requirement of the Act, before the 1966 amendments section 203(s) (3) set forth an economic test which limits the Act\u2019s coverage to certain businesses having an annual gross volume of sales in excess of one million dollars. The 1966 amendments expanded the Act\u2019s coverage by lowering the economic requirement to $500,000 during the period February 1, 1967 through January 31, 1969, and thereafter to $250,000. The legislative history of the Act makes it abundantly clear that the purpose of providing coverage to those companies with a minimum amount of gross sales was to avoid economic dislocation. The Senate Report accompanying the 1961 Amendments to the Act specifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">The million dollar test is an economic test. It is the line which the Congress must draw in determining who shall and who shall not be covered by a minimum wage. It is a way of saying that anyone who is operating a business of that size in commerce can afford to pay his employees the minimum wage under the law. (emphasis added) 1961 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 1620, 1624.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Since the economic criteria of the Act is based upon a legislative judgment that only businesses which have attained a substantial gross volume of sales should be covered because of their presumed economic capacity to pay a prescribed minimum wage, apparently Congress feared that there might be undesirable economic consequences to small or inefficient businesses if they were brought within the scope of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The Company here did not benefit, except as to its commission, as a result of the aggregate gross volume of rentals accruing from all nine buildings. Instead it acted solely in an agency capacity on behalf of each of nine separate and distinct businesses. The facts stipulated in this regard are that the rentals collected by the Company are deposited <em>in separate bank accounts for each owner, </em>and such funds are the property of the respective owners of the buildings. Any economic loss suffered in connection with a particular building is that of the owner. Similarly any profit enjoyed belongs to the individual building\u2019s owner. While as an agent the Company is liable as an \u201cemployer\u201d to adhere to the strictures of the Act, nevertheless such vicarious responsibility does not require that the gross rentals of each of the Company\u2019s principals be pooled together merely because each principal has employed the Company as an agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">The District Court reasoned that since the Company \u201cis in the \u2018business\u2019 of managing the buildings\u2019 janitorial services, * * * each building becomes one of [the Company\u2019s] \u2018places of business.\u2019 \u201d The analysis employed by the court below has been directly adopted by the Fourth Circuit in Shultz v. Falk, 439 F.2d 340 (filed March 3, 1971). However, the Act requires that before separate establishments be deemed part of an enterprise, they first must be found to be \u201crelated activities performed * * * for a common business purpose. * * * \u201d The owner of each of these buildings is not engaged in a business purpose common to all the other eight building owners merely because each employed a common agent. The record is devoid of any other evidence tending to demonstrate that the nine individual building owners have a \u201ccommon business purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Were the buildings managed by their owners, the Government would not attempt to link them together as an enterprise bound together by a \u201ccommon business purpose.\u201d The building owners\u2019 employment of the Company as rental agent does not alter this critical fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>The legislative intent to exclude for purposes of the Act separate businesses which use common service organizations was made manifest in the Senate Report to the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1961, which adopted the \u201centerprise\u201d concept (1961 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 1620, 1660-1661):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU0\">\u201cThe bill also contains provisions which should insure that a small local independent business, not in itself large enough to come within the new coverage, will not become subject to the act by being considered a part of a large enterprise with which it has business dealings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\">\u201cThe definition of \u2018enterprise\u2019 expressly makes it clear that a local retail or service establishment which is under independent ownership shall not be considered to be so operated and controlled as to be other than a separate enterprise because of a franchise, or group purchasing, or group advertising arrangement with other establishments or because the establishment leases premises from a person who also happens to lease premises to other retail or service establishments. For example, a retail establishment will not become part of an enterprise which operates a shopping center merely because it rents its establishment from the shopping center operator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">If the record in this case revealed that the retention of the Company, as agent, were accompanied by a change in the independent business purposes of the owners \u2014 for example facts such as the pooling of profits from the various buildings demonstrating a common business purpose \u2014 the result might be different. Here, however, the record reveals that the owners share no common purpose except the decision to hire the Company as their rental or management agent. As pointed out in Wirtz v. Hardin &amp; Co., 253 F.Supp. 579 (N.D.Ala.1964), aff\u2019d 359 F.2d 792 (5th Cir. 1965), the utilization F.2d 792 (5th Cir. 1965), the utilization of a common service does <em>not </em>by itself establish a common business purpose shared by the owners of separate businesses. Without more than here presented, we think the \u201centerprise\u201d requirement of the Act has not been satisfied. It would be anomalous to treat the owners of commercial buildings as proprietors of individual businesses when they manage the buildings themselves and as participating in a \u201ccommon business purpose\u201d with other building owners merely because they hire a rental agent who manages other buildings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This is particularly so in view of the expressed intent of Congress not to burden small businesses with a minimum wage they may not be able to afford. Therefore, we think the proper approach under the facts of this case is to consider each of the nine buildings separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">We do not reach additional questions posed on this appeal regarding whether the Company is- engaged in interstate commerce as Required by the Act, because viewing the gross rentals of each building separately it appears that in 1964 none of the buildings produced sufficient gross rentals to satisfy the Act\u2019s economic test.
