The United States District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>denied the requested relief and granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss on the basis of pleadings, affidavits, and oral argument, without testimony of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Appellants claim that the Army\u2019s intelligence work involves undercover operations by military agents within the civilian community and organizations, maintenance of records at over a dozen regional and national record centers, and distribution to military units and to criminal investigative agencies of lists describing individuals and organizations who have publicly objected to governmental policies. Appellants claim that these domestic activities of the Army go far beyond any legitimate military need, exceed the Army\u2019s statutory authority, inhibit political participation and debate, and deprive appellants and others similarly situated of the constitutional rights guaranteed by the First, Fourth, Fifth and Ninth Amendments, <em>i. e., </em>the right to free speech and association, and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances, and the right of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Appellees assert the constitutional and statutory authority and duty of the President to use such of the Armed Forces as he deems necessary to suppress any insurrection or domestic violence, and point to Defense Department directives regarding the planning for and employment of military resources in the event of civil disturbances, under which one of the responsibilities of the Army is to provide \u201cessential planning, operational and intelligence data to the national military command center and to military service command centers on a timely basis to insure that the national command authorities and appropriate military service command authorities are adequately informed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">For reasons stated hereafter, we find that this court and the District Court have jurisdiction, that there is a justiciable controversy, and that appellants have stated a claim in relation thereto. We therefore remand the case to the District Court for ascertaining essential relevant facts and the determination thereupon of whether any rights of the appellants have been infringed by any actions of the appellees which may be proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">I. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">Appellants\u2019 complaint in the District Court alleged jurisdiction to be based upon the existence of a federal question as contemplated by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and the requisite $10,000 in controversy. On this appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Government contests the allegation of jurisdictional amount, contending that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-11\">There is no evidence in the record that any of the plaintiffs have a claim in fact for any amount of money, much less a claim for an amount in excess of $10,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">In response to this argument, appellants in essence admit that their claim is not capable of valuation in monetary terms, but argue essentially that where a challenge to a claimed deprivation of fundamental constitutional rights of intangible value is involved, the purposes for the jurisdictional amount requirement <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>3 are inapplicable and that such requirement should therefore not be applied to defeat federal jurisdiction. While there have been mounting expres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>sions of judicial concern over this seeming gap, caused by the jurisdictional amount requirement, in the power of the federal courts to entertain federal question cases of this nature, we find it unnecessary to reach this question in the instant case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">As we recently held in Peoples v. United States Department of Agriculture: <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-5\">The District Court for the District of Columbia has an independent source of jurisdiction in the legislation, passed by Congress, and codified in the</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-19\">District of Columbia Code, 11 D.C. Code \u00a7 521, which\" gives that court general equity jurisdiction, and venue where either party is a resident or found within the District of Columbia. This permits actions for declaratory judgment as well as injunction to be maintained against those whose office in the Federal Government establishes their official residence in the District. Stark v. Wickard, 321 U.S. 288, 64 S.Ct. 559, 88 L.Ed. 733 (1944); Nestor v. Hershey [138 U.S.App.D.C. 73], 425 F.2d 504, at 521-523 (1969).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>Furthermore, we note that since the Government did not contest the existence of the alleged jurisdictional amount in the District Court, appellants had no opportunity to attempt to sustain their allegation that $10,000 was in controversy, an endeavor at which they might well be successful under the doctrine that, particularly where purely injunctive relief is sought, the amount in controversy may be measured by either \u201cthe value of the right sought to be gained by the plaintiff * * * [or] the cost [of enforcing that right] to the defendant. -* * * \u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> jn the instant case, it seems likely that if all the relief sought by appellants were granted, including enjoining the operation of the Army\u2019s civilian intelligence system and the production and destruction of all records pertaining thereto \u201cmaintained by any and all military agencies within the United States and overseas,\u201d the cost to the Army of complying with such a decree might well exceed $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">Thus even apart from the applicability of 11 D.C.Code \u00a7 521, since we have found as detailed subsequently that appellants have otherwise stated an adequate and justiciable claim for relief, we would be constrained to permit appellants on remand the opportunity to meet their burden of satisfying the District Court that the requisite amount is in controversy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">For the foregoing reasons we reject the Government\u2019s claim that the dismissal should be affirmed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>II. JUSTICIABLE CONTROVERSY</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">In recent years the Army and the National Guard have been called upon to act to preserve domestic peace against violent protests leading to civil disorders, a role for the military which was not unforeseen in our Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Many violent protest's were aimed directly at military functions and installations themselves, as in ransacking Selective Service offices, barring troop and supply trains by prostrate bodies on the tracks, unlawful attempts to enter military bases or demonstrations thereon, and harassment of defense-oriented businesses. In executing other missions the Army confronted riotous mobs protesting matters unrelated to military operations, for example, the tragic riots in Detroit, Newark, and other of our large cities. During the period 1967-68 the National Guard was called upon eighty-three times and the Army four times to quell cases of civil disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">While these statistics relate to the period of civil disorders during which the Army operated the intelligence system which appellants complain violated their rights, we also note that in the period beginning with the use of the Army paratroops at Little Rock in 1957 the Army has been called upon under related constitutional and statutory provisions to preserve civil peace in order that certain groups might exercise their constitutional rights. The moral of this is that no matter who the persons or groups are giving voice to their protests against the established order, civil disturbance of one kind or another is likely to ensue; and, irrespective of the content or cause of the protest, the military need certain intelligence information to perform their mission \u201cto enforce the laws of the United States\u201d or \u201csuppress * * * insurrection.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ay6\">In performing this type function the Army is essentially a police force or the back-up of a local police force. To quell disturbances or to prevent further disturbances the Army needs the same tools and, most importantly, the same information to which local police forces have access. Since the Army is sent into territory almost invariably unfamiliar to most soldiers and their commanders, their need for information is likely to be greater than that of the hometown policeman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">No logical argument can be made for compelling the military to use <em>blind </em>force. When force is employed it should be intelligently directed, and this depends upon having reliable information \u2014in time. As Chief Justice John Mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>shall said of Washington, \u201cA general must be governed by his intelligence and must regulate his measures by his information. It is his duty to obtain correct information; * * <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> So we take it as undeniable that the military, <em>i. e., </em>the Army, need a certain amount of information in order to perform their constitutional and statutory missions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The questions are what type of information the military need, how they should go about obtaining it, when they need it, and whether what the Army has done here has infringed any of appellants\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">So much for the military\u2019s mission and intelligence necessity. As for appellants\u2019 contention that their rights, constitutional or otherwise, have been infringed, they have some difficulty in establishing visible injury, at least on this incomplete record. Appellants freely admit that they complain of no specific action of the Army against them, only the existence and operation of the intelligence gathering and distributing system, which is confined to the Army and related civilian investigative agencies. There is no evidence of illegal or unlawful surveillance activities. We are not cited to any clandestine intrusion by a military agent. So far as is yet shown, the information gathered is nothing more than a good newspaper reporter would be able to gather by attendance at public meetings and the clipping of articles from publications available on any newsstand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">Thus the instant case, at this juncture, involves no concrete, identifiable sanctions, no compelled self-identification (except to the extent that the Army may attend meetings thought to be for a faithful few), and no threat of publication. Turning to the authorities claimed to be relevant here, virtually all of the First Amendment cases cited where government activity was enjoined or struck down fall into one of three categories:</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">(1) Cases where some legal or criminal sanction was imposed or threatened to be imposed on persons who exercised their First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">(2) Cases involving some element of government compulsion, either to testify regarding one\u2019s political ideas or beliefs, or to identify oneself in order to exercise First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">(3) Situations where the Government threatens to publicize the names of allegedly politically controversial persons for the purpose of inhibiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>the exercise of their First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">In view of the distinctions in this case from prior decisions, appellees argue that no justiciable controversy exists, <em>i. e., </em>that nothing has been done, that nothing is contemplated to be done, and even if some action by the Army against appellants were possibly foreseeable, such would not present a presently justiciable controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">This position of the appellees does not accord full measure to the rather unique argument advanced by appellants. While appellants do indeed argue that in the future it is possible that information relating to matters far beyond the responsibilities of the military may be misused by the military to the detriment of these civilian appellants, yet appellants do not attempt to establish this as a definitely foreseeable event, or to base their complaint on this ground. Rather, appellants contend that the <em>present existence of this system </em>of gathering and distributing information, allegedly far beyond the mission requirements of the Army, constitutes an impermissible burden on appellants and other persons similarly situated which exercises a <em>present inhibiting effect </em>on their full expression and utilization of their First Amendment rights of free speech, etc. The baleful effect, if there is one, is thus a present inhibition of lawful behavior and of First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-19\">Under this view of appellants\u2019 allegations, under justiciability standards <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> it is the operation of the system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>itself which is the breach of the Army\u2019s duty toward appellants and other civilians.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The case is therefore ripe for adjudication. Because the evil alleged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>the Army intelligence system is that of overbreadth, <em>i. e., </em>the collection of information not reasonably relevant to the Army\u2019s mission to suppress civil disorder,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and because there is no indication that a better opportunity will later arise to test the constitutionality of the Army\u2019s action, the issue can be considered justiciable at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Only recently this court decided <em>Davis v. Ichord, </em>in which an attack was made on the maintenance and potential use of files on political dissenters by the House Internal Security Committee. This court there held that no case or controversy was presented because the appellants had failed to establish standing to attack the present use of the files and did not show any concrete indication that the Committee\u2019s files would be used against anyone in the future. Nevertheless, this court in <em>Davis </em>did indicate that \u201camong the considerations pertinent to determining the existence of a chilling effect upon the exercise of First Amendment rights which give rise to a case or controversy are the <em>source of the chill, </em>the extent to which it focuses upon the conduct of those who allege it, and the likelihood that it will affect that conduct.\u201d The court <em>in Davis </em>was concerned with the \u201csource of the chill\u201d in order to determine whether the threat of <em>future </em>in-</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">jury was sufficiently substantial to provide the necessary ripeness to the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">Nevertheless, in view of this country\u2019s long-established tradition against military involvement in civilian politics, we think it significant that here the \u201csource of the chill\u201d is the Army, as opposed to the situation in <em>Davis </em>where the House Committee could point to a legal basis for the collection of such files pursuant to its designated function to investigate propaganda. We think the Army has a legal basis for the collection of intelligence information relevant to its constitutional and statutory mission, but on the record before us we cannot say that the intelligence system as designed and operated does not go beyond that which would be justified by the Army\u2019s mission. The Army system here is apparently of a much broader scope than the files involved in <em>Davis, </em>and we held in <em>National Student Association v. Hers</em>hey<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that \u201cthe severity and scope of the alleged chilling effect on First Amendment freedoms\u201d is a factor to be considered in determining justiciability. It is arguable that the existence of a system with the broad scope as alleged by appellants would affect the conduct of persons in the class that appellants claim to represent.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>Referring to our holding in <em>Davis </em>that the \u201csource of the chill\u201d is important in determining whether there is any inhibiting effect on the exercise of First Amendment rights, we think that there is a significant difference between investigative actions taken by a military agency in reference to civilians and similar investigative actions taken by a regular investigative agency of a civilian branch of the Government.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\">One of the functions of a civilian investigative agency, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is to compile information on law violators, agitators of violence, and possible subversives. It has always been recognized that this is a delicate function, and it is exercised under the direction of the Attorney General. Investigation is performed by men a majority of whom are lawyers or who have had considerable legal training, under the direction of lawyers in the Justice Department, and the information compiled is only usable and effective through court action. The FBI is powerless to imprison anyone or to affect his liberty in any way except through the action of the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">The Army or other military, in contrast, are not concerned with law violations. And, in sharp distinction to the FBI and other investigative agencies, they definitely command their own force to exercise at the will of their own commanders. The military are not accustomed to effecting their will through courts and legal processes. Indeed, the employment of military personnel in civil disorders itself implies at least a partial breakdown of law and order, a breakdown of normal processes of law through courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">The compilation of data by a civilian investigative agency is thus not the threat to civil liberties or the deterrent \u25a0 on the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech that such action by the military is, because a civil investigative agency has no inherent power to act against an individual, that power always being subject to the well-defined restrictions of law and the approval of the courts. The military have no such re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>strictions; they have their own force (of incomparable power), they have their own commanders trained as soldiers not lawyers, the military\u2019s vast size may make civilian control of individual or small unit actions more theoretical than actual, and the military is not accustomed to operating within the restrictions of law and the processes of courts.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">It is highly important for the safety of the country that to the extent consonant with the performance of the military\u2019s mission a separation of sensitive information and military power be maintained, as a separation of match and powder. In an emergency or anticipation of an emergency the military power can be supplied the necessary information from civilian investigative agencies; these two ingredients, potentially dangerous when combined, can be put together by a responsible President and his Cabinet officers as the emergency demands. But to permit the military to exercise a totally unrestricted investigative function in regard to civilians, divorced from the normal restrictions of legal process and the courts, and necessarily coupling sensitive information with military power, could create a dangerous situation in the Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">The appellants have not had an opportunity to establish (and may never establish) their far-sweeping claims as to the character of the information gathered and the operation of the system established by the Army. We were informed by appellees\u2019 counsel on oral argument that on 6 March 1970 the Secretary of the Army by directive to the Chief of Staff limited the intelligence activities here complained of and directed the personnel responsible to concentrate on the more important and likely sources and locales of violence. Apparently in the judgment of the civilian head of the Army not everything being done in the operation of this intelligence system was necessary to the performance of the military mission. If the Secretary of the Army can formulate and implement such judgment based on facts within his Departmental knowledge, the United States District Court can hear evidence, ascertain the facts, and decide what, if any, further restrictions on the complained-of activities are called for to confine the military to their legitimate sphere of activity and to protect appellants\u2019 allegedly infringed constitutional rights. Appellants have, therefore, stated a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">III. REMAND</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-10\">Having found that this court and the District Court have jurisdiction, that a justiciable controversy exists, and that appellants have stated a claim upon which relief could be granted, we think the record now before us is much too incomplete for a court to determine the ultimate questions of whether the Army has infringed any rights of the appellants and whether appellants are entitled to any injunctive relief. We therefore remand the case to the District Court for the determination of the following principal (and any related) points:</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">1. The nature of the Army domestic intelligence system made the subject of appellants\u2019 complaint, specifically the extent of the system, the methods of gathering the information, its content and substance, the methods of retention and distribution, and the recipients of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>2. What part, if any, of the Army domestic intelligence gathering system is unrelated to or not reasonably necessary to the performance of the mission as defined by the Constitution, statutes, military regulations, and as interpreted by actions under those written definitions of the mission.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">3. Whether the existence of any over-broad aspects of the intelligence gathering system, as determined above, has or might have an inhibiting effect on appellants or others similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">4. Such relief as called for in accordance with the above established law and facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-13\">. No claim of lack of subject matter jurisdiction was raised in tlie Government\u2019s motion to dismiss in the District Court. This, of course, is no bar to the raising of the issue on appeal. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. v. Mottley, 211 U.S. 149. 29 S.Ct. 42, 53 L.Ed. 126 (1908).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1007-14\">. The purposes of the jurisdictional amount requirement are, appellants assert, twofold: first, the promotion of federalism by confining federal courts strictly within the limits of their jurisdiction as prescribed by Congress; and, second, the avoidance of consuming the resources of the federal courts in the resolving of \u201cpetty\u201d controversies. <em>See </em>Healy v. Ratta, 292 U.S. 263, 54 S.Ct. 700, 78 L.Ed. 1248 (1934), and S.Rep. No.1830, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. (1958). Neither of these purposes, appellants insist, would be served by denying jurisdiction in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">. <em>See </em>Wolff v. Selective Service Local Board No. 16, 372 F.2d 817, 826 (2d Cir. 1967); Fein v. Selective Service System Local Board No. 7, 430 F.2d 376, 380 (2d Cir. 1970) (dissenting opinion); Giancana v.

Where a suit seeks equitable relief, and no claim involving personal property, or for debt or damages is made, the District Court for the District of Columbia has \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d without regard for the amount in controversy. <em>See </em>Norden v. Royall, 90 F.Supp. 834, 835 (D.D.C.1949); Paton v. District of Columbia, 180 A.2d 844 (D.C.Mun.App.1962); Friedman v.

Of course, when the District Court entertains such a suit it is exercising powers analogous to those of a state court of general jurisdiction. Western Urn Mfg. Co. v. American Pipe and Steel Corp., 109 U.S.App.D.C. 145, 284 F.2d 279 (1960); King v. Wall &amp; Beaver Street Corp., 79 U.S.App.D.C. 234, 145 F.2d 377 (1944); Boardman v. Martocchia, 216 F.Supp. 830 (D.D.C.1963), And it is unclear whether such a state court would have the power to issue an injunction against a federal officer. <em>See </em>Arnold, The Power of State Courts to Enjoin Federal Officers, 73 Yale L.J. 1385 (1964). Nevertheless, it is clear that the reasons creating the doubt as to state courts\u2019 power in this respect, stemming from considerations of federal supremacy, do not apply to the District Court for the District of Columbia, which is itself a constitutionally based Article III federal court, albeit one additionally endowed with unique general powers, pursuant to Article I, \u00a7 S. <em>See </em>O\u2019Donoghue v.

Hershey, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 56, 64, 412 F.2d 1103, 1111 (1969). If the Army\u2019s intelligence system causes such injury it may be enjoined if the system in operation exceeds the authority granted by Congress, see Kent v.

To \u201callege the sort of \u2018case\u2019 or \u2018controversy\u2019 referred to in Article III of the Constitution, the source of jurisdiction of the federal courts, * * * the complaint must show that there exists a controversy between the parties with such immediacy and presently adversary character as to require its adjudication.\u201d Davis v. Ichord, 143 U.S.App.D.C. -, 442 F.2d 1207 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-16\">To the extent that the Army\u2019s argument against justiciability here includes the claim that appellants lack standing to bring this action, we cannot agree. If the Army\u2019s system does indeed derogate First Amendment values, tlie appellants are persons who are sufficiently affected to permit their complaint to be heard. The record shows that most if not all of the appellants and/or the organizations of which they are members have been the subject of Army surveillance reports and their names have appeared in the Army\u2019s records. Since this is precisely the injury of which appellants complain, they have standing to seek redress for that alleged injury in court and will provide the necessary adversary interest that is required by the standing doctrine, on the issue of whether the actions complained of do in fact inhibit the exercise of First Amendment rights. Nor should the fact that these particular persons are sufficiently uninhibited to bring this suit be any ground for objecting to their standing. <em>See </em>N. A. A. C. P. v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 459, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958); Anderson v. Sills, 56 N.J. 210. 265 A.2d 678, 684 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-21\">Nor does the recent group of Supreme Court decisions limiting the situations in which federal courts may enjoin court criminal proceedings require a different result. <em>See </em>Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), Boyle v. Landry, 401 U.S. 58, 91 S.Ct. 764, 27 L.Ed.2d 683 (1971), and related cases decided the same day. Those cases rest firmly on concepts of Federalism and comity not present in the instant appeal. In <em>Younger </em>where certain of the plaintiffs sought standing to attack alleged unconstitutional state statutes on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>First Amendment grounds, because they claimed to \u201cfeel inhibited\u201d by the existence of such laws, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-7\">We do not think this allegation, even if true, is sufficient to bring the equitable jurisdiction of the federal courts into play to <em>enjoin a pending state prosecution. </em>A federal lawsuit to stop a prosecution in a state court is a serious matter. And persons having no fears of state prosecution except those that are imaginary or speculative, are not to be accepted as appropriate plain-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWqt\">tiffs <em>in such cases. </em>(Emphasis added.) The Court went on to hold that even one who has been indicted under a constitutionally suspect state law may not ordinarily seek federal injunctive relief because of the \u201clong standing public policy against federal court interference with state court proceedings * * And in <em>Boyle, </em>where \u201c[n]ot a single one of the citizens who brought [the] action had ever been prosecuted, charged, or even arrested under the particular * * * statute which the court below held unconstitutional,\u201d the Supreme Court relied on its discussion of the requirements of Federalism in <em>Younger </em>to conclude that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-10\">the normal course of state criminal prosecutions cannot be disrupted or blocked on the basis of charges which in the last analysis amount to nothing more than speculation about the future. <em>The policy of a century and a half against interference hy the federal courts with state law enforcement </em>is not to be set aside on such flimsy allegations as those relied upon here. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">Aside from the fact that, as we have related <em>supra, </em>appellants here complain of present injury and not merely speculative future injury, we are not faced in this case with any considerations similar to the policy against federal interference in state court actions which the Supreme Court found controlling in <em>Younger </em>and <em>Boyle. </em>Furthermore, and highly important here, appellants do not have the \u201cadequate remedy at law\u201d available to the plaintiffs in <em>Younger </em>and <em>Boyle, </em>in the form of the opportunity to present their constitutional claims to the state court, which the Supreme Court also relied on as a basis for restricting the exercise of federal equitable jurisdiction in such cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">. The analysis of justiciability questions in terms of whether there has been a breach of a judicially identifiable \u201cduty\u201d stems from the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion in Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 198, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962), and Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 517, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 1961, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969). In the latter case the Court, quoting in part from <em>Baker, </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-14\">In deciding generally whether a claim is justiciable, a court must determine whether \u201cthe duty asserted can be judicially identified and its breach judicially determined, and whether protection for the right asserted can be judicially molded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-15\">The Army has both a duty not to exceed its statutory authority and not to infringe First Amendment rights. Appellants claim the Army is doing both; their claim is therefore now justiciable, since \u201cthe facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant\u201d judicial resolution. Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S. 103, 108, 89 S.Ct. 956, 959, 22 L.Ed.2d 113 (1969), quoting from Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941). That the Army has a legitimate need for certain information need not be denied. The claim here is that in the operation of its intelligence system the Army has gone beyond any legitimate need for information, and in doing so has created a present chilling effect on the \u201ctranscendent\u201d values enshrined in the First Amendment. Dombrowski v. Pfis-ter, 380 U.S. 479, 486, 85 S.Ct. 1116. 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965). <em>See </em>note, The Chilling Effect in Constitutional Law, 69 Colum.L.Rev. 808, 809 (1969) for a discussion of the \u201csubstantive\u201d significance of the chilling effect doctrine as relied upon by appellants here. The \u201cjudicial determination\u201d of this alleged breach of duty is attainable by identifying those areas in which the Army\u2019s activity goes beyond that reasonably relevant to its statutory mission requirements, assuming, of course, that limitation of the Army\u2019s system to the extent found reasonably relevant to its civil disorder mission would not itself represent a significant intrusion into the protected First Amendment area. <em>Of. </em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968). That this latter assumption is likely to be valid is seen from documents in this record indicating that the Army may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>modified its policy and now views its information requirements as limited to \u201creports concerning- outbreaks of violence or incidents with a high potential for violence beyond the capability of state and local police and the National Guard to control.\u201d Letter from Under Secretary of the Army Thaddeus R. Beal to Senator Sam J. Ervin, 20 March 1970 (App. 84, 88). In spite of this recent self-limitation, however, appellants have alleged the actual operation of a system of much broader scope and, further, that previously collected information is still retained in various Army files. We therefore think that the appellants should be allowed to develop fully their contention that the Army collects and maintains information on civilian political activity in excess of its mission requirements, and the Army should have the opportunity to show the relevance of its intelligence data to its civil disorder mission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">. \u201cThe free exercise of First Amendment rights is perhaps more readily inhibited by a [policy] justifiably suspect as vague or overbroad, because of the uncertainty of its application. * * * \u201d Davis v.

The dissent suggests that the instant suit may not be appropriate for treatment as a class action under Rule 23, Fed.R.Civ.P. While we recognize that the nature of the appellants\u2019 claims and the potentially large number of persons they propose to represent pose difficult questions as to the amenability of their claims to Rule 23 treatment, this question was not considered by the trial court, has not been argued by the parties, and is not presented in the instant appeal. We therefore do not pass on it here. On remand, the trial court will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>have the opportunity, illuminated by the arguments of the parties, to determine to what extent the \u00ablass treatment of appellants\u2019 claims is appropriate. In this connection we note the considerable flexibility afforded the trial judge under Rule 23 to treat the suit as a partial class action (Rule 23(c) (4) (A)), establish subclasses (Rule 23(c) (4) (B)), and to defer final decision on class action issues until after discovery or further development of the factual bases for the claims alleged. <em>See </em>3B J. Moore, Federal Practice, 1(23.45 [1] at 23-707 (1969). This latter course would seem particularly appropriate here, where because of the very nature of the system alleged to be the cause of the complained of injury, the full facts with respect to the scope of its operation and the numbers of persons affected thereby, are, at the present state of the proceedings, primarily within the exclusive knowledge of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">We further note, in response to the concerns expressed by the dissent, that the fact that a proposed class contains a great number of members does not itself necessarily preclude class action treatment, Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, 391 F.2d 555 (2d Oir. 1968), nor, in suits seeking injunctive or declaratory relief, is the court necessarily required to look into tlie particular circumstances of each member of the proposed class in determining whether class action treatment is appropriate.

On oral argument counsel for appellants admitted that there is a material difference in the impact of the same intelligence gathering and distribution, depending on whether it is performed by the military or by civilian investigative agencies such as the FBI. Counsel was unwilling to concede that, as to content, any of the information complained of could be compiled by either type agency, not even to the extent of compiling a list of previously convicted fomenters of civil disturbance; and as to time, counsel asserted that such information as was compiled should be given on the spot to the military force by a civilian agency. So extreme a limitation on the gathering and timely dissemination of any information would render it useless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">. <em>Cf. </em>National Student Association v.

The court there held that the operation of the intelligence system was at least partly pursuant to a valid governmental interest and should not have been enjoined by the trial court in a summary judgment proceeding. Rather, the court held that a full hearing should be conducted to determine whether the scope of the challenged intelligence system was overbroad in view of both the legitimate state interest in collecting information for planning for and preventing civil disorders and the possible burden on the exercise of First Amendment freedoms involved. With regard to its remand order, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-11\">In short, if it should be found that the police are gathering information which they could not reasonably believe to be relevant to the police function * * * and that circumstances warrant judicial intervention on that ae-count, tlie injunctive order must be precisely limited to the offending material or practice. The order must not interfere witli police activity that is proper, either in direct terms or because of tlie vagueness of the restraint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-20\">A similar evaluation must be made in the instant case, with due account given to the differences in function and role between tlie police and tlie Army, in dealing with and seeking to prevent civil disorder, and relief, if any, should be appropriately tailored so as not to interfere with legitimate Army activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1017-7\">MacKINNON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AXt\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">While I concur in many of the pronouncements in the majority opinion I respectfully dissent from the result. My opinion is based on the facts of the ease which emerge from the pleadings, affidavits and the admissions made to the trial court.

There still remains the allegation that the existence of the files and information operates to deny them their constitutional right of association with others who are chilled, but the chill to this amorphous group in turn is grounded in the unrealistic and speculative fear that the Government will improperly use the information against them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The critical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>information relates to reports of public activities of individuals who <em>publicly </em>participate in gatherings and demonstrations which tend to civil disorders and in related activities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellees gathered this information from public sources and open meetings in much the same manner that newspapers cull information. However, there is one difference, <em>1. e., </em>the newspapers publish much of the information they obtain, whereas the Army merely retains it for possible use by it in the future and this may not necessarily include any publication of the information. Such information is intended to be used to help suppress civil disorders in the event the military are called out in conformance with statute <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for that purpose. Other obvious proper uses by the Army for such information may be judicially noticed from public incidents of the period and would include helping prevent and solve crimes involving destruction, threat of destruction, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>theft of military draft records, military supplies, military research and other Government property and facilities at draft centers, armories, military bases, forts, arsenals, military training centers and military suppliers and research centers operating under military contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">In the instant complaint there are no allegations or claims that any of the information gathered by the Army has been used in a manner that has injured plaintiffs or imposed on them any penalty attributable to their exercise of their First Amendment rights.

Appellants\u2019 admission, <em>supra, </em>that the \u201cthreat\u201d of which they complain is \u201cunknown,\u201d as the latter word is used by appellants, means that the threat is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-8\">\u201cNot knowable * * * cannot be comprehended * * * beyond the limits of human experience, or of human powers of apprehension or understanding.\u201d Webster\u2019s International Dictionary (2d ed.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">Such indefinite claims of highly visionary apprehensions that are admittedly based in abstractions which cannot be comprehended, or are beyond human experience or understanding, do not present a case involving facts of sufficient realism and definiteness to confer jurisdiction on the court to make a sweeping constitutional decision affecting important activities of the federal Government. There is nothing more here than a highly abstract claim based on an imaginary fear that governmental power to collect information for a valid purpose will be misused for an <em>improper </em>purpose. Similar fears might exist with respect to any governmental power. All power is susceptible of misuse, but that truism when coupled with unfounded fear alone is not sufficient to make out a case for judicial jurisdiction. What is necessary before a court is authorized to assume jurisdiction is some allegation from which it can be concluded that the apprehension of the misuse of governmental power is a realistic possibility. Because of the absence of any such allegation here it is my view that a proper case or controversy does not exist. Davis v. Ichord, 143 U.S.App.D.C. -, 442 F.2d 1207 (1970); Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S. 103, 108, 110, 89 S.Ct. 956, 22 L.Ed.2d 113 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-14\">Since the claim of the named plaintiffs does not present a case or controversy, nothing is added by the fact that it has been framed as a class action. Davis v. Ichord, <em>supra, </em>at 1215 n. 19. <em>See generally </em>2 Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 567 at 308 (Wright rev. 1961); 3 J. Moore, Federal Practice ,jf24.04 (1969). As Judge Johnsen remarked in Kansas City, Mo. v. Williams, 205 F.2d 47, 51 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 346 U.S. 826, 74 S.Ct. 45, 98 L.Ed. 351 (1953):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-15\">It is of course necessary generally \u2022 that a plaintiff be able to show injury to himself in order to entitle him to seek judicial relief. He cannot.be a mere volunteer and ask judicial intervention simply \u201cbecause someone else may be hurt\u201d, but he \u201cmust present facts sufficient to show that his individual need requires the remedy for which he asks.\u201d McCabe v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., 235 U.S. 151, 162, 164, 35 S.Ct. 69, 71, 59 L.Ed. 169.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-16\">Moreover, even if I were to agree with the majority that appellants\u2019 claim was ripe, I would seriously question whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>the action was an appropriate class action. When one considers the great number of people that the named plaintiffs seek to represent, their highly varied backgrounds and activities, and that it is the constitutional right of the individual that is sought to be protected, it is obvious that a great many highly individualized questions would be presented. The record of each protestor, and each protest activity, might have to be considered separately and might necessarily result in different determinations as to whether the Army was justified in making a record of his public activities for possible future reference. Under such circumstances there is a serious question whether the complaint presents \u201cquestions of law or fact common to the class.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a) (2) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See generally </em>Green v. Wolf Corp., 406 F.2d 291 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, Troster, Singer &amp; Co. v. Green, 395 U.S. 977, 89 S.Ct. 2131, 23 L.Ed.2d 766 (1969). The importance of this requirement is heightened by recognition of the vast numbers of people appellants seek to have rise <em>or fall </em>on the strength of the showing they make in this suit. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 (c) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">It should also be noted that it is Congress that is empowered by the Constitution \u201cto make rules for the Government and regulation of the land and Naval forces\u201d (U.S.Const. Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 14) and judicial notice may be taken that Congress is presently conducting public hearings upon the policy questions involved in this very area where the named plaintiffs here seek judicial intrusion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">Finally, the trial court here concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-11\">The Court holds that what in effect the plaintiffs are complaining of here is that the Army is keeping the type of information that is available to all news media in this country, covered by all news media in this country, and which is in the morgues of the newspapers in this country and magazines,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the Court holds that they state no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>cause of action; they show no unconstitutional action on the part of the Army; they show no threats to their rights. And I will sustain the motion to dismiss and I will deny the preliminary injunction. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\">It is my view that we should affirm the action of the trial court and wait until a case appears involving some person who alleges a more tangible basis for the claimed threat to his rights. Certainly since these investigative activities began in 1965, if they were the great peril to the populace that appellants argue, there must be one individual who can be found to complain of an injury caused by a concrete threat of the <em>actual misuse </em>of such information. To the extent indicated above, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1017-21\">. As the majority points out, appellants vigorously assert that they are not here attacking the legality of the many uses the Army might make of tlie information it is presently gathering; they are not basing their complaint on the possibility of future injury. Rather they assert that the present inhibitory effect of the Army\u2019s surveillance system is the only injury about which they complain; the nature of the sanctions which might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>imposed on them at some future time is to them here irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">To my mind, this attempted distinction is untenable. Any present inhibition which they suffer must be based wholly on a fear, specific or general, of future consequences stemming from use of the Army\u2019s information. At the same time, they have alleged no present use, preparation for use or selectivity in gathering information by the Army which would reasonably justify such fears. This is not a situation comparable to the one facing the Court in Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U.S. 301, 85 S.Ct. 1493, 14 L.Ed.2d 398 (1905), where, in order to receive certain mail, a person was required to tell the Government that he desired to receive \u201ccommunist propaganda\u201d or in Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 486 &amp; n. 7, 81 S.Ct. 247, 5 L.Ed.2d 231 (1960) where there was a realistic fear that information gathered from individuals would be misused. Any inhibition which appellants in this case suffer is attributable, not to what the Army is presently doing, but to their own imagination as to what it might do at some unknown time in the future. Therefore, it is inaccurate to contend that the Army\u2019s present surveillance activity is the source of the inhibitions which appellants allege. <em>Compare </em>Bee See Books, Inc. v. Leary, 291 F.Supp. 622 (S.D.N.Y.1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">. There are no allegations that the Army has conducted surveillance of wholly private activity and at oral argument appellants indicated, in effect, that they did not have any witnesses who would testify that the Army had engaged in such activity. <em>Compare </em>Local 309, United Furniture Workers of America v. Gates, 75 F.Supp. 620 (N.D.Ind.1948).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1018-11\">.

On September 8, 1970, Senator Ervin outlined the purpose and scope of the study. In this regard, it is well to note that the issues appellants seek to have litigated in this suit are tremendously complex, involving broad questions of both law and policy. Recognition of this complexity, recognition of the fact that courts generally become less and less able to deal competently with controversies the farther removed they are from the \u201cimpact of actuality\u201d and recognition of the \u201clegitimating function\u201d of a judicial decree, <em>see </em>A.
