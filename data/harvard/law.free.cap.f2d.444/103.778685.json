Another defendant, Weldon Kelley Lorraine, filed an untimely notice of appeal which we declined to consider because of lack of jurisdiction. Lorraine then sought relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. It was denied and an appeal taken. Lorraine\u2019s appeal was submitted to another panel of this court and an opinion affirming the district court is filed along with this opinion in the Lujan direct appeals. See Lorraine v. United States, 10 Cir., 444 F.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-21\">The Lujans say that their motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted. The point is not before us because the record in their cases does not contain a transcript of the evidence. That transcript has eeen filed in the Lorraine appeal and we have examined it. The Lujans do not assert in what particulars the record is deficient. We have examined the transcript presented in the Lorraine appeal and are convinced that the evidence is sufficient to sustain the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-22\">The main thrust of the appeals now before us is against the instructions of the court. Two accomplices testified at the trial. The Lujans say that the court did not instruct the jury on the suspect character of accomplice testimony. The short answer is that the court told the jury that accomplice testimony \u201cis always to be received with caution and weighed with great care.\u201d This satisfies the requirements of our decisions in Butler v. United States, 10 Cir., 408 F.2d 1103, 1105, and United States v. Reid, 10 Cir., 437 F.2d 94, 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-23\">The instructions on circumstantial and direct evidence were in accord with the admonitions found in Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 139-140, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150. The court\u2019s comments on the evidence were well within the rule that such comments are proper if the fact issues are left for jury determination. Massey v. United States, 10 Cir., 358 F.2d 782, 787, cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>denied 385 U.S. 878, 87 S.Ct. 159, 17 L.Ed.2d 105. See also United States v. Harris, 10 Cir., 441 F.2d 1333. We have read the complete instructions and are convinced that they were eminently fair, legally accurate, and well within judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The judgments are severally affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
