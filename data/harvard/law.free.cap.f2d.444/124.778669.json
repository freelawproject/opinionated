Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554, decided April 20, 1971, at pages 20-21, 91 S.Ct. 1278-1279, and the two eases cited by the unanimous opinion of the Court in support of those principles at page 21, 91 S.Ct. 1279: United States v. Board of Public Instruction of Polk County, Florida, 5 Cir. 1968, 395 F.2d 66, and Brewer v.

Holmes County Board of Education, 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19 (1969), which this Court has earx-ied out in United States v. Hinds County School Board, 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 852, and of Carter v. West Feliciana Parish School Board, 396 U.S. 290, 90 S.Ct. 608, 24 L.Ed.2d 477 (1970), implemented in Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 5 Cir. 1970, 419 F.2d 1211, this Court has judicially determined that the ordinary procedures for appellate review in school desegregation cases have to be suitably adopted to assure that each system whose case is before us \u201cbegin immediately to operate as unitary school systems.\u201d Upon consideration of the parties\u2019 memoranda and so much of the record as is available or determined to be needed by the Court, the Court has proceeded to dispose of this case as an extraordinary matter.
