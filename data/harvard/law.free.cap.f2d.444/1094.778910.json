In accordance with the verdict he was adjudged to be guilty and sentenced. On this appeal he contends (1) that the evidence was not sufficient to support the judgment of conviction, (2) that evidence was obtained by means of an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and (3) that the registration requirements of 26 U.S. C. \u00a7 5179 violate his Fifth Amendment rights. We have reviewed the record in light of the appellant\u2019s contentions and find no merit in any of them. Accordingly the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b1152-18\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING AND FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<author id=\"b1152-19\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1152-20\">The Petition for Rehearing is denied and no member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc, (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 12) the Petition for Rehearing En Bane is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
