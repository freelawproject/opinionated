For the reasons stated below, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The only issue raised by Rivera that merits discussion is the trial court\u2019s alleged failure to make specific findings of fact as required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 23(c). That issue arises in a rather unusual context. The trial began on December 1, 1970, and ended the following day. After a five minute recess, the court found Rivera guilty and doubled his bail. Acknowledging that his client could not meet the new bail, Rivera\u2019s counsel requested immediate sentencing so that Rivera could begin accumulating good time. The judge acceded to that request and imposed a ten year sentence to the great surprise of counsel, who had expected only the mandatory minimum sentence of five years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rivera was then remanded. Rivera was, however, again brought before the court the following day because he had not been advised of his right to appeal at the time of sentencing. At this point Rivera\u2019s counsel moved to set aside the verdict and for the first time requested</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">a finding of facts so that the defendant will have a basis on which to appeal * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">He pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">a specific finding of fact as to what proof you relied upon would be instrumental for the defendant in order to facilitate an appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">In the colloquy between the court and Rivera\u2019s counsel, the thrust of the latter\u2019s objections to the verdict and sentence was that Rivera had merely been a \u201ccasual facilitator\u201d of a sale under United States v. Jones, 308 F.2d 26, 30 (2d Cir. 1962) (en banc). The following then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-10\">The Court: [I]n sentencing the defendant yesterday the Court pointed out that it was not convinced that this defendant was a casual facilitator of the transportation of narcotics, that on the contrary the evidence showed that he was a participant in a major criminal activity and it was on that basis that the Court did not follow your original suggestion with respect to United States v. Jones. * * * * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-15\">[The amount of heroin involved was] [approximately half a kilogram, which obviously indicates that there was no small amount of traffic involved here in narcotics by a mere casual facilitator but rather a knowing participation in a transaction involving a very large amount of narcotics * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-16\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-17\">By his own testimony he admitted that he was quite willing to become involved on a major scale in the transportation of narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-18\">So that I think that this case is clearly distinguishable from Jones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-19\">[Rivera\u2019s counsel]: Except, your Honor, his willingness to participate \u2014he was prevented from participating by his arrest. He was willing to participate. He offered to try and participate. He didn\u2019t have the money with which to participate, and he was arrested before he was able to consummate any of his plans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-21\">Now, I certainly don\u2019t think that a person can dream a conspiracy and dream of being a participant in a conspiracy and be penalized so sufficiently when he hasn\u2019t done any of the things he dreamed about doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-22\">The Court: Well, that is your assertion. The Court has concluded to the contrary, that those assertions are overcome by the evidence in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>which shows that he was a major participant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Rivera\u2019s counsel thereupon stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">Your Honor, I ask, <em>even though the finding has been rendered </em>\u2014 I ask if you would set aside the sentence and adjourn it for a full probation report. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">and made no further request for findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">In this court, counsel argues that the judge should have made special findings as to whether Rivera was in actual or constructive possession of the heroin, whether the court relied on the presumption from possession in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174, and whether there was actual knowledge of the illegal importation. This situation might have raised the interesting and apparently undecided question of when a request for findings under Fed. R.Crim.P. 23(c) is too late, since Rivera\u2019s request was not made until the day after sentence was imposed. See generally Benchwick v. United States, 297 F.2d 330, 335 (9th Cir. 1961); United States v. Morris, 263 F.2d 594 (7th Cir. 1959). But the problem evaporates in the present case in light of the colloquy quoted above. The request for findings in the district court was ambiguous, not clearly focussed on specific issues as it is in this court. After the district judge responded, counsel apparently acknowledged that his request had been met. Moreover, in summation below, the Government clearly disavowed reliance on the inference in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 based upon possession, which the <em>Jones </em>decision discussed, and relied instead on its ample proof of defendant\u2019s actual knowledge of illegal importation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under those circumstances, it is unlikely that the court relied on the statutory presumption. Even if it did, the finding that Rivera was not just a casual facilitator was supported by the evidence and sufficient to allow the statutory inference and to warrant conviction. On any theory, therefore, if error there was with respect to a failure to make findings, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">Accordingly, we find it unnecessary either to decide-when a request for findings must be made or to determine whether, absent counsel\u2019s acquiescence, the findings made in the present case would have been adequate. We do emphasize, as we have before,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the desirability of at least brief findings, which may be oral, in all non-jury criminal cases. Certainly, when there has been a request under Rule 23(c), the findings should ordinarily be more thorough than those made there.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">We have carefully considered appellant\u2019s other arguments, viz. that testimony of a police officer was improperly admitted, that the prosecution denied Rivera equal protection when it allowed a co-defendant to plead guilty to a lesser offense, and that the court erred in failing to order a probation report, but find none of them persuasive. We note that our decision in no way affects Rivera\u2019s pending motion in the district court for reduction of sentence under Fed.R. Crim.P. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-13\">. These sections were repealed effective May 1, 1971.
