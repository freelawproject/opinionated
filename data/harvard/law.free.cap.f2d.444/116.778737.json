Hershey, E.D.Mich., 1969, 311 F.Supp. 1. There the District Court found invalid the withholding of the fatherhood deferment to those registrants, otherwise qualified, whose induction had previously been deferred for graduate \u2014 as opposed to undergraduate \u2014 study. However, that judgment collapsed, both for the parties and the members of the class, following its reversal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Gregory v. Tarr, 6 Cir., 1971, 436 F.2d 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">We follow <em>Gregory </em>and hold that pre-induction relief was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-13\">. 32 C.F.R. 1622.30(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKn\">(a) In Class III-A shall be placed any registrant who has a child or children with whom he maintains a bona fide family relationship in their home and who is not a physician, dentist or veterinarian, or who is not in an allied specialist category which may be announced by the Director of Selective Service after being advised by the Secretary of Defense that a special requisition under authority of section 1631.4 of these regulations will be issued by the delivery of registrants in such category, except that a registrant who is classified in Class II-S after the date of enactment of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967 shall <em>not </em>be eligible for classification in Class III-A under the provisions of this paragraph.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-25\">.
