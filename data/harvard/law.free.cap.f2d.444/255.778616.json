App. \u00a7 462. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">On April 21, 1967, Alvarado was mailed an order to report for induction on May 10, 1967. Thereafter, on April 27 he requested a copy of Selective Service Form 150 in order to claim a 1-0 deferment as a conscientious objector. The local board supplied the form, considered it upon return and concluded that re-opening was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">(1) Alvarado\u2019s contention that the local board\u2019s consideration of his request amounted to re-opening under Miller v. United States, 388 F.2d 973 (9th Cir. 1967) is without merit since the local board must give some consideration to his showing before it can determine whether it amounts to \u201ccircumstances beyond his control.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2. <em>See </em>United States v. Price, 427 F.2d 162, 163 (9th Cir. 1970); United States v. Bowen, 423 F.2d 266, 267 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-15\">(2) His claim that the local board was required to re-open because he made a prima facie showing is foreclosed by Ehlert v. United States, 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
