Blake, 18 U.S. (95 Wheat.) 317, 5 L.Ed. 98 (1820); Heald v. District of Columbia, 259 U.S. 114, 42 S.Ct. 434, 66 L.Ed. 852 (1922); Carliner v. Commissioner of District of Columbia, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 43, 412 F.2d 1090, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 987, 90 S.Ct. 482, 24 L.Ed.2d 451 (1969); Breakefield v. District of Columbia, 143 U.S.App.D.C.-, 442 F.2d 1227, cert. denied, 401 U.S. 901, 91 S.Ct. 871, 27 L.Ed.2d 807, February 22, 1971; Hobson v.

No. 20,838, decided September 29, 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 914, 87 S.Ct. 863, 17 L.Ed.2d 787 (1967); Moore v. Board of Elections, 319 F.Supp. 437 (D.D.C.1970); Lyons v.

The court is also of the view that, with respect to the challenge to the filing fee requirements, the allegations of the complaint do not present any live controversy appropriate for judicial resolution; and it is further</p>\n<p id=\"b933-16\">Ordered that, insofar as the judgment appealed from involves the challenge by appellants to the party qualifying provisions for the Presidential election contained in Section 8(f) of the District of Columbia Election Act, it is vacated and the case remanded to the District Court for hearing and determination of the preliminary question of whether the constitutional issues are sufficiently ripe for resolution at this time at the instance of these appellants as to warrant the convening of a three-judge court. <em>See </em>Georgia Socialist Workers Party v. Fortson, 315 F.Supp. 1035 (N.D.Ga.), <em>prob. juris, noted, </em>Jenness v. Fortson, 400 U.S. 877, 91 S.Ct. 127, 27 L.Ed.2d 114 (1970), with which compare Socialist Labor Party v. Rhodes, 318 F.Supp. 1262 (S.D.Ohio 1970). We intimate no opinion as to the merits of those issues.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
