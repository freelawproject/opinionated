Thompson, United States District Judge, District of Nevada, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b574-18\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b574-19\">The bankruptcy proceeding below followed a Chapter XI proceeding which was dismissed. In the Chapter XI proceeding Klapper, the appellant, filed an application to recover $5011.52 as an expense of administration for the use by the receiver of certain equipment. Dan-ning, the appellee, who was then the receiver in the Chapter XI proceeding, stipulated that \u201cSaid sum shall constitute an administrative expense of this estate [the Chapter proceeding] and of any bankruptcy estate in the event that the debtor is subsequently adjudicated a bankrupt * * * \u201d. The referee approved the stipulation in the Chapter XI proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-21\">Subsequently the debtor was adjudicated a bankrupt, and Danning was appointed trustee of the bankruptcy estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-22\">Danning\u2019s first and final account in the bankruptcy showed expenses of administration in that proceeding of $224.-46 and total cash of $2,313.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-23\">Meanwhile one Weirick and the Franchise Tax Board had filed claims in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the superseding bankruptcy proceeding for administrative expenses. Weirick\u2019s claim was $6900.00 for rent. The Franchise Tax Board's claim was $156.04 for taxes. Both arose during Danning\u2019s operation as receiver in the Chapter XI proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Danning as trustee in the bankrupt estate, filed an \u201cApplication to Determine Status of Asserted Claims and Priority of Payment.\u201d The application set forth the prior stipulation between Dan-ning, as receiver in the chapter proceedings, and Klapper; and the claim for administrative expense by Weirick and the Franchise Tax Board. The application asked the referee to classify \u201cthe claims of * * * Weirick, the Franchise Tax Board and * * * Klapper as administrative claims in the superseded Chapter XI proceeding and subordinate in priority to the payment of expenses of administration incurred in the within superseding bankruptcy proceedings; * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The referee granted the application and expressly provided that Klapper\u2019s claim was subordinate to the administrative expenses in the bankruptcy and was to be paid prorate with the other claims after the administrative expenses in the bankruptcy were first paid in full. A petition for review was denied by the district court, and Klapper appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The order complained of only <em>classified </em>Klapper\u2019s claim as to priority with other claims in the bankruptcy proceeding. The defense of <em>res adjudicata </em>has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Under the Bankruptcy Act, an order allowing a claim may be reconsidered at any stage of the proceedings prior to the closing of the bankruptcy estate, sections 2a(2) and 57k of the Act (11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 lla(2) and 93k). A referee in bankruptcy has authority to reconsider an order previously entered, even though the time for filing a petition for review from the order has expired, where a party has not changed his position to his prejudice in reliance upon the supposed finality of the order. Smith v. Hill (9 Cir. 1963) 317 F.2d 539, 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">Since the 1952 amendment of section 64a(l) of the Act (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 104a(l), administrative costs and expenses in a bankruptcy have priority ahead of unpaid costs and expenses of administration of a superseded debtor-relief proceeding. 3A Collier on Bankruptcy 2077 (14th Ed.). The congressional mandate of the amended section is clear. New York Credit Men\u2019s Adjustment Bureau v. A. Jesse Goldstein &amp; Co. (2 Cir. 1960) 276 F.2d 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
