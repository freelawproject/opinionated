See also, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148 pertaining in part to district court motions for release pending appeal and making applicable thereto 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146, paragraph (d) of which requires the judicial officer to set forth in writing the reasons for requiring the conditions imposed. See also, Ninth Circuit Rule 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>We accordingly remanded this matter to the district court for the limited purpose of setting forth in writing the reasons for the district court denial of release pending appeal in this case. The district court has now provided a supplemental transcript setting out such a statement. The reason given is that a substantial danger exists that defendant will, unless retained in custody pending appeal, flee the jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">We are not persuaded that we should disregard this determination by the district court. Accordingly, the motion for release pending appeal is</p>\n<p id=\"ahd-dedup-0\">Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
