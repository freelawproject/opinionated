One and a half months later, after the preliminary hearing had been held, the Philadelphia Voluntary Defender\u2019s Office entered an appearance, conducted an interview and investigation, and prepared a file on the case. The case was listed for trial several times, and each time it was called it was continued although the prosecuting witness was in court prepared to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-23\">The case was scheduled for the final time on October 11, 1966. When the case was called, the Voluntary Defender on duty in the courtroom explained to the presiding judge that the case had been assigned to another attorney and that she neither had the file nor knew anything about the case. The judge, apparently concerned with the well-being of the prosecution\u2019s principal witness, who was in poor health, ordered the case to trial later that morning. After a brief delay, during which the Defender conferred both with her client and the Assistant District Attorney, the Defender informed the court that the defendant desired to plead not guilty and to present an alibi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jury trial was waived and the judge agreed to hear the defense ease a few days later in order to enable defense counsel to interview the alibi witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">The Commonwealth then presented its case, which consisted of the testimony of the victim and two policemen. The Voluntary Defender fully cross-examined the complainant, and asked one question of one of the officers. At the close of the prosecution\u2019s evidence, after a brief discussion with his attorney, the defendant changed his mind and pleaded guilty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant was sentenced to prison for four and one half to ten years and did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">Some time later (the specific date is not in the record), Johnson filed a petition for relief under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Hearing Act, 19 PS \u00a7\u00a7 1180-1 to -14 (Supp. 1970). The petition was denied without opinion on November 27, 1967.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In September, 1968, Johnson filed a petition for habeas corpus in the district court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> An eviden-tiary hearing was held on November 5, 1969, and on February 10, 1970, Judge Higginbotham denied relief. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-6\">Since the date of the district court\u2019s opinion, which fully discussed the performance at trial of the defense attorney,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court has limited the scope of inquiry in cases like this where the defendant has entered a guilty plea in a state criminal trial. McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970); Parker v. North Carolina, 397 U.S. 790, 90 S.Ct. 1458, 25 L.Ed.2d 785 (1970). These cases hold that when a defendant pleads guilty upon the advice of competent counsel, he waives prior constitutional infirmities and \u201cassumes the risk of ordinary error in either his or his attorney\u2019s assessment of the law and facts.\u201d McMann v. Richardson, <em>supra </em>at 774, 90 S.Ct. at 1450. <em>See </em>Parker v. North Carolina, <em>supra, </em>at 796, 90 S.Ct. 1458. Before we may examine the conduct of the trial before the entry of the plea, we must find \u201cserious derelictions on the part of counsel sufficient to show that his plea was not, after all, a knowing and intelligent act.\u201d 397 U.S. at 774, 90 S.Ct. at 1450.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-19\">In United States ex rel. Grays v. Run-dle, where the factual situation was very similar to the one in this case, our Circuit held, en banc, that where a defendant later challenges the validity of his guilty plea, \u201cthe burden of persuasion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>[is] upon the relator to show that his plea was not entered as an intelligent act \u2018done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, because the district judge decided the present case prior to <em>Grays, </em>he applied the earlier rule, which placed the burden upon the Commonwealth to validate the plea.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nevertheless, he found, from all of the evidence before him \u201cthat her advice to relator that he change his plea to guilty was competent, effective legal counsel and that relator was not prejudiced thereby.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-4\">There is adequate evidence to support the finding by the district court that the petitioner was not denied the effective assistance of competent counsel <em>at the time of the plea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">Petitioner\u2019s allegations of inadequacy are directed solely at his attorney\u2019s lack of preparation, which was not attributable to her neglect or fault. However, she was a competent, experienced defense attorney, and despite the unavailability of the Voluntary Defender File, it was not a \u201cserious dereliction\u201d for her to conclude, on the basis of her interview with the defendant, her knowledge of the Commonwealth\u2019s case after it was fully presented, and her general experience with alibi defenses, \u201cthat no defense that we could put on would possibly prevail, and that the defendant would do himself at least some good by changing his plea at that time rather than waiting to be found guilty by the court.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-13\">Because petitioner was adequately served by counsel when he entered his guilty plea,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we need not further inquire into the adequacy of representation during the trial phase of the proceedings or the procedure utilized in expediting the case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-14\">Accordingly, the order of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1236-7\">. The defendant\u2019s alibi witness, his employer, was not present in the courtroom at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1236-8\">.
