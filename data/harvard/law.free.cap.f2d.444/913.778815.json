Michigan Consolidated is a gas utility subsidiary company of American Natural Gas Company, a registered holding company regulated by the Commission under the Act. Michigan Consolidated distributes natural gas at retail in various cities in Michigan including Detroit. Homes Corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Michigan Consolidated and was organized to construct and operate low and moderate income housing projects in and around Detroit pursuant to the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701 <em>et seq. </em>(1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">The first of the three orders under review issued June 22, 1970 (App. 126; Holding Co. Act Release No. 16763) and was a denial by the Commission of an application in which Homes Corporation requested authority to issue, and Michigan Consolidated sought authority to acquire, up to $500,000 in Homes Corporation common stock and up to $6,-000,000 in short-term Homes Corporation notes to finance construction of two housing projects (the \u201cElmwood I project\u201d and the \u201cInkster project\u201d) in the Detroit area. (App. 1-8; S.E.C. File No. 70-4778.) The order further provided that Homes Corporation divest itself of all its interests in the two projects and that Michigan Consolidated divest itself of all its interests in Homes Corporation. In two subsequent orders issued. August 26, 1970 (App. 151-53; Holding Co. Act Release No. 16819) and September 22, 1970 (App. 164-65; Holding Co. Act Release No. 16842) the Commission denied petitioners\u2019 motions for an \u201cinterim order\u201d and \u201climited relief\u201d filed subsequent to issuance of the June 22 order. For the following reasons we affirm the orders of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">Since Michigan Consolidated is a subsidiary of a registered public utility holding company, it is required under section 9(a) (1) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 79i(a) (1) (1964), to receive prior approval from the Commission to acquire any securities or any other interest in any business. Before such approval may be granted, however, the contemplated acquisition must be found not \u201cdetrimental to the carrying out of the provisions of section [11] of [the Act].\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 79j (c) (1) (1964). The provisions of section 11 pertinent to this case are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-12\">(b) It shall be the duty of the Commission * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-13\">(1) To require by order * * * that each registered holding company, and each subsidiary company thereof, shall take such action as the Commission shall find necessary to limit the operations of the holding-company system of which such company is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>part to a single integrated public-utility system, and <em>to such other businesses as are reasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate to the operations of such integrated public-utility system </em>* * *. <em>The Commission may permit as reasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate to the operations of one or more integrated public-utility systems the retention of an interest in any business </em>* * * <em>which the Commission shall find necessary or appropriate in the public interest </em>* * -X-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 79k(b) (1) (1964) (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">The diverse interpretations attached to section 11(b) (1) by the Commission and the petitioners are the heart of the dispute before us. The Commission in construing this section has adopted what has been referred to as the \u201cfunctional relationship\u201d test in order to determine whether the retention of a particular business is permissible under the Act. To pass this test the holding company or its subsidiary must clear two hurdles. First, the company must show that its \u201cother business\u201d is \u201creasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate to the operations of such integrated public-utility system.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Once a company has cleared this hurdle, the Commission then looks to see whether the second sentence of section 11(b) (1) is adhered to, <em>i. e., </em>whether the retention of the \u201cother business\u201d is \u201cnecessary or appropriate in the public interest.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>In this ease the Commission held that petitioners failed even to clear the first hurdle and as a result felt it unnecessary to reach the \u201cpublic interest\u201d question.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">The petitioners\u2019 construction of section 11(b) (1) is altogether different from that of the Commission\u2019s. Petitioners argue that an <em>independent </em>finding of \u201cpublic interest\u201d in the retention of the \u201cother business\u201d satisfies the requirements of section 11(b) (1), thereby making it unnecessary to find a relationship in the operations of the business involved. We think that prior judicial decisions, the principles of statutory construction, and the legislative history call for adoption of the Commission\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">An analysis of the wording of the Act substantiates the Commission\u2019s interpretation of section 11(b) (1). Section 1(c), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 79a(c) (1964), states that <em>all the provisions </em>of the Act shall be interpreted \u201cto meet the problems and eliminate the evils as enumerated in this section.\u201d After a careful study, Congress listed in section 1(b) (4) one such evil to be present \u201cwhen the growth and extension of holding companies bears <em>no relation to economy of management and operation or the integration and coordination of related operating properties.\u201d </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 79a(b) (4) (1964) (Emphasis added.) Further it is provided in section 11(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 79k(a) (1964), that it is the duty of the Commission to examine the corporate structure of every registered holding company system with an eye toward confining the businesses thereof \u201cto those necessary or appropriate to the operations of an integrated public-utility system.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The Commission interpretation also seems quite logical even if we were to focus only on section 11(b) (1). The second sentence or \u201cpublic interest\u201d sentence of section 11(b) (1) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-11\">The Commission may permit <em>as reasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate to the operations of one or more integrated public-utility systems </em>the retention of an interest in any business * * * which the Commission shall find necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers and not detrimental to the proper functioning of such system or systems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-13\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 79k(b) (1) (1964) (Emphasis added.) Inclusion of the italicized portion of this sentence indicates that retention of a business deemed appropriate in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d must still be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>\u201creasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate to the operations\u201d of the public utility system. Any other interpretation of the second sentence would render the italicized portion meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">Prior judicial decisions also support the Commission interpretation. In Engineers Public Service Co. v. S. E. C., 78 U.S.App.D.C. 199, 138 F.2d 936 (1943), vacated as moot, 332 U.S. 788, 68 S.Ct. 96, 92 L.Ed. 370 (1947) this court held the Commission\u2019s \u201cfunctional relationship\u201d interpretation of section 11(b) (1) to be incorrect. Earlier the same year, however, the Second Circuit in North American Co. v. S. E. C., 133 F.2d 148 (2d Cir. 1943), aff\u2019d on other grounds, 327 U.S. 686, 66 S.Ct. 785, 90 L.Ed. 945 (1946) adopted the Commission\u2019s interpretation. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in both the <em>Engineers </em>case, 322 U.S. 723, 64 S.Ct. 1273, 88 L.Ed. 1561 (1944) and the <em>North American </em>case, 318 U.S. 750, 63 S.Ct. 764, 87 L.Ed. 1126 (1943). The cases were argued together in the Supreme Court, but, after a voluntary divestment by the Engineers Public Service Company of the properties involved in its case, the judgment of this court was vacated for mootness. Engineers Public Service Co. v. S.E.C., <em>supra, </em>332 U.S. 788, 68 S.Ct. 96. The Supreme Court in the <em>North American </em>case limited itself to the resolution of a constitutional question, but by way of dicta approved the \u201cfunctional relationship\u201d test. North American Co. v. S.E.C., <em>supra, </em>327 U.S. at 697, 66 S.Ct. 785. More than three years after the Supreme Court decision in <em>North American </em>issued, this court had another opportunity to resolve the section 11(b) (1) dilemma. In Philadelphia Co. v. S.E.C., 85 U.S.App.D.C. 327, 333, 177 F.2d 720, 726 (1949), this court re-evaluated its prior stand on section 11(b) (1) and clearly adopted the Commission interpretation and the dicta of the Supreme Court. It is evident then that prior case law supports the Commission\u2019s position. Since the Commission interpretation of section 11(b) (1) is the correct one and since the operations of a low-rent housing project are not \u201creasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate to the operations\u201d of a natural gas company, the Commission was correct in not permitting Michigan Consolidated\u2019s retention of interest in Homes Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">Petitioners advance a second argument in support of retention of Homes Corporation. The origin of petitioners\u2019 second contention dates back to an order of the Commission prior to the ones now at issue. In that order of March 31, 1969, the Commission authorized Michigan Consolidated to acquire a maximum of $500,000 in Homes Corporation common stock and up to $3,-000,000 in its short-term promissory notes for the construction of a low-rent housing project in the Detroit inner city.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission was informed that this was to be a \u201cpilot project\u201d and that if successful petitioners contemplated engaging in other housing projects.in the future. It also developed that the amount actually expended on the \u201cpilot project\u201d was less than the amount authorized by the Commission. On the basis of these two facts the petitioners argue that the March 31, 1969 order authorized at least the initial financing of the two projects involved here. A careful reading, however, of the Commission\u2019s March 31 opinion indicates clearly only an approval of the one housing project, <em>i. e., </em>the \u201cpilot project.\u201d (App. 103-13; Holding Co. Act Release No. 16331.) All that can be said for the petitioners is that they might well have reasonably anticipated Commission ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>proval of the \u201cElmwood I\u201d and \u201cInk-ster\u201d projects since they were quite similar to the one already approved in the March 31 order. This, however, is no legal excuse for commencing the projects without the authorization required by the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Petitioners finally contend that they are entitled to authorization under section 9(c) (3) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 79i(c) (3), which would allow \u201ccertain acquisition of commercial paper and other securities, within such limitations, as the Commission may by rules and regulations or order prescribe as appropriate in the ordinary course of business\u201d of the public utility company. The section 9(e) (3) exemption being sought here, however, as the petitioners admit <em>(see </em>Brief for Petitioners at 43), is \u201csubject to dollar limits and is inapplicable where the acquisition of securities would result in control.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Section 9(c) (3) therefore cannot justify the retention requested in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">The remaining legal issue to be decided is the propriety of the Commission\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 motions for an \u201cinterim order\u201d and \u201climited relief\u201d filed subsequent to issuance of the June 22 order. We think reversal of the Commission\u2019s ruling in this regard would leave the Act with little or no teeth. Furthermore, there has been no prospective showing that denial of this relief would render any substantial harm to Michigan Consolidated, its investors, or any of its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">Though in administering our judicial duties we have somewhat chastized petitioners, it is with great reluctance that we do so, for their only sin seems to have been an overeager response to their social conscience as corporate citizens of the city of Detroit. It has become common knowledge that many of our inner city woes can be traced directly to the numerous dilapidated and run-down apartments and houses that, though unfit for human habitation, are the homes of far too many people. The efforts of companies like Michigan Consolidated to react positively to the need should be encouraged. If these companies show by example it can be done, there might well be brought about an exponential increase in interest among private industries willing to lend a hand. We as a court, however, are unwilling and unable to write the National Housing Act into the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. This can only be accomplished by Congress. We have been informed that the United States Senate, on September 23, 1970, passed a housing bill<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which contained an amendment that would have permitted the type of acquisition Michigan Consolidated is seeking. The bill became law<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but the relevant amendment was rejected by the conferees <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> just before the last session of Congress terminated. Inasmuch as this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>amendment would seem to be an invaluable aid to the public and has the endorsement of the Secretary of HUD (116 Cong.Rec. S13850 (daily ed. Aug. 20, 1970)) and the Commission <em>(Id.), </em>it is hoped that our decision today will inspire further consideration of this matter by Congress as soon as its busy \u25a0 schedule allows.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b975-5\">. At the time of this order the Commission had two members who were not proponents of the \u201cfunctional relationship\u201d test. One other member favored the acquisition on another ground. Unfortunately for the petitioners, since this decision the composition of the Commission has changed, with the result that it did not approve the similar acquisitions at issue now.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b976-7\">. Prior to July 29, 1969, when the 1969 application was filed, petitioners began construction of the Inkster project. (App. 3; S.E.C. File No. 70-4778.) Construction of the \u201cElmwood I\u201d project was started after the filing of the application, but before the Commission had acted on the matter. As of October 15, 1969, the \u201cInkster\u201d project was 50% completed (App. 13; S.E.C. File No. 70-4778) ; by January 16, 1970, the \u201cInkster\u201d project was 75% completed and the \u201cElmwood I\u201d project was 10% completed. (App. 17; S.E.C.
