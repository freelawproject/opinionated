Kimbrough v. Beto, Director, 5 Cir. 1969, 412 F.2d 981.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-27\">The appellant, represented by court-appointed counsel, pleaded guilty to a 17 count information charging violations of Title 18, U.S.C., \u00a7\u00a7 2312 and 2313. He was sentenced by the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee on March 6, 1964 to serve a five-year sentence running consecutively to 16 concurrent five-year sentences. He was released from custody on February 3, 1970 pursuant to the mandatory release provisions of Title 18, U.S.C., \u00a7 4163, with 1326 days remaining to be served. However, he was re-incarcerat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>ed on October 20, 1970 on authority of a mandatory release violator\u2019s warrant which was issued on August 14, 1970, and based upon his conviction for disorderly conduct, his failure to submit the required supervision report, his failure to report to his probation officer as directed, and his failure to report his change in residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In his habeas petition, which the district court treated as one for the writ of mandamus, the appellant contends that his release under Title 18, U. S.C., \u00a7 4163 was absolute, and therefore his re-incarceration is invalid. He also argues that he cannot be incarcerated beyond ten years from the date of his sentencing; and, that once good time credits are accumulated and one is released from prison, they cannot thereafter be forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">These contentions are each devoid of merit. This Court\u2019s decisions in Buchanan v. Blackwell, 5 Cir. 1967, 372 F.2d 451, and Garnett v. Blackwell, 5 Cir. 1970, 423 F.2d 1211, are dispositive of all the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
