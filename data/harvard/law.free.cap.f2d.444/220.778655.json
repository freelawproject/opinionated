Most of the money was later recovered in San Antonio, Texas, and in Argentina.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-29\">Francis Xavier Kilday now appeals his conviction, after a jury trial, of violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, statutes dealing with theft from a federally insured bank, transportation of the proceeds of such a theft, and conspiracy in connection with such offenses. Kilday was sentenced to serve a maximum of ten years, with credit for nineteen months spent under incarceration in Argentina.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-30\">The evidence of guilt, except for the testimony of appellant\u2019s brother, John J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Kilday, directly implicating him, was altogether circumstantial. Since John Kilday at appellant\u2019s trial repudiated portions of his earlier statement to agents of the FBI as faction, appointed counsel for Kilday earnestly urges, in brief and on oral argument, that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Our appraisal of the record, however, is that there was proof which pointed inexorably to guilt, if the jury chose to believe it. The Jury so decided, and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"A3t\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
