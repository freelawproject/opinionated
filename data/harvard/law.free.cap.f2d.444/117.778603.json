Various errors are asserted. We find no error, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-25\">The Board refused to reopen appellant\u2019s I-A classification to consider his conscientious objector claim, made <em>after </em>his induction notice had been mailed. Thus, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2 was applicable and forbade a reopening absent a showing of circumstances over which he had no control. This regulation is lawful. Ehlert v. United States (9th Cir. en banc 1970), 422 F.2d 332, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Affd. 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625 (1971); United States v.

Appellant did not establish the requisite facts to entitle him to a II-A deferment under 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.23(a). The employers listed stated appellant \u201cwas the only one presently employed * <em>* * </em>in this particular field,\u201d and that his induction would \u201cgreatly jeopardize government contracts.\u201d But there was no showing he could not be replaced. This was essential to make a \u201cclearly established\u201d <em>pri-ma facie </em>showing. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.-23(a) (2) and \u00a7 1622.1(c). United States v.
