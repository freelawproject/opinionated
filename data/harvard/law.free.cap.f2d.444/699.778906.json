Section 10(i) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(1), provides in effect that an appropriate official, in this case the Regional Director, shall make an investigation of complaints of alleged unlawful secondary boycott activity, and, should he find \u201creasonable cause to believe that such charge is true and that a complaint should issue, he shall, on behalf of the Board, petition any [appropriate] United States district court * * * for appropriate injunctive relief pending the final adjudication of the Board with respect to such matter.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">The plaintiffs (hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cTerminal\u201d) originally filed a complaint for a mandatory injunction requiring the defendant Joseph H. Solien, Regional Director of the Fourteenth Region of the National Labor Relations Board, to petition for temporary injunctive relief against the Union\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> allegedly unlawful secondary boycott activity pending final adjudication of Terminal\u2019s unfair labor complaint filed with the Board. This complaint was amended to include a prayer for declaratory relief with respect to what discretion, if any, the Regional Director had under the circumstances here posited. The District Court sustained a motion to dismiss on the ground of mootness and also on the ground of failure to join an indispensable party.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">The rather complex factual situation of this controversy has already been before this court in a different context and is discussed in Solien v. Miscellaneous Drivers and Helpers Union, Local 610, 440 F.2d 124 (8th Cir. 1971) (hereafter referred to as <em>\u201cSolien </em>/\u201d). There are also other aspects of this controversy now pending before us.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A brief recital of the factual situation underlying the issues presented in this appeal is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-15\">On June 12, 1970, Terminal filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Board alleging that Teamsters Local 610 was engaging in a secondary boycott in violation of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (B), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(4)(B). On June 16 the Board\u2019s Regional Director, Joseph H. Solien, determined there was reasonable cause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>believe that the charge was true, and that in the absence of a cessation of the unlawful picketing, a complaint should issue. The Regional Director did not at that time issue a Board complaint or petition the district court for a \u00a7 10(Z) injunction because on June 18 he received written assurance from the Union that it had altered its picketing to conform to the <em>Moore Dry </em>Dock<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> standards for determining the legality of \u201ccommon situs\u201d picketing and an offer of a proposed informal settlement agreement executed by the Union. At the request of Terminal the Regional Director deferred consideration of the proposed settlement while he further investigated the Union\u2019s picketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">On June 19, Terminal filed a complaint for an injunction to compel the Regional Director to petition for an injunction pursuant to \u00a7 10 (Z). Terminal\u2019s complaint was amended on June 26 to also seek a declaratory judgment (1) that the Director\u2019s refusal to petition for a \u00a7 10(Z) injunction violated the \u201cshall petition\u201d command of \u00a7 10(Z), and (2) that \u00a7 10230 of the Board\u2019s Field Manual, which allegedly authorizes Regional Directors to exercise discretion in petitioning for \u00a7 10(Z) injunctions, is likewise violative of \u00a7 10 (Z).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">After further investigation the Regional Director came to the conclusion that the Union\u2019s picketing still had a secondary nature. Thus, on June 29 he petitioned the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri for a temporary injunction pursuant to \u00a7 10 (Z) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and on July 2 he issued an unfair labor practice complaint against the Union. The Union\u2019s primary dispute, however, had been resolved on June 27 and all picketing ceased on June 29. Terminal thereupon dismissed its complaint only insofar as it sought to compel the Regional Director to petition for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">The District Court, Judge John K. Regan, 321 F.Supp. 248, dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the Director\u2019s June 29 petition for injunctive relief rendered moot Terminal\u2019s claim that the Director\u2019s refusal to petition for injunctive relief violated \u00a7 10(Z), and that a declaration as to the validity of \u00a7 10230 of the Board\u2019s Field Manual was inappropriate in the absence of its promulgator, the General Counsel, as a party-defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">On July 24, over the objections of the charging parties, the Regional Director and the Union executed a formal settlement agreement with regard to the underlying unfair labor practice complaint, which settlement agreement provided for the entry of a Board order and a court of appeals\u2019 decree enforcing the order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The General Counsel approved this set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>tlement on March 19, 1971, and has submitted it to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">JUSTICIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">There is a threshold question of subject matter jurisdiction. The Regional Director argues that \u00a7 3(d) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(d),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> makes clear that the General Counsel is the final authority in all matters affecting the Board\u2019s prosecutorial machinery, including the Regional Director\u2019s determination of whether to institute a \u00a7 10 (i) proceeding, and that the Director\u2019s determination in this regard is subject to review only by the General Counsel and not by the courts. It is correctly pointed out that the federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, does not confer jurisdiction but rather provides an additional remedy where jurisdiction already exists. Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 671-672, 70 S.Ct. 876, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In Meekins, Inc. v. Boire, 320 F.2d 445 (5th Cir. 1963), the charging parties sought to enjoin a regional director from refusing to petition the district court for \u00a7 10(i) relief. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal because the charging parties failed to exhaust their administrative remedies in not seeking review under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.19.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The critical factual difference between <em>Meekins </em>and the instant case is that the regional director in <em>Meekins </em>did not find there was reasonable cause to believe that the secondary boycott charge was true. Since the Director in the instant case found that there was reasonable cause to believe the charge was true, the question squarely presented is whether the Director acted in excess of his statutory authority in refusing to issue a complaint and to petition for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">That the district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337 in the instant case to determine whether the Director\u2019s action exceeded his delegated powers was made clear in Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 79 S.Ct. 180, 3 L.Ed.2d 210 (1958). <em>Leedom </em>held the district court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 1337 to determine . whether the Board had exceeded its delegated powers and acted contrary to a specific prohibition in the Act, reasoning that \u201c[t]his Court cannot lightly infer that Congress does not intend judicial protection of rights it confers against agency action taken in excess of delegated powers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190, 79 S.Ct. at 185. Although a negative prohibition was involved in <em>Leedom, </em>the rationale has been held to be equally applicable when, as here, the Board or its agents act in disregard of an affirmative or mandatory command. In Miami Newspaper Printing Pressmen\u2019s Union Local 46 v. McCulloch, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 243, 322 F.2d 993 (1963), the Court held that \u00a7 9(c) (1) of the Act requiring the Board to certify results of a representation election imposed a mandatory duty on the Board to certify an election in which the infirmity, if any, was in the Board\u2019s own procedure. The Court\u2019s answer to the Board\u2019s argument that <em>Leedom </em>applied only with reference to a negative prohibition vis-a-vis a mandatory requirement is likewise dispositive of that issue in the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-10\">\u201cThe language which the Supreme Court held had been violated was in terms of \u2018shall not,\u2019 words of prohibition. The provision with which we are here concerned, Section 9(c) (1), is in terms of requirement: \u2018If the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>finds upon the record of such hearing that such a question of representation exists, it <em>shall </em>direct an election by secret ballot and <em>shall </em>certify the results thereof.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) We are unable to read the Court\u2019s decision in Leedom v. Kyne as limited to the negatively worded prohibition there involved. If, after the Board finds that a question of representation exists, and an election is held, the requirement that it \u2018shall\u2019<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> certify the results is mandatory, then a failure to so certify would be prohibited by the Act and in excess of the Board\u2019s powers. A party would be as aggrieved by such a failure as by an act of the Board contrary to an express prohibition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 997 (footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amk\">We conclude that jurisdiction properly rested with the district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337. In so holding, we stress, as did the Supreme Court in <em>Leedom, </em>that the instant \u201csuit is not one to \u2018review,\u2019 in the sense that term is used in the Act, a decision of the Board made within its discretion.\u201d 358 U.S. at 188, 79 S.Ct. at 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">We think this case is justiciable because there is a distinct possibility that the challenged activity will recur and that th'e challenging party will be affected should recurrence take place. Solien I (440 F.2d at 127). <em>See also </em>Local 1976, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, etc. v. NLRB, 357 U.S. 93, 97 n. 2 (1958). In addition the controversy between these adverse parties still exists as to the authority or discretion of the Regional Director to refuse to file a petition for injunctive relief upon his finding that there is reasonable cause to believe that the secondary boycott charge is true. The Regional Director\u2019s contention that he has absolute discretion to file or not directly impinges upon Terminal\u2019s rights to be free of recurring secondary boycotts. The Director\u2019s position is diametrically opposed to Terminal\u2019s contention that the Director has no discretion whatever after making the necessary predicate findings under \u00a7 10(\u00a3). Thus, the extent of the charging party\u2019s rights under \u00a7 10 (\u00cd) and the Regional Director\u2019s obligations thereunder are and will continue to be relevant each time a charge is filed alleging violations remedial under \u00a7 10(I).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c[Furthermore, the policy of insuring judicial review of issues of public importance which are inherently evasive of review compels us not to refuse review on the basis of mootness.\u201d Solien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>I (440 F.2d at 128). <em>See </em>United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953); Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U.S. 814, 89 S.Ct. 1493, 23 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969); Southern Pac. Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U.S. 498, 31 S.Ct. 279, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">For these same reasons we reject the Director\u2019s contention that this case does not satisfy the \u201cactual controversy\u201d prerequisite to a determination under the Declaratory Judgment Act. There was clearly an actual controversy as of June 19 when the Director refused to petition for the injunction although he had found reasonable cause to believe the charge true three days earlier. His voluntary cessation of this conduct (by petitioning for a temporary injunction) on June 29 should not deprive the court of the power to hear and determine the case. United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. at 632, 73 S.Ct. 894. The controversy still remains to be settled and the resolution of this case in its present posture will further two of the principal purposes for rendering declaratory judgments in that \u201cthe judgment will serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling the legal relations in issue\u201d and \u201cit will terminate and afford relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the proceeding.\u201d E. Borchard, Declaratory Judgments 299 (2d ed. 1941). <em>See also </em>Gordon v. Bowles, 153 F.2d 614, 616 (Emer.Ct.App.), cert. denied, 328 U.S. 858, 66 S.Ct. 1350, 90 L.Ed. 1629 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Finally, we think the District Court erred in concluding that the General Counsel was an indispensable party to any determination of the validity of Board Field Manual \u00a7 10230. The determination of the validity of \u00a7 10230 is necessarily tied to our determination of the duty \u00a7 10 (Z) imposes on the Regional Director. Since \u00a7 10230 would clearly be invalid if we were to sustain Terminal\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 10 (Z) that the Regional Director has a mandatory duty to petition for injunctive relief once he has determined there is reasonable cause to believe a secondary boycott charge is true, the General Counsel is not an indispensable party. While \u00a7 10 (Z) expressly provides that for purposes of initiating injunctive relief the Regional Director acts \u201con behalf of the Board,\u201d we are cognizant that the General Counsel has final prosecutorial authority and can override the Regional Director. <em>See </em>McLeod v. Local 239, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, etc., 330 F.2d 108 (2d Cir. 1964). Nonetheless, the General Counsel is not an indispensable party since our decree could effectively grant the relief desired by expending itself on the Regional Director who is before the Court. Williams v. Fanning, 332 U.S. 490, 68 S.Ct. 188, 92 L.Ed. 95 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">THE MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">The Regional Director\u2019s position is that the duty imposed on him by \u00a7 10(Z) of seeking appropriate injunctive relief becomes operative-only after he has made two independent judgments. First, he must decide whether there is reasonable cause to believe the secondary boycott charge is true; if he so concludes, he then must decide whether a complaint should issue. And the determination as to whether a complaint should issue is a matter within his discretion, subject to review only by the General Counsel under \u00a7 3(d) of the Act. Moreover, he contends other valid considerations, apart from the merits of the charges, may be significant elements in his decision and equally within the scope of discretion allowed the General Counsel under \u00a7 3(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">Terminal claims that a literal reading of the statute indicates that upon the Director\u2019s determination that reasonable cause exists, a complaint must issue and the Director must necessarily petition for injunctive relief under the statutory command of \u00a7 10 (Z). In support of its position, Terminal points to the \u201cshall petition\u201d language of \u00a7 10 (Z) and argues that had Congress intended the decision to petition for injunctive relief to be discretionary even though reasonable cause has been found, it would have used language similar to the \u201cshall have power * * * to petition\u201d upon issuance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>a complaint language of \u00a7 10(j), which affords potential injunctive relief from violations of the Act not included under \u00a7 10(i).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">The legislative history is of some assistance <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the comparatively clear distinction in the use of words in \u00a7 10(j) and \u00a7 10(0, which were drafted, debated and enacted together in the 1947 amendments to the Act, leads us to conclude that Congress did create a deliberate statutory distinction between the nature of the duty it imposed on the Regional Director in \u00a7 10(0 and \u00a7 10(j).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>ate Report No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. (1947), also indicates that a definite distinction was intended. The Report explains that jurisdictional strikes were omitted from mandatory coverage under \u00a7 10(1) and placed under \u00a7 10(j), where injunctive relief \u201cis made discretionary because it is anticipated that the separate machinery provided in 10 (k) for settling such disputes will generally suffice.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The Senate floor debates, which did not focus on the precise question before us, reveal a deep concern about the serious economic damage occasioned by secondary boycotts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While a consensus agreed that there was a need for expeditious relief in such situations, the Senate was split on the question of whether the charging parties should be allowed to petition a district court directly for injunc-tive relief or whether the Board alone would have the power to initiate such injunction suits. The Ball Amendment, which would have permitted charging parties to petition the district courts directly for injunctive relief, was soundly defeated and a legislative compromise appears to have been struck.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> To avoid the problem of employers forum-shopping and achieving an independent development of the law through their selection of theories of violation and relief, the right to initiate injunction suits was limited to the Board. In order to provide a meaningful remedy for employers faced with an injurious secondary boycott, the regional director<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> was required to investigate such charges forthwith, giving them priority over all other cases, and to seek injunctive relief when he finds reasonable cause to believe the charges are true, subject to certain qualifications which we will discuss shortly.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Although this is a case of first impression, the Ninth Circuit construed \u00a7 10 (\u00cd) similarly in Retail Clerks Union Locals 137 v. Food Employers Council, Inc., 351 F.2d 525 (9th Cir. 1965), though in a different context. The Court there held that a district court had the power to grant a \u00a7 10(\u00cd) injunction originally petitioned for by the regional director notwithstanding the fact that the latter had meanwhile entered into a stipulation with the respondent union which he believed obviated the need for injunctive relief. Although acknowledging that \u201cit may be true that the Regional Director could not be compelled to institute proceedings under Section 10(i)\u201d, the Court stated that \u201cthe Regional Director\u2019s duty to seek an injunction when he has reasonable cause to believe that one of the sections of the National Labor Relations Act enumerated in Section 10(0 has been violated is <em>mandatory.\u201d </em>351 F.2d at 530 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">It is our conclusion that Congress intended that the Regional Director must take immediate steps to investigate charges arising under \u00a7 10(0, and, upon making a reasonable cause determination, proceed forthwith to resolve the dispute. While we disagree with the Director\u2019s view that even after finding reasonable cause, he retains absolute discretion as to whether he should petition for a temporary injunction or issue a complaint, we do not feel the \u201cand that a complaint should issue\u201d language of the statute is superfluous or should be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Generally those engaged in prosecutorial or enforcement activities are allowed a wide discretion and considerable latitude on when to file charges and against whom charges are to be filed. This is necessarily so for many reasons, some more obvious than others. The resources of those engaged in prosecutorial activities as well as the resources of all agencies of the Government and the country itself are not unlimited. Priorities must be established and the resources available utilized to carry out the primary object of the enforcement activity. Some violations are minimal and in the very nature of things are not worthy of the expense entailed in calling the parties to account. Often disputes are settled by agreement or negotiation and thus do not warrant a greater expenditure of public funds and manpower. Also, many decisions rest on marginal facts, requiring an assessment of the overall situation and background before a commitment of limited manpower can be channelled into enforcement activity. Therefore, it stands to reason that the Regional Director must possess some latitude on when, in his judgment, appropriate injunctive relief should be sought. However, this general prosecu-torial discretion is neither absolute nor unfettered, and where an appropriate statute directs mandatory action, the prosecutorial discretion is thus narrowed and limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">We, therefore, conclude the \u201cand that a complaint should issue\u201d phrase reflects Congress\u2019 intention that the regional director retain limited prosecutorial discretion once he has made a reasonable cause determination. We think it is clearly within his discretion to make an initial demand upon the union to cease its unlawful activity. However, if he is unable to secure cessation upon such summary demand and negotiation, he must then petition for temporary injunctive relief and issue a complaint (or viceversa). The law does not and should not require the doing of useless acts. Rather than requiring the regional director to petition for injunctive relief in every case where reasonable cause is found, as Terminal contends, Congress intended that the regional director retain a limited discretion so that he would not be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>quired to perform the meaningless act of petitioning for injunctive relief when the union has already ceased the unlawful activity and it is unlikely that the conduct will resume, nor to proceed in a case where the acts complained of are so insignificant as to be unworthy of the Board\u2019s and the Court\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The Director of course may still negotiate settlements in lieu of injunctive relief in cases in which he has petitioned for injunctive relief such as was done here, and undoubtedly such settlements will be approved by the district court in most instances. <em>See </em>Solien I. If a settlement in lieu of injunctive relief negotiated by the regional director fails to adequately protect the public interest, the district court can override the settlement and grant injunctive relief. Retail Clerks Union, Local 137 v. Food Employers Council, Inc., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Our construction of \u00a7 10 <em>(l) </em>is in no way inconsistent with our decision in <em>Solien I. </em>While \u00a7 10(1) neither permits the charging party to initiate an injunction suit nor grants it party status in the injunction proceeding, it does afford the charging party certain rights and imposes a duty upon the regional director to petition for injunctive relief if he is unable to secure cessation of the unlawful activity upon request or through summary negotiation, unless the matter presented is so unsubstantial as not to warrant further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Notwithstanding our disagreement with the all-or-nothing argument made by the Board on the statutory construction question, we do not think the assailed \u00a7 10230 of the Board\u2019s Field Manual is at all violative of the Congressional mandate for affirmative action, but to the contrary is in aid thereof and consonant with our interpretation of \u00a7 10(i). In the first place, the Field Manual, as stated in the introductory paragraph \u00a7 10000, is not all inclusive or necessarily a compendium of when action shall be taken regarding unfair labor practice complaints.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In the second place, \u00a7 10230 expressly recognizes the mandatory nature of the Congressional command of \u00a7 10(1) and by implication directs that affirmative action be taken unless the proscribed activity has voluntarily ceased and a resumption thereof is not indicated. Section 10230 of the Field Manual reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-9\">\u201cWhere there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation [of - Sections 8(b)(4), 8(e) or 8(b)(7)] has occurred and that a complaint should issue * * *, Section 10(1) of the Act authorizes injunctive relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-10\">\u201cUnder that section injunction proceedings are <em>mandatory; </em>however, if it appears that the union has voluntarily ceased engaging in the conduct and a resumption thereof is not threatened, * * * commencement of 10(1) proceedings <em>may be held in abeyance, </em>as our experience in the courts has demonstrated that they are unwilling to accept filings where the activity has ceased and there is no likelihood of resumption.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">This is in accord with our view of the regional director\u2019s obligation and duties under \u00a7 10(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">Inasmuch as the complaint for injunction was dismissed by Terminal and the balance of this suit is concerned with a declaration of rights, this opinion shall serve as a declaration of rights of the parties and no further action is required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>by the trial court.

In the \u00a7 10(i) proceeding the district court approved on July 9 a settlement stipulation in lieu of injunctive relief, which had been executed by the Regional Director and the Union over the objection of the charging parties. The charging parties thereupon appealed to this Court from the district court\u2019s order denying them full party status in the \u00a7 <em>10(l) </em>proceeding. This Court affirmed the district court\u2019s order in Solien v.

On July 17 the charging parties had filed a complaint in the district court alleging that the Director had violated their rights under the Act and the Board\u2019s rules and regulations by excluding them from settlement discussions and depriving them of essential facts in connection with settlement deliberations and sought to enjoin the Director from approving any settlement or engaging further in settlement discussions without the informed participation of the charging parties. The action was dismissed by the district court for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter.

Terminal has compiled statistics from data furnished by the Board under the Public Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, which indicate that in perhaps three-fourths of the cases in which reasonable cause is found by a regional director, the regional director does not petition for injunctive relief. During the three-year period from 1968 through 1970, there were 30 cases in which unilateral settlement agreements as to the underlying unfair labor practice charges were effected between the Board and the unions charged with \u00a7 8(b) (4) violations <em>over the objections of the charging parties. </em>Of these 30 cases in which the regional director necessarily found reasonable cause and the charging parties were not satisfied with the settlements negotiated by the regional director, the regional director petitioned for injunctive relief in only 8 cases (i. e. 26.7%).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The National Labor Relations Board\u2019s Thirty-Fourth Annual Report, for the fiscal year 1969, provides further support for Terminal\u2019s assertion that regional directors refuse to seek injunctive relief in approximately three-fourths of the cases in which they find reasonable cause. During fiscal 1969, 2656 cases were filed alleging violations contemplated within the relief afforded under \u00a7 10(1). Appendix A, Table 2, page 199, 34th Annual Report of the NLRB, CCH Labor L.Rep. No. 130 (Jan. 26, 1971). Of this total, settlement agreements were effected in 784 cases. <em>Id., </em>Appendix A. Table 7, page 208. Of these 784 cases in which reasonable cause necessarily was found, \u00a7 10(1) relief was sought in only 190 cases. <em>Id., </em>Appendix A, Table 20, page 238. Consequently, regional directors failed to petition for \u00a7 10(1) injunctive relief in 75.8% of these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">While these figures do not include cases in which regional directors may have petitioned for injunctive relief where an adjudication of the unfair labor practice was ultimately made, we note that the Board does not dispute these figures or the conclusion Terminal has drawn from them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b764-5\">. Section 10(j) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">\u201cThe Board shall have power, upon issuance of a complaint as provided in subsection (b) of this section charging that any person has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, to petition any United States district court, within any district wherein the unfair labor practice in question is alleged to have occurred or wherein such person resides or transacts business, for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b764-7\">. The precise nature of the regional director\u2019s duty to petition for \u00a7 10 (Z) relief was not fully clarified in either the Congressional reports or the floor debates on the committee bill, which contained the present \u00a7 10 (Z) provisions in question here. The only floor discussion of the meaning of \u00a7 10 (Z) at all relevant took place in the Senate floor debates on the Ball Amendment which would have permitted private parties to petition for in-junctive relief. The Ball Amendment, of course, was subsequently defeated by a vote of 62 to 28. 93 Cong.Rec. 4847 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">In the Senate floor debates, the proponents of the Ball Amendment, Senators Ball, Wherry, Donnell and Revercomb, took the position that the committee bill made it discretionary with the Board as to whether a temporary injunction would be sought against alleged secondary boycotts, 93 Cong.Rec. 4835-36, 4837, 4838 (1947). The supplemental views of Senators Taft, Ball, Donnell and Jenner to the Senate Majority Report were likewise critical of the proposed \u00a7 10 (Z) because it provided \u201ca weak and uncertain remedy for those injured by clearly illegal strikes\u201d as \u201c[i]t depends upon the decision of the National Labor Relations Board as to whether any action shall be taken * * Supplemental Views of Senators Taft, Ball, Donnell and Jenner on S. 1126, Senate Report No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. (1947), at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-13\">Of those opposing the Ball Amendment in the Senate floor debates Senator Morse and Senator Pepper took the position that the committee bill provided a mandatory injunction procedure, while Senator Smith indicated that a discretionary procedure was intended and desirable, 93 Cong.Rec. 4840, 4846, 4843 (1947). The Senate Majority Report, which merely repeats the pertinent statutory language, is not of itself very illuminating although it does speak of a mandatory duty on the Board to petition for in-junctive relief. Senate Report No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. (1947), at 27. However, one of the main objections to the bill in the Senate Minority Report was \u201cthe immediate requirement of a mandatory injunction\u201d in certain types of labor disputes. Senate Minority Report No. 105, pt. 2, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. (1947), at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-17\">We are quite cognizant that the conflicting views set forth in these reports and remarks undoubtedly were due in part to the adversary context in which they were made. The issue of primary concern was whether the charging party could personally petition for a temporary injunction. Except for Senator Smith\u2019s remarks, the remarks made in opposition to the Ball Amendment painted the committee bill as providing a mandatory injunction procedure through the Board; whereas the remarks made in support of the Ball Amendment and the supplemental Majority Report contended that the procedure was wholly discretionary with the Board under the committee bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-18\">Consequently, while we view the Senate floor debates as not conclusive in construing \u00a7 10 (Z), we do think the statements in both the Senate Majority and Minority Reports that a mandatory injunction procedure was intended are valuable indications of Congressional intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b764-19\">. A plausible rationale for this distinction has been suggested by one commentator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX5\">\u201cEvidently, these particular union un- \u25a0 fair labor practices warranted the mandatory operation of section 10 (Z) because of their immediate injury to the public resulting from the union clash with an employer and his business whereas the remaining union unfair labor practices, which fall within the discretionary scope of section 10(j), directly affect employees and their relations with the union, with possible public injury more remote. Similarly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>the absence of employer unfair labor practices from section <em>10(l) </em>seems to be based on a policy judgment that the proscribed employer practices, unlike the enumerated union activities, do not so injure the public that normal Board remedies are inadequate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Note, Temporary Injunctive Relief Under Section 10 (Z) of the Taft-Hartley Act, 111 U.Pa.L.Rev. 460, 463-464 (1963) (footnotes omitted). <em>See also </em>Comment, 56 Mich.L.Rev. 102, 104-105 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b765-9\">. This distinction is also reflected in the remarks of Senator Morse of Oregon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8V\">\u201cUnder section 10(j) of the committee bill the National Labor Relations Board may in its discretion apply for a temporary restraining order where unfair labor practices have been committed, including, of course, the unfair labor practices which we are here discussing. Section 10 (k) authorizes the Board to appoint arbitrators in jurisdictional disputes whose decision is to be final. Section 10 (Z) requires that with respect to secondary boycotts and jurisdictional strikes the regional attorney of the National Labor Relations Board shall petition for appropriate injunctive relief pending the final adjudication of the Board with respect to the case.\u201d 93 Cong.Rec. 4841 (1947).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">Jurisdictional strikes were subsequently deleted from the mandatory coverage of \u00a7 10 (Z) in its final form.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b765-12\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>93 Cong.Rec. 4833-4847 (1947).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b765-13\">. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b765-14\">.

The remarks of Senator Morse on the floor of the Senate during the debate on the Ball Amendment reflect the nature of the compromise. As a substitute for the Ball Amendment, Senator Taft of Ohio had proposed that private parties be given the right independent of Board action to sue for damages resulting from unlawful secondary activity. Senator Morse stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-16\">\u201cI do want to make the additional argument against the Taft substitute that it makes it possible for two different district courts and the NLRB to be dealing simultaneously with the same subject matter. The Board would be conducting a hearing looking to a cease-and-desist order. At the same time, the Board would be required, as provided in the committee bill [in which the proposed \u00a7 10(Z) was in substantially its present form], on which I will comment in a moment, to seek injunctive relief, which means that there would be two actions going on at the same time, or that there might be. While I acquiesced in this latter provision when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>was added to the bill, I may say that I did so rather reluctantly. That is an example, however, of <em>my willingness to enter into reasonable compromise in committee. I did so believing that the best procedure would have been to make it discretionary, rather than mandar tory, for the Board to seek injunctions.\" </em>93 Cong.Rec. 4840 (1947) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b767-13\">.
