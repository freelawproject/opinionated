We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-34\">After our opinions in Patton v. North Carolina, 381 F.2d 636 (4th Cir. 1967), and May v. Peyton, 398 F.2d 476 (4th Cir. 1968), the district court found that Levine\u2019s constitutional rights had been violated by the imposition of a harsher sentence by a jury after his retrial. The district court granted the writ conditioned on the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to resentence Levine to a sentence not in excess of ten years imprisonment, the sentence he received at his first trial. The Commonwealth appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-35\">When his ten year sentence had expired, allowing for good conduct time, Levine applied for bail pending disposition of his appeal. The Commonwealth did not oppose the motion, and we granted release on his own recognizance. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>stayed action on the appeal pending disposition by the Supreme Court of North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), then May v. Peyton, 398 F.2d 476 (4th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, Cox v. May, 402 U.S. 948, 91 S.Ct. 1602, 29 L.Ed.2d 117 (1971), and McLaren v. Peyton, No. 12,-450 (4th Cir. 1968) (mem. decis.), cert. denied, Cox v. McLaren, 401 U.S. 1012, 91 S.Ct. 1246, 28 L.Ed.2d 550 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"> We reaffirm the results of <em>May </em>and <em>McLaren. </em>Although we recognize <em>Pearce </em>is somewhat more limited in scope than <em>Patton, </em>we think that the Supreme Court was concerned, as we are, that a defendant be freed of the apprehension of a harsher sentence after retrial. Due process requires no less. See <em>Pearce, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 725, 89 S.Ct. 2072. Jury sentencing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does not free a defendant of the apprehension of a harsher sentence. We therefore hold that <em>Pearce </em>applies to a jury sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Since we have found <em>Pearce </em>to be retroactive in effect to those who actually received harsher sentences on retrial, James v. Copinger, 428 F.2d 235 (4 Cir. 1970), modified on resubmission, 441 F.2d 23 (4th Cir. 1971), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-13\">.
