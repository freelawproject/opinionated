We reject all of the claims of error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Defendant Ponder is an attorney at Amite, in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana. During the indictment yea.r he also owned and operated a small hotel in Amite, held various corporation ownership interests and directorships, and participated, either through joint ventures or separately, in other business operations and sales of capital assets or collections of installment payments from such sales in prior years. His return was separate from that of his wife for each indictment year. The indictment alleged under-reporting of 1960 law business income and director\u2019s fees, and 1961 law business income, director\u2019s fees and interest income.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">I. Use of Defendant\u2019s Records</p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">The trial court denied motions by which defendant sought to suppress all evidence obtained or derived out of leads from certain of his business and financial records because of alleged violations of his rights under the Fourth (search and seizure) and Fifth (self-incrimination) Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-15\">The records in question were voluntarily submitted to the Internal Revenue Service during a civil audit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Taxpayer contends that when he wrote and requested their return, the civil audit terminated, a criminal investigation was commenced, and his records were then copied in violation of his constitutional rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He reasons that such copying of his records was an illegal search and seizure, and that their use in evidence was compelled self-incrimination. He argues that the Service was under <em>\u201ca </em>duty to advise of the change in status to that of a criminal case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-16\">We hold otherwise. Ponder agreed to supply the records requested and voluntarily delivered them to the revenue agents. At that point there was a valid consent to a search, which carries with it the right to examine and photocopy. McGarry v. Riley, 363 F.2d 421 (1st Cir. 1966), cert. den., 385 U.S. 969, 87 S.Ct. 502, 17 L.Ed.2d 433 (1966); Boren v. Tucker, 239 F.2d 767 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>1956). Likewise there had been a waiver of the constitutional right against self-incrimination. The Fifth Amendment right not \u201cto be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against\u201d one\u2019s self protects against compulsion and not voluntary acts, and must be asserted by refusing to deliver records in a case such as this. Hanson v. United States, 186 F.2d 61 (8th Cir. 1950). After the government obtained possession of the information with his consent, it was too late for Ponder then to claim constitutional immunity. Nicola v. United States, 72 F.2d 780 (3rd Cir. 1934). There is no doubt that the government can use information legitimately obtained during a civil audit in the prosecution of a criminal case. Donaldson v. United States, 400 U.S. 517, 91 S.Ct. 534, 27 L.Ed.2d 580 (1971); Venn v. United States, 400 F.2d 207 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Two recent decisions by this Court deal directly with the argument that the Internal Revenue Service owed a duty to advise Ponder that the government was investigating the possible criminal implications in his returns. United States v. Prudden, 424 F.2d 1021 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. den., 400 U.S. 831, 91 S.Ct. 62, 27 L.Ed.2d 62, and United States v. Tonahill, 430 F.2d 1042 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. den., 400 U.S. 943, 91 S.Ct. 242, 27 L.Ed.2d 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">In <em>Prudden, </em>the revenue agent was conducting a civil audit of defendant\u2019s return. Finding indications of fraud, he referred the matter to the Intelligence Division. However, he continued his examination and requested further information from the defendant. Thereafter, he advised the defendant that he was being transferred and that another revenue agent would continue. The succeeding revenue agent appeared on the scene with a special agent of the Intelligence Division, who was identified as such. The two agents told the defendant they were examining his returns, but never told him that a criminal investigation was in progress and never advised him of his constitutional rights. The District Court suppressed all evidence obtained following the referral to the Intelligence Division. This Court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">Similarly, <em>Tonahill </em>involved a referral to the Intelligence Division after a civil audit. There, following the appearance of a special agent, along with the original revenue agent, the defendant inquired of the agents why the examination was taking so long and whether fraud was involved. The agents did not advise the defendant whether fraud or a crime was involved, but stated that they were attempting to reconcile large discrepancies to see if they were the result of innocent errors. In reliance upon <em>Prudden, </em>this Court reversed the granting of a motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-14\"> Thus <em>Prudden </em>and <em>Tonahill </em>hold that evidence received from the taxpayer after the criminal investigation commenced is admissible, even though no notice or <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given. <em>A fortiori </em>the evidence received from Ponder before the criminal investigation commenced is not rendered inadmissible merely because it was copied thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">These cases recognize that evidence obtained for criminal use by deceit, fraud and misrepresentation might be suppressed, but held that failure to advise the taxpayer that a criminal investigation was being made did not amount to such conduct. Ponder argues that after his demand, the government\u2019s letter answer and the retention of the records practiced fraud, misrepresentation and deceit against him. The exchange of letters provide insufficient basis for such an argument, and certainly furnish no ground for upsetting the finding of the District Court that \u201cthere is not the slightest hint of any overbearing threat, trickery, or deception on the government\u2019s part.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>are conclusive on this Court unless clearly erroneous. United States v. Montos, 421 F.2d 215 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. den., 397 U.S. 1022, 90 S.Ct. 1262, 25 L.Ed.2d 532 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The question remains as to whether or not by retaining Ponder\u2019s records after he had demanded their return, the government converted a reasonable search into an unreasonable one, and compelled the defendant to give evidence that could not be obtained over objection under Stuart v. United States, 416 F.2d 459 (5th Cir. 1969). We held there that a taxpayer can successfully resist the production of records on Fifth Amendment grounds when the investigation has become an inquiry with dominant criminal overtones, even though the records had previously been examined by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">We hold that Ponder\u2019s demand for the return of his records did not transform to compulsion an otherwise voluntary submission to the Internal Revenue Service, and did not make the continued examination of the records an unreasonable search. That no such metamorphosis took place is readily apparent for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-19\">First, the demand for return did not assert a constitutional basis, but on the other hand indicated that the defendant needed the records for business reasons. It placed no restriction on the use of the records by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-20\">Second, as an experienced businessman and as a lawyer, Ponder was bound to be aware that any civil investigation could lead to criminal charges if the inquiry revealed wrongdoing and that any records he gave to the government which evidenced criminal activity might be used against him. Cf., United States v. Prudden, <em>swpra, </em>and United States v. Tonahill, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-21\">Third, once having voluntarily submitted records in response to a summons, it is only reasonable to assume that the government would conclude its examination and copy such records prior to return, even after a demand, and that it should have a reasonable time to do so. Glotzbach v. Klavans, 196 F.Supp. 685 (E.D.Va.1961), order vacated, 11 AFTR 2d 1191, 62-2 U.S.T.C. Par. 15,-452 (4th Cir. 1962); Caro v. Bingler, 242 F.Supp. 418 (W.D.Pa.l965).<footnotemark>5A</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>II. Grand Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The defendant attacks the indictment on the ground that the grand jury which returned it was drawn from an improper list.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The contention that the list excluded persons from some of the 12 parishes in the Division is defeated by \u00a7 1865(a) of Title 28, United States Code, which specifically authorizes the court to select the jurors from parts of a district.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This section, which descended from the original Judiciary Act of 1789, has been held constitutional repeatedly. Lewis v. United States, 279 U.S. 63, 49 S.Ct. 257, 73 L.Ed. 615 (1929); Ruthenberg v. United States, 245 U.S. 480, 38 S.Ct. 168, 62 L.Ed. 414 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">As to the composition of the grand jury, defendant\u2019s evidence fails to support the contention that the jury list did not represent the community,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or that the order of the District Court under Section 1865 was not followed. Jackson v. Morrow, 404 F.2d 903 (5th Cir. 1968); Bloomer v. United States, 409 F.2d 869 (9th Cir. 1969); United States v. Skidmore, 123 F.2d 604 (7th Cir. 1941), cert. den., 315 U.S. 800, 62 S.Ct. 626, 86 L.Ed. 1201 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">\u201cThe focus of the law is on the list from which the jury is drawn and not on the composition of a particular jury or grand jury.\u201d Rabinowitz v. United States, 366 F.2d 34, 59 (5th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-15\">The fact that defendant\u2019s home parish was not included does not render the list improper. Lewis v. United States, supra; Agnew v. United States, 165 U.S. 36, 17 S.Ct. 235, 41 L.Ed. 624 (1897).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-16\">As stated by Judge Learned Hand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At6\">\u201cThe statute confers a power which, like any other power, the court need, and indeed can, use only with approximate exactness; it is engaged, not in a scholastic exercise, but in the practical administration of justice.\u201d United States v. Gottfried, 165 F.2d 360 (2d Cir. 1948), cert. den., 333 U.S. 860, 68 S.Ct. 738, 92 L.Ed. 1139 (1948).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"afp-dedup-1\">Having fully considered each of the defendant\u2019s objections to the grand jury, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss the indictment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-17\">III. Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b879-18\">Defendant objected to certain of the instructions as given by the trial court on the various grounds that they gave the jury an instruction that the prosecution evidence was assumed to be correct; that they gave to defendant the burden of proving his innocence; that they did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>not cover his defense; that they stated the law erroneously; and that they were not in accord with accepted rules as to instructions. Defendant made certain requests for instructions which were refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Having carefully studied all of the instructions as a whole, we conclude that they fairly instructed the jury on the applicable law and contain no prejudicial error, and that the objections were properly overruled and the requested instructions were properly refused. Zeigler v. Seaboard Coast Line R. Co., 437 F.2d 80 (5th Cir. 1971); Knight v. United States, 123 F.2d 959 (5th Cir. 1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">IV. Motion for Judgment of Acquittal</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The defendant contends that the Court should have granted a judgment of acquittal for lack of proof that the returns were signed by the defendant, or authorized to be signed on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">Although the defendant urges that this matter must be considered as the evidence stood at the time that \"the government rested its case in chief, this is clearly not the law. When a defendant introduces evidence after a denial of a motion for acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s case, the reviewing court should consider the entire record, including defendant\u2019s evidence. United States v. Cashio, 420 F.2d 1132 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. den., 397 U.S. 1007, 90 S.Ct. 1234, 25 L.Ed.2d 420 (1970). The <em>Cashio </em>case also decided that the statutory presumption that an individual\u2019s name signed to a return furnishes prima facie evidence that the document was signed by him is sufficient to preclude a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s case. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6064.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">The defendant\u2019s secretary, Mrs. Smith, testified for the defendant that the defendant signed the 1960 return, but that she had signed his name to the 1961 return. She further testified that she had prepared the 1961 return and that it was first submitted to the Internal Revenue Service unsigned. It was sent back to be executed. After two or three weeks, she signed the defendant\u2019s name to the return and sent it in, but claims that at no time did she show the return to the defendant and that he did not authorize her to sign it.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">Taking the view of the evidence most favorable to the government, Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), there are sufficient circumstances present from which a reasonable jury could find that the defendant did authorize the filing of the return with his name subscribed to it. The returns were prepared in the defendant\u2019s law office by the defendant\u2019s secretary from the defendant\u2019s records over a period of weeks. The return involved a number of extraordinary items. It was signed under a declaration that the penalties of perjury applied to the return. The defendant had been under previous scrutiny of the Internal Revenue Service, and the jury might well have believed that Mrs. Smith would not have signed the return without authority and the defendant would not let tax time come and go without either making and filing his own return or authorizing someone to do it for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">We conclude there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could connect the defendant with the preparation of the return for 1961. United States v. Barnes, 313 F.2d 325 (6th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">V. Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b880-13\">Defendant seeks reversal of the conviction as to the 1960 return on the ground that the prosecution was barred by the six year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-14\">The first indictment brought within the six year period was dismissed on October 11, 1967, because of an improperly constituted grand jury. By that time, the six year period had expired, but within six months of the dismissal a new indictment was returned on December 3, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-15\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3288 presents a complete answer to the statute of limitations de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>fense.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The express purpose of Section 3288 is to extend the statute of limitations as to a person who has been charged under an indictment which \u201cis dismissed for any error, defect or irregularity with respect to the grand jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The argument that the grand jury was \u201cvoid\u201d and its actions beyond redemption does not advance the defendant past Section 3288. Using the defendant\u2019s concept, the first indictment was at most \u201cvoidable,\u201d because any defects would have been waived unless timely presented. Therefore such defects are not jurisdictional. Rule 12(b) (2), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; Shotwell Mfg. Co. v. United States, 371 U.S. 341, 362, 83 S.Ct. 448, 9 L.Ed.2d 357 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">The instant situation is exactly the-kind of case to which 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3288 was intended to apply and prosecution was not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">VI. Admission of Evidence and Other Points on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">Defendant appeals several rulings of the Court admitting evidence over objection and denying the admission of evidence he sought to introduce. He cites conduct of the Court which he deems prejudicial, to his case. As to all of these issues not previously discussed, we find no reversible error and none which merit discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">The trial lasted seven weeks. A significant portion of the transcript of the proceedings is before this Court. It has all been read, the arguments of counsel have been carefully considered, and viewing the case as a whole, it appears from this review that the defendant had a fair trial and that his convictions must be sustained on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-7\">. \u00a7 7206.

The government claimed that the evidence shows defendant under-reporting his 1960 law business income by $12,358.-95, and his director fees by $600.00, and under-reporting his 1961 law business income by $11,580.80, his interest by $1,-160.40, and his director fees by $1,000.00.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b876-18\">. The records consisted of a \u201cReceipts Book\u201d which was photocopied, admitted in evidence, and its contents used against Ponder; and numerous deposit records shown on check stubs giving names of those who paid him and amounts of settlements on claims of clients, not introduced in evidence, but which were used as sources for leads.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b876-19\">. Although the District Court found that the criminal investigation did not actually begin until after the records had already been copied by the civil division, it is unimportant to the result whether the records were copied for civil or criminal usage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b877-7\">.

At the hearing on the motion to dismiss the indictment, the only evidence offered by the defendant was a Louisiana Governmental Guide showing the population of the various parishes; an order of the District Court of January 20, 1967, providing that jurors would be selected from seven of the parishes in the New Orleans Division; a list of the members of the Grand Jury venire which subsequently indicted the defendant; and a Louisiana Highway map.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b879-20\">. Ponder was originally indicted on March 30, 1967. On October 11, 1967, the original indictment was dismissed on grounds that the Grand Jury that returned the indictment was improperly constituted.
