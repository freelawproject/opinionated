The district court, 312 F.Supp. 293, found that appellant was such an \u201cowner\u201d and awarded damages to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-23\">The barge was towed by a river boat company to appellant\u2019s dock in a river harbor. It was tied to the dock along with other barges and left in appellant\u2019s possession for the purpose of loading it with pipe. After tying up the barge, the boat company left the area. Barge handlers, employed by appellant, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1391\">*1391</page-number>responsible for movement of the vessel from various locations in the harbor by means of pulleys. Their duties also obliged them to place night warning lights on the moored barge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-4\">Plaintiff, an employee of appellant, was one of four loaders whose job required him to receive the pipe which was lowered from the dock into the barge by crane. The loaders were to unhook the pipe from the crane sling and roll it into place on the barge. There was testimony that plaintiff was injured when the crane sling struck the side of the barge and the wall of the dock, causing him to jump from the tier of pipe on which he was standing and fall on an accumulation of ice on the deck of the barge. It was averred, and the district court found, that the accumulation of ice and the absence of sufficient illumination to disclose the presence of ice constituted unseaworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-5\">In Aird v. Weyerhaeuser S.S. Co., 169 F.2d 606, 609-610 (3 Cir. 1948), this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1449-6\">If the owner of the vessel has given entire possession and control of it to another <em>by virtue of a demise charter or otherwise </em>* * * the person thus put in possession and control of the vessel becomes special owner. * * * Such a person is frequently described as \u201cowner pro hac vice\u201d which is merely a convenient expression to indicate that he stands in the place of the owner for the voyage or service contemplated and bears the owner\u2019s responsibilities, even though the latter remains the legal owner of the vessel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1449-8\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-9\">There being no showing of an agreement between the owner of the barge and the appellant inconsistent with a demise, see Banks v. Chas. Kurz Co., 69 F.Supp. 61, 66 (E.D.Pa.1946), and there being sufficient evidence to sustain the district court\u2019s finding that appellant had possession and control of the barge, a finding which we do not consider clearly erroneous, Speyer v. Humble Oil and Refining Co., 403 F.2d 766 (3 Cir. 1968), we are persuaded that the district court did not err in holding appellant liable as an owner <em>pro hac vice </em>for injuries sustained by a stevedore. <em>See </em>Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946); Reed v. The Yaka, 373 U.S. 410, 83 S.Ct. 1349, 10 L.Ed.2d 448 (1963); Jackson v. Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., Inc., 386 U.S. 731, 87 S.Ct. 1419, 18 L.Ed.2d 488 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-11\">We have considered the other contentions presented by appellant and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-12\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
