Relators contend in their brief that, if the terms of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are construed to deny them relief, such construction violates the second clause of Article I, Section 9, of the Constitution, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-14\">\u201cThe Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, * \u2022&gt;:\u2022 -x \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-15\">This contention has been consistently rejected by this court, United States v. Anselmi, 207 F.2d 312, 314 (3d Cir. 1953), and other federal courts. <em>See </em>Cantu v. Markley, 353 F.2d 696, 698 (7th Cir. 1965), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-16\">Although relator Millan-Diaz alleges in his complaint filed in June 1970 that the remedy by motion under 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 2255 is \u201cineffective and inadequate\u201d because no action had been taken on such a motion filed by him in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in July 1969 (Civil No. 906-69), the record in that proceeding shows that the motion was denied by order of February 24, 1971, entered on the docket on March 1, 1971, and no appeal was taken from such denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-17\">Also, relator Baggio contends that the remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate\u201d and hence has not been pursued by him since the court in which he was sentenced will not consider his allegation that he did not know that he would not be eligible for parole if committed as the result of his guilty plea to Count 2 of the indictment (68 Cr. 256 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>cerning a similar challenge to legal rules applied in the Second Circuit, this court said recently (In the Matter of Galante,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 437 F.2d 1164, 1165-1166 (3d Cir. 1971)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201cThe cited cases explicitly hold that Section 2255 has made the sentencing court the exclusive forum for challenge to the validity of a conviction and sentence in first instance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">\u201cSection 2255 requires a federal prisoner to exhaust his remedies in the sentencing court and in the Court of Appeals for the circuit in which that court is located, and to apply to the Supreme Court for certiorari from a denial of such remedies, * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">* * * -X- * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">\u201cAnent Galante\u2019s contention that a Section 2255 application in the sentencing court would afford him an \u2018inadequate and ineffective remedy,\u2019 we specifically said in <em>Leguillou </em>at pages 683-684 [United States ex rel. Leguil-lou v. Davis, 212 F.2d 681, 3 Cir.] that \u2018doubts about its administration in a particular case\u2019 does not make the remedy \u2018inadequate or ineffective.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">\u201cHere Galante seeks by his habeas corpus petition to make a collateral attack on legal standards in effect in the Second Circuit. We cannot give santion to such attack.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">Finally, relator Aparo contends that relief by motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is unavailable to him in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, but the record in that court (#SA-69-CA-401) shows that his motion was initially denied on December 22, 1969, and an application to reconsider such denial was denied on January 20, 1970. A notice of appeal has never been filed in that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-16\">The district court orders <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from which these appeals have been taken will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-12\">. We note that, in United States v. Caruso, 280 <em>F.Supp. </em>371 (S.D.N.Y.1967), aff\u2019d sub. nom. United States v. Mauro, 399 F.2d 158 (2d Cir. 1968). which is relied on by relator to prove that absence of knowledge that there is no parole eligibility for a defendant at the time of his plea is no ground for relief in the Second Circuit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the court stated, in denying a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, at page-375: \u201cHis affidavit 1ms not changed this court\u2019s original conclusion, admittedly shared by his trial counsel, that [defendant] knew full well at the time he pled guilty that he would not be eligible for parole.\u201d Furthermore, in the <em>Caruso </em>case, the defendant pleaded guilty to ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>separate counts, on each of which he knew the minimum sentence was five years, whereas relator Baggio entered a plea to a single count for which the minimum sentence was five years, so that that case would be easily distinguishable from relator\u2019s situation as described in his district court pleadings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-12\">. There is nothing in United States v. Vasilick, 206 F.Supp. 195 (M.D.Pa. 1962), relied on by relators, which is inconsistent with the very recent <em>Galanie </em>decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b155-29\">.
