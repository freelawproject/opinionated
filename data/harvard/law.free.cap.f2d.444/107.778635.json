We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-27\">The taxpayers claimed a dependency deduction for Mr. Schluter\u2019s 17-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>year-old son, Donald, who was living with his mother, from whom Mr. Schlu-ter had been divorced. During the year in question Mr. Schluter paid $962.50 toward Donald\u2019s support, pursuant to the divorce decree. He claims that he also expended $219.00 for motor trips to visit his son, telephone calls, and miscellaneous gifts. The Tax Court properly disallowed these alleged additional expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The Tax Court correctly placed the burden of proof upon the'taxpayers to establish that they contributed more than one-half of the total support of the claimed dependent. Rezazadeh v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 356 F.2d 898 (7th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">There was no proof nor even a reasonable estimate of the amount of support furnished Donald by his mother, with whom he lived, nor of the amount contributed by the boy himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The taxpayer has not met the burden of proving that he contributed more than one-half for the support of his minor son. The decision of the Tax Court was correct and is</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
