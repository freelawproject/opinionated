The written stipulation upon which the case was submitted and tried admitted all the essential elements of the subject offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-21\">Prior to the submission of the question of appellant\u2019s guilt to the court Maxwell had been required by order of the court to furnish handwriting exemplars to the prosecution. Appellant objected to but complied with the order. This objection was purportedly preserved for appellate consideration in the later stipulation submitted to the court for trial and now constitutes the only issue presented to us. Although the answer to the question of the validity of the court\u2019s preliminary order seems clear, Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178, we refuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>to recognize this procedure to in any way present or preserve an appellate issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The admitted facts support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
