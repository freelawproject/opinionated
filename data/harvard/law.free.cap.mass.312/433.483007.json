P. Doyle, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b472-3\"><em>S. I.

Upon report, the Appellate Division for the Southern District decided that there was prejudicial error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s request for a ruling that Rebello, at the time of the collision, was not acting as the defendant\u2019s agent, and ordered the finding for the plaintiff vacated and that a finding for the defendant be entered. It has not been argued that this request does not properly raise the question whether Rebello, at the time of the collision, was acting within the scope of his employment, and the question whether he was is the only one that has been argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">It could have been found that Rebello was an employee of the defendant, and that part of his work was to \u201cpick-up\u201d automobiles to be repaired and to deliver automobiles that had been repaired at the defendant\u2019s garage. The day before the collision occurred, the daughter of the owner of the automobile that was being operated by Rebello at the time of the collision drove this automobile to the defendant\u2019s garage for the purpose of having repairs made. It was impossible to make the repairs that day, and the defendant\u2019s manager told another employee to deliver the automobile to the owner\u2019s daughter at her place of employment. This employee, however, turned this task over to Rebello, who delivered the automobile, whereupon he and the owner\u2019s daughter arranged that she would pick him up at seven-thirty o\u2019clock the following morning in front of the defendant\u2019s garage. She did, then drove him to her place of employment and told him to drive the automobile back to the defendant\u2019s garage. But instead of doing this, he went to his home for breakfast, and it was while he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>driving from his home to the garage that the collision occurred. Rebello\u2019s usual time for commencing work at the garage was eight o\u2019clock in the morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\">The report states that it was agreed by counsel that the most direct and ordinarily travelled route by which an automobile would travel from the daughter\u2019s place of employment to the defendant\u2019s garage was a distance of one and three tenths miles \u201cin a due northerly direction\u201d; that the \u201cautomobile distance\u201d from this place of employment to Rebello\u2019s home was one mile in a \u201cdue westerly direction\u201d; and that the \u201cautomobile distance\u201d from Rebello\u2019s home to the place where the collision occurred was one tenth of a mile \u201cdue east\u201d; and therefore that the place of collision was nine tenths of a mile \u201cdue west\u201d from the place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The liability of the defendant for the admitted negligence of Rebello depends upon whether he was then acting within the scope of his employment. <em>McKeever </em>v. <em>Ratcliffe, </em>218 Mass. 17, 19. See <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Holyoke Machine Co. </em>233 Mass. 573, 576. There was no evidence from which it could be found, by inference or otherwise, that Rebello had any authority to use the automobile for the purpose of getting his breakfast as an incident of his employment (compare <em>Reynolds </em>v. Denholm, 213 Mass. 576; <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Feinstein, </em>251 Mass. 109, 111, 112), and there was no evidence from which it could be found, by inference or otherwise, that after Rebello left the automobile owner\u2019s daughter at her place of employment, there was anything for him to do in the scope of his employment except to drive the automobile to the defendant\u2019s garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">We are of opinion that the evidence did not warrant a finding that, at the time of the collision, Rebello was acting within the scope of his employment. The permissible findings do not disclose that this is a case where Rebello chose \u201cthe quickest and best way to reach his destination\u201d (see <em>Mathewson </em>v. <em>Edison Electric Illuminating Co. </em>232 Mass. 576, 581), or that, at the time of the collision, he had resumed the performance of his duty (see <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Vorenberg, </em>227 Mass. 1, 6), or that his \u201cdeviation from his em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>ployer\u2019s business had ended\u201d (see <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Republic Truck Co. </em>241 Mass. 292, 294).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\">The case at bar is governed by <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Timmins, </em>178 Mass. 378, and <em>Fleischner </em>v. <em>Durgin, </em>207 Mass. 435. See <em>Vallavanti </em>v. <em>Armour &amp; Co. </em>260 Mass. 417; <em>Gearin </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>299 Mass. 145. It is distinguishable from <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>194 Mass. 223, <em>McKeever v. Ratcliffe, </em>218 Mass. 17, 20, <em>Lewandowski </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>237 Mass. 125, and <em>Thornes </em>v. <em>Meyer Store Inc. </em>268 Mass. 587, and from other cases to which reference has already been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\n<em>Order of Appellate Division affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
