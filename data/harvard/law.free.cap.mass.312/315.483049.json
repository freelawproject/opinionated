The plaintiff was employed as a broker to obtain a customer for real estate owned by the defendant, but the defendant stated no selling price. The plaintiff procured an offer of $15,000 from one Sorota, but the defendant refused it. Successive offers of $15,500, $16,000 and $16,500 were likewise refused. Later Sorota made an offer of $17,000 through another broker, and the premises were conveyed by the defendant to a straw for Sorota named Levine. The defendant knew that Sorota was the real buyer. The defendant paid the other broker a commission. The judge, sitting without a jury, found for the plaintiff. The case comes here on report.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Upon the evidence the question whether the plaintiff or the other broker was the efficient cause of the sale was a question of fact. As was said in <em>Cadigan </em>v. <em>Crabtree, </em>192 Mass. 233, 240, \u201cThe question of efficient cause is ordinarily at least a question of fact for the jury where no exclusive agency has been given and where two brokers have worked on the case.\u201d This disposes of the. defendant\u2019s exception to the granting of the plaintiff\u2019s first request. The plaintiff\u2019s fifth request dealt with an indecisive point. His other requests were conditioned upon a finding that the plaintiff was the efficient cause of the sale, and were in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The requests presented by the defendant were all granted, with one exception, and the defendant did not except to the .refusal of that one. The defendant\u2019s eighth request was as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>follows: \u201cUpon all the evidence the court is unwarranted in finding that the plaintiff\u2019s efforts were the efficient cause of the sale.\u201d This request was granted. Nevertheless the judge found for the plaintiff, and the defendant excepted to \u201cthe finding of the court as inconsistent with\u201d the action of the judge upon that request. This inconsistency was made the subject of a motion for a new trial, upon which the judge, without changing his general finding for the plaintiff, corrected his action upon the defendant\u2019s eighth request by denying it. He thus cured the preexisting inconsistency. In this there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">This disposes of all the questions of law raised by the report. Judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff upon the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
