In each action the plaintiffs seek to recover the full amount of their loss, \u201cregardless of the said award,\u201d on the ground that the award is not binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\">There is nothing in the bill of exceptions to support the allegations of the declarations that the award was invalid. All that appears is that an award was made and that the plaintiffs at the trial contended that it was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">On this record the award was \u201cconclusive and final upon the parties as to the amount of loss or damage.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 175, \u00a7 99. <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co. </em>224 Mass. 310, 315. <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Globe &amp; Rutgers Fire Ins. Co. 227 </em>Mass. 354, was an action to recover for loss and damage caused by fire. An award was made which the plaintiff declined to accept. It was held that the jury were correctly instructed that if they found the award to be valid, the plaintiff could not recover. (Page 366.)</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The trial judge ruled that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover. See Rule 71 of the Superior Court (1932); <em>Field </em>v. <em>Hamm, </em>254 Mass. 268, 271. The bill of exceptions does not disclose that the plaintiffs excepted to this ruling, but if it be assumed that they did, we are of opinion that there was no error, and that a verdict for the defendant in each case was rightly ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
