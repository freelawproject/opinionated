That court refused to order judgments for the plaintiffs on counts that alleged full performance of the building contract upon which the actions were brought;, because the auditor found substantial performance and waiver of full performance rather than full performance. After recommittal, a count was added to each declaration on a quantum meruit, and judgments for the plaintiffs were ordered on that count, under the rule stated in <em>Andre </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>305 Mass. 515, and <em>Russo </em>v. <em>Charles I. Hosmer, Inc., ante, </em>231. The defendants appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\">In the work the variations from the contract were small. They did not prevent the contract from being substantially performed. Good faith on the part of the plaintiffs was found.
