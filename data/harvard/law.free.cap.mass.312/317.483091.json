All the directors of the defendant joined in employing the plaintiff\u2019s intestate as a broker in the matter. The terms of a lease to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate\u2019s customer, Interstate Theatres Corporation, were agreed to by the defendant. The term of the lease was to be ten years, with an option to the lessee for five years more. The rent was to be $12,000 a year, and the lessee was to deposit $16,000 in cash as security for performance of the terms of the lease. The proposed lessee was ready, able and willing to take the lease upon these terms. Later the defendant refused to lease to Interstate Theatres Corporation, but leased the theatre to one Laches upon terms no more favorable to the defendant than those of the proposed lease to Interstate Theatres Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\">Upon the evidence it could have been found that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate did all that was necessary to earn a commission. Ordinarily a broker earns a commission when he procures a customer able, ready and willing to meet the owner\u2019s terms. <em>John T.
