The constitutional requirements for the passage of a law by the initiative process are fixed by art. 48 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth, The Initiative, II, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4; V, \u00a7 1; General Provisions, III. These requirements are stated in outline in <em>Compton </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Commission, </em>311 Mass. 643, 645-646. The only question with respect to compliance with these constitutional requirements involved in the present case is whether the initiative petition had been signed by the required number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>of qualified voters \u2014 \u201cnot less than twenty thousand\u201d \u2014 when it was filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth and by him transmitted to the clerk of the House of Representatives so that the proposed law was then \u201cdeemed to be introduced and pending.\u201d The Initiative, II, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4; V, \u00a7 1. No contention is made that if the initiative petition was so signed by the required number of voters the proposed law should not be submitted to the people at the State election, nor, on the other hand, is it contended that if the initiative petition was not so signed the proposed law should be submitted to the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\">The present proceeding is a petition for a writ of certiorari (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 249, \u00a7 4) brought in the Supreme Judicial Court by ten citizens and registered voters of the Commonwealth \u2014 constituting the first ten signers of the petition \u2014 against the commissioners constituting the State ballot law commission \u2014 hereinafter referred to as the commission\u2014 for the purpose of quashing the proceedings before the commission in which it decided that it \u201crejects the petition, and the same shall not appear on the official ballot.\u201d See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, as appearing in St. 1938, c. 192.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The commissioners filed a return to the petition embodying therein the original decision of the commission and also a \u201csupplementary statement\u201d of the commission. And the Attorney General in behalf of the commissioners filed a demurrer to the petition in which the reason for demurrer stated was \u201cthat the petition and return do not set forth any cause or matter whatsoever entitling the petitioners to relief by way of a writ of certiorari against the respondents.\u201d The case was heard by a single justice of this court. As appears from the bill of exceptions, he \u201csustained the demurrer and ruled as a matter of law that the petition be dismissed,\u201d and the petitioners \u201cduly excepted to the ruling sustaining the demurrer and to the ruling as a matter of law that the petition should be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">First. Procedure. No contention is made that a peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>tian for a writ of certiorari is not an appropriate proceeding to review the action of the commission, or that the petitioners are not proper parties to institute the proceeding. See <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Lexington, </em>122 Mass. 290; <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>269 Mass. 503, 508-509; <em>Compton </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Commission, </em>311 Mass. 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\">The case was heard by the single justice, in accordance with the usual practice, upon the petition and the return of the commissioners thereto <em>(Farmington River Water Power Co. </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>112 Mass. 206, 214; <em>Tewksbury </em>v. <em>County Commissioners of Middlesex, </em>117 Mass. 563, 564; <em>Worcester &amp; Nashua Railroad </em>v. <em>Railroad Commissioners, </em>118 Mass. 561, 563-564; <em>Haven </em>v. <em>County Commissioners of Essex, </em>155 Mass. 467, 468; <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Street Commissioners of Boston, </em>183 Mass. 119, 120; <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, </em>295 Mass. 572, 573), except that, as has been said to be permissible practice <em>(Selectmen of Wakefield </em>v. <em>Judge of the First District Court of Eastern Middlesex, </em>262 Mass. 477, 481; <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, </em>295 Mass. 572, 573; see also <em>Worcester &amp; Nashua Railroad </em>v. <em>Railroad Commissioners, </em>118 Mass. 561, 564; <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Brighton District, </em>298 Mass. 158, 159), a demurrer of the commissioners was filed with the return. We do not discuss the function, in general, of a demurrer in a certiorari proceeding, but since the ground of this demurrer is \u201cthat the petition and return do not set forth any cause or matter whatsoever entitling the petitioners to relief,\u201d such demurrer raised no question of law not presented for decision by the petition and the return thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The \u201caccurate statement of the force and effect of the return of respondents in a petition for a writ of certiorari is that it is \u2018 conclusive as to all matters of fact, within their jurisdiction, passed upon by them.\u2019 <em>Tewksbury </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>117 Mass. 563, 565.\u201d <em>Marcus </em>v. <em>Street Commissioners of Boston, </em>252 Mass. 331, 333. See also <em>Compton </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Commission, </em>311 Mass. 643, 646. This statement, however, necessarily implies that \u201ca petitioner may attack the jurisdiction of the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ferior tribunal and may, if necessary, introduce evidence in support of his contention.\u201d <em>Marcus </em>v. <em>Street Commissioners of Boston, </em>252 Mass. 331, 333. The petitioners in the present case attack the jurisdiction of the commission to make the decision challenged by them, but the burden rested upon them \u201cto prove by evidence outside the record, if necessary, that the respondents were without jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Weymouth, </em>279 Mass. 486, 490. The bill of exceptions, however, does not disclose that any such evidence was introduced at the hearing before the single justice. Evidence outside the record of a proceeding under review may also be received in the trial court to controvert statements of extrinsic facts in the return relied on to show that substantial justice does not require the granting of relief. <em>Tewksbury </em>v. <em>County Commissioners of Middlesex, </em>117 Mass. 563, 566. <em>By field </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>247 Mass. 46, 53-54. <em>Selectmen of Wakefield </em>v. <em>Judge of the First District Court of Eastern Middlesex, </em>262 Mass. 477, 481. But the return in the present case contains no such statement, and the record does not disclose that any such evidence was introduced at the hearing before the single justice. (Moreover, such evidence, if introduced, would relate to a matter of discretion. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Newton, </em>181 Mass. 432, 433.) So far, therefore, as appears from the bill of exceptions, there was no evidence in the case that in any respect tended to controvert the facts stated in the return of the commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\">The petitioners, however, rely upon certain allegations of fact in their petition on the theory that, so far as these allegations are not inconsistent with the return of the commissioners, they are admitted by the commissioners by their demurrer, if not otherwise. There were no allegations of fact in the petition bearing upon the jurisdiction of the commission unless this effect is to be attributed to the allegation therein that the objections to the initiative petition filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth and by bim referred to the commission were \u201con the grounds that the signatures appearing thereon were invalid under the provisions of Article 48 of the amendments to the Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>stitution and of Sections 7, 22A and 22B of Chapter 53, G. L. (Ter. Ed.).\u201d Even if it is assumed in favor of the petitioners, in any aspect of the case, that this allegation, though not proved by evidence, is to be regarded as true and that any of the grounds of the objection therein stated are beyond the scope of the jurisdiction of the commission \u2014 matters upon which no opinion is here intimated \u2014 the inclusion of such grounds in the objections is not fatal to the jurisdiction of the commission upon grounds stated in such objections and acted upon by the commission that are within the scope of such jurisdiction. The other allegations of the petition relied on by the petitioners relate to the proceeding before the commission and are allegations with respect to the state of the evidence before the commission at the public hearings upon the objections to the initiative petition, to rulings of law alleged to have been made by the commission at such public hearings, and to requests by the petitioners that certain specific findings be incorporated in the record of the commission. Upon a hearing upon the petition and the return such allegations must be disregarded. <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Mayor of Taunton, </em>200 Mass. 252, 260. <em>Prusik </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>262 Mass. 451, 453. <em>Newcomb </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Holyoke, </em>271 Mass. 565, 567. <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>District Court of Springfield, </em>297 Mass. 472, 478. In the light of these decisions the statement by the court in <em>Weed </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Boston, </em>172 Mass. 28, seeming to furnish some support for the petitioners\u2019 contention \u2014 however correct it may have been with respect to the state of the pleadings and the particular facts alleged in the petition in that case \u2014 is not applicable to the present case heard upon the petition and the return. And the demurrer purporting to be based upon the petition and the return does not change the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\">The remedy of the petitioners, if they deemed the return of the commissioners insufficient by reason of the omission of facts alleged in the petition, was to move for an amendment or extension of the return. <em>Tileston </em>v. <em>Street Commissioners of Boston, </em>182 Mass. 325, 327. <em>Swan </em>v. <em>Justices of the Superior Court, </em>222 Mass. 542, 546. <em>Newcomb </em>v. <em>Alder</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>men of Holyoke, </em>271 Mass. 565, 568. The record in the present case does not disclose that any such specific motion was made by the petitioners or passed upon by the single justice. There is, however, in the petition a prayer for the extension of the record. But even if, as we do not intimate, the disposition of the case by the single justice is to be considered as a denial of this prayer within the scope of the petitioners\u2019 exceptions, no error of law is shown. <em>Marinelli </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>275 Mass. 169, 173-174. <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Weymouth, </em>279 Mass. 486, 488. The return cannot be amended or extended by allegations in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\">The question for decision upon the petitioners\u2019 exceptions is whether there is error of law, including \u201cexcesses of jurisdiction,\u201d apparent on the record of the proceeding of the commission as set forth in the return of the commissioners to the petition. See <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Lexington, </em>122 Mass. 290; <em>Old Colony Railroad </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>147 Mass. 455, 462; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Newton, </em>181 Mass. 432, 433; <em>Marcus </em>v. <em>Street Commissioners of Boston, </em>252 Mass. 331, 333-334; <em>Newcomb </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Holyoke, </em>271 Mass. 565, 567, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Second. Merits. The jurisdiction, if any, of the commission to make the decision challenged by the petitioners rested upon G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, which is as follows: \u201cThe provisions of law relative to the signing of nomination papers of candidates for state office, and to the identification and certification of names thereon and submission to the registrars therefor, shall apply, so far as apt, to the signing of initiative and referendum petitions and to the identification and certification of names thereon, and, except as otherwise provided, to the time of their submission to the registrars. Registrars shall receipt in writing for each initiative or referendum petition submitted to and received by them, and shall deliver such petitions only on receiving written receipts therefor. Objections that signatures appearing on an initiative or referendum petition have been forged or placed thereon by fraud and that in consequence thereof the petition has not been signed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>a sufficient number of qualified voters actually supporting such petition, as required by the constitution, may be filed with the state secretary not later than the sixtieth day prior to the election at which the measure therein proposed or the law which is the subject of the petition is to be submitted to the voters, except that, if a referendum petition is lawfully filed after the sixty-third day prior to said election, such objections may be filed not later than seventy-two week day hours succeeding five o\u2019clock of the day on which such petition is so filed. If upon hearing or otherwise it appears to the state secretary that there is substantial evidence supporting such objections, he shall refer the same to the state ballot law commission, which shall investigate the same, and for such purpose may exercise all the powers conferred upon it relative to objections to nominations for state offices, and if it shall appear to said commission that the objections have been sustained it shall forthwith reject the petition as not in conformity with the constitution and shall notify the state secretary of its action.\u201d A related statute, inserted in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53 as \u00a7 22B by St. 1938, c. 191 j provides that \u201cEach initiative or referendum petition filed with the state secretary shall contain a statement, signed under the penalties of perjury by the person who circulated the petition, that each person whose name appears on said petition signed the same in person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\">Significant parts of the return of the commissioners to the petition are the following: \u201cThere were transmitted to the respondents under the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, by the Secretary of the Commonwealth, objections filed with him to the proposed measure, the same being an initiative petition, under the provisions of Art. XLVIII of the Amendments to the Constitution as set forth in the petition for the writ of certiorari. . . . The initiative petition purported to be signed by 24,192 persons. The Commission found upon the evidence introduced at the hearings that of that number more than 5,000 signatures of purported signers were forged or placed on the petition by fraud. That this left less than 20,000 signers on the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>tian, the amount necessary to cause the same to go on the ballot under the provisions of Art. XLVIII of the Amendments.\u201d The original decision filed by the commission, set out in the return, contained the following: \u201cObjections that signatures appearing on said petition were forged or placed thereon by fraud having been sustained, the Commission finds that in consequence thereof the petition has not been signed by a sufficient number of qualified voters actually supporting such petition as required by the Constitution. The Commission, therefore rejects the petition, and the same shall not appear on the official ballot.\u201d And the supplementary statement, also set out in the return, contained the following: \u201cWhile the Commission would have rejected the petition on its findings as to the violations of chapter'53, section 22B, it also found a more serious situation, namely, that the petition contained more than 5,000 invalid signatures of purported signers. The Commission found that these invalid signatures were forged or were placed on the petition by fraud. The petition was, therefore, rejected.\u201d Further statements in the return are referred to hereafter in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\">The petitioners contend (a) that the portion of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, under which the commission purported to act, particularly the portion thereof with respect to fraud, is unconstitutional on its face; (b) that even if this portion of the section is not unconstitutional on its face, the action of the commission thereunder in the present case was unconstitutional; and (c) that even if the portion of the section under which the commission purported to act is constitutional on its face and the commission acted in a constitutional manner in the present case, \u201cits conclusion that the petition should be rejected because of the presence thereon of signatures which had been placed thereon by fraud was erroneous, and its order rejecting the petition on that ground is null and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">A. The contention of the petitioners that the portion of said \u00a7 22A of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53 under which the commission purported to act is unconstitutional on its face is based on three distinct grounds: (a) that the requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>of due process are not satisfied by the section because it does not provide as matter of right for notice and an opportunity to be heard; (b) that these requirements are not satisfied because there is no provision as matter of right for appeal or judicial review of the action of the commission; and (c) that the portion of said \u00a7 22A under which the commission purported to act with respect to fraud is unconstitutional because beyond the power granted to the Legislature by art. 48 of the Amendments to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\">The statute in question was before this court in the recent case of <em>Compton </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Commission, </em>311 Mass. 643, but its constitutionality was not therein attacked nor considered by the court. In dealing with the question of the constitutionality of this statute, the long established principle is to be applied that \u201cAll rational presumptions are made in favor of the validity of every act of the legislative department of government, and the court will not refuse to enforce it unless its conflict with the Constitution is established beyond reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Westwood, </em>226 Mass. 268, 271, and cases cited. <em>Lowell Co-operative Bank </em>v. <em>Co-operative Central Bank, </em>287 Mass. 338, 343-344. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Election Commissioners of Cambridge, </em>309 Mass. 303, 311-312.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">1. General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, does not in express terms require notice of objections to an initiative petition referred to the commission and opportunity to be heard thereon before the commission. The decision of the commission, however, cannot be struck down on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The reason for holding statutes unconstitutional for failure to provide therein for notice and opportunity to be heard is that by proceedings thereunder persons are \u201cdeprived of life, liberty or property\u201d in contravention of the Constitution of the Commonwealth and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. <em>Pizer </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>253 Mass. 321, 332. <em>Reale </em>v. <em>Judges of the Superior Court, </em>265 Mass. 135, 141. The rights protected by the constitutional guaranties are private rights. This was true in the cases relied on by the petitioners on this branch of the case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>See <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>McGirr, </em>1 Gray, 1, 39-40; <em>Pizer </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>253 Mass. 321, 332; <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Armour Fertilizer Works, </em>237 U. S. 413, 424-425, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\">The ultimate question for decision by the commission according to the terms of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, however, relates to a public right and not to private rights. This question is whether, for the reasons set forth in the section, the \u201cpetition has not been signed by a sufficient number of qualified voters actually supporting such petition, as required by the constitution,\u201d so that the petition should be rejected as not in conformity with the Constitution and, consequently, the law proposed thereby should not be submitted to the people at the State election. This is a matter in which all qualified voters of the Commonwealth, whether or not they signed the initiative petition, have an interest as a part of the public but no private right or interest. This conclusion is in accord with the language and decision in <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>257 Mass. 91. In that case citizens and voters of the Commonwealth brought a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the Secretary of the Commonwealth to omit from the ballot for the next State election a law proposed under the initiative procedure. The court held that the \u201cpetitioners as citizens and voters have standing to maintain this petition.\u201d Page 92. The court quoted from the opinion in <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>195 Mass. 222, 224, the following statement of the general rule: \u201cWhen the question is one of public right and the object of the mandamus is to procure the enforcement of a public duty, the people are regarded as the real party in interest, and the relator at whose instigation the proceedings are instituted need not show that he has any legal or special interest in the result, it being sufficient to show that he is a citizen and as such interested in the execution of the laws.\u201d The court also quoted from the opinion in the <em>Brewster </em>case the statement in <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>123 Mass. 460, 479, that \u201cThere is,a great weight of American authority in favor of the doctrine that any private person may move, without the intervention of the attorney general, for a writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>of mandamus to enforce a public duty not due to the government as such.\u201d Page 93. Numerous cases were cited in which this general rule had been affirmed and applied. The court in <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth </em>concluded its discussion of this branch of the case by saying: \u201cThe case at bar falls within the rule of <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Sherman </em>.... The present petitioners seek the enforcement of public duty by an officer with respect to a public right in which the voters at large have an interest.\u201d Page 94. The principle declared in the <em>Brooks </em>case with respect to persons instituting proceedings relating to initiative and referendum petitions has been followed in practice in later cases, irrespective of whether the petitioners were signers of the initiative petition. See <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>269 Mass. 503; <em>Yont </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>275 Mass. 365; <em>Christian </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>283 Mass. 98; <em>Mount Washington </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>288 Mass. 67; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>306 Mass. 296; <em>Compton </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Commission, </em>311 Mass. 643. See also <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>299 Mass. 191; <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>299 Mass. 205. Compare <em>McGlue </em>v. <em>County Commissioners of Essex, 225 </em>Mass. 59. And the right of the petitioners to bring the present petition rests upon this principle unless \u2014 a matter herein later referred to \u2014 it can be rested upon the ground of \u201csubstantial injury or manifest injustice\u201d to the petitioners in their private rights. See <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>District Court of Springfield, </em>297 Mass. 472, 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\">The initiative process for the passage of a law is in many respects analogous to the election process for the election of State officers. By express provisions of art. 48 the proposed law is to be placed upon the ballot for the State election in a particular manner. The Initiative, V, \u00a7 1; General Provisions, III. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>294 Mass. 610; 309 Mass. 631. Thereafter the usual proceedings of the election process are followed. The method by which the initiative process originates, though prescribed in considerable detail by constitutional provisions (The Initiative, II, \u00a7 3), is somewhat analogous to the method of nominating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>candidates for State offices, and the analogy was recognized in the constitutional provisions for identification and certification of signatures. General Provisions, I. Although the Constitution fixes the qualifications of voters (art. 3, as amended, and art. 30 of the Amendments), \u201cthe right to vote is a sacred privilege\u201d and every \u201crational intendment is to be made in favor of its rightful exercise,\u201d yet \u201cthe Legislature is clothed with power to enact appropriate laws to regulate the orderly conduct of elections and to facilitate the counting of votes.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Election Commissioners of Boston, 257 </em>Mass. 332, 338. See also <em>Capen </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>12 Pick. 485, 493; <em>Miner </em>v. <em>Olin, </em>159 Mass. 487; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>164 Mass. 486, 487-489; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>181 Mass. 184, 186-187; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>247 Mass. 583, 586-588; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Election Commissioners of Cambridge, </em>309 Mass. 303, 324. To what extent the Legislature has power under the general grant of legislative power to legislate with respect to the initiative process need not be considered, for art. 48, though providing that it is \u201cself-executing,\u201d provides further that \u201clegislation not inconsistent with anything herein contained may be enacted to facilitate the operation of its provisions.\u201d General Provisions, VII. This is a recognition or grant of a legislative power similar in nature, when not inconsistent with art. 48, to the legislative power with respect to elections described in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Election Commissioners of Boston, 257 </em>Mass. 332, 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\">Article 48 and statutes passed under the authority thereof impose the duty of enforcing the provisions of said article \u2014 subject to review by the courts in appropriate proceedings \u2014 upon administrative officers, particularly upon the Secretary of the Commonwealth and the State ballot law commission. The duty of enforcing the provisions of art. 48 is a \u201cpublic duty . . . with respect to a public right in which the voters at large have an interest.\u201d <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, 257 </em>Mass. 91, 94. In performing this duty the respective administrative officers, acting within the scope of the authority conferred upon them, represent the public at large including all qualified voters. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banks in re Prudential Trust Co. </em>240 Mass. 244, 252. With respect to a somewhat similar situation it was said in <em>Bi-Metallic Investment Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Equalization of Colorado, </em>239 U. S. 441, 445, that where \u201ca rule of conduct applies to more than a few people it is impracticable that every one should have a direct voice in its adoption.\u201d The court was there considering an order of certain State boards increasing the valuation of all taxable property in one of the cities of the State, and it was assumed that the proper State machinery had been used. The court stated the question to be \u201c whether all individuals have a constitutional right to be heard before a matter can be decided in which all are equally concerned,\u201d and answered this question as applied to the particular case in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\">The duty of the Secretary is primarily, though not exclusively, of a ministerial nature to be performed upon the basis of documents filed with him. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A; <em>Compton </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Commission, </em>311 Mass. 643, 659. Compare <em>Hitchcock </em>v. <em>Examiners for Hampshire County, </em>301 Mass. 170, 172-173. The duty of the State ballot law .commission, however, is not purely ministerial. Its duty is to \u201cinvestigate\u201d objections to signatures appearing on an initiative petition in certain respects for the purpose of determining the ultimate question whether the petition fails to bear a sufficient number of signatures of qualified voters, as required by the Constitution, for the law proposed thereby to be submitted to the people. The performance of this duty may and ordinarily does require the determination of facts apart from documents filed with or referred to the commission. In the performance of this duty the commission, under the authority conferred by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, \u201cmay exercise all the powers conferred upon it relative to objections to nominations for state offices,\u201d and, under its general powers, \u201cmay summon witnesses, administer oaths, and require the production of books and papers at a hearing before it upon any matter within its jurisdiction.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 6, \u00a7 32 (see St. 1937, c. 227; St. 1938, c. 473, \u00a7 1). The duty of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>commission in some aspects at least may be described as quasi judicial since it involves a determination of facts. But while doubtless it was contemplated by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, that the investigation by the commission thereby authorized might be made through the medium of a hearing, though a hearing is not required in express terms, it is unnecessary for the purposes of this case to determine whether the scope of the statutory investigation is so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\">Neither the nature of the issue to be decided by the commission nor the fact that the decision of this issue involves a determination of facts imports that a person having no private right or interest beyond that of the public at large or qualified voters of the Commonwealth generally has a constitutional right to notice and opportunity to be heard in the proceeding before the commission. Such notice to, and opportunity to be heard for, all the qualified voters of the Commonwealth obviously would be impracticable. <em>Bi-Metallic Investment Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Equalization of Colorado, </em>239 U. S. 441, 445. A requirement of such notice and opportunity to be heard wo\u00fald not \u201cfacilitate the operation\u201d of the provisions of art. 48. General Provisions, VII. On the contrary, it would tend to hamper such operation. And there is no such constitutional requirement \u2014 as in proceedings where private rights are involved \u2014 for the protection of the public right involved in the proceeding before the commission. What was said in <em>National Licorice Co. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>309 U. S. 350, 363, though with respect to a materially different proceeding, applies to a proceeding before the commission such as is here in question: \u201cIn a proceeding so narrowly restricted to the protection and enforcement of public rights, there is little scope or need for the traditional rules governing the joinder of parties in litigation determining private rights.\u201d This principle is in conformity with the principle of general application that \u2014 apart from express statutory provisions (see <em>Barrows </em>v. <em>Farnum\u2019s Stage Lines, Inc. </em>254 Mass. 240, 243) \u2014 persons are not entitled \u201cto litigate matters in which they have no interest affecting their liberty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>rights or property.\u201d <em>Hogarth-Swann </em>v. <em>Weed, </em>274 Mass. 125, 132-133, and cases cited. And this is true even where the constitutionality of a statute is involved. \u201cOnly those directly affected as to some personal interest by the operation of a statute can question its validity.\u201d <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>269 Mass. 503, 514. See also <em>McGlue </em>v. <em>County Commissioners of Essex, </em>225 Mass. 59, 60, and cases cited; <em>Mullholland </em>v. <em>State Racing Commission, </em>295 Mass. 286, 290-291. We think it clear that G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, is not unconstitutional by reason of the failure to provide therein for notice to all qualified voters of the Commonwealth of proceedings before the commission with an opportunity for them to be heard before the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\">Very likely the petitioners\u2019 contention does not go to the extent that all qualified voters of the Commonwealth have a constitutional right to notice and opportunity to be heard. But the extent of their contention is not wholly clear. It may be their contention that the petitioners in the present case have such a constitutional right or that all the signers of the initiative petition have such a constitutional right. The present petitioners, however, have no such constitutional right beyond that of other signers of the petition. It appears to be uncontroverted not only that the petitioners in the present case are citizens and voters of the Commonwealth, but also that they were \u201cthe first ten signers\u201d of the initiative petition. Such signers perform a special function with respect to originating the initiative petition and have special powers with respect to amending the law proposed thereby. The Initiative, II, \u00a7 3; V, \u00a7 2. But in other particulars they are in no different position from that of other signers of the initiative petition. The petition signed by \u201cthe first ten signers\u201d is the same petition as that signed by other qualified voters. <em>Mount Washington </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>288 Mass. 67, 70. The \u201cfirst ten signers\u201d have no private right or interest beyond that of other signers of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">There is the same objection on the ground of impracticability \u2014 though less in degree \u2014 to requiring notice of the proceeding before the commission to all signers of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>initiative petition as to requiring such notice to all qualified voters. As is more fundamental, however, the signers of the initiative petition do not by signing it acquire any private right to have the law proposed by such petition submitted to the people distinct from the public right that the law with respect to such submission be enforced. Although such signers are advocates of the proposed law, their interest in the enforcement of the law with respect to such submission, though from a different point of view, is of the same nature as the interest of all other qualified voters, even including those who are indifferent or opposed to the proposed law. Qualified voters who are opposed thereto have the same standing to bring appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the laws with respect to the submission of the proposed law to the people as have qualified voters advocating the proposed law or signing the initiative petition by which it is proposed. See <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>257 Mass. 91; <em>Christian </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>283 Mass. 98; <em>Compton </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Commission, </em>311 Mass. 643. In each instance such standing is based upon the right of a citizen to bring a proceeding \u201cwith respect to a public right in which the voters at large have an interest.\u201d <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>257 Mass. 91, 94. In neither instance is the standing to bring the proceeding based upon a private right constitutionally protected. A signer of an initiative petition has not a standing such as that of a candidate for election who has a special interest in the result of the election process (see <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Election Commissioners of Boston, </em>257 Mass. 332), though we need not consider to what extent his interest in proceedings under the election process is within the protection of constitutional provisions. See <em>Ashley </em>v. <em>Three Justices of the Superior Court, </em>228 Mass. 63, 72, 73. The position of a signer of an initiative petition is more nearly analogous to that of a voter signing a nomination paper for an election or voting at an election. His constitutional right is to exercise his privilege as a voter in accordance with reasonable regulations with respect to casting his vote and having it counted. But a voter, as such, has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>private right in the result of an election beyond the right of all other voters entitled to vote at such election. Compare <em>Sevigny </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>260 Mass. 294. Where proceedings can be brought by voters to determine the result of an election it is by virtue of statutory authority and not by reason of any private right in such voter distinct from the public right. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. <em>55, </em>\u00a7 37; <em>Ashley </em>v. <em>Three Justices of the Superior Court, </em>228 Mass. 63. We conclude, therefore, that signers of an initiative petition, as such, have no private right in the questions to be determined by the commission under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, and, consequently, that the failure'of the section to provide for notice to such signers of the proceeding before the commission, and an opportunity for them to be heard before the commission on such questions, does not render the section unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\">No question is raised on the record of this case of the impairment of the private rights of those signers of the initiative petition whose signatures were found by the commission to have been \u201cforged or placed thereon by fraud,\u201d as distinguished from the rights of the signers of the initiative petition generally. The record does not disclose that any of the petitioners was within this class of signers, and the petitioners have no standing to raise the question that G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, is unconstitutional on the ground that it impairs the private rights of signers who are within this class. To any such special grievance of other signers of the petition the petitioners are strangers. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>269 Mass. 503, 513-514.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">In view of the conclusion here reached with respect to notice and opportunity to be heard it is unnecessary to consider other contentions relating to the subject in support of the constitutionality of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, or of the constitutionality of the action of the commission here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">2. The contention of the petitioners that the portion of \u00a7 22A of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53 under which the commission purported to act is unconstitutional on the ground that the constitutional requirements of due process are not satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>by the section, because there is no provision as matter of right for appeal or judicial review of action of the commission, fails on the same ground as that already discussed with respect to the lack in the section of a requirement for notice and opportunity to be heard \u2014 that the proceeding before the commission, so far as any question with respect thereto is involved in the present case, relates to a public right and not to private rights. Nevertheless, as already pointed out, a remedy appropriate for the enforcement of a public right is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\">3. The third contention of the petitioners to the effect that G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, is unconstitutional relates solely to the portion thereof under which the commission purported to act with respect to fraud. This portion of the section purports to confer upon the commission the power to determine whether signatures appearing on an initiative petition were \u201cplaced thereon by fraud.\u201d The petitioners urge that this portion of the section is beyond the scope of the power granted to the Legislature by art. 48. This contention cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Article 48 provides specifically that provision \u201cshall be made by law for the proper identification and certification of signatures\u201d to initiative and referendum petitions, as well as \u201cfor penalties for signing any such petition, or refusing to sign it, for money or other valuable consideration, and for the forgery of signatures thereto.\u201d The article provides further that the \u201cgeneral court may provide by law that no co-partnership or corporation shall undertake for hire or reward to circulate petitions, may require individuals who circulate petitions for hire or reward to be licensed, and may make other reasonable regulations to prevent abuses arising from the circulation of petitions for hire or reward.\u201d General Provisions, I. But art. 48 also provides that, though it \u201cis self-executing,\u201d \u201clegislation not inconsistent with anything herein contained may be enacted to facilitate the operation of its provisions.\u201d General Provisions, VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Clearly the phrase \u201cproper identification and certification of signatures\u201d in art. 48, General Provisions, I, includes a determination whether the names signed to a petition are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the names of qualified voters of the Commonwealth \u2014 a subject considered in <em>Compton </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Commission, </em>311 Mass. 643 \u2014 and a determination whether the signatures to a petition are, in fact, the signatures of the persons whose signatures they purport to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\">\u25a0 We do not pause to consider whether the phrase \u201cproper identification and certification of signatures\u201d includes also a determination whether signatures upon an initiative petition have been \u201cplaced thereon by fraud\u201d \u2014 although we intimate no opinion to the contrary <em>(Compton </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Commission, </em>311 Mass. 643, 656)\u2014for we are of opinion that legislation directed to a determination of this fact is legislation \u201cto facilitate the operation\u201d of the provisions of art. 48. General Provisions, VII. Reasonable legislation \u201cto regulate the orderly conduct of elections and to facilitate the counting of votes\u201d is within the general grant of legislative power. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Election Commissioners of Boston, 257 </em>Mass. 332, 338. So also is reasonable legislation to insure the purity of elections. <em>Ashley </em>v. <em>Three Justices of the Superior Court, </em>228 Mass. 63. In the latter case it was said: \u201cThe purity and freedom of elections is fundamental in a republican form of government. Scarcely anything can be conceived of more vital to the public welfare than free and honest elections.\u201d Page 74. Obviously there is like necessity for purity in the initiative process. Article 48, I, defines the \u201cpopular initiative\u201d as \u201cthe power of a specified number of voters to submit constitutional amendments and laws to the people for approval or rejection.\u201d Legislation reasonably calculated to insure that the submission of such constitutional amendments and laws to the people shall not be accomplished by means of signatures, \u201cplaced\u201d upon an initiative petition \u201cby fraud,\u201d that do not represent the intention of qualified voters entitled to sign such a petition expressed in a legal manner, is legislation \u201cto facilitate the operation\u201d of the provisions of art. 48 within the natural meaning of those words. (By what is here said we do not attempt to define the scope of the words \u201cplaced thereon by fraud\u201d in G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 53, \u00a7 22A. See <em>Compton </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Commission, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>311 Mass. 643, 656.) We cannot accede to the apparent suggestion of the petitioners that only legislation that makes easy the submission of a proposed law to the people facilitates the operation of the provisions of art. 48. The operation of those provisions includes also the nonsubmission of a proposed law to the people if the constitutional requirements for such submission are not met. Legislation directed to this end is legislation \u201cto facilitate the operation\u201d of the provisions of art. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\">Moreover, if legislation is calculated to \u201cfacilitate the operation\u201d of the provisions of art. 48, such legislation is precluded only if it is \u201cinconsistent with anything\u201d contained in said article. The provision in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, with respect to signatures \u201cplaced\u201d upon an initiative petition \u201cby fraud\u201d is not \u201cinconsistent with anything\u201d contained in art. 48. The fact that certain subjects with respect to initiative petitions are dealt with specifically in art. 48, General Provisions, I, does not imply that related subjects may not be dealt with under the authority to legislate \u201cto facilitate the operation\u201d of the provisions of art. 48 so long as there is no actual inconsistency between such legislation and the provisions of art. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">B. The contention of the petitioners, that even if the portion of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, under which the commission purported to act is not unconstitutional on its face \u25a0\u2014\u25a0 as we hold \u2014\u25a0 the action of the commission thereunder in the present case was unconstitutional, cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">This contention that the action of the commission was unconstitutional rests upon the ground \u2014 of like nature to the ground already considered in connection with the contention that the portion of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, under which the commission purported to act was unconstitutional on its face \u2014 that the action of the commission amounted to a denial of due process of law. But the decisive answer to this contention, like the answer to the similar contention with respect to the unconstitutionality of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, on its face, is that the ultimate question for decision by the commission i\u00f1 th\u00e9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>proceeding before it \u2014 whether the proposed law should be submitted to the people \u2014 related to a public right and not to private rights, and that the constitutional requirements of due process of law are for the protection of private rights and are inapplicable to proceedings involving public rights, so long as such proceedings do not affect private rights. The record does not disclose that any private rights of the petitioners distinct from the interest of all qualified voters, or at least from the interest of all signers of the initiative petition, were involved in the proceeding before the commission or affected by its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\">The petitioners make no contention that they had no actual notice of the proceeding before the commission or opportunity to be heard at such proceeding. Such a contention would be foreclosed by the statement in the return, not controverted by facts appearing in the record of the present case, that the commission, having received from the Secretary of the Commonwealth objections filed with him, \u201cproceeded to conduct an investigation respecting said objections and held public hearings at which the petitioners for said measure and the objectors thereto appeared and were represented by counsel, who were heard and introduced evidence.\u201d The particular objections of the petitioners to the proceeding before the commission are that the findings of the commission were not based solely upon evidence before the commission and that the commission made no findings of fact upon which its ultimate conclusions of fact and law are based.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Even if it be assumed \u2014 as we do not decide \u2014 that for any legal reason the commission was required to base its findings solely on evidence before it, the return of the commissioners \u2014\u25a0 which must be taken as true \u2014 shows that the findings upon which rested the ultimate conclusion of the commission were based solely upon evidence. The return states that the initiative petition \u201cpurported to be signed by 24,192 persons\u201d and that the commission found \u201cupon the evidence introduced at the hearings that of that number more than 5,000 signatures of purported signers were forged or placed on the petition by fraud,\u201d with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>result that there was an insufficient number of signers upon the initiative petition. There are other statements in the return with respect to the proceeding before the commission. The return of the commissioners in the part thereof described as \u201csupplementary statement\u201d refers to the initiative petition in such a manner as to indicate that it was before the commission, and refers to the appearance of some of the witnesses, their manner of testifying and their apparent lack of credibility, and to improper occurrences at the hearing before the commission, and states that with \u201cthis unhealthy background the Commission had to pass on the validity of the petition from evidence presented at the hearing and from facts that the Commission uncovered itself during its own investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\">This statement in the return with respect to the \u201cunhealthy background\u201d does not vitiate the findings of the commission upon the decisive issue of the case. The reference to the \u201cfacts that the Commission uncovered itself during its own investigation\u201d is somewhat ambiguous, but it does not necessarily import that the commission considered anything that was not before it in the nature of evidence proper for its consideration, even if \u2014 as we do not intimate \u2014 it was required to base its findings solely upon evidence. Obviously the commission, within such a limitation, could consider the initiative petition though it was not \u201cpresented at the hearing\u201d by the parties appearing before the commission. It does not appear that this petition was not exhibited to or made available to these parties. The situation shown by the return differs materially from that in <em>American Employers\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Insurance, </em>298 Mass. 161, 166-168, and in <em>Boott Mills </em>v. <em>Board of Conciliation &amp; Arbitration, </em>311 Mass. 223, 226-227. The reference to the commission's \u201cown investigation\u201d cannot override the express statement in the return that the finding of the commission as to the number of signatures forged or placed on the petition by fraud was made upon the evidence introduced at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">The original decision of the commission followed closely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>the language of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, imposing upon the commission the duty to \u201cinvestigate\u201d objections \u201cthat signatures appearing on an initiative . . . petition have been forged or placed thereon by fraud and that in consequence thereof the petition has not been signed by a sufficient number of qualified voters actually supporting such petition, as required by the constitution,\u201d and \u201cif it shall appear to said commission that the objections have been sustained . . . forthwith [to] reject the petition as not in conformity with the constitution.\u201d The original decision of the commission set forth\" in the return states: \u201cObjections that signatures appearing on said petition were forged or placed thereon by fraud having been sustained, the Commission finds that in consequence thereof the petition has not been signed by a sufficient number of qualified voters actually supporting such petition as required by the Constitution\u201d and \u201ctherefore rejects the petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\">The return of the commissioners, however, contains the further statements that the petition \u201cpurported to be signed by 24,192 persons\u201d and that the commission found \u201cthat of that number more than 5,000 signatures of purported signers were forged or placed on the petition by fraud,\u201d thus leaving fewer signatures on the petition than were necessary to cause the proposed law to go on the ballot. The return states also that the commission \u201creceived a request for findings of material facts from counsel representing the original signers of the initiative petition as set forth in the petition for the writ of certiorari . . . [thus incorporating in the return this part of the petition], but took no action thereon and made no findings of fact except such as are embodied in their decisions\u201d set forth in the return. This request apparently was made after the original decision of the commission was filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth. The finding of the commission with respect to the number of purported signatures \u201cforged or 'placed on the petition by fraud\u201d was sufficient in law to support its ultimate conclusion. This finding was a unit. There is no statutory or other legal requirement \u2014 compliance with which was essential to the validity of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>cisi\u00f3n of the commission \u2014 that, even upon the request of a party at the proceeding before the commission or thereafter, this finding with respect to the number of signatures forged or placed upon the petition by fraud be further analyzed. See <em>Tileston </em>v. <em>Street Commissioners of Boston, </em>182 Mass. 325, 327. The return states further that \u201cDuring these hearings the respondents made no rulings of law.\u201d Express rulings were not essential to the validity of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\">A return to a petition for a writ of certiorari brought for the purpose of reviewing a decision on the ground of error of law therein should be sufficient to show the principles of law upon which the decision was based. See <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Zoning Adjustment Board of Boston, </em>255 Mass. 160, 163. But if a return is not deemed sufficient to show these principles, the remedy of the petitioner, as already pointed out, is to obtain an amendment or extension of the return. The return of the commissioners originally filed in the present case has not been amended or extended, and, as already pointed out, no error of law in this respect is disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">C. Apart from objections by the petitioners on constitutional grounds to G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22A, and the action of the commission thereunder, the petitioners contend that the conclusion of the commission that the petition should be rejected because of the presence thereon of signatures that had been placed thereon by fraud was erroneous and that its order rejecting the petition is null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">This contention is based upon an allegation in the petition that at the public hearings before the commission \u201cno evidence was offered by the objectors or received by the . . . [commission] that the signature of any person who signed said initiative petition as a petitioner had been placed on said petition by fraud other than evidence tending to prove that the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) Chapter 53, Section 22B had not been complied with or that the circulators\u2019 certificates in certain instances contained false statements of fact in that not all of the signatures of petitioners to which such certificates applied were affixed in the presence of the circulator who signed the certificate.\u201d There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>is nothing in the return of the commissioners to support the allegation that no such evidence was offered or received, and, as already pointed out, this allegation must be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\">General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 22B, provides that each \u201cinitiative . . . petition filed with the state secretary shall contain a statement, signed under the penalties of perjury by the person who circulated the petition, that each person whose name appears on said petition signed the same in person.\u201d The return of the commissioners in the part thereof described as \u201csupplementary statement\u201d contains various recitals of fact with respect to violations of this section, such as that some of the \u201ccirculators\u201d of the initiative petition here involved knowingly made false and fraudulent statements and that \u201cthere was a large number of circulators whose names were forged to the statement\u201d required by this section. The return states, however, that, while the commission \u201cwould have rejected the petition on its findings as to the violations of chapter 53, section 22B, it also found a more serious situation, namely, that the petition contained more than 5,000 invalid signatures of purported signers. The Commission found that these invalid signatures were forged or were placed on the petition by fraud.\u201d The return is not fairly open to the construction that in making this decisive finding the commission based it upon violations of \u00a7 22B. The return makes a marked distinction between the findings of the commission with respect to such violations and its findings with respect to signatures of voters \u201cforged\u201d or \u201cplaced on the petition by fraud.\u201d It is, therefore, unnecessary to consider whether it would have been within the jurisdiction of the commission under \u00a7 22A to reject an initiative petition by reason of violations of \u00a7 22B.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">It follows from what has been said that no error of law or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the commission in deciding that the initiative petition here involved should be rejected is apparent upon the record of the proceeding of the commission as set forth in the return of the commissioners to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-5\"> Hereinafter, where \u00a7 22A is referred to, that section as appearing in St. 1938, c. 192, is intended.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
