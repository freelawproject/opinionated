Flint, a resident of Massachusetts \u2014 herein referred to as the taxpayer \u25a0\u2014in the year 1934 upon certain shares of stock held by him in the Field and Flint Co. \u2014 herein referred to as the corporation \u2014 was taxable as income under the provisions of the income tax law. See St. 1933, c. 307, \u00a7 9; St. 1935, c. 489, \u00a7 1. If within the meaning of the governing statute this dividend was a \u201cdistribution of capital\u201d it was not taxable, but if it was a distribution of \u201caccumulated profits\u201d it was taxable. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g). The Appellate Tax Board decided that the dividend in question was, in part, a \u201cdistribution of capital\u201d and granted a partial abatement. The taxpayer, however, contends that the entire dividend was such a distribution and that the entire tax upon such dividend should be abated.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">In the recent case of <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Filoon, </em>310 Mass. 374 \u2014 decided after the decision by the Appellate Tax Board in the present case \u2014 G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g), was interpreted and applied to the facts found by the Appellate Tax Board in that case. The decision of the present case depends upon the application of subsection (g) as interpreted in that case to the facts found by the Appellate Tax Board in the present case. The question with respect to the source of the distribution by dividend is to be determined from the standpoint of the corporation making the distribution. Page 377. (a) The word \u201ccapital\u201d as used in subsection (g) \u201cmeans property invested in the corporation by the stockholders\u201d whether representing \u201c \u2018legal capital,\u2019 that is, property sufficient to balance the capital stock liability,\u201d or \u201cpaid in surplus\u201d or \u201ccapital surplus\u201d in any form. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Pages 382-383. (b) The words \u201caccumulated profits\u201d mean \u201cearned surplus\u201d or \u201cundivided profits\u201d of the corporation, and represent \u201cproperty earned by the corporation as distinguished from property invested therein by the shareholders.\u201d Page 385. (c) \u201cSuch \u2018accumulated profits\u2019, necessarily take into account losses as well as gains in the course of operations of the corporation during the period for which its \u2018accumulated profits\u2019 are to be ascertained, that is, the period during which they were accumulated.\u201d Page 386. (d) If at any date losses exceeded prior \u201caccumulated profits\u201d the deficiency in such profits \u2014 that is, the excess of losses over prior \u201caccumulated profits\u201d\u2014 must be made good before the corporation can be said to have \u201caccumulated profits.\u201d Page 390. And it does not follow from the fact that a corporation sustaining losses in excess of its \u201caccumulated profits\u201d or \u201cearned surplus\u201d thereby, in effect, depletes or impairs its \u201ccapital,\u201d in the sense in which that word is used in subsection (g), \u201cthat such losses can no longer properly be considered in determining whether as of a subsequent date the corporation has \u2018accumulated profits\u2019 or \u2018earned surplus.\u2019 \u201d Page 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">According to the findings of the Appellate Tax Board the \u201ccapital\u201d of the corporation within the meaning of said subsection (g), prior to the transactions hereinafter outlined, was $970,700 represented by fully paid capital stock in that amount. The \u201clegal capital\u201d of the corporation and its capital stock liability were, therefore, of this amount. The corporation, however, suffered losses, and the accumulated net losses at the end of the year 1928 amounted to $210,027.60. By reason of the accumulated losses the corporation at the end of that year reduced its capital stock in accordance with statutory provisions to $700,000, a reduction of $270,700. There is no finding that this reduction was accompanied by any return of capital to the shareholders. At the end of the year 1931 a further reduction of capital stock was made in accordance with statutory provisions to $400,000. This reduction of capital stock by the amount of $300,000 was accompanied by a return of capital to the shareholders of $107,100, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>the remaining $192,900 according to the finding of the Appellate Tax Board created a \u201ccapital surplus item, so-called,\u201d of $192,900.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\">At the close of the year 1933 there were accumulated net losses amounting to $222,758.92, and the net worth of the corporation was $594,911.08 \u2014 $194,911.08 in excess of the capital stock liability. During the year 1934 the earnings of the corporation amounted to $26,815.17, and the corporation distributed by dividend to its shareholders $36,075 which includes the amount thereof paid to the taxpayer involved in the present case. At the end of the year 1934 the accumulated net losses of the corporation amounted to $195,943.75, and the net worth of the corporation was $585,651.25 \u2014 $185,651.25 in excess of its capital stock liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The Appellate Tax Board held that, of the dividend amounting to $36,075, $7,248.75 \u2014 the amount by which the \u201ccapital surplus item\u201d resulting from the reduction of capital stock in 1931 was greater than the excess of the net worth of the corporation at the end of the year 1934 over its capital stock liability \u2014 was a distribution of capital not subject to taxation as income of the shareholders, but that the remaining $28,826.25 \u2014 the sum of the increase in surplus from the last reduction of capital stock in 1931 to the end of 1933 ($2,011.08) and the earnings of the corporation in the year 1934 ($26,815.17) \u2014 was not such a distribution and was subject to taxation as income in the hands of the shareholders. The taxpayer contends that this decision is erroneous as matter of law on the facts found and that the entire amount of the dividend was a distribution of capital and, consequently, that no part of this amount was subject to taxation as income.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The ground of the decision of the Appellate Tax Board was that the \u201creduced capital [of the corporation] . . . and any actual surplus resulting from the last readjustment [the reduction of capital stock in 1931] constituted the fund with regard to which earnings and distributions were to be judged.\u201d The Appellate Tax Board in its opinion recognized the principle later laid down by this court in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>Filoon </em>case, already stated in this opinion, that if at any date losses exceeded prior \u201caccumulated profits\u201d the amount of such excess must be made good before the corporation can be said to have \u201caccumulated profits,\u201d but held this principle inapplicable to the present case by reason of the fact that the reductions of the capital stock of the corporation in each instance \u25a0\u2014in 1928 and 1931 \u2014 were made in accordance with applicable statutory provisions. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 156, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 42, 45. The Appellate Tax Board in its opinion in the present case said: \u201cThe corporation and its officers in their relations to the stockholders and the public were to be judged by the reduced amount of the capital, and were under no obligation to provide any greater amount or to restore any former shrinkage. The action taken by the stockholders was an agreement voluntarily entered into, with the approval of the Commonwealth, to carry on the corporate business with a reduced authorized capital of $400,000, and with its prior capital losses wiped out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\">The Appellate Tax Board was in error in ruling that the reductions of capital stock took the case out of the general principle requiring that the excess of losses over prior \u201caccumulated profits\u201d be made good before the corporation could be said to have \u201caccumulated profits\u201d \u2014 subject to income taxation in the hands of the shareholders when distributed \u2014 so that as stated by the Appellate Tax Board the \u201creduced capital\u201d and any \u201cactual surplus\u201d resulting from the reduction of capital stock \u201cconstituted the fund with regard to which earnings and distributions were to be judged\u201d for the purpose of determining whether distributions were out of \u201ccapital\u201d or \u201caccumulated profits\u201d within the meaning of subsection (g). Doubtless the conclusion stated by the Appellate Tax Board is true for some purposes. Such a reduction of capital stock \u2014 not accompanied by a return of property to the shareholders \u2014 has the effect of transforming \u201clegal capital\u201d into \u201ccapital surplus,\u201d and it may well be that the right of the corporation to pay dividends may be affected by such a transformation, though no such question is here involved. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>Smith </em>v. <em>Cotting, </em>231 Mass. 42, 48; <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Filoon, </em>310 Mass. 374, 391. But a distribution by dividends of such \u201ccapital surplus,\u201d sometimes described as \u201creduction surplus,\u201d is a distribution of \u201ccapital\u201d within the meaning of subsection (g), and the principle continues applicable, notwithstanding the reduction of capital stock, that a deficiency in \u201ccapital\u201d \u2014 the \u201cproperty invested in the corporation by the stockholders\u201d \u2014 must be made good before there can be any \u201caccumulated profits.\u201d If this were not true, the shareholders receiving dividends, before the deficiency in \u201caccumulated profits\u201d had been made good, would be receiving, in the guise of \u201caccumulated profits\u201d subject to income taxation, property that had been invested by shareholders in the corporation and not earnings of the corporation representing an increase in the wealth of the corporation. See <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Filoon, </em>310 Mass. 374, 386. The present case with respect to the effect of a reduction of capital stock is governed by the <em>Filoon </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\">It is suggested that the present case is distinguishable from the <em>Filoon </em>case on the ground that in the present case the reductions of capital stock were made in accordance with statutory requirements. Indeed, the Appellate Tax Board in reaching its decision in this case distinguished on this ground its own decision in the <em>Filoon </em>case \u2014 which was in substance affirmed by this court after the decision of the Appellate Tax Board in the present case. But the cases are not to be distinguished on this ground. The record in the <em>Filoon </em>case did not show in express terms either that the reduction of capital stock in that case was made in accordance with statutory requirements or that it was not so made. The record showed merely that \u201cthe par value of the 3,000 shares of common stock was reduced from $100 to $50 per share.\u201d In this state of the record it was to be assumed that the reduction of capital stock was made legally in accordance with statutory authorization, and this court in the <em>Filoon </em>case dealt with this reduction on that assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">On principle, however, a reduction of capital stock in accordance with statutory authorization, when not accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ponied by an actual return of \"capital\u201d to the shareholders, is not in its nature a return of \"capital\u201d to the shareholders. The shareholders, by assenting to a reduction of capital stock, thereby assent to a reduction of \"legal capital,\u201d but do not assent to a reduction of \u201ccapital,\u201d within the meaning of subsection (g), without an actual return of \u201ccapital\u201d to them. And the statutes contemplate that capital stock may be reduced without such a return. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 156, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 45; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>United States Worsted Co. </em>220 Mass. 183, 185. Ordinarily an increase of the capital stock of a corporation imports an increase of the \"capital\u201d of such corporation. See <em>Hood Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Mass. 369, 371; <em>Olympia Theatres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Mass. 374, 377. And this is the effect, under our decisions, of an increase of capital stock accompanied by a stock dividend payable out of \"accumulated profits,\u201d on the theory that such a dividend is a distribution of such profits and a reinvestment of the amount thereof in the corporation, \"constituting not only an increase of the \u2018legal capital\u2019 of the corporation but also an increase of its \u2018capital\u2019 in the sense in which the word is used in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 1, subsection (g).\u201d <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Filoon, </em>310 Mass. 374, 384-385, and cases cited. But an increase of capital stock does not always import an increase of the \u201ccapital\u201d of the corporation. Such an increase of capital stock may be made for the purpose of capitalizing surplus of the corporation. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 156, \u00a7 16. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Mitchell, Woodbury Co. </em>263 Mass. 160, 166. But if such surplus is \"capital surplus,\u201d though the \"legal capital\u201d of the corporation is increased, there is no increase of the \"capital\u201d of the corporation within the meaning of said subsection (g). The \"legal capital\u201d of the corporation by being so increased is thereby brought more nearly into conformity with the \"capital\u201d of the corporation. On the other hand, when the \u201ccapital\u201d of the corporation has been depleted by losses, a reduction of the capital stock of the corporation, without actual return of capital to the shareholders, although it may bring the \u201clegal capital\u201d of the corporation more nearly into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>conformity with the net worth of the corporation, does not reduce its \u201ccapital.\u201d Such a transaction does not, in truth, amount to a return of \u201ccapital\u201d to the shareholders. And it would be an unnatural interpretation of their action in assenting to the reduction of capital stock to regard such assent as amounting to an agreement by them that the reduction of capital stock is to be treated for the purposes of income taxation as a return of \u201ccapital\u201d to them. Yet this would be the substance of the agreement of the shareholders, attributed to them by the Appellate Tax Board, \u201cto carry on the corporate business . . . with its prior capital losses wiped out\u201d if the agreement were to affect the taxability of dividends. We think no agreement of this nature on the part of the shareholders can rightly be implied from their assent to the reduction of capital stock. Consequently, we do not consider the effect upon the taxability of dividends of such an agreement if actually made.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\">It is also suggested that the present case is distinguishable from the <em>Filoon </em>case on the ground that in that case, unlike the present case, the \u201caccumulated net losses\u201d were not accumulated before the reduction of capital stock. But the cases are not to be distinguished on this ground. The record in the <em>Filoon </em>case showed that the capital stock of the corporation there involved was reduced on some date within a period of about three years during which the losses were accumulated. But the record did not show whether any part of these losses was accumulated before the reduction of the capital stock. Since, however, as has already been pointed out, a reduction of capital stock does not have the effect, for the purpose of determining the amount of the \u201ccapital\u201d of the corporation, of wiping out prior accumulated losses, it is immaterial whether the losses are accumulated before or after the reduction of capital stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The Appellate Tax Board in the present case treated one or both of the reductions of capital stock as a \u201creorganization or readjustment, by whatever term it may be designated,\u201d of the corporation. The word \u201creadjustment\u201d has no particular significance. And we are not here concerned with the meaning of \u201creorganization\u201d as used in any spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>cific statute, as for example, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 62, \u00a7 5, subsection (c) as amended, applicable to the income tax on gains from exchanges of shares, or with the question whether for the purpose of any specific statute either of the reductions of capital stock amounted to a reorganization of the corporation. The word \u201creorganization\u201d is sometimes used with reference to a change in the corporate structure falling short of a change in the identity of the corporation. See <em>Ladies\u2019 Collegiate Institute </em>v. <em>French, </em>16 Gray, 196, 201. Neither of the reductions of capital stock here involved resulted in a reorganization of the corporation whereby the identity of the corporation was changed by terminating the existence of the original corporation and bringing into existence a new corporation as of the date of the reduction of capital stock. The situation in this respect is materially different from the situation in <em>Abbot </em>v. <em>Waltham Watch Co. </em>260 Mass. 81. The effect of a change in the corporate structure \u2014 where, as here, there is no change in the identity of the corporation \u2014 upon the taxability of dividends of the corporation depends upon the nature of the change in the corporate structure and not upon the propriety of a characterization of such change as a \u201creorganization\u201d of the corporation. The nature of the changes in corporate structure here involved has already been discussed in this opinion and the conclusion reached \u2014 where there was no return of \u201ccapital\u201d to the shareholders \u2014 that they were not of such a nature as to reduce the \u201ccapital\u201d of the corporation. Since there was no change in the identity of the corporation, the effect upon the taxability of dividends of a change in identity of a corporation need not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\">It follows that the decision of the Appellate Tax Board was based upon an erroneous ruling of law, and the question remains whether the case should be remanded for further findings of fact or should be disposed of on the findings already made. We reach the latter conclusion. No contention is made that the \u201ccapital\u201d of the corporation was reduced so as to render taxable any part of the dividend here in question unless by reason of the reductions of its capital stock here considered. While no other aspect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the case was specifically considered in the findings of the Appellate Tax Board, its general findings \u2014 detailed analysis of which is not required \u2014 necessarily import that there was no such reduction of \u201ccapital\u201d by return of \u201ccapital\u201d to the shareholders that the property of the corporation at the time of the dividend in question to any extent represented \u201caccumulated profits\u201d the distribution of which would constitute a taxable dividend.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\">The tax assessed upon the taxpayer by reason of the dividend in question amounted to $167.74, and this amount with interest of $3.53 has been paid. This entire amount must be abated. And costs are awarded against the commissioner. Provision for repayment to the taxpayer of the amount so abated, that has been paid, with interest thereon at the rate of six per cent per annum from the time when the tax was paid, and costs, if awarded, is made by statutes. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as amended; c. 62, \u00a7 46, as amended. Notwithstanding what was said in <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Tousant, </em>309 Mass. 84, 90, no specific order for such repayment and for payment of interest and costs need be made by the Appellate Tax Board or by this court, since without such an order the statutory provisions require such repayment and payment of interest and costs, if awarded, when abatement is granted. Compare, however, as to local taxes, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 64, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\n<em>Abatement is granted in the amount of $171.27, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
