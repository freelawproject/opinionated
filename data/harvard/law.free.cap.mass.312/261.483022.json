The single justice, on October 6, 1939, found that \u201cthe receiver is not a person subject to the tax . . . because I do not find that the liquidation of the company by him is a continuation of the business formerly conducted by the company; because he has not acquired the legal assets of the company but has only the possession and custody of the same; and because he will not employ during the current year for a period of twenty weeks or more four or more employees in the administration of the receivership.\u201d Accordingly, a final decree was entered dismissing the petition. After an abortive attempt to bring the case here by report <em>(Commissioner of Insurance </em>v. <em>Broad Street Mutual Casualty Ins. Co. </em>306 Mass. 362), the. full court granted leave to claim the appeal that brings the case here. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>The receiver does not contend that the company was. not one subject to the act. Section 1A of c. 151A inserted in the General Laws by St. 1937, c. 421, \u00a7 1, and amended by St. 1938, c. 469, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4. And the petitioner maintains that the receiver is the same employer as the company, and succeeds to its obligations. It is settled, however, in other connections that the company and its receiver are different entities. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Boston, Hartford &amp; Erie Railroad, </em>107 Mass. 1, 28. <em>Fort Payne Coal &amp; Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>163 Mass. 134, 137. <em>Bell </em>v. <em>American Protective League, </em>163 Mass. 558, 562. <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>J. J. Warren Co. </em>183 Mass. 123, 124. We think that the receiver cannot be deemed subject to the act merely because the company was subject to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\">The second question is whether the receiver is within the act because he \u201cacquired the organization, trade or business, or substantially all the assets thereof, of another employer [the company] who at the time of such acquisition was an employer subject to this chapter . . . .\u201d Section 1A (4) of c. 151A, inserted in the General Laws by St. 1937, c. 421, \u00a7 1. The word \u201cacquire\u201d imports ownership, and is not satisfied by the mere custody or control that a receiver has. <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>San Joaquin Fruit &amp; Investment Co. </em>297 U. S. 496, 499. <em>Wulzen </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>101 Cal. 15, 25. <em>In re Okahara, </em>191 Cal. 353, 362. <em>Clarno </em>v. <em>Gamble-Robinson Co. </em>190 Minn. 256, 259. <em>National Surety Co. </em>v. <em>McGreevy, </em>64 Fed. (2d) 899, 901. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary defines the word \u201cacquire\u201d as \u201cto get as one\u2019s own.\u201d The Oxford New English Dictionary defines it as \u201cTo gain, obtain, or get as one\u2019s own, to gain the ownership of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
