Upon trial of her suit against the Southern Bell Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, a jury awarded her $1,400.93. She claims the_ verdict was inadequate After the accident, and against her wishes, appellant was taken to a hospital where, as described by her family physician, she was mostly an angry woman.\u201d This was on September 28, 1961, at Corbin, Kentucky. Her doctor had x-rays taken which, in his view, merely disclosed extensive arthritic degeneration of her vertebrae, with no evidence of any injury resulting from her accident. Mrs. Smith left the hospital after an overnight stay and returned to her apartment in Corbin, Kentucky. She received no medical attention thereafter until two weeks later when her son came for her and took her to Louisville. There, her daughter made an appointment with a doctor who saw Mrs. Smith on October 12, 1961. This doctor saw evidence of a compression fracture of one of her vertebrae, which he attributed to her accident. The only medical assistance prescribed for her was a brace which appellant was still wearing at the time of trial in November, 1962. Her Louisville doctor thought she would have to wear the brace for another six months. A third doctor saw evidence of a compression fracture in her vertebrae, but indicated that it was healed at the time he examined his x-rays.</p>\n<p id=\"A3T\">The plaintiff was unusually active for her age, but stated that she suffered pain in her back. She travels by plane from Louisville to Corbin, Kentucky, where she maintains her own apartment. No one meets her at tlle airport. \u201cI just a ^ax^ ^ce me over X I g0 over adone-</p>\n<p id=\"ALO\">In reply to the question, \u201cMrs. Smith, is there anything that you could do before ^ acddent that you have been un_ aWe to do gince the accidentr she an. swered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Arp\">Her only out-of-pocket loss was a medieal bill of $230.93, $150.00 of which was the fee of the doctor who found evidence of a fracture. Her additional damages, therefore, consisted of pain and suffering. The jury&gt; after finding for piaintiff, awarded her a total of $1,400.93.
