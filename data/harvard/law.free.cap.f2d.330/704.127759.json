At his trial before a judge sitting without a jury he asserted the affirmative defense that he, an unwilling seller, had been entrapped into the two sales of heroin, one for $4100 and one for $1000, that the Government proved he made.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-20\">On all the evidence the trial judge held that the affirmative defense was not proven, a result we find to have been properly reached, and as there is also no merit in appellant\u2019s other contentions, we affirm the conviction in open court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
