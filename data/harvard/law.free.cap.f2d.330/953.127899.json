See Sahn v. Pagano, 2 Cir., 302 F.2d 629, cert. den. 371 U.S. 819, 83 S.Ct. 34, 9 L.Ed.2d 59, for the story of his gross looting of the bankrupt\u2019s estate and his incredible explanation of disposal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>loot. The passage of time will eventually erode the inference of continued control of stolen funds, Maggio v. Zeitz, 333 U.S. 56, 68 S.Ct. 401, 92 L.Ed. 476. But here less than a year has passed, and Pagano has offered no plausible account of what happened to them. The bankruptcy court should not be forced to abandon its coercive efforts as yet. Accordingly motion for bail pending appeal is denied and dismissal of the application for habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
