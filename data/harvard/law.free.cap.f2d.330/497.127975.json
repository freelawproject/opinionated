The uncontested affidavit of debt discloses that the amounts claimed to be due totaled $420,250.05. One of the three cases was commenced 23 years ago; the other two, 18 years ago. We are satisfied that the delay in the obtaining of judgment in the consolidated case was not entirely the fault of the Government; but we cannot refrain from pointing out that, because of interest accumulations, the judgment now obtained is substantially in excess of double the amount of the taxes claimed to have been due and unpaid, and, in affirming the judgment below, we do not wish to imply that we approve this sort of delay. Nevertheless, as we are satisfied that neither the Government nor the taxpayers have been prejudiced, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
