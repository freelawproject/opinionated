At the conclusion of the trial, the court below made findings of fact and conclusions of law, and made an award in favor of libelants. Both sides appealed; respondents in the court below contending here that the court erred as a matter of law in making an excessive award, and libelants contending that the award was inadequate. We have carefully considered the record, the briefs, and oral arguments and conclude that all of the grounds of appeal are without merit. The costs of appeal are taxed against G. B. Zigler Company, the Barge Z-120, and Gulf Oil Corporation, respondents in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-21\">The judgment of the trial court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
