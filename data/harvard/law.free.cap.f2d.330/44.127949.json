The only point raised is the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-22\">Two federal agents testified that arrangements were made with one Wyatt for the purchase of moonshine whiskey; that appellant drove up behind them in a car and gave keys to Wyatt who then drove the car alongside the agents\u2019 car; and that the whiskey was then transferred from the car previously driven by appellant to the agents\u2019 car. Appellant and Wyatt both testified that appellant had not driven the car in which the whiskey was transported. The question presented was one of credibility and the jury chose to believe the agents. Substantial evidence sustains the verdict of the jury and we will not disturb its findings. See Reynolds v. United States, 10 Cir., 289 F.2d 698, 699; Corbin v. United States, 10 Cir., 253 F.2d 646, 648-649.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
