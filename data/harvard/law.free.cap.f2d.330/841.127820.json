His defense was insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-27\">Testimony at the trial tended to prove that appellant was a drug addict who also suffered from a mental disease related to the commission of the offenses by reason of his addiction. But there was also significant testimony that he was not suffering from a mental disease related to the offenses. Thus, the issue of insanity was for the jury to decide. Appellant\u2019s contention that his motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>for acquittal on the ground of insanity-should have been granted must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">On the issue of insanity appellant requested an instruction on irresistible impulse; but the requested instruction was in terms which would have placed this issue before the jury as an independently controlling alternative test of mental responsibility, inconsistent with our decision in McDonald v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 120, 124-125, 312 F.2d 847, 851-852 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Finding no error in the respects above .discussed, or otherwise, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
