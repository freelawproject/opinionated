Ownership in the-two corporations was originally the same \u2014and is still the same to some extent but the corporations, themselves, are not related. Although the Tennessee corporation operates in and around Memphis- and the Louisiana corporation in and around New Orleans, both corporations-have done a substantial amount of business in the area around Jackson, Mississippi. Advertising in Memphis and New Orleans newspapers is often seen in. Jackson. In 1936 the defendant first started using the \u201cO K\u201d name and, for a few months, acted as the statutory agent for the appellees in Jackson for the service of process. This activity soon-stopped and, although the defendant has; been in the moving business in Jackson from 1936 without interruption, he has-not actively used the \u201cO K\u201d name. His business is done under a number of other-names and only the \u201cO K\u201d telephone number is maintained; his \u201cO K\u201d company is nothing more than a \u201ctelephone book company\u201d. In 1960 some of the owners-of the plaintiff corporations established an \u201cO K\u201d mover in Jackson. All of a sudden, defendant sprang to life, painted \u201cO K\u201d on two of his trucks, and began actively to use the \u201cO K\u201d name. The-trial court found actual confusion. The-plaintiffs sued for an injunction, charging the defendant with unfair competition and infringement of a trade name.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-18\">After a careful analysis of the facts, the trial court found that the plaintiffs-were the senior users and that \u201cO K\u201d had developed a secondary meaning in Jackson so that the resulting confusion became an infringement by the defendant.. The Court granted an injunction in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>We have reviewed the record and considered all of the contentions the appellant urges. We hold that the trial court's findings of fact are not clearly erroneous and that the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law properly follow the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
