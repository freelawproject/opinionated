The complaint filed by the Interstate Commerce Commission was based on the premise that Piedmont, a \u201cfor hire carrier\u201d of agricultural or exempt commodities used its trucks on return trips from various parts of the United States to haul nonexempt commodities. The device used was a trip-lease arrangement whereby a formal lease agreement was entered into, under which the other defendants, as shippers, became \u201clessees\u201d of the trucks for the purpose of the carriage from the distant point back to the Georgia destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-19\">The District Court recognized that the question at issue was to be controlled by the decision of the Supreme Court in United States v. Drum, 368 U.S. 370, 82 S.Ct. 408, 7 L.Ed.2d 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-20\">As stated by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Drum case prescribed' two tests which are to be considered in such a situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-21\">\u201cThe first and basic test concerns control, direction, and domination of the transportation. The second test is one which supplements the basic test of control, direction and domination, and it concerns the \u2018substance\u2019 of the operation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-22\">Here, the trial court made specific findings of fact which resolved the basic factual issues touching on control, direction and domination of the transportation by the \u201clessee\u201d and as to the substance of the operation, all favorable to the appellees. These being essentially issues of fact, we can not say that the trial court\u2019s determination of them was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-23\">The judgment must, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
