In view of this, there is no substance to the procedural point that the District Court erred in rendering judgment on the pleadings with the annexed contracts and affidavits. As to the merits, we think the District Court\u2019s construction of the agreements was correct. Denial of relief and dismissal of the complaint was therefore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
