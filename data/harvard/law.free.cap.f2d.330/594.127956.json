No hearing was required. United States, ex rel. Burage v. Pate, 316 F.2d 582, C.A.7th; Jackson v. Steiner, 261 F.2d 447, 448, C.A.4th; Hodge v. Huff, 78 U.S.App.D.C. 329, 140 F.2d 686, 689, cert. denied, 322 U.S. 733, 64 S.Ct. 946, 88 L.Ed. 1567.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-23\">The orders herein appealed from were entered on December 26, 1962, and February 13, 1963. The record contains a letter dated November 30, 1962, to the District Judge from a Cleveland attorney stating in part, \u201cPlease be advised that I will represent the above captioned petitioner in his hearing on Writ of Habeas Corpus filed in your court.\u201d The record does not show that he thereafter withdrew from the case. In fact, said attorney appeared for the petitioner in this appeal and made oral argument on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-24\">In addition, it has been many times held that the constitutional right to counsel in criminal prosecutions provided by the Sixth Amendment does not apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus, which is a civil proceeding.
