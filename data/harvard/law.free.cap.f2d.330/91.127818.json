Petitioner thought the lessons would help him stay thin, and thus create less pressure on his leg. Petitioner knew how to dance before taking the lessons, but learned new steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">In Thoene v. Commissioner, 33 T.C. 62, 63, the petitioner was held not entitled to claim as a medical deduction amounts expended for dance lessons, even though dancing had been recommended to that petitioner by his doctor, and he needed mild post-operative strengthening of his abdominal and leg muscles.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">We agree that by the term \u201cmedical care\u201d as defined in \u00a7 213(e) (1) (A), the dance lessons involved were not \u201cfor the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.\u201d Nor were they primarily for the purpose \u201cof affecting any structure or function of the body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-16\">Section 1.213-l(e) (ii) of the Treasury Regulations on Income Tax (1954 Code), states under the heading \u201cMedical, dental, etc., expenses\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-17\"><em>\u201c(e) Definitions </em>\u2014 (1) <em>General. </em>* * \u201c(ii) Amounts paid for operations or treatments affecting any portion of the body, including obstetrical expenses and expenses of therapy or X-ray treatments, are deemed to be for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body and are therefore paid for medical care. Amounts expended for illegal operations or treatments are not deductible. Deductions for expenditures for medical care allowable under section 213 will be confined strictly to expenses incurred primarily for the prevention or alleviation of a physical or mental defect or illness. Thus, payments for the following are payments for medical care: hospital services, nursing services (including nurses\u2019 board where paid by the taxpayer), medical, laboratory, surgical, dental and other diagnostic and healing services, X-rays, medicine and drugs (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, subject to the 1-percent limitation in paragraph (b) of this section), artificial teeth or limbs, and ambulance hire. However, an expenditure which is merely beneficial to the general health of an individual, such as an expenditure for a vacation, is not an expenditure for medical care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-19\">* -K * * * * (26 C.F.R., sec. 1.213-1)\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-22\">\u201c (A) for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body (including amounts paid for accident or health insurance), * * * * * * * * (26 U.S.C.1958 ed., \u00a7 213.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Petitioner alleges (1) he was misled by the language used in the government\u2019s pamphlet: \u201cYour Federal Income Tax For Individuals\u201d (1958, 1959 and 1960) which describes \u201cmedical expenses,\u201d not \u201cmedical care;\u201d (2) that he is willing to pay the tax on the money used for lessons when and if petitioner obtains restitution of money for unused lessons from the Arthur Murray organization; and (3) that an Arthur Murray manager told petitioner that because he had varicose veins, the dancing lessons\u2019 cost was deductible.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">None of these defenses has merit. The government need not, and cannot, await for a convenient time for taxpayers to pay taxes. Nor can any interpretation by taxpayers of the language used in government pamphlets act as an estoppel against the government, nor change the meaning of taxing statutes; any more than a dance studio manager can bind the government in its effort to collect taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-10\">. \u201c\u00a7 213.
