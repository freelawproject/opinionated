It applied to the Civil Aeronautics Board for an order requiring scheduled air transportation to and from its airport, and made North Central a party to the proceeding. The latter opposed Sheboygan\u2019s application because it was already providing scheduled air service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>at Manitowoc, some 28 miles north of Sheboygan.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">After extensive hearings, the Board concluded that public convenience and necessity did not require the certification of Sheboygan to be separately served, and that service at Manitowoc should be redesignated as a hyphenated point with Sheboygan \u201cbecause of the benefits that should result from the use of the names of both.\u201d North Central\u2019s certificate was amended accordingly. Sheboygan petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The expert Board carefully spelled out the considerations which led to its conclusions. Its action has support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
