Barsh\u2019s agent and employee was driving a 1955 Chevrolet tractor towing a 1957 Cadillac house trailer when the accident occurred. Barsh claimed that he was entitled to insurance protection for claims asserted against him by the other parties to the automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">The case was submitted to the district court without a jury on the pleadings, stipulated facts and briefs. The district court denied Mountain States the relief sought, and held that the policy extended to and covered the nondescribed 1955 Chevrolet truck and the hired 1957 Cadillac house trailer and that Mountain States was obliged to extend \u00e1ll benefits of the policy to Barsh with regard to defense of the claim and payment of any judgment rendered. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">Mountain States\u2019 policy issued to Barsh on August 2, 1962, provided liability insurance for a 1956 International Tractor and a-29-foot single action, flatbed trailer, neither of which were involved in the accident of September 30, 1962. Barsh\u2019s contention is that Endorsement No. 65, \u201cHired Automobiles,\u201d attached to Mountain States\u2019 policy provided coverage for the trailer involved in that collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-15\">At the time of the issuance of Mountain States\u2019 policy, Barsh also owned a Chevrolet two-ton tractor which was insured by another company, Miller\u2019s Mutual Fire Insurance Company of Texas. For about a year he had been renting a 1957 Cadillac house trailer used for living quarters for employees when his construction jobs took him away from Waco, his home office.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-16\">On Sunday, September 30,1962, an employee of Barsh was driving Barsh\u2019s Chevrolet tractor towing the Cadillac house trailer to one of Barsh\u2019s construction jobs at the Army Reserve Center in Marshall, Texas. He had reached a point on the outskirts of Tyler, Texas, some 135 miles from Waco, when the Cadillac house trailer - broke loose from the Chevrolet tractor and, after careening across the road, collided with an automobile occupied by Mr. and Mrs. R. V.' Evans.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-17\">The Evanses made claim against Barsh for personal injuries and property damage sustained in the collision. The Miller\u2019s Mutual policy on the Chevrolet trac-^ tor contained no \u201cHired Automobiles\u201d endorsement or other provision which\u2019 would cover the rented Cadillac house trailer. The question is whether coverage to that trailer is provided by the \u201cHired Automobiles\u201d endorsement attached to Mountain States\u2019 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-18\">The blanks in the \u201cHired Automobiles\u201d endorsement were not filled in, but we will assume that those blanks were intended to be filled in as favorably as pos-, sible to the insured Barsh. In pertinent part it provided: \u201cThis endorsement forms a part of Policy No............. etc.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-21\">\u201cIt-is agreed that such insurance as is afforded by the policy for Bodily Injury Liability, for Property Damage Liability and for Basic Medical Payments applies with re- - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>spect to hired automobiles, subject to the following provisions :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\"><em>\u201cl. Definitions. </em>The words \u2018hired automobile\u2019 shall mean a land motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer used under contract in behalf of, or loaned to, the named insured *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Thus the endorsement extends to \u201chired automobiles\u201d \u201csuch insurance as is afforded by the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">By the policy, Mountain States \u201cagrees with the insured, named in the declarations made a part hereof, in consideration of the payment of the 'premium and in reliance upon the statements in the declarations and subject to the limits of liability, exclusions, conditions and other terms of this policy.\u201d There is thus no basis for Barsh\u2019s contention that the \u201chired automobiles\u201d endorsement affords insurance coverage under the policy without any consideration of the \u201c\u2018Exclusions\u201d contained in the policy. One of those \u201cExclusions\u201d provides that: \u201c\u2018This policy does not apply: * * * while the automobile is used for the towing of any trailer owned or hired by the insured and not covered by like insurance in the company; or while any trailer covered by this policy is used with any automobile owned or hired by the- insured and not covered by like insurance in the company.\u201d Plainly, the policy and the endorsement did not apply unless both the tractor and the trailer were covered by like insurance in the same company.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">As an alternative contention, Barsh argues that the definition of \u201chired automobile,\u201d which has been quoted, includes \u201ctrailer,\u201d and, hence, that the trailer involved in the collision should be treated not as a trailer but as an automobile. That construction is too strained. The definition evidences no intent- to convert the trailer into an automobile. The two are treated as separate -entities throughout the policy' and the \u25a0endorsement. The definition of \u201cautomobile\u201d in Part IY of the \u201cInsuring Agreements\u201d of the policy contains within it a subparagraph captioned \u201cTrailer\u201d and including within the coverage \u201ca trailer not described in this policy, if designed for use with a private passenger automobile, and if not being used for business purposes with another type automobile.\u201d The trailer involved in the collision was being used with the tractor for business purposes. We think that the parties clearly intended the trailer to be treated as a trailer, and as such that it was not covered by the policy as a \u201chired automobile\u201d or otherwise at the time of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">Barsh\u2019s counsel cites no authority and states \u201cthat after a thorough search he can find no specific authority on this point, and none is cited in Appellant\u2019s brief.\u201d Accepting that statement at face value, we have measured Barsh\u2019s contentions by the terms of the policy and endorsement, and find that Mountain States\u2019 obligations do not include the defense of Barsh against the claims asserted by the Evanses, or payment of or indemnification against such claims. The judgment is therefore reversed and the cause remanded with directions to enter judgment for Mountain States.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
