The District Court sustained appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint, and appellant has appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-15\">The hearing examiner had denied appellant\u2019s application for benefits and his decision, when the Appeals Council overruled the request for review, became the final decision of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-16\">Upon consideration, we are of the opinion that the findings of the Secretary are supported by substantial evidence and therefore are conclusive. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); Ward v.
