Defendant-appellee, Ernest F. Negangard, was that county\u2019s sheriff and, we assume, its jailer. Defendantappellee, Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland, was surety on Negangard\u2019s pub]ic official bond, Arrested by Indiana state Troopers, plaintiff was delivered into tbe eustody of defendant sheriff. No charge was made, and he was released at the end of the above-mentioned \u201e . , . \u201e , . _ period. An answer of defendant sheriff , gave an explanation for the arrest and . . . \u201e . \u201e imprisonment of plaintiff, but for our de- . . ... , cisi\u00f3n it is assumed that the sheriff s conduct amounted to false imprisonment. in\u00aetant suit was started on June 17, ^our^ Common Pleas of Hamilton County, Ohio, service was had in Chio on the defendants, and the cause was ^en removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"A8G\">Defendants, in separate answers, pleaded the one-year Ohio statute of limitations applicable to actions for false imprisonment, Page\u2019s Ohio Revised Code, \u00a7 2305.11, and a two-year Indiana statute of limitations applicable to actions for \u201cinjuries to person or character,\u201d Burns\u2019 Indiana Statutes, Anno., \u00a7 2-602. Indiana had no limitations statute specifically applying to false imprisonment. The District Court granted defendants\u2019 motions for judgment on the pleadings, holding that plaintiff\u2019s action was barred , <em>, ,, T </em>, , , , under both the Indiana two-year statute and the Ohio one-year statute.</p>\n<p id=\"AJK\">Plaintiff sougbt e from the forcgoing br asserting that his cause of action was not exclusively one for false imprisonment, but was also for damage to his character and good reputation, for loss of business and profit, for mental anguish, disgrace and physical suffering, and for violation of his constitutional rights. These charges, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>our view, are merely descriptive of the damages that resulted from the tort of false imprisonment. Plaintiff also insists that the only statute of limitations applicable here was an Indiana five-year statute, applicable to \u201call actions against a sheriff * * * and his sureties on a public bond, growing out of a liability incurred by doing an act in an official capacity * * Burns\u2019 Indiana Statutes, Anno., \u00a7 2-602. If such statute was the only applicable one, the action was timely by one day. We are satisfied, however, that the District Judge cor.rectly ruled that the action was barred by the Ohio one-year limitation on actions for false imprisonment. Such was ithe only tort described by plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">This was a diversity case. Subject to constitutional limitations, the conflict of laws rule of the forum state controls as to whether questions involving limitations of actions are procedural &lt;or substantive. Wells v. Simonds Abrasive Co., 345 U.S. 514, 516, 73 S.Ct. 856, 97 L.Ed. 1211; Kryger v. Wilson, 242 U.S. 171, 37 S.Ct. 34, 61 L.Ed. 229. Ohio holds that limitations questions relate to remedy and that the law of the forum state controls. Kerper v. Wood, 48 Ohio St. 613, 29 N.E. 501, 15 L.R.A. 656. An exception is found in \u00a7 2305.20 of the Ohio Revised Code, which provides that if the state wherein a cause of action arises has a shorter period of limitations than Ohio, applicable to such cause of action, the lex loci will control. Such, however, does not apply here because the Ohio statute has the shorter period.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Appellant seeks to avoid the bar of the Ohio law by asserting that his cause of action was created by the same Indiana statute which fixed the limitation on its assertion. He says that his cause of action against the defendant sheriff and the latter\u2019s surety arises from the Indiana statute which prescribes a five-year limitation on \u201call actions against a sheriff * * * and his sureties on a public bond.\u201d Aside from our view that plaintiff\u2019s action for false imprisonment was not a creature of such Indiana statute, it would still be subject to the one-year Ohio statute and Ohio\u2019s conflict of laws rule, Wells v. Simonds Abrasive Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was barred by the one-year limitation provided by \u00a7 2305.11, Ohio Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
