Sections 216 (i), 223, Social Security Act, 64 Stat. 492, 70 Stat. 815, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416(i), 423. The District Court set aside the Secretary\u2019s decision and directed that the claimant be granted disability benefits. The Secretary appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"A9c\">The Social Security Act, Section 216(i), 64 Stat. 492, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(i), defines the term \u201cdisability\u201d as \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically deter-m\u201cable \u00b0f fftal impairment which can be expected to result m death b\u00ae \u00b0f long-continued and indefinite</p>\n<p id=\"AU4\">^ is undisputed that the claimant has a chronically infected ear and some de\u00aeree deafness. Since 1960 he has attempted to obtain employment by answering a few ads for \u201cwatching jobs.\u201d In this connection he stated, \u201cThey don\u2019t want you if you\u2019re over 35 years old on most everything I\u2019ve asked about sometMng j could d0j or try to do_ If you&gt;re over 35 years old in this town its hard ^o ge\u00a3 anyt}1ing) or anywhere else I\u2019ve been\u00bb Raley\u2019s doctors have advised him no^ engage in manual labor, apparentIy because of statements by the claimant to them that he has occasional dizzy spells and has fainted three times in seven years. Their advice, however, appears to be related primarily to manual labor involving stooping in an aggravated noise situation, such as that found in the oil fields where claimant formerly worked. Within the limits of his seventh grade education, claimant can perform sedentary work of any kind. Claimant now drives a pick-up truck, at least during daylight hours. Thus the record indicates that the claimant\u2019s impairment pf'd,.des him only from the performance of ^envy labor, such as that formerly performed by him.</p>\n<p id=\"AE4\">The Secretary found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXe\">\u201c* * * [I]t may be that the claimant has not been able to carry on his usual work in his usual manner, and may not be able to obtain employment as he had heretofore, but it has not been established by the evidence that he has been unable to engage in any type of substantial gainful activity, particularly light or sedentary work, such as driving a truck or some type of motor vehicle, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>which the evidence shows him qualified to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">This finding was supported by substantial evidence and is thus conclusive. Section 205(g), Social Security Act, 53 Stat. 1368, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). The finding is sufficient to preclude benefits, for, as this court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-5\">\u201cTo establish a disability under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 416 (i) a claimant must do more than show that he is unable to do his former work; he must be unable to perform any substantial, gainful work, including work of a physically or emotionally lighter type. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Hicks v. Flemming, 5 Cir., 302 F.2d 470, 473 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The decision of the Secretary must therefore stand, and the judgment Of the District Court must thus be Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
