California Portland Cement Company, 297 F.2d 345 (9th Cir. 1962), and need not be repeated here. In that case we noted that the taxpayer had elected to take the pre-kiln seed cutoff point as to all taxable years here involved, pursuant to Public Law 86-781 \u00a7 4, 74 Stat. 1017, 1018, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 613 note. We remanded the cause to the district court \u201cfor the making of new findings and conclusions, and the entry of a judgment consistent with the teachings of [United States v. Cannelton Sewer Pipe Co., 364 U.S. 76 [80 S.Ct. 1581, 4 L.Ed.2d 1581] (I960)] and with this opinion * * * and with the election made by California Portland Cement Company.\u201d Upon remand the district court held that, in computing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>taxpayer\u2019s gross income from mining (its percentage depletion base) by the proportionate profits method, prescribed in the pertinent Treasury Regulations, for the limestone mined by the taxpayer and used to make cement and cement clinker, the costs of iron ore and quartzite added to the limestone are to be treated as mining costs. This appeal is from that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">The undisputed facts, so far as pertinent here, are as follows. In the taxable years in question, the taxpayer extracted limestone from its Colton Quarry and used it to make cement clinker and finished cement. The taxpayer took the following steps in producing cement from its limestone and preparing the cement for marketing: (1) quarrying and primary crushing of the limestone; (2) secondary crushing, grinding and blending of the crushed limestone with varying amounts of iron ore and quartzite to obtain a properly proportioned raw mixture which is stored in silos pending further processing; (3) dead burning the raw mixture in rotary kilns to produce cement clinker which is stored in piles pending further processing or sale; (4) grinding the clinker with the addition of other materials; and (5) storing the resultant finished cement in silos, and preparing the cement for shipment in bulk or sack to customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-18\">The addition of iron ore and quartzite to the limestone (step 2) was an essential step in the production of cement clinker and finished cement from the taxpayer\u2019s limestone. All of the quartzite was purchased by the taxpayer; all of the iron ore was extracted by the taxpayer from its own iron ore deposit. For all of this-iron ore, the taxpayer received a depletion allowance separate and apart from its depletion allowance on limestone.</p>\n<p id=\"AtE\">The taxpayer\u2019s limestone is subject to percentage depletion at the rate of 10 percent of its \u201cgross income from mining.\u201d The district court used the method for constructively computing the \u201cgross income from mining\u201d which is commonly called the proportionate profits method, reflected in the following formula:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">\u201cmining\u201d costs -- X total costs of product sold sale price of gross income product sold from mining.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">By virtue of taxpayer\u2019s election, the prekiln feed stage is to be used as the cutoff point to \u201cmining\u201d in determining the \u201cmining costs\u201d factor of that formula, as now provided in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 613, the pertinent parts of which are reproduced in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question presented concerns the scope of \u201cTreatment processes considered as mining\u201d within the meaning of that provision. The addition of quartzite and iron ore to limestone encompasses two costs: (1) the cost of the additives themselves, which covers the purchase price of the quartzite and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>cost of mining the iron ore; and (2) the cost, or expense of physically adding those minerals to the limestone. The appellant concedes that the second \u2014 the act -of physically adding the quartzite and iron ore to the limestone \u2014 is a pre-kiln \u201cprocess\u201d and that the expense thereof is a \u201cmining\u201d cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">In our view the costs of the additives themselves are not includable as a \u201cmining\u201d cost. The district court was of the erroneous view that of the total cost of bulk cement production, so much as relates to the pre-kiln stage represents \u201cmining\u201d within the formula, and that the cost of these additives were includable simply because they were added to the limestone prior to the kiln stage. The legislative history of the provision in -question reveals the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">S.Rep.No.1910, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 7-10, explains that the cutoff point for cement-producing minerals is derived from Rev.Rul. 290, 1953\u20142 Cum.Bull. 41, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">\u201cBlending with other materal after crushing and grinding such as that occurring at the kiln feed bins, is excluded from \u2018ordinary treatment processes\u2019 * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">\u201cThe gross income for percentage depletion purposes must of course be computed separately with respect to each component mineral, notwithstanding any such mixing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">We believe that by the enactment of the amendment in question Congress intended only to move the cutoff point from the \u2022crushing and grinding stage to the prekiln stage, but not to alter the revenue ruling with respect to separate computations of depletion of component minerals. To hold otherwise would be to allow a double depletion on the iron ore extracted hy the taxpayer. This will not do.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">With respect to the quartzite, H.Conference Rep.No.2005, 86th Congress, 2d Sess., pp. 8-9 (1960-2 Cum.Bull. 741, 746), U.S.Code Congressional and Administrative News 1960, p. 2581 contains the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-12\">\u201cAs under existing law, a described process is to be treated as mining where performed by another person for the mine owner or operator if the mine owner or operator has not disposed of his depletable interest in the ore or mineral to which such process is applied. Under the language of this provision, a described process is not treated as mining where applied to a purchased ore or mineral.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">If inclusion of iron ore extracted by taxpayer is improper, <em>a fortiori </em>inclusion of quartzite purchased from someone else is improper. Taxpayer has no \u201ceconomic interest\u201d in the quartzite.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-14\">It will be noted that \u00a7 613(c) (4) is concerned with \u201ctreatment processes * * * <em>applied </em>to the * * * mineral.\u201d (Emphasis added.) A number of \u201ctreatment processes\u201d are described in the provision. \u201cCleaning, breaking, sizing, dust allaying\u201d coal; \u201ccleaning, pumping to vats, cooling, breaking, and loading for shipment\u201d sulfur recovered by the Frasch process; \u201cpulverization\u201d of talc; \u201cburning\u201d of magnesite; and \u201csintering and nodulizing\u201d of phosphate rock, are illustrative examples of the processes described. \u201cExtracting\u201d and \u201cpurchasing\u201d additives are not representative of the \u201ctreatment processes * * * applied to the * * * mineral\u201d described in the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">The depletion allowance sought here is in respect of limestone. Under the Cannelton doctrine, \u201cmining\u201d ceases at the crushing stage. Riddell v. Monolith Portland Cement Co., 371 U.S. 537, 83 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>378, 9 L.Ed.2d 492 (1963) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Congress granted relief from this rule by including treatment processes applied to the mineral up to the kiln-feed stage. Surely Congress did not mean to grant the additional relief of allowing depletion upon minerals already depleted or in which the taxpayer had but an \u201ceconomic advantage.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Finally, appellee urges as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">\u201cIf for any reason this court is unable to adopt the method of computation reflected in the decision below, then in the alternative it should adopt the proportionate tonnage method of account for additives.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The alternative method was presented to the district court in the course of argument in the proceedings appealed from, but the court made no findings or conclusions in respect thereto. The government urges that the alternative method is improper where there is no representative market price of like kind and grade at the cutoff point. The district court made specific findings that there was no commercial market for any mineral product of like kind and grade at the cutoff point. (Findings Nos. 5 to 12 inclusive.) Appellee makes no challenge to these findings. The alternative method is scantily treated in the briefs. In these circumstances we decline to attempt or to consider the alternative method. Whether, on remand, the district court should reconsider the alternate method in light of the findings and pertinent treasury regulations is a matter resting within its province.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Judgment is reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-10\">. \u201c\u00a7 613.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-11\">***** \u201c(e) Definition of gross income from property. \u2014 For purposes of this section\u2014 *****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-14\">\u201c(2) Mining. \u2014 -The term \u2018mining\u2019 includes not merely the extraction of the ores or minerals from the ground but also the treatment processes considered as mining described in paragraph (4) (and the treatment processes necessary or incidental thereto), * * *^ *****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-23\">\u201c(4) Treatment processes considered as mining. \u2014 The following treatment processes where applied by the mine owner or operator shall be considered as mining to the extent they are applied to the ore or mineral in respect of which he is entitled to a deduction for depletion under section 611:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-24\">\u201c(F) in the case of calcium carbonates and other minerals when used in making cement \u2014 all processes (other than preheating of the kiln feed) applied prior to the introduction of the kiln feed into the kiln, but not including any subsequent process;\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-9\">.
