ROBBIN, Appellant, v. The AMERICAN UNIVERSITY, a corporation, Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b277-13\">No. 17766.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b277-14\">United States Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b277-15\">Argued Jan. 4, 1964.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b277-16\">Decided March 5, 1964.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-24\">Mr. Alfred M.

Myers, Washington, D. C., filed a brief on behalf of The American Council on Education, as amicus curia, urging affirmance.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b277-27\">Before Edgerton, Senior Circuit Judge, and Fahy and Wright, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b277-28\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b277-29\">Appellant\u2019s complaint against The American University and certain individuals who are members of its staff is based upon alleged acts of the individuals. The District Court dismissed the complaint \u201cas to the defendant American University only\u201d and declined to dismiss it as to the individuals. The court expressly \u201cdetermined * * * that there is no just reason for delay of the entry of final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>judgment\u201d and ordered final judgment to be entered as to the University.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">We think the court erred. At least one of the possible decisions of this appeal might in effect decide appellant\u2019s claims against the defendant members of the University\u2019s staff. Those claims have not been and should be decided in the first instance by the District Court. We therefore apply the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Mackey, 351 U.S. 427, 437, 76 S.Ct. 895, 100 L.Ed. 1297, that an abuse of discretion by the District Court in acting under F.R.Civ.P. Rule 54(b) is reviewable by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The appealed judgment will be set aside and the case remanded for further proceedings. The District Court will have full control over the entire case, including appellant\u2019s claims against all defendants, until final judgment is entered as to all. Cf. Zangardi v. Tobriner, 117 U.S.App.D.C. -, 330 F.2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
