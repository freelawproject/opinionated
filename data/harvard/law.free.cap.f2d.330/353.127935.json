The compounds are 2,5-bis (para-aminophenyl) -1,3,4-oxadiazoles.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-29\">In electrophotography, a substratum (e. g., paper, glass, metal foil, etc.) is coated with a photoconductive substance (i. e., a substance whose electrical conductivity is dependent upon the amount of light to which it is subjected) to provide a surface upon which images are reproducible. The photoconductive layer, although not light-sensitive per se, is rendered so by applying to the coated article an electrostatic charge (e. g., by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>corona discharge<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>). Images to be reproduced are placed atop the charged surface which is exposed to illumination by conventional photographic methods, whereby the coating locally dissipates its charge in proportion to the intensity of illumination. Non-illuminated areas, which retain their charge, are then treated with eleetroscopic powder (e. g., colored synthetic resins) resulting in a visible image which may be transferred to another surface or may be fixed (e. g., by fusing), rendering the powder permanently adherent to the coated substratum.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The rejected claims define electrophotographic articles as well as a method of making them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Claims 129, 130, 131 and 157 are representative (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">\u201c129.

In article claims 141 to 156, specific oxadiazoles are recited. \u201cDyestuff sensitizers\u201d according to appellants\u2019 specification are used to extend the sensitivity of the photoconductive layer \u201cinto the visible part of the spectrum * * *_\u00bb Appellants disclose a host of dyes as applicable including triarylmethanes, xanthenes, thiazines, etc. \u201cOrganic colloids\u201d are said to be \u201cadvantageous in preparing the photoconductive insulating layers\u201d and may be natural and synthetic resins, synthetic polymers and the like. For what purpose they are \u201cadvantageous\u201d is not expressly disclosed, but apparently they provide a fusible medium for fixation of the photoconductive layer after exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">The sole ground of rejection is unpatentability over the following reference:</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">Siegrist et al. 2,765,304 Oct. 2, 1956</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">In the Siegrist et al. patent, entitled \u201cNew Ox-Diazole Compounds and Process for their Manufacture,\u201d the patentees teach various oxadiazoles, the sole statement of utility of which is \u201cfor making <em>organic material </em>impenetrable to ultraviolet rays, for the optic brightening of <em>organic material </em>or as an intermediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>product for the preparation of dyestuffs.\u201d (Emphasis ours.) Such compounds also \u201cexhibit in solution or when applied to a <em>substratum </em>a green-blue to violet fluorescence in daylight or ultra-violet light.\u201d (Emphasis ours.) Appellants assert, and the Patent Office concedes, there is no teaching in Siegrist et al. that any oxadiazoles possess photoconductive properties. Appellants concede that some of the oxidiazoles of their claims are disclosed by Siegrist et al.</p>\n<p id=\"AC0\">We shall discuss separately the rejeetion of the article claims and method claims.</p>\n<p id=\"AVN\">\n<em>Article Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ab6\">The Patent Office position is that the reference teaches, or at least suggests, a \u201cbacking member\u201d upon which is coated an oxadiazole <em>as ultraviolet brightener; </em>that such \u201cbacking member\u201d may be paper which is \u201corganic material\u201d; and that such coated paper would <em>inherently </em>be an article defined by appellants\u2019 claims. Stated another way, the Patent Office position is that appellants\u2019 claims define an article not distinguishable from a coated paper suggested by Siegrist et al.</p>\n<p id=\"Az5\">. The examiner said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnA\">\u201cIt is the Examiner\u2019s position that the instant claims recite no new or unobvious article even though the intended use may be different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ake\">\u201cSiegrist et al clearly discloses coating the composition on a \u2018backing member\u2019, which is substantially all the structure that is required * * * [by appellants\u2019] claims * * * to be \u2018an electrophotographic material\u2019. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APAC\">\u201cThe requirement in the instant claims that the backing member be \u2018electrically conductive\u2019 is not seen to define any significant structural distinction since <em>any </em>material is \u2018electrically conductive\u2019, even the best insulators known. In any event, note that applicants may employ such backing materials as glass or paper * * *. The obvious and well known use for ultra-violet absorbers and optic brighteners, the utility suggested by the reference * * * is in paints, inks, photographs, and coating compositions in general, for example in the optical brightening of paper. Nor is it deemed unobvious to broadly classify substrates into two distinct categories, i. e. conductive and non-conductive, where there is no apparent reason to limit the reference to non-conductive substrates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN0\">The board added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APg\">\u201cAppellants rely upon the preamble directed to \u2018An electrophotographic material\u2019 to support patent-of [the] article claims * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8C\">_ a\u00a3ree with appellants\u2019 interpretation of ^ the preamble which, in our opinion, neither requires specific structure nor suggests a particular function. The term \u2018An electrophotographic material\u2019 does no^ indicate what structure other than that specified in the terms of the claims is required nor how said mater^ai is b\u00ae employed in an electrophotographic process. Thus, the preample differs from those considered by the court in the decisions cited in appellants\u2019 brief and in particular, from the printing plate to which the claims in In re Schmidt, 48 CCPA 1140; 772 O.G. 897; 293 F.(2d) 274; 130 USPQ 404 were directed. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGn\">\u201cWe further disagree with appellants in that we must look to appellants\u2019 specification to determine what is intended by the claimed element, \u2018an electrically conductive support layer\u2019, since this term is not of itself clearly definitive. As pointed out by the Examiner, appellants\u2019 description includes as apparent representatives of this element, a glass plate * * * or paper sheets or webs * * *. We note the paper sheets or glass plates are not stated to be further treated to make them additionally electro-conductive and in fact, the paper sheets are treated with coat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>ings which would be expected to tend to decrease electrical conductivity. Thus, we agree with the Examiner, in view of the disclosed representative examples of the otherwise undefined electrically conductive support layer, that the substrates to which reference is made in Siegrist et al., or which are suggested therein, must inherently fall within the terms of the claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">* -X- -x- * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">\u201cMerely referring to a possible use for such an article, not specified in the reference, does not render the composite patentable. We consider the situation before us to be somewhat analogous to that in In re Rosicky, 47 CCPA 861; 755 O.G. 929; 276 F.(2d) 656; 125 USPQ 341, since we hold the teaching of the utility of the oxadiazoles in Siegrist et al. to suggest to the chemist the use thereof as applied to substrates including paper, fabrics, and other material falling within the terms of appellants\u2019 claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Appellants argue that the preamble of their claims, when considered in conjunction with the other claim limitations, distinguishes their invention structurally over Siegrist et al.; that \u201cThere is no disclosure in Siegrist et al. of a photo-conductive insulating layer or an electrically conductive support layer\u201d and that accordingly \u201cthese structural recitations of the claims are not met\u201d; that the claims are \u201cdefinitive of an article of manufacture\u201d not taught by the reference; and that the preamble does not constitute a mere \u201cuse\u201d limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">We agree with the Patent Office that Siegrist et al. fairly teach paper coated with oxadiazole as optical brightener. The issue then is simply whether appellants\u2019 claims, read in the light of the disclosure distinguish the \u201celectrophotographic material\u201d over such coated paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">As to the claim preamble, this court has frequently considered problems related thereto. See, e. g., Kropa v. Robie et al., 187 F.2d 150, 38 CCPA 858, and cases cited therein. We know no general rule for deciding the weight to be given preamples as positive structural limitations. Ellis,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for example, states \u201cPreambles are used primarily to give the field within which the invention has utility. They designate <em>use </em>rather than <em>structure, form </em>or <em>composition.\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">In the instant case, we do not consider it to be controlling that the reference does not <em>in haec verba </em>disclose \u201celectrophotographic material.\u201d The claims <em>as a whole </em>must be analyzed in light of the disclosure to see if the article defined thereby is distinguishable in fact, vis-a-vis <em>in verbis, </em>over the prior art.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">We first consider the limitation \u201celectrically conductive support layer.\u201d As did the board, we look to the specification to see what appellants\u2019 claims mean. It says the support \u201cmay be of any material suitable for use in electrophotographic processes, for example, aluminum or other metal plates or foils; glass plates; <em>paper sheets </em>or webs, or plastic foil * * (Emphasis ours.) The paper may be pretreated against penetration in a conventional manner by coating with methyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol or the like. In twenty examples, sixteen employ paper as the support layer, defined simply as \u201cpaper foil,\u201d \u201ctransparent paper\u201d or \u201ctranslucent paper.\u201d Appellants, in neither the disclosure nor their brief, indicate that such paper is of any special type, other than being \u201csuitable for use in electrophotographic processes.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ae<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>cordingly, we are not convinced that a typical paper substrate suggested for use by Siegrist et al. is not \u201celectrically conductive\u201d as contemplated by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Appellants\u2019 \u201cphotoconductive insulating layer\u201d may be an oxadiazole per se or mixtures thereof, or may be oxadiazoles in admixture with dyestuff sensitizers or organic colloids, discussed supra. As to coatings of oxadiazole per se, upon which we believe the phrase \u201cphotoconductive insulating layer\u201d reads, nothing in the record indicates such a layer to be unlike oxadiazole coatings for ultraviolet reflecting. Merely calling the coating a \u201cphotoconductive insulating layer\u201d does not make it any the less an admittedly old oxadiazole. Thus we hold that claims reciting an \u201celectrically conductive support layer\u201d and a \u201cphotoconductive insulating layer * * * containing * * [oxadiazole]\u201d do not therein distinguish over Siegrist et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\"> However, we do not agree with the board that claims which require that \u201cdyestuff sensitizer\u201d or \u201corganic colloid\u201d be present <em>in the photoconductive layer </em>do not distinguish over Siegrist et al.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nothing in the reference suggests dyestuff sensitizers or organic colloids <em>in admixture </em>with oxadiazoles, such admixture then used <em>as a coating. </em>A claim to such a combination of coating and support layer defines an article structurally different from any taught by Siegrist et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">Thus, we hold the claims reciting that the \u201cphotoconductive insulating layer\u201d <em>contains </em>oxadiazole do not distinguish over Siegrist et al. while the claims which recite \u201cdyestuff sensitizer\u201d and \u201corganic colloid\u201d as part of the \u201cphotoconductive insulating layer\u201d do so distinguish.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">\n<em>Method Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-15\">Method claims 157 to 162 recite simply \u201ccoating\u201d a support layer with photoconductive insulating layer. The examiner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-16\">\u201cClaims 157 to 162 do not distinguish over the references [sic] in that they merely recite the obvious method for preparing the article, i. e. by \u2018coating\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-17\">The board added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-18\">\u201cProcess claims 157 to 162 are directed to a single-step method which comprises \u2018coating\u2019. As pointed out in appellants\u2019 specification * * * the coating is applied \u2018in known manner\u2019. Hence the claimed step functionally defined in terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>of its result cannot differentiate over the application to a substratum taught in Siegrist et al. and is apparently obvious to one having ordinary skill in this art.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Appellants urge in their brief \u201cthat while it may be obvious to prepare the article by coating once the article is known, it certainly can not be obvious to prepare the article by such a process when the article is unknown and, absent appellants\u2019 disclosure, there is nothing to teach the claimed article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">We agree with the board. Appellants\u2019 coating process appears to be conventional and therefore obvious. The faet that the final product is novel is not controlling of obviousness of the method.

Subsequent to the brief, appellants\u2019 counsel submitted memoranda citing patents and technical journal articles, purporting to establish art-recognition of electrically conductive papers and glasses for electrophotography. The brief asserts \u201cthere is no reason why appellants should be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>quired to recite in the specification that which is notoriously old in the art.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">We have reviewed the citations but find nothing therein to support appellants\u2019 position. None of the electroeonductive papers listed are related directly to electrophotography but rather to facsimile recording in telegraphic transmission. The paper in one instance is specially made by incorporating graphite or metal particles into raw pulp to lower the resultant paper\u2019s electrical resistance. In another type, ordinary paper is penetrated with metal conductor.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Appellants\u2019 specification discloses nothing from which we can justifiably conclude that their \u201celectrically conductive\u201d support layer is intended to be, inter alia, specially fabricated papers as are used in facsimile recording.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b409-10\">.
