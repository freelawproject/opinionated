Junior Franklin Maddox was sentenced to one year and one day with the last six months suspended and three years\u2019 probation. Willie Joe Maddox received two years\u2019 probation. Both complain in this Court of (1) insufficient evidence to raise a jury issue much less to support the convictions and (2) the supplemental charge on aiding and abetting, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-15\">There was ample evidence in the record to raise a jury issue and to support the jury\u2019s verdict finding Junior Franklin Maddox guilty of Count 2 of the indictment \u2014 sale of non-taxpaid whiskey on or about July 18, 1962. Since the sentence imposed was less than the maximum which could have been imposed upon conviction on this one count, we need not examine the evidence in support of the convictions on the other counts. E. g., Fowler v. United States, 5 Cir., 1956, 234 F.2d 695; Pollock v. United States, 5 Cir., 1953, 202 F.2d 281; Whitley v. United States, 5 Cir., 1938, 100 F.2d 504. There was also sufficient evidence both to raise a jury issue and sustain the jury\u2019s verdict finding Willie Joe Maddox guilty of Count 3 of the indictment \u2014 possession of non-taxpaid whiskey on or about July 19, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-16\">Appellants failed to object to the supplemental charge as finally given to the jury, and they may not here complain of any error that may have been present. Fowler v. United States, 5 Cir., 1956, 234 F.2d 697; Lambert v. United States, 5 Cir., 1955, 226 F.2d 602. However, we have examined the charge and find it to be a full and fair statement of the law. See, e. g., Lambert v. United States, supra, 226 F.2d 602, at 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
