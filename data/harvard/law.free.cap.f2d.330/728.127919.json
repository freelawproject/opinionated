The suit was brought by Gypsum against Rock Wool <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Insulating Company and four others to recover damages for patent infringement and resulted in a judgment for Gypsum <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which has been satisfied. Ap pellant Brennan intervened in the patent suit. The trial court said that Brennan\u2019s interest was \u201cthat of a stockholder of Bock Wool Insulating Company, who is attempting to ascertain the state of affairs of said company.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The issues raised by the intervention were tried separately and decided against Brennan.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Judgment on the patent issues was entered September 23, 1963, and on the intervention issues, October 14, 1963. Brennan\u2019s notice of appeal purported to go to each judgment and was received by the Clerk of the District Court on October 22, 1963, within the 30-day period provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107. The filing fee required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1917 was not paid until November 4, 1963. Untimely payment of the fee did not vitiate the validity of the notice .of appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Rule 73(g), F.R.Civ.P., requires that the record on appeal be filed in the appellate court within 40 days from the filing of the notice of appeal. 'This was not done and no extension of time was granted by the trial court or by this court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the record has now been lodged with the Clerk of the Court of Appeals, the $25 docket fee required by the court\u2019s Rule 15(6) has not been paid. The cost bond does not name Gypsum as an obligee.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">These failures do not deprive the court of jurisdiction but they are grounds for such action as the court deems appropriate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">Brennan makes no adequate explanation of his disregard of the rules. His controversy is with the defendants who were sued by Gypsum. A consideration of the record convinces us that his nebulous claims against Gypsum are entirely frivolous. In the circumstances the proper exercise of our discretionary powers requires that the motion to docket and dismiss be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-21\">The appeal is dismissed as to United States Gypsum Company.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-14\">.
