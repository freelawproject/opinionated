The Act provides that the agency to which the assets are returned, here appellee, shall agree \u201cthat not to exceed 3 per centum of the book value of [its] assets will be expended * * * for administrative purposes during any year, without the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">As we construe the statutory authority of appellants it does not authorize them to require a reduction of administrative expenses below the 3 per centum level when there is only a difference of opinion as to the amount needed for administrative purposes. In these circumstances approval by appellants would be necessary only if the percentage exceeded 3 per centum.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
