Testifying in his own behalf, Jenkins denied the robbery, said he could not remember where he was on the day in question, but admitted having been in the store on several occasions. Cross-examination disclosed a criminal record which, of course, went to his credibility. Found guilty by the jury, he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-25\">The principal'claims of error advanced by Jenkins are that the trial judge gave a coercive instruction and improperly commented on the evidence. Significantly, the appellant did not object at the time and protests for the first time on appeal. Regardless of that, we have considered the matter and have concluded that, viewed in the context of the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>charge, the challenged statements of the trial judge do not require reversal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AHY\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-10\"> The court\u2019s statements to the jury did not in any sense purport to be the charge under Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492, 17 S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896), to which our dissenting colleague applies colorful words such as \u201cdynamite\u201d and \u201cnitroglycerin.\u201d They were no more than the judge\u2019s response to a jury which reported it was \u201cdeadlocked\u201d after only very brief deliberations. We see no basis whatever for characterizing these statements as coercive, especially as the jury did not reconvene and resume its deliberations until the following day.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b273-5\">J. SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Afs\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Jenkins was convicted<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the robbery of $38.00 from a High's Dairy Products store and sentenced to serve three to ten years. I believe this conviction should be reversed because of two trial court errors: (1) coercive instruction to the jury, and (2) improper comment on the evidence during the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">The court began its charge to the jury in this case with the following words: \u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury: What we have here is a very simple case that should not detain you long and in which you should have no difficulty in reaching a prompt decision one way or the other.\u201d Nevertheless, after two hours of deliberation, the jury sent the court a note reading: \u201cThe jury cannot come to a decision on both counts because of insufficient evidence.\u201d Thereupon the court gave the jury additional instructions, including: \u201cNow, I am not going to accept this. You have got to reach a decision in this case.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-25\">After further deliberation, the jury brought in a verdict of guilty on Count 1 and not guilty on Count 2. It is my view that the jury may well have concluded that the judge\u2019s additional instruction meant what it said: \u201cYou have got to reach a decision in this case\u201d \u2014 that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>were required to bring in a verdict. I also believe that, under the circumstances, the verdict as returned was, in all probability, a compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The charge to the jury given here is more coercive than anything I have heard or read in 25 years of exposure to criminal jury trials. Even the 67-year-old Allen<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> charge, now condemned as \u201cthe dynamite charge,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> does not go so far in coercing the jury. At least in the <em>Allen </em>charge, after the jury is told that it is its duty to reach a verdict, the words \u201cif [you] can conscientiously do so\u201d are added. Here the jury was simply told flat out: \u201cYou have got to reach a decision in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">There is no requirement in law that a jury agree. As a matter of fact, a hung jury can be a safeguard to liberty. The urge to convict in times of public hysteria may be very great. And the common law recognizes that, even where there is a failure of proof, often only the uncommon man can stand against this pressure. Thus, by having a jury of twelve, with a unanimous individual vote required, a measure of protection is afforded.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The majority\u2019s approval of this coercive charge is also in conflict with two decisions of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. In Powell v. United States, 5 Cir., 297 F.2d 318, 320 (1961), the instruction, \u201cIf you follow the principles of law given you by the Court and if you recall the evidence in this case you ought to be able to agree upon a verdict,\u201d was held sufficiently coercive to require reversal of the conviction. And in Green v. United States, <em>supra </em>Note 4, 309 F.2d at 855, the court held that the instruction, \u201c * * <em>* </em>it is the duty of the minority to listen to the argument of the majority with some distrust of their own judgment because the rule is that the majority will have better judgment than the mere minority * * far exceeded permissible limits. The instruction \u201cprejudiced the right of an accused to <em>a </em>hung jury and a mistrial by tending to stifle the dissenting voices of minority jurors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>309 F.2d at 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">A comparison of the objectionable portion of the charge given here with the charges in the <em>Powell </em>and <em>Green </em>cases demonstrates that the charge in this case was by far the most coercive. Yet in both those cases the Fifth Circuit held that the giving of such a charge was error requiring reversal of the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">The second trial court error concerns the inaccurate and incomplete summary of a key prosecution witness\u2019 testimony in the charge. On cross-examination the witness, Mrs. Hodges, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-15\">[By defense counsel.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-16\">\u201cQ. Do you recall having a conversation with a Mr. Savage of the Legal Aid Agency on April 9th, 1963?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-17\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-18\">\u201cQ. Do you recall an investigator of the Legal Aid Agency talking to you and asking you if you knew anything about this case ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-19\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-20\">\u201cThe Court: What is your answer ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\u201cThe Witness : No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">And also:</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">[By defense counsel.]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">\u201cQ. Isn\u2019t it true, Mrs. Hodges, that you were actually unable to identify this defendant on a prior occasion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">\u201cThe Court: You will have to specify the prior occasion. You can\u2019t ask enigmas like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">\u201cQ. Was there a prior occasion when you were unable to identify this defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\">\u201cThe Court : No, no; you will have to make clear what you are referring to. You cannot mystify a witness, Mr. Jones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-11\">\u201cMr. Jones: Very well, Your Hon- or, I have no further questions at this time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">A Legal Aid investigator, Mr. Savage, was called and testified that he had indeed interviewed Mrs. Hodges, by phone, and that she told him \u201cshe was not able to identify the man.\u201d On being recalled, Mrs. Hodges admitted that she had spoken to the investigator as he had testified. Thereafter she was asked:</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">[By defense counsel.]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-14\">\u201cQ. But the question is, did you tell him that you couldn\u2019t identify him [the defendant] ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-15\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-16\">Apparently not satisfied with the answer, the court interrupted at this point to take over the questioning of the witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-17\">\u201cThe Court: Did you tell Mr. Savage that you could not identify this defendant as being the man who held up the store? Did you tell him that ? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-18\">\u201cThe Witness: I told him that I could his face part, but that Mrs. McLeish got a better description of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-19\">\u201cThe Court: We are asking you whether you told Mr. Savage that you could not identify this defendant. Did you tell him that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-21\">\u201cThe Witness: Well, no, I didn\u2019t tell him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-22\">In summing up this portion of the evidence, the trial court did not mention the answer Mrs. Hodges had given to defense counsel, but only the answer elicited by the court itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-23\">\u201cNow the defense called an investigator, Mr. Francis Savage, who said that he telephoned Ruth Hodges- and asked her concerning the matter. He further testified that Ruth. Hodges said that she could not identify the man but that her co-worker, Mrs. McLeish, picked his picture out from a number of photographs furnished to her by the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-24\">\u201cRuth Hodges was called back to the stand and she testified that she did have a telephone conversation with Francis Savage, but she denied that she said she could not identify the man, but said that she told him that Mrs. McLeish got a better view of him and was better able to identify him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-25\">A judge\u2019s discretion to comment on the facts \u201cis not arbitrary and uncontrolled, but judicial, to be exercised in conformity with the standards governing the judicial office. * * * This court has accordingly emphasized the duty of the trial judge to use great care that an expression of opinion upon the evidence \u2018should be so given as not to mislead, and especially that it should not be one-sided\u2019; * * Quercia v. United States, 289 U.S. 466, 470, 53 S.Ct. 698, 77 L.Ed. 1321 (1933). See also Wabisky v. D. C. Transit System, Inc., 117 U.S.App.D.C. -, 326 F.2d 658 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-29\">The court\u2019s instruction here was not only misleading, it was also one-sided. In a simple criminal case, there is little excuse for the trial court\u2019s exercising its common law right to comment on the testimony of witnesses. The jury is in as good a position as the judge, not only to remember their testimony, but to appraise it. So, when a trial judge undertakes the risk of trenching on the function of the jury, he must do so with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>certain knowledge that his actions will be subjected to strict scrutiny. Here the summation by the court of the testimony of the identifying witness, Mrs. Hodges, is indefensible, not only from the standpoint of accuracy, but from the standpoint of fairness as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-12\">. The indictment was in two counts: (1) robbery, 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2901 (1961), and (2) assault with intent to commit robbery, 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 501 (1961). The defendant was convicted on Count 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b273-14\">. The complete additional instruction reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3l\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Foreman, the Court has received your note reading as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-16\">\u201c \u2018The jury cannot come to a decision on both counts because of insufficient evidence.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-17\">\u201cWell, you have all the evidence there is, all the evidence that anybody can have. That is what we have jurors for, to decide on the evidence. If there weren\u2019t any problems we wouldn\u2019t have a jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-18\">\u201cNow, I am not going to accept this. You have got to reach a decision in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-20\">\u201cYou may resume your seat, Mr. Foreman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-21\">\u201cOf course, every case involves a problem and you have got to weigh the cvidence and reach a conclusion. That is what you are jurors for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-27\">\u201cNow, I am going to let you go home at this time. Each of you think it over overnight and I am going to ask you to be back here by 10 o\u2019clock tomorrow morning and resume your deliberations. Now, from the moment you leave the jury box until you return tomorrow morning at 10 o\u2019clock to resume your deliberations, please don\u2019t discuss this case with anyone, not even amongst yourselves, not even at home with members of your families. Each of you can individually think about it, but don\u2019t discuss it and don\u2019t let anybody talk to you about it. Perhaps after you have had a good rest overnight you will be in a position to roach a verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-28\">\u201cIt is a simple case. We have eases that are much harder than this one that juries decide. As I say, if cases were open and shut we wouldn\u2019t need any juries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-29\">\u201cI am going to excuse you at this time and please be back in the jury room a few minutes before 10 o\u2019clock tomorrow morning and then resume your deliberations because this case has to be decided. That is all the evidence there is, that is all the evidence anybody can have. If I excuse you we have to try the case again with some other jury and they will have the same evidence. Now that would not be very sensible, would it. So, you will be excused at this time, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. I know that you will reach a decision tomorrow after you think about it overnight.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\">. See Allen v.
