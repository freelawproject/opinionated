Appellant, a pedestrian, sued the appellees for injuries sustained when during daylight hours he walked across an unmarked crosswalk on West Fort Street in Detroit, Michigan, at the intersection of Casgrain Street. Appellant walked into the left side of a trailer which was being pulled by a tractor proceeding west on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>West Fort Street in the lane adjacent to the right curb.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The jury returned a verdict of no cause of action and a judgment was entered thereon in favor of appellees and against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Eleven errors are charged by appellant, relating to the admission and rejection of evidence, the charge of the District Judge and the refusal of the District Court to submit certain requested charges to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Upon consideration, we are of the opinion that there was no error in the trial affecting the substantial rights of appellant, and that the appeal is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
