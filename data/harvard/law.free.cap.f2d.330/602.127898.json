While we share the concern expressed by the trial court over the plight of the appellant resulting from his failure to plead the available defense of discharge in the state court suit, we perceive no difference between this situation and the ordinary case in which a party permits a case to go to default judgment against him, whether through ignorance or inattention, or failure of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">There being no basis for setting aside the state court judgment on the ground of fraud, duress or coercion we conclude that the judgment of the trial court must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
