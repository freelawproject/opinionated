A jury found him guilty of murder in the first degree and fixed the penalty at death. The court en banc granted Melton\u2019s motion for a new trial on the ground that an aggregate of prejudicial events at the trial, including an emotional outburst by the bereaved husband of the murdered woman \u201ccreated such an inflammatory atmosphere that the jury\u2019s determination may well have been based upon other than the substantive factual evidence introduced.\u201d The Commonwealth appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court contending that the court en banc abused its discretion in granting a new trial. The Commonwealth\u2019s appeal was dismissed on the ground that it had no right of appeal inasmuch as the new trial had been granted for factual reasons \u2014 prejudicial events at the trial \u2014 -and under settled Pennsylvania law \u201cIt is only where the question involved is purely one of law that the Commonwealth may appeal from an adverse ruling in a criminal case * * Commonwealth v. Melton, 402 Pa. 628, 629, 168 A.2d 328, 329 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">Melton\u2019s contention at his second trial that the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal constituted double jeopardy and violated his constitutional rights was rejected and he then pleaded guilty to murder. In conformity with Pennsylvania criminal practice a three-judge court then held a hearing at which considerable evidence was presented relating to Melton\u2019s crime, his early life, environmental background and mentality. Two psychologists and a neuropsychiatrist testified in Melton\u2019s behalf that he was a \u201cmental defective\u201d, but able to distinguish between right and wrong. The evidence established that Melton had completed the ninth grade in school; he had served in the United States Marine Corps for over a year when he was discharged because of flat feet; at the time of the murder he was 29 years old; married but separated from his wife; the father of five children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">The three-judge court found Melton guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced him to death. He appealed on the grounds that (1) he had been placed in double jeopardy by the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal in violation of his Constitutional rights; (2) the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction of murder in the first degree; and (3) the sentencing court abused its discretion when it fixed the penalty at death.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, after an exhaustive review of the evidence and law applicable to Melton\u2019s contentions, affirmed the judgment and sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>fence. Commonwealth v. Melton, 406 Pa. 343, 178 A.2d 728 (1962). Certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court of the United States, 371 U.S. 851, 83 S.Ct. 93, 9 L.Ed.2d 87 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In his petition to the District Court for habeas corpus relief Melton contended only that rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States had been violated in that he had been subjected to double jeopardy by the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal and \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d when he was sentenced to death despite the fact that he is a \u201cmental defective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In denying Melton\u2019s petition the District Court held with respect to the double jeopardy issue that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had not decided the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal on its \u201cmerits\u201d but had dismissed it for lack of appealability and that \u201ceven if the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had decided the matter on the merits, one would not be justified in holding that double jeopardy was involved in the appeal.\u201d United States v. Hendrick, 218 F.Supp. 293, 295 (E.D. Pa.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s holding that under Pennsylvania law Melton \u201cwaived his protection against being tried again for the same offense by his application for a new trial, since the court considers that the first jeopardy in which he was placed continues until the time of imposition of legal sentence at a subsequent trial.\u201d 218 F.Supp. 295. We are in accord, too, with the District Court\u2019s holding that the Fourteenth Amendment is not offended when the state is the moving party in an appeal from an order of the trial court granting a defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial following a jury\u2019s return of a verdict of guilty. It would serve no useful purpose to elaborate on Judge Van Dusen\u2019s excellent discussion of dispositive state <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and federal decisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As he so well stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-12\">\u201cThe Pennsylvania procedure, as followed in this case, does not violate that standard of permissible process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment since it does not violate \u2018the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty\u2019 and because its continuance would not \u2018violate a \u201cprincipal of justice so rooted in\" the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\u201d \u2019 Bute v. Illinois, 333 U.S. 640, 659, 68 S.Ct. 763, 773, 92 L.Ed. 986 (1948).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-13\">We are further of the opinion that the District Court did not err in holding that the death sentence imposed on Melton did not violate the cruel and unusual punishment provisions of the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-14\">As earlier stated, Melton\u2019s contention that the death sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment is premised on the fact that he is a \u201cmental defective\u201d. He has never contended that he was insane at the time of the murder nor does he contend that he was then unable to distinguish between right and wrong. The record discloses that Melton\u2019s counsel expressly stated at the sentencing proceedings that he was <em>not </em>attempting to prove that his client was insane but was only presenting the evidence as to his client\u2019s mental condition <em>in mitigation </em>of punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">The hard core then of Melton\u2019s contention is that it is \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d to sentence a mental defective to death when he has been convicted of murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-16\">Melton has not cited to us any authority to support his contention in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>The Pennsylvania Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, \u00a7 701, as amended by the Act of December 1, 1959, P.L. 1621, \u00a7 1, 18 P.S. \u00a7 4701 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">\u201cIn cases of pleas of guilty, the court where it determines the crime to be murder of the first degree, shall, at its discretion, impose sentence of death or imprisonment for life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has time and again ruled that a death sentence may be imposed in first degree murder cases even though the defendant \u201cwas a moron or a mental defective * * * or * * * an unstable, mentally defective moron, or was feeble-minded.\u201d Commonwealth v. Smith, 405 Pa. 456, 459, 176 A.2d 619, 620 (1962). In Commonwealth v. Graves, 394 Pa. 429, 147 A.2d 416 (1959) the defendant, a mental defective, entered a plea of guilty to murder generally. After hearing evidence the three-judge sentencing court found him guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced him to death. The Supreme Court rejected his contention that he should have been sentenced to life imprisonment instead of death because he was mentally deficient, and held that the sentencing court had not abused its discretion in imposing the death sentence. In doing so the Court ruled that the scope of its review was limited to a determination whether the sentencing court had abused its discretion in imposing the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">In Commonwealth v. Elliott, 371 Pa. 70, 89 A.2d 782 (1952), the Supreme Court held that the imposition of the death penalty, following a guilty plea, on \u201can aggressive, unstable, dangerous moron who was mentally defective\u201d was not an abuse of discretion on the part of the sentencing court. In doing so, it stated (371 Pa. p. 75, 89 A.2d p. 785):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">\u201cMental deficiency is a fact which always should be and in this case was taken into consideration in determining and fixing the penalty or sentence. However, no case in Pennsylvania has ever decided that a trial Judge or a Supreme Court <em>must, as a matter of law, </em>reduce a sentence from death to life imprisonment because the defendant is an unstable, weak moron or a mental defective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Here, the District Court found that evidence as to Melton\u2019s mental condition was fully explored and considered by the sentencing court and by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in its review of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">The record fully sustains the District Court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">We agree, too, with the District Court\u2019s determination that (218 F.Supp. p. 297):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-13\">\u201cThe punishment imposed in this case is not out of all proportion to the offense disclosed by the record [participation in a robbery during which there were brutal and inhumane beatings of a man (by the defendant and a co-defendant) and his wife (by the co-defendant), resulting in the death of the wife]. * * This punishment is not beyond the \u2018extent\u2019 and \u2018mode permitted by the common law for offenses of a similar nature.\u2019 See quotation from Cooley\u2019s \u2018Constitutional limitations\u2019 in Weems v. United States, supra, 217 U.S. (349) at p. 375, 30 S.Ct. (544) at 552, 54 L.Ed. 793.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-15\">We are of the opinion that the imposition, in a first degree murder case, of a death penalty on a mental defective by a state court which has fully considered the defendant\u2019s mental condition, is not <em>per se </em>violative of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s proscription of cruel and unusual punishment. To hold otherwise would be to \u201cwithdraw the freedom of a State to enforce its own notions of fairness in the administration of criminal justice\u201d,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and to substitute a federal concept of penological policy for that entertained by a state even though the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>policy cannot be said to do violence to the historic meaning of \u201ccruel and unusual punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">For the reasons stated the Order of the District Court will be affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-8\">. The evidence relating to the commission of the crime may be summarized as follows : On December 13, 1958, about 9 P. M., Melton met one Rucker at a bar and suggested to him that they rob the Schloss delicatessen store across the street; Melton led Rucker to the Schloss property and he broke in the pavement cellar door and led the way into the first floor where they encountered 65-year old Schloss; Melton repeatedly struck Schloss on the head with a hatchet until it broke and then beat him time and again with a three foot brass door chime into unconseiousness and again when he regained consciousness ; Rucker attacked 63-year old Mrs. Schloss, beat, kicked and then stabbed her to death with a butcher knife; Melton then beat Schloss with a brass pipe until he disclosed the presence of several hundreds of dollars in a bureau drawer; Melton and Rucker went to a nearby house where Melton \u201cdivided\u201d the proceeds of the robbery-murder, cheating Rucker out of $105 which he had hidden inside his sock; they were arrested shortly thereafter, confessed and reenacted the crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\">.
