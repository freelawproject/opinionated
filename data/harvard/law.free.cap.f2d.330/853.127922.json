In our view Nos. 18,068 and 18,072 should be disposed of first, although they are later in their numbering.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">In No. 18,068, the National Mediation Board appeals from an order issued by the District Court which, among other things, restrains the Board from conducting a representation election.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">In No. 18,072, the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employes appeals from the same order.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">The order appealed from is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-13\">\u201c * * * Ordered That the Board is hereby permanently enjoined from conducting any election among the \u2018Clerical, Office, Stores, Fleet and Passenger Service employees\u2019 of United Air Lines, Inc., in which the form of the ballot does not permit a voting employee to cast a vote against collective bargaining representation, and it is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeq\">\u201cFurther Ordered That the plaintiff\u2019s request that the Board shall conduct a hearing relating to the question of the appropriateness of class or craft of employees among whom the election was to be held, at which hearing the plaintiff could be heard as a party in interest, shall be and the same is hereby remanded to the Board for further consideration in the light of the Court\u2019s conclusion that the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq. gives employees, a right to have a ballot <em>on </em>which <em>they </em>may express a preference for no collective bargaining representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-15\">The opinion of Judge Youngdahl, of the District Court, is found in D.C.D.C., 218 F.Supp. 114 (1963) and is adopted; by us as the opinion of this court. It. follows that the judgment of the District. Court in these cases must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-16\">In No. 17,777, United Air Lines, Inc.. appeals from the dismissal by the District Court of its action filed to enjoin: the election proposed by the National! Mediation Board. The grounds for dismissal of the action are not stated in: the court\u2019s order but, as one of the\u2019 grounds urged was lack of standing on: the part of United Air Lines, we assume-it was on this ground that the suit was-, dismissed. The close question as to. United\u2019s standing, about which there is a dearth of authority, causes us concern. We have decided, however, not to disturb, the District Court\u2019s dismissal, because-our decision in the other two cases affords the relief concerning the form of the ballot which United sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-17\">No. 18,068 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-18\">No. 18,072 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-19\">No. 17,777 is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b906-20\">WRIGHT, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AXi\">(concurring: in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-21\">In No. 17,777 of this consolidated litigation, United Air Lines appeals from: the District Court\u2019s refusal to enjoin the: National Mediation Board from conducting a representation election under Section 2, Ninth, of the Railway Labor Act.. 48 Stat. 1188, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, Ninth. In Nos. 18,068 and 18,072, the National Mediation Board and the Brotherhood of' Railway and Steamship Clerks appeal from the granting of an injunction: against the Board, by the same court through a different judge, restraining it from conducting the same election which, is the subject of the United Air Lines-suit. The second injunction action was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>brought<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by certain employees of United Air Lines who claim to want to represent themselves <em>individually </em>in their labor negotiations with their employer. I agree with the court that in No. 17,777 the United Air Lines injunction proceeding was properly dismissed by the District Court. I respectfully dissent from its affirmance in Nos. 18,068 and 18,072 upholding the issuance of the injunction against the National Mediation Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">Since the United Air Lines suit and the action brought by some of its employees appear to have a common inspiration as well as common issues, I shall treat them together. Both United and its appellee employees, here called ABNE,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> urge two grounds for enjoining the Board from performing its duty under the Act: (1) The Board improperly determined the bargaining unit craft or class to be \u201cclerical, office, stores, fleet and passenger service employees\u201d; and (2) the Board proposes to use in the election a form of ballot which does not provide a space for the employee to vote against representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The craft or class recognized by the Board as the proper bargaining unit for the proposed election is the same as that recognized in its 1947 proceeding. Case No. R-1706, Determinations of Craft or Class of the National Mediation Board (1947). There has been no change in the classification since that time. After \u25a0considering the representations by .United as to the need for change, the Board determined that it would follow its prior ruling. Thus United and ABNE would have the court reweigh these class considerations and substitute its judgment for the Board\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">With reference to the form of ballot, space is provided to vote for either of the competing unions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A third blank space is indicated for voting for a representative not named on the ballot. That same blank space may be used for voting for \u201cno union\u201d or \u201cno representation.\u201d Section 2, Fourth,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Railway Labor Act provides, in part: \u201cThe majority of any craft or class of employees shall have the right to determine who shall be the representative of the craft or class for the purposes of this Act.\u201d Thus, if a majority of the craft or class actually votes for representation, a \u25a0representative may be selected. If a majority fails to vote, the Board may not certify a representative. Radio Officers\u2019 Union, C.T.U.-A. F. of L. v. National Mediation Board, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 319, 181 F.2d 801 (1950). In addition, the admitted practice of the Board is to add the number voting \u201cno union\u201d to the number not voting in determining whether a majority of the employees eligible to vote actually voted for representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">The District Court\u2019s action enjoining the Board from conducting the election here is in the teeth of a host of cases from the Supreme Court, from this court, and from the Circuit Courts around the country. In the interest of economy, I shall simply list <em>seriatim </em>the reasons why this injunction should not have been issued and briefly comment on each.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">1. The District Court was without jurisdiction to enjoin the National Mediation Board from conducting an election to resolve the representation dispute at United Air Lines. Switchmen\u2019s Union of North America v. National Mediation Board, 320 U.S. 297, 64 S.Ct. 95, 88 L.Ed. 61 (1943). In upholding the action of the Board against union attack, the Court in <em>Switchmen\u2019s Union </em>said, \u201c * * * if Congress had desired to implicate the federal judiciary and to place on the federal courts the burden of having the final say <em>on any aspect </em>of the problem, it would have made its desire plain.\u201d 320 U.S. at 303, 64 S.Ct. at 98, 88 L.Ed. 61. (Emphasis added.) Unlike the Na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>tional Labor Relations Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Railway-Labor Act has no provision for judicial review. <em>Switchmen\u2019s Union </em>was reinforced by three other cases<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> handed down by the Supreme Court at the same term, and the force of these decisions has continued, unmodified by Congress, down to the present day.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">2. The ballot which the District Court has ordered changed before an election can be conducted has been used by the Board and its predecessor, the Railway Labor Board, since 1921 in over 3,400 elections. In the 43 years since 1921, Congress has not indicated the slightest disapproval of the Board\u2019s election machinery \u2014 including its ballot. Moreover, no court except the District Court here, in the ABNE case but <em>not </em>in the United case,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> has found this ballot unlawful.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And this court has approved its use as a proper exercise of the Board\u2019s discretion within the intendment of the Act. Decker v. Linea Aeropostal Venezolana, <em>supra </em>Note 7 (see briefs) .<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-15\">3. The Board\u2019s craft or class determination is unreviewable. This court has so held in at least four cases, one at the last term of court. WES Chapter, Flight Eng. Int. Ass\u2019n, A.F.L.-C.I.O. v. National Mediation Bd., <em>supra </em>Note 7; Air Line Stewards &amp; Stewardesses Ass\u2019n, Intern, v. National Mediation Board, <em>supra </em>Note 7; UNA Chapter, Flight Eng. I. Ass\u2019n, A.F.L.-C.I.O. v. National Mediation Bd., <em>supra </em>Note 7; Radio Officers\u2019 Union, C.T. U.-A. F. of L. v. National Mediation Board, <em>supra. </em>The Fourth Circuit, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>Rose v. Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clks., <em>supra </em>Note 7, 181 F.2d at 946, summed it up well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-5\">\u201cIn the light of the decisions of the Supreme Court, there can be no doubt that the effect of this statute was to vest in the Mediation Board exclusive jurisdiction over the <em>certification of bargaining agents, the determination of bargaining units and the classification of employees for the purposes of bargaining. </em>And it is equally clear that the <em>exercise of discretion by the board with respect to such matters is not subject to review by the courts. </em>* * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">4. United Air Lines lacks standing to challenge the Board\u2019s action. The purpose of the Railway Labor Act is to guarantee employees complete freedom to organize \u2014 freedom from employer interference. This Act was passed, as the Government asserts, \u201cto put an end to the harmful consequences of * * * individual dealing between large carriers and small employees. [International Ass\u2019n of] Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740, 760 [81 S.Ct. 1784, 6 L.Ed.2d 1141]; Virginian Ry. v. System Federation, 300 U.S. 515, 553 [57 S.Ct. 592, 81 L.Ed. 789] ; Texas &amp; N. O. R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, 281 U.S. 548, 570 [50 S.Ct. 427, 74 L.Ed. 1034.\u201d United\u2019s obligation under the Act is <em>not \u201cto interfere in any way with the organization of its employees.\u201d </em>Railway Labor Act, \u00a7 2, Fourth. (Emphasis added.) And this obligation includes refraining from filing, or inspiring, litigation designed to block or delay representation elections conducted by the National Mediation Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">5. There is no Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 79 S.Ct. 180, 3 L.Ed.2d 210 (1958), question here. It is not even suggested that the Board has acted contrary to a plainly and expressly defined statutory duty, nor has the Board here conceded that it has so acted, as in <em>Leedom. </em>This principle has been expounded recently by this court in a series of cases so there should be no doubt about its application. WES Chapter, Flight Eng. Int. Ass\u2019n, A.F.L.-C.I.O. v. National Mediation Bd., <em>supra </em>Note 7; Air Line Stewards &amp; Stewardesses Ass\u2019n, Intern, v. National Mediation Board, <em>supra </em>Note 7; UNA Chapter, Flight Eng. I. Ass\u2019n, A.F.L.-C.I.O. v. National Mediation Bd., <em>supra </em>Note 7. In the <em>UNA </em>case we said (111 U.S.App.D.C. at 124, 294 F.2d at 908):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-12\">\u201cAppellant urges, however, that jurisdiction exists under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Leedom v. Kyne, 1958, 358 U.S. 184, 79 S.Ct. 180, 3 L.Ed.2d 210. We cannot agree. In Leedom the Supreme Court carefully differentiated Switchmen\u2019s Union from the case before it, pointing out that the latter did not involve \u2018review\u2019 of agency action, but the striking down of action <em>in excess of delegated powers, in flat violation of the controlling statute </em>\u2014 there the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 141 et seq. See 358 U.S. at pages 188-190, 79 S.Ct. at pages 183-184 [3 L.Ed.2d 210]. It should be noted, also, that in Leedom v. Kyne the National Labor Relations Board <em>did not deny </em>that it had contravened its governing statute. See 358 U.S. at page 187, 79 S.Ct. at page 183 [3 L.Ed.2d 210]. No such admission is made here, and appellant has not pointed out any clear statutory limitation expressed by the Railway Labor Act which has been violated by the NMB. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">6. There is a demonstrable lack of equity in the application for the injunction against holding the election. AB-NE, the no-contract employees\u2019 group, claims it represents more than half of the employees eligible to vote in the election. If so, its remedy is to tell its members either not to vote or to vote for no representation. As shown, if its membership complies with these instructions, there will not be a majority voting for representation and, consequently, no representative will be certified. As in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>dicated during oral argument, this was precisely the result of the voting \u2014 or not voting \u2014 in the representation election held recently at Lake Central Airlines. No irreparable injury is shown, therefore, if the election here is conducted as ordered by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">This litigation is a throwback to the early days of the 1900\u2019s when federal courts were used to deliver individual workmen unrepresented to the bargaining table of their employer. See, <em>e. g. </em>Adair v. United States, 208 U.S. 161, 28 S.Ct. 277, 52 L.Ed. 436 (1908); Adkins v. Children\u2019s Hospital, 261 U.S. 525, 43 S.Ct. 394, 67 L.Ed. 785 (1923). I thought those days were over.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">I regret my inability to agree with my distinguished brethren in respect to this-litigation. Respectfully I dissent from the court\u2019s ruling upholding this injunction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-7\">.
