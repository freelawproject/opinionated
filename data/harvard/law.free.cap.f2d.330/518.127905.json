The resolution recited that the payments were \u201cintended as gifts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Mrs. Evans is the widow of Silliman Evans, Sr., the former publisher of the \u201cTennessean,\u201d and majority stockholder of the Tennessean Newspapers, Inc. She was the principal beneficiary under the Silliman Evans, Sr., will. She was also elected president of the corporation concerned at a salary of $10,000 a year, and she acted as Chairman of the Board of Directors at the meeting which adopted the resolution referred to. The resolu-' tion was drafted by and at the suggestion of a member of the Board of Directors, who was also treasurer and accountant for the corporation, and tax advisor for the corporation and for Mrs. Evans.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The sums paid were disclosed by Mrs. Evans in her income tax reports for the years 1955, 1956 and 1957, but they were not listed as taxable income on the contention that they were gifts, and, hence, excludable under 1954 I.R.C., Sec. 102.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue on administrative review determined that these payments were not gifts within the meaning of Sec. 102, but were \u201cdeath benefits\u201d under the provisions of 1954 I.R.C., Sec. 101<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hence, after giving effect to the $5,000 limitation on such benefits contained in See. 101, he determined tax deficiencies for the years 1955 through 1957 of $3,392.79, $17,239.67 and $9,398.74, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Appellant petitioned the Tax Court for a redetermination of the deficiencies assessed. After trial of the issues before Judge Atkins in Nashville, Tennessee, the Tax Court, in an opinion by Judge Atkins (one j\u2019udge dissenting), relied principally upon Commissioner v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed. 2d 1218 (1960), and found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">\u201cUnder the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, a transfer, in order to qualify as a gift in the statutory sense, must proceed from a detached and disinterested generosity, out of affection, respect, admiration, charity or like impulses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-15\">\u201cUpon careful consideration of the record as a whole, including the evidence showing the control which the petitioner had over the corporation, we think that the payments in question did not proceed from such a detached and disinterested generosity, and that they do not qualify as gifts under the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-16\">\u201cThe fact that the resolution of the board of directors stated that the payments were intended as gifts is not conclusive, since the Supreme Court has made it clear that the transferor\u2019s characterization of his action is not determinative. * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6R\">The Tax Court approved the Commissioner\u2019s determination of tax deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">On appeal to this court we are asked to hold that the record before the Tax Court does not constitute legal support for the court\u2019s finding that the payments were not gifts within the meaning of 1954 I.R.C., Sec. 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-18\">In the leading case on this topic, the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201cprimary weight in this area must be given to the conclusions of the trier of fact.\u201d Duberstein, supra, 363 U.S. at 289, 80 S.Ct. at 1199, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218; and whereas here \u201cthe trial has been by a j\u2019udge without a j\u2019ury, the j'udge\u2019s findings must stand unless \u2018clearly erroneous,\u2019 Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 52(a).\u201d Duberstein, supra, 363 U.S. at 291, 80 S.Ct. at 1200, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-19\">The Tax Court\u2019s findings of fact and opinion are set forth in full in 39 T.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>570. The extent of Silliman Evans, Sr.\u2019s, services to and relationship with the Tennessean Newspapers, Inc., the amount of control over this enterprise of Mrs. Evans and her sons after decedent\u2019s death, the extent of provision for her security made in decedent\u2019s will, and the role played by the corporation\u2019s accountant in suggesting and drafting the \u201cgift\u201d resolution are all set forth in detail, which we do not need to repeat. In all of these factual areas the present ease is clearly distinguishable from Kuntz\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 300 F.2d 849 (C.A. 6, 1962), upon which appellant primarily depends.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Simply put, our review of this record does not serve to convince us that the basic finding of fact contained therein, and which we have quoted above, is \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">For the reasons stated herein, and in the opinion of the Tax Court in this case, 39 T.C. 570, with which we agree, the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-9\">. \u201c\u00a7 102. <em>Gifts and inheritances</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">\u201c(a) General rule. \u2014 Gross income does not include the value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-11\">. \u201c\u00a7 101. <em>Certain death benefits </em>* * *</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah6\">\u201c(b) Employees\u2019 death benefits.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-13\">\u201c(1) General rule. \u2014 Gross income does not include amounts received (whether in a single sum or otherwise) by the heneficiaries or the estate of an employee, if such amounts are paid by or on behalf of an employer and are paid by reason of the death of the employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-21\">\u201c (2) Special rules for paragraph (1).\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-22\">\u201c(A) $5,000 limitation. \u2014 The aggregate amounts excludable under paragraph (1) with respect to the death of any employee shall not exceed $5,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
