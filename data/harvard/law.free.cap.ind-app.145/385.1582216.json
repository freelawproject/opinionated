The final disposition of this case will determine whether or not the easements of the certificate by the Public Service Commission should be approved or whether it should be permanently rescinded, set aside and held for naught and the appellee, Associated Truck Lines, Inc., enjoined from operating over the territory in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Since this is a matter coming up from the Public Service Commission of Indiana, an administrative agency, we sit in judicial review of the order of the Public Service Commission and the record which exists in support of that order. <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Telephone Co. </em>(1940), 217 Ind. 93, 26 N. E. 2d 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The application filed by the appellees requested authority to operate as a common carrier carrying all types of commodities over the following routes: (1) between South Bend and LaPorte; (2) between South Bend and Michigan City; and, (3) between Michigan City and LaPorte.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The basis of the appellants\u2019 argument, and on which they seek an order of this court vacating and setting aside the certificate issued by the Public Service Commission, is fully and .carefully stated in the appellants\u2019 brief and is in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">\u201cThe only proof submitted was with respect to an alleged need for service from Angola and Edinburg to LaPorte; from Angola to LaPorte and Michigan City, and (3) between Michigan City and LaPorte. No witnesses appeared to testify as to a need for service between South Bend and LaPorte and Michigan City. Therefore, Appellants argue that the evidence submitted was beyond the scope of the application and is further indicative of Appellants\u2019 contention that the order granting the application was not supported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">\u201cAppellants further argue that the Commission failed to acknowledge the effect the granting of the application would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>have on all authorities held by the Appellants because Associated can, by a grant of the application, tack the authority granted with other authorities it holds, thereby rendering a service well beyond the published scope of the application. This is contrary to the evidence and contrary to law in that the grant of the authority exceeded that which was applied for and published.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\">\u201cThe order of the Commission dated April 19, 1968, was issued contrary to law in that the Commission on May 13, 1968, prematurely issued the certificate of public convenience and necessity to Associated without expiration of the time limit for filing petitions for reconsideration and rehearing, thereby depriving Appellants of their administrative remedies all of which is contrary to Bums\u2019 Indiana Statutes, Annotated, Section 47-1215.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Brief, pp. 4-5.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Appellants contend that the evidence submitted by the appellee, Associated Truck Lines, Inc., was beyond the scope of the application and that the order of the Public Service Commission was not supported by substantial evidence; that it is contrary to law for the reason that the Commission failed to consider the adequacy of the existing service and the effect that the granting of the application would have on the existing carriers. There has been no objection to the notices issued relative the subject of the application and the time and place of the various hearings. The examiner\u2019s report and recommended order was submitted to the Commission and the parties on March 4, 1968. The appellants filed exceptions to the report and recommended order of the examiner; the appellee filed motion for extension of time to file reply to the exceptions but, the record does not disclose that any reply was actually filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The findings and final order of the Commission which was issued on the 19th day of April, 1968, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">\u201c1. That the Commission has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">\u201c2. That the applicant is an Indiana Corporation with principal place of business at Warsaw, Indiana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u201c3. That the applicant is financially able to conduct and perform the proposed service herein sought by this authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">\u201c4. That the applicant has sufficient equipment to perform the proposed services, and said equipment will be supplied to the public shippers as required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">\u201c5. That the personnel of the applicant company are familiar with the laws of the State of Indiana and the rules and regulations of the Public Service Commission of Indiana, as the same relate to common carriage, and are willing to abide by them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">\u201c6. The granting of this authority will not impair the operations of any other common carrier serving the same territory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">\u201c7. That the Protestants filed timely exceptions to the recommended order of the examiner, and the Applicant filed a motion for extension of time for filing answer brief which was approved; and the recommended order of the examiner should be approved and the Protestant\u2019s exceptions overruled and a certificate of public convenience and necessity should be issued to the Applicant herein to operate motor vehicles as a common carrier of property, intrastate, and it will be so ordered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">\u201cIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED BY THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF INDIANA that a certificate of public convenience and necessity be issued to Associated Truck Lines, Inc., of Indiana, Warsaw, Indiana, to operate motor vehicles as a common carrier of property, intrastate, subject to the performance of the conditions as hereinafter set out as follows, to-wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">\u201cREGULAR ROUTES:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">\n<em>\u201cGeneral Commodities.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-11\">\n<em>\u201cRoute 1.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-12\">\u201cBetween South Bend, Indiana, and LaPorte, Indiana, over Indiana Highway 2 serving all intermediate points.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-13\">\n<em>\u201cRoute 2.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-14\">\u201cBetween Michigan City and LaPorte, Indiana, over U.S. Highway 35 serving all intermediate points.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-15\">\u201cIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the protestants exceptions are overruled, and the recommended order of the examiner is hereby approved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-16\">\u201cIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that no intrastate certificate or permit, as the case may be, shall be issued herein unless applicant has performed each and all of the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>conditions precedent: (1) applicant shall file and at all time thereafter keep on file insurance as provided by law and the Commission\u2019s regulations, and subject to the approval of the Commission; (2) applicant if a common carrier shall file with the Commission three (3) copies of a tariff and if a contract carrier, shall file with the Commission three copies of a schedule of minimum rates together with one copy of each contract, all in accordance with the laws of the State of Indiana and the rules and regulations of this Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\">\u201cIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the entry of this order shall create no property rights or authority to operate for the applicant without the performance of the foregoing requirements, and should applicant fail to qualify as herein-before provided, this order shall be AUTOMATICALLY REVOKED at the expiration of 60 days from its entry herein without further notice or proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">\u201cIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall comply with all applicable provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act of the State of Indiana, 1935, as amended; the applicant shall abide by any and all applicable rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission now in effect or which may hereafter be adopted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">\u201cIT IS FURTHER ORDERED and it is made a condition to the issuance of a certificate or permit, that the holder thereof shall render reasonable, continuous and adequate service to the public in pursuance of the authority herein granted, and that failure so to do shall constitute an abandonment of the rights granted herein and shall operate as a forfeiture of said certificate or permit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">\u201cIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the service contemplated herein may not be instituted by applicant prior to the issuance of the operating authority (certificate of public convenience and necessity or permit).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">\u201cIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Commission retain jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the party or parties hereto for the purpose of issuing any further order or orders as the Commission may deem necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">\n<em>\u201cBAYT, STEIN AND CLANCY CONCUR:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">\u201cAPPROVED: April 19, 1968</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-11\">\u201cI hereby certify that the above is a true and correct copy of the order as approved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-12\">\u201cJ.

The decision, ruling and order of the Public Service Commission of Indiana entitled <em>In the Matter of the Application of Associated Truck Lines, Inc., of Indiana, Warsaw, Indiana, for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to operate motor vehicles as a common carrier of property, intrastate, </em>Docket No. 2747-A, 35, is contrary to law. \u201cDATED: September 30, 1968.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The above assignment presents to this court all questions raised by the appellants\u2019 argument of the appellee, Associated Truck Lines, Inc.\u2019s, answer which are necessary for this court to consider in its review.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">In the argument portion of appellants\u2019 brief, we are presented with several points, all of which we have considered, and find that some of them do not need to be discussed in disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Proposition D of the appellants\u2019 brief reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">\n<em>\u201cThe Order of the Commission Dated April 19, 1968, was Issued Contrary to Law and was Not Supported by Substantial Evidence\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">This covers the scope of the point to which we address ourselves in this opinion, which point is hereinafter set out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-12\">\u201c5. <em>The Commission Failed to Consider the Statutory Criteria of Burns\u2019 Section 4-7-1217\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>We have carefully examined the record including the findings of the Commission which are necessary to support its order. The record fails to disclose that the Commission made any finding of ultimate fact as to the existence of public convenience and necessity. Such finding is necessary to support the Commission\u2019s order. Burns\u2019 1965 Replacement, \u00a7 47-1217. See also: <em>American Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Serv. Comm. of Ind. </em>(1959), 239 Ind. 453, 154 N. E. 2d 512; <em>Kosciusko County, etc. </em>v. <em>Public Service Comm. </em>(1948), 225 Ind. 666, 77 N.

E. 2d 753, at page 613:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">\u201cThe finding that a certificate of public convenience and necessity should be granted is simply a conclusion from all the evidence without any special finding of fact upon which the conclusion can be reached. The Public Service Commission should find the ultimate facts specifically and not generally. The findings of fact must be specific enough to enable the court to review intelligently the Commission\u2019s decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The order of the Public Service Commission granting the certificate to Associated Truck Lines, Incorporated, is hereby reversed and the certificate is vacated and set aside and this cause is remanded to the Commission for further findings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Order reversed, certificate vacated, cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"AP5\">Lowdermilk, P.J., Cooper and Sullivan, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 251 N.
