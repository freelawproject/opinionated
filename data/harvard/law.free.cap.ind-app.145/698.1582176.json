Simpson, the conditional seller, against appellant Norman Z. Flick, the conditional purchaser, for breach of contract to purchase and for possession of real estate. Failure to pay taxes was the breach alleged. The day before trial appellant filed a written motion for continuance which was promptly overruled. The next day, at the beginning of the trial, appellant\u2019s counsel orally requested a continuance because of appellant\u2019s alleged physical inability to be present. Appellant\u2019s two attorneys left the court room after the continuance was de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>nied, and the trial was conducted in the absence of appellant and of his counsel. Before counsel left, however, a telegram from appellant to one of his attorneys, dated the day before trial, was offered by them and admitted into evidence. It stated that appellant had to leave town immediately due to an unspecified emergency and that he understood the case was probably continued. Also before counsel were excused, appellant\u2019s deposition was published and offered into evidence by appellee (but there is no record that it was admitted or that it was read to or by the court).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">After hearing several witnesses, the trial court awarded plaintiff-appellee judgment for $968.36 damages, $500.00 attorney fees, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Defendant-appellant filed a motion for a new trial in which the grounds were stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">\u201c1. Irregularities in the proceeding of the Court and orders of the Court, and abuse of the Court\u2019s discretion by which the defendant was prevented from having a fair trial, in this, to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">\u201c (a) That the Court erred in refusing and overruling defendant\u2019s Motion for Continuance of the cause having been duly filed in writing on May 8, 1967;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\">\u201c(b) That the Court erred in refusing and overruling defendant\u2019s Petition to Add Second and Third Paragraphs of Answer having been duly filed in writing on May 8, 1967;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-10\">\u201c(c) Error of Law occurring at the trial in this to wit: that the Court erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s Motion for Continuance orally made by counsel for defendant at the opening of the trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-11\">\u201c(d) That the judgment of the Court is contrary to law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-12\">\u201c (e) That the judgment of the Court is not substantiated by sufficient evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">No memorandum was filed. The overruling of the motion is the sole error assigned on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-14\">On July 19, 1968, appellee filed a motion to dismiss or affirm. By order of this court entered November 1, 1968, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>motion to dismiss was overruled and the motion to affirm was held in abeyance pending determination of the case on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The basis of the motion to affirm as to grounds (a), (b), and (c) of the motion for new trial is that said grounds were waived by defects in appellant\u2019s brief. These defects as to grounds (a) and (c) were cured by the filing (with leave of court) of the amended appellant\u2019s brief. (Ground [b] was again waived by failure to argue it in the amended brief.) As to grounds (d) and (e) of the motion for new trial, the basis of the motion to affirm is that these grounds were not supported by a memorandum. Supreme Court Rule 1-14B states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">\u201cWhenever a new trial is requested on the ground or grounds \u2018that the verdict or decision is not sustained by sufficient evidence or is contrary to law,\u2019 the moving party shall file a memorandum stating specifically under such itemized cause wherein such evidence is insufficient or the verdict or decision is contrary to law. The party filing such motion shall be deemed to have waived any ground not specified in the memorandum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Appellant contends that no memorandum is required because he has not asserted that the <em>decision </em>is not sustained by sufficient evidence or is contrary to law, but has stated as grounds (d) and (e) of his new trial motion that the <em>judgment </em>is not so sustained and is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"ApX\">The fallacy of appellant\u2019s argument is that a judgment is never sustained by evidence. It depends for its sustenance on the jury\u2019s <em>verdict </em>or the court\u2019s <em>finding </em>or <em>decision. </em>If the judgment does not conform to the verdict, finding, or decision it is unquestionably contrary to law, but the remedy is not a new trial. The remedy is a correction of the judgment to conform. And the remedy is applied for by a written motion to correct judgment. <em>Branson </em>v. <em>Studebaker, </em>133 Ind. 147, 162, 33 N. E. 98 (1892).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">It is for that very logical reason that the statute which specifies the grounds for a new trial makes no mention of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>\u00a1judgment, but does state, as the sixth ground: \u201cThat the verdict or decision is not sustained by sufficient evidence, or is contrary to law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ar1\">We would be receptive to an argument based on authorities appellant .cites<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that \u201cjudgment,\u201d as used in the motion for new trial should be construed as \u201cdecision.\u201d That would make \u201cgrounds\u201d out of what otherwise are mere surplusage in appellant\u2019s motion. But it would not aid appellant if we so held, because the above quoted Supreme Court of Indiana Rule 1-14B requires us to deem such grounds waived unless a memorandum filed by the moving party states specifically wherein such evidence is insufficient or the decision is contrary to law. The rule is binding on us and we are without jurisdiction to question its wisdom or fairness, nor to sanction its evasion by calling a \u201cdecision\u201d a \u201cjudgment.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>We therefore deem appellant\u2019s \u201cgrounds\u201d (d) and (e) of his motion for new trial to have been waived by his failure to specify by memorandum wherein such evidence is insufficient or the \u201cjudgment\u201d (i.e., decision) is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">This leaves us with but two claimed errors to consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">\u201c (a) That the Court erred in refusing and overruling the defendant\u2019s [appellant\u2019s] Motion for Continuance of the cause having been duly filed in writing on May 8, 1967.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">\u201c(c) Error of Law occurring at the trial, in this, to-wit: that the court erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s Motion for Continuance orally made by counsel for defendant [appellant] at the opening of the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">As to ground (a) \u2014the court erred in overruling the written motion for continuance \u2014 appellant contends a continuance is mandated by Burns IND. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 2-1519, (1968 Repl.) which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\">\u201cEvery deposition intended to be read in evidence, must be filed in court at least one [1] day before the time at which the .cause in which the deposition is to be used stands on the docket for trial ,* or, if filed afterwards and claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>to be used, on the trial, the adverse party shall be entitled to a continuance, at the costs of the party filing the deposition, upon showing good cause by affidavit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">The record shows the deposition was filed a day before the trial as required by the statute. The cause was set for trial on May 9, 1967. The Entry Docket entry for May 8, 1967, from the Office of the Clerk of Marion County, shows the filing on that date of the defendant\u2019s deposition by the plaintiff. It is true that the deposition was not published until the day of the trial. However, it was timely filed and this is all that is required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"AIc\">In addition to the fact that appellee did not violate Burns IND. STAT. ANN. \u00a72-1519 (1968 RepL), it is evident that the appellant <em>did </em>violate the statute. The statute demands that good cause be shown by affidavit. The appellant failed to file any affidavit. This failure would be sufficient reason for the lower court to refuse to grant a continuance even if the deposition had not been timely filed. Furthermore, neither the written motion for continuance nor the later oral motion was on the ground the deposition had not been timely filed. Neither motion made any mention of the deposition. No objection was made to the motion to publish the deposition and no objection was made when it was offered into evidence. (At that time appellant\u2019s counsel had not yet ceased to participate in the trial.) The reasons stated in the written motion for continuance have not been discussed here on appeal and are therefore waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">There was no abuse of discretion or other error in overruling appellant\u2019s written motion for continuance or in denying him a continuance at that time (i.e., the day before trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">This brings us to ground (c) \u2014 the court erred in overruling the oral motion for continuance made at the beginning of the trial. Appellant\u2019s basis for his oral motion for a continuance was a reiteration of his written motion and his attorney\u2019s statement that he was physically unable to be in court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>day. His attorneys produced and introduced into evidence a telegram sent from Indianapolis the day before by the appellant stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">\u201cMR DEWITT [appellant\u2019s attorney] AN EMERGENCY HAS AROSE HAVE TO LEAVE TOWN IMMEDIATELY AN EARLIER CONVERSATION WITH YOUR OFFICE I UNDERSTOOD THE CASE OF V 0 SIMPSON WAS PROBABLY CONTINUED WILL CONTACT YOU IN A FEW DAYS SINCERELY YOURS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axa\">NORMAN FLICK\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">This wholy unverified telegram was the sole evidentiary support for appellant\u2019s oral motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayn\">The unavoidable absence of a party is good cause for a continuance. <em>Welcome </em>v. <em>Boswell, </em>54 Ind. 297 (1876) ; <em>Post </em>v. <em>Cecil, </em>11 Ind. App. 362, 39 N. E. 222 (1894). Although discretionary with the court, a continuance should not be denied, except for weighty reasons, when the application therefore is proper and shows good cause, since it is an important privilege of a party to be present at his own trial. <em>Pate, Exr. </em>v. <em>Tait, </em>72 Ind. 450 (1880); <em>Deacon </em>v. <em>Rasch, </em>40 Ind. App. 77, 81 N. E. 84 (1907) ; <em>Schwartz, Adm\u2019r. </em>v. <em>Parsons, Guardian, </em>22 Ind. App. 340, 53 N. E. 785 (1899). But it is not error to deny a continuance when the party fails to show a sufficient reason for his absence. <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Ratliff, </em>94 Ind. 583 (1884). <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>49 Ind. 332 (1874); <em>McBride </em>v. <em>Stradley, </em>103 Ind. 465, <em>2 </em>N. E. 358 (1885) ; <em>In re Holovachka, </em>245 Ind. 483, 198 N. E. 2d 381, cert. den. 379 U. S. 974, 85 S. Ct. 665, 13 L. Ed. 2d 565 (1964). It is the duty of a judge to dispatch the business of the court as expeditiously as is consistent with orderly procedure and the administration of justice. <em>Kroll </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>127 Ind. App. 178, 182, 139 N. E. 2d 573 (1957). For that purpose courts are endowed with large administrative discretion. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Youngblood, </em>226 Ind. 165, 170, 78 N. E. 2d 663 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the telegram was evidence of probative value tending to prove his counsel\u2019s unsworn asser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>tion that appellant was physically unable to be present, it was nevertheless, the duty of the trial judge to weigh its probative value against the possible injustice to appellee who was present by counsel with witnesses, as well as the possible injustice to all other persons whose matters in litigation could be delayed by failure to dispose of this case at the appointed time. In finding, as he apparently did, that the evidence of appellant\u2019s physical inability to attend was insufficient to outweigh these other considerations, it would appear that the trial judge exercised a sound discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">While appellant\u2019s assertion that the trial judge abused his discretion lacks even the appearance of substantiation there is some basis (more apparent than real, perhaps) for the charge that the judge delegated his discretion to appellee\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">In support of that contention, appellant quotes the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I shall ask counsel for the plaintiff point blank, do you want the Court to reconsider its former ruling ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">\u201cMR. FOSTER: No, I do not. We feel there is no grounds for continuance and the evidence is well known to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, it is your lawsuit and not mine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">It will be noted that it is not about the ruling on the motion for a continuance that the court questioned appellee\u2019s counsel, but as to whether a reconsideration of that ruling was desired. The judge had already given extended consideration to the motion, listening to lengthy statements from the attorneys for both parties, examining the telegram, and making certain that appellant\u2019s deposition was available, before he denied the motion and ordered the trial to proceed. He made no suggestion at that time that he would consider deferring to anyone\u2019s pleasure concerning whether the trial should proceed or be delayed. It was not until the two attorneys who were present in behalf of appellant had asked leave of court to be excused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>from the courtroom that the court asked appellee\u2019s attorney whether he wished the court to reconsider the former ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The layman with little courtroom experience could well have considered this question a display of bias in favor of the appellee. The experienced trial lawyer, however, would recognize immediately that the court was merely soliciting the opinion of appellee\u2019s attorney as to the possibility that the denial of the continuance might later be considered reversible error. We think appellant draws much too broad an implication from the court\u2019s question when he says it \u201creflects an implied concession on the part of the court below that error was being committed, but left it to the <em>discretion of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel </em>as to whether or not it should be committed.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s emphasis.) Conceding that the court was obviously concerned with the possibility that his ruling might be held to be reversible error and that he considered appellee\u2019s counsel (as the only attorney about to participate in the trial) to be assuming the risk of reversal if the trial did proceed, we fail to see anything wrong in asking for his advice at that point and nothing wrong in following it. Both the original ruling and its reaiflrmance were the obvious result of considering and weighing the contrary advice of counsel for both parties. Such procedure appears as the very opposite of arbitrary or capricious conduct or the delegation of discretionary power to rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Appellant\u2019s counsel argue that appellant was harmed by the denial of the continuance in that \u201cthe defendant [appellant] was denied the right of producing the receipts [for the payment of the taxes] and interrogating witness Dobkins [the deputy treasurer who testified taxes were delinquent] concerning them.\u201d Also that it prevented appellant from subpoenaing \u201cthe Auditor and Assessor concerning the payment records of their offices.\u201d Nowhere, however, is it asserted in any manner (beyond the feeblest insinuation) that appellant could, at any date subsequent to the trial, have produced any receipt for the taxes Dobkins testified were unpaid or that either the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Auditor or Assessor\u2019s records would have shown any payments not shown on the treasurer\u2019s records.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Furthermore, there is no attempt to explain in what manner appellant\u2019s presence was essential to the production of the receipts and the cross examination of Mr. Dobkins concerning the receipts. It would seem reasonable to suppose that one of appellant\u2019s two attorneys who walked out could have brought the receipts to the trial and could have conducted the cross examination with more skill than could appellant who was never shown to have been admitted to the bar or to be learned in the law. The absence of these attorneys was not shown to be other than by their free choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Had appellant shown an abuse of discretion in denying him a continuance, which we hold he has failed to show, he would nevertheless fail in this appeal for want of a showing that he was harmed by the denial. <em>Freimann </em>v. <em>Gallmeier, </em>116 Ind.

Ct. </em>(1958), 238 Ind. 637, 645, 153 N. E. 2d 327; <em>Miller Monuments, Inc. </em>v. <em>Asbestos Insulating, etc. </em>(1962), 134 Ind. App. 48, 51, 185 N. E. 2d 533. One reason for that rule is that the appellee has no opportunity to answer a reply brief. <em>McBeth Evans Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1911), 176 Ind. 221, 224, 95 N. E. 567; <em>Michaels </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1967), 140 Ind. App. 389, 392, 223 N. E. 2d 585, 225 N. E. 2d 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">If appellee had had an opportunity to answer appellant\u2019s new argument that filing \u201con the day prior to trial ... is not \u2018one day\u2019 in advance of trial as the pertinent statute requires,\u201d he may well have called our attention to the following cases:</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">In <em>State ex rel. Durham </em>v. <em>Marion Circuit Court </em>(1959), 240 Ind. 132, 135, 162 N. E. 2d 505, the Supreme Court of Indiana said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">\u201cThe relator claims the necessary five days did not elapse \u2018from the time the accusation was presented\u2019 to the day the relator herein was cited to appear. The citation to appear was issued on August 26, 1959 for Durham to appear on August 31, 1959.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-9\">\u201cBurns\u2019 \u00a7 2-4704 reads as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-10\">\u201c <em>\u2018Computation of time </em>\u2014 The time within which an act is to be done, as herein provided, shall be computed by excluding the first day and including the last. If the last day be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Sunday, it shall be excluded. [Acts 1881 (Spec. Sess.), ch. 38, \u00a7 849, p. 240.]\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">\u201cSince the statute makes no reference to calculations of fractional parts of the day and there is no evidence here when, on August 26th \u2018the accusation was presented,\u2019 we have no grounds for holding that less than five days elapsed. The relator points to the record which shows that the citation was received in the sheriff\u2019s office at 1:41 p.m. on August 26th. This, however, is no evidence of when the accusation \u2018was presented\u2019 in court and the point from which the time begins to run. We hold there is no showing made that less than the statutory period of five days had run at the time the relator Durham was cited to appear.\u201d (240 Ind. at 135.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">In <em>Keeling </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals </em>(1946), 117 Ind. App. 314, 320, 69 N. E. 2d 613, a rule of the board of zoning appeals required that notice \u201cbe given by the petitioner by leaving or mailing said notice to the residence, or last known address, of the interested party, or parties, at least five (5) days before the date of hearing. . . .\u201d We there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">\u201cThe application for a variance was filed by appellee churches with the Board of Zoning Appeals on August 16, 1945, and the hearing thereon was set for August 27, 1945. Notice on the prescribed forms was served upon the interested parties involved as property owners by registered mail, posted on August 22, 1945. Service of notice so served was proved by the required affidavit filed with the board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">\u201cSection 29 of the zoning ordinance provides that notice of a hearing must be published \u2018at least seven (7) days prior to the time fixed for such hearing.\u2019 Publication of notice of the hearing was made on August 20, 1945, and proof of such publication duly filed with the board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">\u201cIt is asserted by appellants that the notice given as aforesaid was insufficient under the requirements of \u00a7 29 of the zoning ordinance and Article VII of the rules of procedure, <em>supra. </em>Appellants\u2019 contention is based upon the proposition that five and seven full days of 24 hours each must elapse prior to the day of the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">\u201cSection 2-4704, Burns\u2019 1946 Replacement, provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANd0\">\u2018The time within which an act is to be done as hereinafter provided, shall be computed by excluding the first day and including the last.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>\u201cIt has been uniformly held by both the Supreme Court and this court that notice such as was given in the instant case is sufficient under the requirements of the foregoing statute. <em>Moag </em>v. <em>State </em>(1941), 218 Ind. 135, 31 N. E. 2d 629; <em>Mockford </em>v. <em>Iles </em>(1940), 217 Ind. 137, 26 N. E. 2d 42; <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Tuhey </em>(1895), 13 Ind. App. 74, 75, 40 N. E. 144; <em>Sexton </em>v. <em>Goodwine </em>(1904), 33 Ind. App. 329, 330, 68 N. E. 929.\u201d (117 Ind. App. at 320.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Appellant did not mention the alleged late filing of the deposition in his written or oral motion for a continuance and filed no affidavit whatsoever in any of his attempts to show that he had good cause for a continuance. He has never attempted to show that he was prejudiced by the \u201clate\u201d filing or that his situation would have been altered one iota had the deposition been filed one, or two, or ten days earlier. Nor did he object to the introduction of the deposition into evidence at the very time he was arguing that he should have a continuance on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">As we pointed out in our first opinion, appellant\u2019s failure to file an affidavit showing good cause for continuance \u201cwould be sufficient reason for the lower court to refuse to grant a continuance even if the deposition had not been timely filed.\u201d (252 N. E. 2d at 511, 19 Ind. Dec. at 374.)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The petition for rehearing denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Hoffman, P.J., Pfaff and Sharp, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 225 N.

E. 2d 702. Appellant\u2019s reply brief is not a trial court pleading to which a demurrer may be addressed and this new argument is not, strictly speaking, a \u201cdeparture\u201d. However, the analogy between a new argument for reversal in a reply brief and a new cause of action in a reply, is so great that the ultimate fate of both is the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
