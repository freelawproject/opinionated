[Acts 1929, ch. 172, \u00a7 24, p. 536; 1947, ch. 162, \u00a7 2, p. 523; 1961, ch. 101, \u00a7 1, p. 202.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The Appellant filed his Form 9, Application for Relief, with the Industrial Board on September 7, 1965, alleging disability from an accident which occurred on January 6, 1959, but which disability did not manifest itself until September 8, 1963. The Industrial Board dismissed Appellant\u2019s application finding that said application was not filed before January 7, 1961, and hence was barred by the statute of limitations as found in Burns\u2019 Indiana Statutes Annotated, \u00a7 40-1224. The sole assignment of error here is that the decision of the Industrial Board is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Prior to 1947 this section of the statute barred claims unless filed within two years \u201cafter the injury.\u201d In 1947, the statute was amended providing claims were barred unless filed two years \u201cafter the occurrence of the accident.\u201d The proviso with reference to radiation injuries was added by Acts 1961, chapter 101, \u00a7 1. There is no contention here that Appellant\u2019s condition is in any way connected with radiation.</p>\n<p id=\"A-9V\">The legislative intent of \u00a7 40-1224 is clear. With the exception of radiation injuries, the right is forever barred unless a claim is filed within two years after the occurrence of the accident or if death results, within two years after such death. This interpretation was clearly inferred in <em>Railway Express Agency </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>119 Ind. App. 595, 88 N. E. 2d 175 (1949), and explicitly stated by this court in <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Marhoefer Packing Co., </em>144 Ind. App. 220, 245 N. E. 2d 685 (1969). See also Small, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of Indiana, \u00a7 12.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Therefore, the Appellant\u2019s claim was barred by the statute of limitations as found in Burns\u2019 Indiana Statutes Annotated, \u00a7 40-1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The decision of the Industrial Board shall be and is affirmed. Costs v. Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Pfaff, C.J., Hoffman and White, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 251 N. E. 2d 489.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
