App. 60, 231 N. E. 2d 864, at page 867, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-11\">\u201cDisregarding this immaterial evidence, there is uncontradicted testimony of two witnesses that the two children were dependent on the decedent. In the case <em>King </em>v. <em>Illinois Steel Corp., supra, </em>we held that where the facts are uncontradicted the determination of dependency is a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">By direct reference to the case of <em>King </em>v. <em>Illinois Steel Corp. </em>(1931), 92 Ind. App. 456, 176 N. E. 161, we feel that the only possible construction of the above paragraph is that our opinion held that the appellants, Dwight McDade and Duane Louis McDade were dependents as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">Our opinion and order did not authorize the Board to make a determination of dependency as a matter of law but, only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the right to make a finding of fact on the evidence with reference to the degree of dependency as either full or partial dependents, and to enter an award based upon such finding not inconsistent with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">This cause is again remanded to the Industrial Board to make a finding of fact as to the degree of dependency and to enter an award upon such finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Lowdermilk, P.J., Cooper and Sullivan, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 251 N.
