In a prosecution for wilfully neglecting to provide for an infant child, where the State\u2019s Attorney requested the mother, while testifying, to hold the child up beside the respondent so the jury could observe its features, an objection to the exhibition, not made until after it occurred, came too late, it not appearing but that there was sufficient time to interpose an objection before the exhibition was made.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b190-16\">3. Although the respondent conceded that the child was unable to take care of itself, evidence that it was injured in an accident and was still suffering from the injuries was admissible as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>bearing on the question of wilf illness; it being presumed that the respondent knew the child\u2019s condition, the contrary not appearing.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b191-5\">4.

L. 3536, by wilfully neglecting to provide for the support and maintenance of his child which is under the age of sixteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">The respondent denies that he is the father of the child. The child\u2019s mother and the respondent were married September 30, 1914, and the child was born April 8, 1915.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> Euzeba Thibedeau, a witness called by the respondent, testified in chief that he heard the respondent say, just previous to the marriage, that he had not been with her (the child\u2019s mother) for five months. He was then asked: \u201cQ. State whether or not Ida (the child\u2019s mother) said anything to Zebe\u2019s statement that he hadn\u2019t been with her for five months?\u201d The form of this question was objected to and the answer was excluded, subject to the respondent\u2019s exception. We-think the form of the question unobjectionable, but we cannot say from what appears that its exclusion constitutes reversible error. The record does not disclose what the examiner desired or expected to show by the answer, and we cannot infer that it would have been favorable to the respondent. Unless it would have been favorable to him, he was not harmed by its exclusion. It is not enough that the excepting party allege error. He assumes the burden of showing that he has been prejudiced thereby. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>94 Vt. 423, 111 Atl. 701; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Martin et al., </em>93 Vt. 111, 128, 106 Atl. 666. This the respondent has not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>While the child\u2019s mother was testifying, the State\u2019s Attorney requested her to hold the child up beside the respondent so the jury could observe its features. Counsel for the respondent inquired the purpose of this, but did not object, or say anything more, until after the request had been complied with, when he objected \u201cto the proceeding and to the exhibition as it was made, \u2019 \u2019 and an exception was allowed. The record does not show how the exhibition was made, so that part of the exception is without merit. The objection and exception came too late to avail the respondent. It does not appear but that he had sufficient time to interpose an objection before the exhibition was made. Moreover, he has not shown, or attempted to show, that he was harmed by what occurred, and the exception, therefore, falls within the rule above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The mother, while testifying, was a,sked to tell the jury what had happened to the child, whereupon the respondent conceded that it was unable to take care of itself, and objected to any evidence of its condition. The exceptions show that the objection was overruled and the respondent had an exception,, but do not show that the question was answered. This, of course, saves nothing for review. The transcript is referred to and made a part of the bill of exceptions \u201cas to the tendency of the evidence,\u201d but is not referred to to show what the exceptions are, nor is it made controlling. It is doubtful if this reference permits an examination of the transcript for the purpose of ascertaining whether the question was answered, and, if so, the character of the evidence given; but, assuming that it does, error is not shown. The answer was in substance that the child was injured in an accident about a year before the trial, and that it was still suffering from those injuries. If the respondent knew the child\u2019s condition, and it must be presumed in the circumstances that he did, the contrary not appearing, the evidence clearly had a bearing on the elements of wilfulness. The stronger the appeal for financial aid the stronger the inference that a failure to respond to such appeal was intentional and by design, and therefore wilful.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Subject to\u2019the respondent\u2019s exception that there \u201cis no controversy about his earnings, \u2019 \u2019 the State was permitted to show what wages the respondent received. Where, as here, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>charge is a <em>wilful </em>neglect to support, the pecuniary ability of. the respondent is material. The evidence was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\n<em>Judgment that there is no error in the proceedings, and that the respondent takes nothing by his exceptions. Let execution be done.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
