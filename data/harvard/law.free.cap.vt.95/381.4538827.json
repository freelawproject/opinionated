In an action for alienating the affections of plaintiff\u2019s wife, complaints made by the wife of the-plaintiff\u2019s conduct toward her while they were living together and before the defendant had interfered with their relations, but not afterwards, are admissible in behalf of the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b408-6\">2.

Argument by plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the route taken by the wife in going from her house to the defendant\u2019s on a certain occasion took her out of sight of the neighbors was justified by evidence that such route was out of sight of the only neighbors mentioned for much, if not all, of the way.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b408-14\">6.

The mother of plaintiff\u2019s wife who testified for the defendant was not, in a legal sense, equally available to the plaintiff as a witness, and it was not error to permit his counsel to ask the. jury to draw an adverse inference from her failure to testify to a certain important fact.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b408-20\">9.

An adverse inference arises from the failure of the party calling a witness to question him on a particular matter within the witness\u2019 knowledge, although the evidence would be merely corroborative of that of another witness for the same party.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b408-24\">11. The nature of an action for alienating the affections of plaintiff\u2019s wife is such as to justify exemplary damages in most, if not all, cases, and an instruction authorizing such damages was proper where there was evidence to show'that defendant\u2019s acts were deliberate, intentional, and persistent, and were carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>out under circumstances of aggravation and in wanton disregard of plaintiff\u2019s marital rights.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b409-5\">12. Evidence tending to show that defendant\u2019s attentions to plaintiff\u2019s wife resulted in her leaving her husband, and, with full knowledge of the situation, were persisted in thereafter under circumstances indicating an improper intimacy, was sufficient to warrant the court\u2019s charge on the subject of defendant\u2019s interference with a reconciliation between plaintiff and his wife.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b409-6\">Action ok Tort for the alienation of the affections of the plaintiff\u2019s wife.

The verdict was for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleges error.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\"><bracketnum>[1-3]</bracketnum> Mrs. Haywood, the mother of Mrs. Button, wife of the plaintiff, was a witness for the defendant. After testifying that she had visited at her daughter\u2019s at different times, she was asked in direct examination if Mrs.* Button had complained to her of the plaintiff\u2019s conduct toward her. Upon plaintiff\u2019s objection, the question was excluded, and an exception saved.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">It had appeared that Mrs. Button left her husband in October, 1917, and never returned to him. The plaintiff claimed that her action was the result of the defendant\u2019s influence over her. The defendant claimed that she left the plaintiff on account of his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">It is quite probable that the examining attorney intended the question under consideration to refer to the occasions when Mrs. Haywood was visiting her daughter, as she had just testified, and that these visits were at a time when Mr. and Mrs. Button were living together, and before the defendant had interfered with their relations. If so, the question would relate to admissible matter. <em>Fratini </em>v. Caslini, 66 Vt. 273, 29 Atl. 252, 44 A. S. R. 843. But this does not affirmatively appear. The ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>tion was not limited to that time. The ruling was in plaintiff\u2019s favor, and we must construe the record in a way to support it, if it can reasonably be, done. The question, then, was unlimited as to time, and inadmissible. As shown by the ease just cited, complaints of this character made after the trouble over or relations with the defendant began are to be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The same\" witness -testified that Mrs. Button had lived with her since she left her husband, and that the defendant had made his home, there during a part of that time. Sh.e was asked if she had seen any improper conduct between her daughter and the defendant, and replied that she had not. An objection being then made, the court ruled that the question was improper, as calling for the conclusion of the witness, and that the evidence might be \u201cleft out,\u201d which counsel treat as meaning that the answer be stricken out. \u201cWhile, in a way, the question called for the witness\u2019\" opinion, since it involved her construction of the conduct of the parties, it comes within the exception of the rule excluding opinion evidence. It cannot be distinguished from the evidence involved in <em>Re Clogston\u2019s Est., </em>93 Vt. 46, 106 Atl. 594, wherein we held that one might testify that he never saw a designated person misuse or abuse another, or other examples of this class of testimony collected in <em>State </em>v. <em>Fetch, </em>92 Vt. 477, 105 Atl. 23. Nevertheless, the ruling under consideration was not erroneous. No foundation for this evidence was laid. <em>Fowlie\u2019s Admx. </em>v. <em>McDonald, Cutler &amp; Co., </em>82 Vt. 230, 72 Atl. 989. \u201cWhile such testimony is not the statement of an opinion in a full sense of the term, and in many cases partakes largely of the character of a statement of fact, it is treated like an expression of an opinion by a lay Avitness, and a foundation must first be laid. Judge Peck correctly says, in <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em>45 Vt. 474, that in the circumstances there specified the witness is allowed to <em>add </em>his conclusion, judgment, or opinion. The requirement of the rule that, before such evidence is receivable, the witness must state, so far as practicable, the facts and circumstances on which he bases his conclusion, is expressly recognized in <em>Re Clogston\u2019s Will; supra, </em>for this was assumed in support of the ruling under review. Such facts and circumstances, be they few or many, must first be testified to by the witness. <em>Hathaway\u2019s Admr. </em>v. <em>National Life Insurance Co., </em>48 Vt. 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> It appeared that at the time the trouble between the Bhttons culminated, D. M. Cutler and his wife lived just across <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>the road from the plaintiff\u2019s house, and that the defendant\u2019s buildings were a few rods below on the same side of the road as the plaintiff\u2019s, and in plain sight from the Cutler place; that on a certain occasion, Mrs. Button went to the defendant\u2019s place, and, instead of going down the road, she went through the fields and woods, and approached the defendant\u2019s buildings from the rear. In argument, counsel for the plaintiff asserted that the route taken by Mrs. Button at this time took her out of the sight of the neighbors. To this the defendant excepted. The argument was justified by the evidence. It appeared from the testimony of several witnesses that one going to the defendant\u2019s by the route selected by Mrs. Button would be out of the sight of the Cutlers for much, if not all the way. So far as appears, the Cutlers were the only neighbors that could have been referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> The evidence tended to show that the defendant had carried Mrs. Button in his automobile to various places on different occasions after she left the plaintiff \u2014 usually on business connected with the divorce proceedings instituted by her. Counsel for the plaintiff argued that there was no evidence that the defendant had been paid a penny for the use of his car. To this the defendant excepted. The only evidence that the defendant was paid for any of this service was that Mrs. Haywood paid him for bringing Mrs. Button and her witnesses to Montpelier at the time the divorce case was tried. When this exception was taken, attention was called to this evidence, and counsel modified his statement by saying that all the record showed was that the defendant had received six dollars from Mrs. Haywood. In fact, the amount paid by Mrs. Haywood was not stated by any witness; but counsel for the defendant remembered it that the evidence disclosed the amount of this payment. The court\u2019s recollection was that the defendant testified that the amount was six dollars, but left it to the jury to say how it was. The modification of the original statement cured any error therein, and no exception was taken to the qualified statement. The whole incident was harmless, and no error resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> The evidence tended to show that while Mrs. Button and the defendant lived at Mrs. Haywood\u2019s they never Avent to ride together unless some one else was with them. Counsel for the plaintiff argued that it was understood in the Haywood home that they should not be seen out together alone. The defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>The only justification for this argument is found in a single statement in the testimony of Alice Trombley. After she had testified that these parties never went to ride alone, she was asked if that was talked about in the Haywood house, and she replied that it was. That this was enough to warrant a statement that it was understood there that these parties did not, in fact, go out riding alone, is plain enough. But to say that this was enough to warrant the statement that there was an understanding that they should not be seen out together alone is going too far. The former is a mere assertion of fact. The latter implies a prearranged course of conduct. But there is not enough to the misstatement to warrant a reversal. It is not made to appear that the defendant was harmed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\"><bracketnum>[8-10]</bracketnum> Mrs. Button was a witness for the defendant. She testified that, on the occasion when she went to the defendant\u2019s as above stated, she went to look at a buggy, and that she did this at the request of Mrs. Haywood, who was intending to buy the buggy. When Mrs. Haywood was on the stand as a witness for the defendant, he did not ask her anything about this buggy, nor did the plaintiff on cross-examination. In the closing argument, counsel for the plaintiff referred to this omission, asking the jury to draw an inference therefrom unfavorable to the defendant. The latter excepted. In support of this' exception, it is argued that the witness was as available to the plaintiff as to the defendant, in which eases no adverse inference arises. But the witness was not, in a legal sense, equally available to the plaintiff. She was the mother of the \u201cwoman in the case\u201d\u2014 one vitally interested in the defendant\u2019s success. The presumption is that a witness is more favorable to the party calling him than to the other <em>(Seward </em>v. <em>Garlin, </em>33 Vt. 583), and one is not bound to invade the \u201ccamp of the enemy\u201d seeking evidence. <em>Fonda </em>v. <em>St. Paul City Ry. Co., </em>71 Minn. 438, 74 N. W. 166, 70 A. S. R. 341. It is said by some that no adverse inference arises when the sole purpose of the inquiry would be corroborative or cumulative; but this is not our rule as is plainly shown by <em>Seward </em>v. <em>Gendin. </em>The case in hand comes well within that decision, though the person there to be corroborated was a party, while here she was a witness, merely. During the colloquy over this matter, some expressions were indulged in that were improper, and should have been omitted; but no error resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number><bracketnum>[11]</bracketnum> The defendant excepted to that part of the charge which allowed the jury to award exemplary damages. The nature of the action is such as to justify'such damages in most, if not all cases. Men who pay their addresses to other men\u2019s wives usually know what they are doing and how their conduct comports with the proprieties, both legal and moral; and, to quote from <em>Mathies </em>v. <em>Mazet, </em>164 Pa. 580, 30 Atl. 434, \u201cit will be an evil day to the cause of justice and good morals\u201d when the principles on which punitive damages are sustained in such eases are abandoned. Here the jury, by its verdict, has said that the defendant broke up the plaintiff\u2019s family. There is an abundance of evidence in the record to show that his acts were deliberate, intentional, and persistent, and that, if they were not inspired by actual malice toward the plaintiff, they were carried out under circumstances of aggravation, and in utter and wanton disregard of the plaintiff\u2019s marital rights. This was enough to justify the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><bracketnum>[12]</bracketnum> The defendant excepted to the charge of the court on the subject of reconciliation, not on the ground that the law was not correctly stated, but because there was no evidence that warranted a charge on that subject. And it is argued here that there is nothing, in the evidence warranting an inference that the defendant did anything to obstruct or prevent a re-establishment of the marital relations between this husband and wife. But the record refutes the claim. Not only did this man\u2019s attentions to Mrs. Button result in her leaving her husband, but, with full knowledge of the situation, they were persisted in thereafter, under circumstances strongly indicating an improper and unwarranted intimacy, and the jury may well have inferred that, but for the defendant, a reconciliation might have been effected.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Another objection to the argument is briefed, but the record shows that no exception was saved.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
