The plaintiff claimed that the trouble with the\u2018suit was that it was made of cloth' of \u201ctwo different kinds of colors. \u2019 \u2019 The trouble with the suit was that, in cutting the cloth of which it was made, the cloth was cut the wrong way of the nap, and it looked as though it was of two different pieces of cloth, unlike in color.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-6\"><em>Joseph G.

That is'yoiir whol\u00e9 claim? A. Yes. I claim .that there is two colors in that suit. Q. And you do not claim anything else? A. No.\u201d Urging that this was a waiver by plaintiff of all other alleged ground's of complaint within the scope of the declaration, the defendant objected to evidence showing that he made a mistake in cutting the cloth of which the suit was made, different ways of the nap, thereby making the suit look as if it were made of two pieces of cloth, unlike in color. There was no error in receiving the evidence. The mere fact that plaintiff stated in cross-examination as set forth above, did not in itself constitute a waiver of other alleged grounds of action, shown by proper evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Defendant excepted to the judgment, but assigned no grounds.
