Pleard on the commissioners\u2019 report at the January Term, 1922.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-14\">The material part of the report is as follows: \u201cAfter careful and thorough investigation, your commissioners find that two blazed spruce stubs, both long dead, are undoubtedly, in their opinion,- of the age of marking done by Surveyor General James Whitelaw in his survey of the town of Caldersburgh into lots for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>tbe proprietors thereof in June, 1788, and that they designate points in the line of division between lots numbered 14 and 15 of the then town of Caldersbnrgh, which division line, by Act of Assembly, has now become the town line between Morgan and Brighton before named, and is the town line now in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-5\">\u201cAccordingly, we find that the true line between the aforenamed towns begins from an ancient birch stub (it having appeared in evidence that the original southwesterly corner of lot numbered 14 in range numbered 1 was a birch tree) standing in the original northeast line of Random at 1.94 chain northwest from the \u2018Spruce marked M 13 on the northwest side of a Hill\u2019 (as described by Surveyor General Whitelaw to be standing at 5 chains southeast from the original north corner of Random and south comer of Navy, recorded in Papers of the Surveyors-General, Volume 10, page 93), said birch stub being 0.06 chain northwest from a maple tree with witness trees and blazes upon-the four sides about 30 years old, thence the town line aforesaid to be by us determined runs north 52\u00b0 6' east (by the magnetic meridian of August, 1921) passing (at 64 chains) 15% feet northwest from the northwest end of a bridge 49 feet long spanning Pherring\u2019s river and at 141.14 chains passing through one of the two spruce stubs above named as an original Whitelaw marked tree, and continues to a stake at 282 chains, where the line described intersects the southwest line of the Warren Gore.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-6\">\u201cThe line above described we unanimously find to be the true present town line dividing Morgan and Brighton.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b533-7\"><em>Aaron E.
