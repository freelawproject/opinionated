Pratt v. Reed, 19 How. [60 U. S.] 359. The court say an implied hypothecation of the vessel cannot arise under a credit to the master, [under circumstances] less stringent than are required to support a bottomry. That there is no footing for argument in this case, but that a bottomry hypothecation by the master, entered into upon the facts in proof, would have been void.
