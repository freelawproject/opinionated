Clayton, which was injured by a collision with the Queen of the South in the night of Nov. 26, 1856, off the lower end of the Cedars, on the New Jersey coast. The libel was filed March 5, 1857, and the answer Nov. 30, 1860. Two exceptions were taken in the answer, one alleging a non-joinder of one part owner of the Clayton, and the other that the circumstances of the collision and the manoeuvers and faults which caused it were not set out with sufficient detail. The exceptions were not brought to argument until the trial of the cause.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-12\">Beebe, Dean &amp; Donohue, for libelants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-13\">Benedict, Burr &amp; Benedict, for claimants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b229-14\">SHIPMAN, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AGk\">At this late stage of the case the court will deem all questions arising on the exceptions to have been waived. They should have been determined before the proofs were taken. On the proofs, although the evidence is very conflicting, the weight of it establishes the fact that the Clayton was coming up the coast close hauled; that the Queen of the South was going down the coast with a free wind; that at the time when those in charge of the Queen of the South ought to have discovered the Clayton\u2014the former was to leeward of the latter; that had she kept her course she would have passed the Clayton to leeward and cleared her with safety; and that those in charge of the Queen of the South mistook the position or course of the Clayton, or both, and luffed, striking the latter on the starboard side, and causing the damage complained of. This luffing was a mistake for which the Queen of the South should be held responsible. Decree for libelants, with a reference.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
