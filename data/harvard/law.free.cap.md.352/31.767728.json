The agreement provided for the submission of the dispute to an arbitration panel consisting of three rabbis and called a Beth Din.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition to naming the three rabbis, the agreement also stated that \u201c[i]t is further understood that the Beth Din is binding on both parties, is final and with no appeal.\u201d In an unanimous decision, the arbitration panel awarded the petitioner $5000.00 payable in two installments. One installment of $3,000 was due for payment by July 9, 1994, and the second installment of $2,000, by July 28, 1995. Although the respondent did not seek to vacate, modify, or correct the award and despite demand by the petitioner, the Synagogue did not make either of the installment payments as required.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Consequently, the petitioner filed, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, a Petition to Confirm and Enforce Arbitration Award and Complaint for Damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition to the $5,000.00 awarded by the arbitration panel, he requested \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>cost of this petition, of any subsequent proceedings, disbursements and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d The petitioner also filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. When the respondent failed to respond timely to the petition or to file an opposition to the summary judgment motion, the court entered summary judgment for the amount requested, \u201cplus the cost of this action and any attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by the [petitioner] in connection with the [petitioner\u2019s] Petition to be determined by the Court upon submission of sufficient evidence in support thereof.\u201d On May 15, 1996, the day after the Summary Judgment Order was signed and the day before it was filed, the respondent filed its Response To Motion For Summary Judgment, a Petition to Vacate or Modify, and an Answer and Petition For Modification. In the Answer and Petition For Modification, the respondent alleged only that \u201cthe arbitrators exceeded their authority in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The petitioner submitted, in compliance with the Summary Judgment Order, his affidavit in support of attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $1200.00 and costs and disbursements of $415.00, totaling $1,615. The circuit court entered judgment in favor of petitioner in the amount of $415.00, representing the costs and disbursements, but refused to award attorney\u2019s fees. The record does not reflect the basis for the refusal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the petitioner\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration was denied without a hearing, he noted his appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In that court, the petitioner argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the terms \u201ccosts\u201d and \u201cdisbursements,\u201d as used in \u00a7 3\u2014228(b) includes attorney\u2019s fees. The Court of Special Appeals rejected that argument, holding instead that \u201cthe Legislature did not intend in C.J. \u00a7 3\u2014228(b) to permit recovery of legal fees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>under the guise of \u2018costs\u2019 or \u2018disbursements,\u2019 incurred in confirming and enforcing an arbitration award.\u201d <em>Blitz v. Beth Isaac Adas Israel Congregation, </em>115 Md.App. 460, 481, 694 A.2d 107, 117 (1997). Aware that \u00a7 3-232 of the Act provides for the interpretation and construction of the Act \u201cas to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of the states which enact it,\u201d and that other jurisdictions have construed \u00a7 3-228(b) as the petitioner does, the court, in affirming the judgment of the trial court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">\u201cWe decline to move like lemmings toward the precipice of an erroneous interpretation of an unambiguous statute by summarily subscribing to uniformity for uniformity\u2019s sake, when other sound principles of statutory construction mandate a different result. Arbitration is a creature of contract and statute, and the role of the courts in the process has been narrowly tailored. Parties may protect themselves from bad faith refusals to abide by arbitration decisions and frivolous actions to modify or vacate awards by providing for those eventualities in the arbitration agreement itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 487, 694 A.2d at 120. At the request of the petitioner, we granted certiorari to consider this important issue. We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The petitioner argues that he is entitled to an award of the attorneys\u2019 fees he incurred in confirming and enforcing the arbitration award, as well as for the attorneys\u2019 fees he has incurred in connection with this appeal. He relies on both \u00a7 3-228 and \u00a7 3-232. Section 3-228 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">\u201c(a) Entering of judgment; enforcement of judgment.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">(1) If an order confirming, modifying, or correcting an award is granted, a judgment shall be entered in conformity with the order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">(2) The judgment may be enforced as any other judgment, (b) Costs and disbursements.\u2014A court may award costs of the petition, the subsequent proceedings, and disbursements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Although subsection (b) uses broad terms to describe what expense items the court may award in connection with a confirmation petition, it does not specifically mention attorneys\u2019 fees. The broad language of \u00a7 3-228(b), in particular, the word, \u201cdisbursements,\u201d the petitioner argues, encompasses the attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by a party who, because the losing party refuses to pay, is required to confirm an arbitration award. He points out that the courts that have construed \u00a7 3-228 have so interpreted \u201cdisbursements.\u201d Furthermore, the petitioner submits, to be effective, uniform acts must be interpreted uniformly and consistently by the States that adopt them. In support of that proposition, the petitioner cites \u00a7 3-232. That section provides: \u201cThis subtitle shall be so interpreted and construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of the states which enact it.\u201d Maryland law is consistent. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. Hall, </em>283 Md. 644, 392 A.2d 1103 (1978);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Continental Oil Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number><em>Horsey, </em>177 Md. 383, 385, 9 A.2d 607, 608 (1939) (\u201cUniformity of Maryland decisions with those applying the same law in other states is generally to be sought.\u201d); <em>Whitcomb v. Nat. Exchange Bank, </em>123 Md. 612, 616, 91 A. 689 (1914). <em>See also Williams Constr. v. Constr. Equip., </em>253 Md. 60, 63, 251 A.2d 864, 865 (1969) (\u201cThe interpretation given a statute in the jurisdiction in which it was first adopted is presumed to have been adopted with it, or should be given great weight.\u201d); <em>Public Service Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Balto. Transit Co., </em>207 Md. 524, 534, 114 A.2d 834, 838 (1955) (\u201cWhere a particular statute has been adopted in one State from the statute of another State, after a judicial construction has been given to it in the other State, it will be presumed that the construction was adopted with it.\u201d). The petitioner thus urges this Court to give to the word \u201cdisbursements\u201d the same meaning it has been given by courts in other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The respondent\u2019s position mirrors the reasoning of the Court of Special Appeals. That court concluded that the word \u201cdisbursements\u201d does not include attorney\u2019s fees. While it acknowledges and accepts the uniformity direction in \u00a7 3-232, <em>Blitz, </em>115 Md.App. at 482, 694 A.2d at 118, it believes that to apply it so as to permit the recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees in confirmation of an arbitration award proceedings, given the language of that section, would conflict with well established rules of statutory construction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 477, 694 A.2d at 115. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>In arriving at that conclusion, the Court of Special Appeals points out that \u00a7 3-221 of the Act, relating to \u201cExpenses and Fees,\u201d expressly addresses attorneys\u2019 fees, making their award dependent upon the provisions of the arbitration agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the court submits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">\u201cThe construction we have been asked [by the petitioner] to give to the ... Act would engraft upon the statute a meaning not evident from its plain language or legislative intent. Further, such an interpretation would require us to ignore well honed principles of statutory construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\"><em>Id, </em>at 478, 694 A.2d at 116. The well honed principles of statutory construction to which the court referred include that a statute must be read as a whole, so that all provisions are considered together and, to the extent possible, reconciled and harmonized. <em>Id. </em>at 480, 694 A.2d at 116. The intermediate appellate court also recognized that the \u201cpower to award attorney\u2019s fees, being contrary to the established practice in this country, may be expressly conferred but will not be presumed from general language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481, 694 A.2d at 116, quoting <em>Talley v. Talley, </em>317 Md. 428, 438, 564 A.2d 777, 782 (1989). In its view, therefore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">\u201c[t]he specific reference to attorney\u2019s fees in C.J. 3-221, coupled with its omission in C.J. \u00a7 3-228(b), leads us to conclude that the Legislature did not intend in C.J. \u00a7 3-228 to permit recovery of legal fees, under the guise of \u2018costs\u2019 or \u2018disbursements,\u2019 incurred in confirming and enforcing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>arbitration award. Surely, if the Legislature wanted to authorize an award of legal fees under such circumstances, it would have expressly said so, particularly in view of the principles of the \u2018American Rule.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The question this Court must answer is, as the Court of Special Appeals recognized, what does the term \u201cdisbursements\u201d mean? And that court rightly focused on the canons of statutory construction, for answering that question involves interpreting \u00a7 3-228. While the process is straight forward and requires resort only to the words of the statute when the statute is clear and unambiguous, <em>State Dept. of Assessments and Taxation v. Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>348 Md. 2, 13, 702 A.2d 690, 696 (1997); <em>Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co. of Maryland v. Director of Finance for Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>343 Md. 567, 579, 683 A.2d 512, 517 (1996), something more is required when the statute is ambiguous. Where the meaning of the plain language of the statute, or the language itself, is unclear, \u201cwe seek to discern legislative intent from surround<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ing circumstances, such as legislative history, prior case law, and the purposes upon which the statutory framework was based.\u201d <em>Lewis v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 653, 705 A.2d 1128, 1131 (1998); <em>See also Haupt v. State, </em>340 Md. 462, 471, 667 A.2d 179, 183 (1995). We are also required to interpret the statute as a whole, \u201c[w]here the statute to be construed is a part of a statutory scheme, the legislative intention is not determined from that statute alone, rather it is to be discerned by considering it in light of the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>GEICO v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>332 Md. 124, 132, 630 A.2d 713, 717 (1993). <em>See Gordon Family Partnership v. Gar on Jer, </em>348 Md. 129, 138, 702 A.2d 753, 757 (1997); <em>Popham v. State Farm Mutual Insurance Company, </em>333 Md. 136, 148, 634 A.2d 28, 34 (1993). Moreover, neither the words in the statute nor any portion of the statutory scheme should be read \u201cso as to render the other, or any portion of it, meaningless, surplusage, superfluous, or nugatory.\u201d <em>GEICO, </em>332 Md. at 132, 630 A.2d at 717. <em>See also DeBusk v. Johns Hopkins, </em>342 Md. 432, 445, 677 A.2d 73, 79 (1996); <em>Schlossberg v. Citizen\u2019s Bank, </em>341 Md. 650, 660, 672 A.2d 625, 629-630 (1996); <em>State v. Pagano, </em>341 Md. 129, 134, 669 A.2d 1339, 1341; <em>In re Roger S., </em>338 Md. 385, 394, 658 A.2d 696, 700 (1995). Nor should we read a statute in a way that is inconsistent with, or ignores, common sense or logic. <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106, 112 (1994). In many contexts, perhaps most, the word \u201cdisbursements\u201d is clear and unambiguous. In the present context, however, it is not. Indeed, most of the courts that have interpreted their State\u2019s version of \u00a7 3-228 have held that, in that context, \u201cdisbursements\u201d includes attorneys\u2019 fees in the award-enforcement action. <em>See Anchorage Medical and Surgical Clinic v. James, </em>555 P.2d 1320 (Alaska 1976), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Ahtna, Inc. v. Ebasco Constructors, Inc., </em>894 P.2d 657 (Alaska 1995); <em>Canon Sch. Dist. No. 50 v. W.E.S. Construction, </em>180 Ariz. 148, 882 P.2d 1274 (1994)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; <em>County of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>Clark v. Blanchard Construction, </em>98 Nev. 488, 653 P.2d 1217 (1982); <em>Wachtel v. Shoney\u2019s, Inc., </em>830 S.W.2d 905 (Tenn.App.1991).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">It is true, as the intermediate appellate court points out, that <em>Anchorage Medical </em>is sparse on rationale <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the need for uniformity does play a significant part in the reasoning in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>these cases. It is not correct, however, in the belief that the results reached can be explained only on that basis. The court in <em>County of Clark v. Blanchard Constr. Co. </em>recognized the significant difference between the initial arbitration proceedings and the confirmation proceedings when it interpreted its version of \u00a7 3-228 \u201cto mean that the court is permitted to award attorneys\u2019 fees only for the effort expended in this case in obtaining an order confirming the arbitration award and not for any efforts expended prior to that time.\u201d 653 P.2d at 1220. To reach that conclusion, the court considered both the confirmation provision and the provision the Court of Special Appeals determined to be critical, the one precluding an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in the absence of an express provision in the arbitration agreement. <em>Id. </em>Also focusing on that provision, A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1510, its version of this State\u2019s \u00a7 3-221,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Supreme Court of Arizona acknowledged that \u201c[t]he Uniform Act has taken a different approach, expressly excluding attorneys\u2019 fees in A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1510, but not excluding fees in the confirmation section.\u201d <em>Canon School District, </em>882 P.2d at 1279. Then noting that approach had prompted most jurisdictions interpreting the language in its A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1514, the Arizona equivalent to \u00a7 3-228,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to permit the award of attorneys\u2019 fees in confirmation proceedings, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB\">\u201cThe interpretations of our sister states also promote the public policy of encouraging early payment of valid arbitration awards and the discouragement of nonmeritorious pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>tracted confirmation challenges. The prefatory comment to the 1954 draft of the Uniform Arbitration Act stated that court intervention in arbitration \u2018must be prompt and simple or the values of arbitration will be largely dissipated through prolonged litigation.\u201d \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"><em>Id. </em>(Quoting Handbook of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws 204 (1954)). Therefore, although in this context the court quoted, with approval, the Tennessee Supreme Court in <em>Holiday Inns, Inc. v. Olsen, </em>692 S.W.2d 850, 853 (1985), on the need for the consistent interpretation of uniform acts: \u201cIt is axiomatic that a purpose in enacting uniform laws is to achieve conformity, not uniqueness,\u201d it is patent that that was not the sole or even the most important reason for the decision. Indeed, what <em>Canon School District </em>demonstrates is that there is absolutely no inconsistency between the goal of uniformity of interpretation and the rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\"><em>Wachtel v. Shoney\u2019s, Inc. </em>followed the reasoning of <em>County of Clark v. Blanchard Construction </em>in construing the identical provision. That court made clear, however, that, while it was required, by its Supreme Court, to strive to maintain the standardization of construction of uniform acts,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">\u201cThis does not mean that this court will blindly follow decisions of other states interpreting uniform acts, but this court will seriously consider the constructions given to comparable statutes in other jurisdictions and will espouse them to maintain conformity when they are in harmony with the spirit of the statute and do not antagonize public policy of this state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-8\"><em>Wachtel, </em>830 S.W.2d at 909, (quoting <em>Holiday Inns, Inc. v. Olsen, </em>692 S.W.2d at 853.)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">And that one of the purposes that motivated the various State legislatures to enact the Uniform Arbitration Act was the desire for uniformity is amply demonstrated by the inclusion in the act as enacted of a provision similar or identical to \u00a7 3-232. Thus, by conforming the interpretation of \u00a7 3-228 to that of our sister states, we are, in fact, maintaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>standardization of construction of uniform acts and, in that way, carrying out the legislative intent of uniformity.</p>\n<p id=\"ALb\">Viewed in light of the purpose of arbitration<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and, in particular, the Uniform Act as enacted in Maryland, and the interpretation other courts have given their equivalent of \u00a7 3-228(b), we hold, as the Legislature intended, that \u201cdisbursements,\u201d in the context of proceedings to confirm an arbitration award, include attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO VACATE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AND TO REMAND THIS ACTION TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY THE RESPONDENT.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">ON MOTION FOR CLARIFICATION</p>\n<author id=\"b151-6\">BELL, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The petitioner, Marcel Blitz, has filed Petitioner\u2019s Motion For Clarification, requesting this Court to clarify the scope of its decision; to state clearly whether the attorneys\u2019 fees contemplated by the term \u201cdisbursements\u201d include those \u201cincurred ... at the appellate level in connection with confirming and enforcing an arbitration award.\u201d The motion was prompted by the respondent taking the position, subsequent to the filing of the opinion in this case, that the opinion addresses only those attorneys\u2019 fees that the petitioner incurred in the trial court and not those he incurred during the appeals. That remains the respondent\u2019s position. Despite its recognition that this Court determined that the word \u201cdisbursements,\u201d in the context of Maryland Code (1974, 1995 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 3-228(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, includes attorneys\u2019 fees, in its Respondent\u2019s Answer To Motion For Clarification, relying on the proposition that \u201c[t]he award of attorneys\u2019 fees for pursuing the interpretation of a statute on appeal would run contrary to accepted Maryland law,\u201d the respondent asserts, \u201cthe opinion of this Court does not award attorneys\u2019 fees for the appellate efforts of Petitioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The issue in this case was straightforward, \u201cwhether, pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 1995 RepLVol.), \u00a7 3-228(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act (the Act), the prevailing party in a binding arbitration proceeding may recover reasonable attorney fees when the losing party\u2019s unjustified refusal to comply with the award requires the prevailing party to institute and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>successfully prosecute an action in order to confirm and enforce the arbitration award.\u201d We answered the question in the affirmative, reasoning, \u201c[v]iewed in light of the purpose of arbitration and, in particular, the Uniform Act as enacted in Maryland, and the interpretation other courts have given their equivalent of \u00a7 3-228(b), we hold, as the Legislature intended, that disbursements, in the context of proceedings to confirm an arbitration award, include attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d In reaching that conclusion, we were mindful that we were interpreting a uniform act, which, consistent with the Legislature\u2019s instructions, set out in \u00a7 3-232 of the Act, was to \u201cbe so interpreted and construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of the states which enact it.\u201d Thus, we reviewed decisions of our sister States that have construed the provision comparable to \u00a7 3-228(b) in their uniform arbitration act, and found that most of them have reached the same result we reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">We also discovered that the desirability of uniformity of interpretation of uniform acts was not the only rationale for the decisions. Those decisions could only be explained by reference to the \u201csignificant difference between the initial arbitration proceedings and the confirmation proceedings.\u201d The Supreme Court of Arizona made just that point, we noted, when it concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">The interpretations of our sister states also promote the public policy of encouraging early payment of valid arbitration awards and the discouragement of nonmeritorious protracted confirmation challenges.

If \u201cdisbursements\u201d include attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in a trial proceeding to confirm an arbitration award, it must also include attorneys\u2019 fees in an appellate proceeding challenging the trial court\u2019s decision. This is especially the case when, as here, the appellate proceedings were made necessary by the respondent\u2019s contention that attorneys\u2019 fees were not payable at all in respect to confirmation proceedings and it was only as a result of the appellate proceedings that an interpretation of the applicable statute was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">While it seems clear enough that our decision contemplated the payment of <em>all </em>attorneys\u2019 fees necessary to obtain confirmation of the arbitration award, we did not explicitly spell it out. We do so now in the interest of avoiding any further argument on the subject, thus avoiding the possible expense and delay of another appeal and for the guidance of the trial court on remand: pursuant to \u00a7 3\u2014228(b), the prevailing party is entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees incurred both at trial and on appeal in confirming and enforcing an arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The Motion For Clarification is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\">.

The court order referred to \u00a7 3-228 as the basis for the award of attorneys' fees as well as costs. That section, however, does not expressly mention attorneys' fees as being recoverable; in fact, subsection (b) only mentions costs and disbursements.
