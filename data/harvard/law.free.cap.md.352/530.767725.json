For the reasons set forth below we shall hold that there was procedural error that requires a remand to the Talbot County Council (the Council).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In 1984, the General Assembly enacted the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Protection Program (the Program). Chapter 794 of the Acts of 1984, codified as amended in Maryland Code (1974, 1990 Repl.Vol., 1998 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 8-1801 through 8-1817 of the Natural Resources Article (NR). The purposes of the Program are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">\u201c(1) To establish a Resource Protection Program for the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries by fostering more sensitive development activity for certain shoreline areas so as to minimize damage to water quality and natural habitats; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8d\">\u201c(2) To implement the Resource Protection Program on a cooperative basis between the State and affected local governments, with local governments establishing and implementing their programs in a consistent and uniform manner subject to State criteria and oversight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-8\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8-1801(b). The Chesapeake Bay critical area generally consists of the Chesapeake Bay, its tributaries to the head of tide, all designated State and private wetlands, and all land and water areas within 1,000 feet beyond the landward boundaries of designated State or private wetlands and the heads of tides of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8-1807(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">The General Assembly created the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission (the Commission) to promulgate regulations and to administer the Program. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 8-1803 and 8-1806. Each county within the critical area has primary responsibility for developing and implementing a local critical area protection program pursuant to criteria established by the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>sion and subject to review and approval by the Commission. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 8-1808(a), (d), and 8-1809. Each local program must designate the local critical area (the Critical Area), include a comprehensive zoning map for the Critical Area, and, as necessary, enact new or amended provisions of the jurisdiction\u2019s subdivision regulations, comprehensive or master plan, zoning ordinances or regulations, and enforcement provisions. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8-1808(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">In 1986, the Commission promulgated regulations establishing the criteria for development in the Critical Area. Md. Regs.Code tit. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 01.02.01 through 01.02.07 (1992) (CO-MAR). These regulations recognize three types of development areas: Intensely Developed Areas (IDAs), Limited Development Areas (LDAs), and Resource Conservation Areas (RCAs). COMAR \u00a7 27.01.02.02A. Local jurisdictions are directed to identify each of these three types of areas within their jurisdiction. COMAR \u00a7 27.01.02.02E.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The developer in the case before us seeks to have its Critical Area property reclassified under the County\u2019s program from RCA to LDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">LDAs are defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">\u201cthose areas which are currently developed in low or moderate intensity uses.

Within this Critical Area, 51,000 acres are RCAs; thus, five percent or 2,554 acres are available for growth allocation. One-half of the 2,554 acres available for allocation has been set aside for growth in or around the towns of Easton, Oxford, and St. Michaels. In early 1997, when the County was considering the request for growth allocation involved in this case, 2,150 acres had not yet been allocated.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Growth allocation within the County is administered by the Council, pursuant to \u00a7 19.14(c)(l)(iv) of the Talbot County Zoning Ordinance (1991), as amended.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under this subsection \u201ca person with a committed financial, contractual, or proprietary interest\u201d in property in the Critical Area can initiate a growth allocation district boundary amendment. \u00a7 19.14(c)(l)(iv)[a]. An application is filed in the County Planning Office, along with a proposed site plan or subdivision plat, or both, that meet the County\u2019s development design standards and site plan review requirements. \u00a7 19.14(c)(1)(iv)[b]; <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 19.10 (development design standards) and 19.12 (site plan review). The application \u201cshould make the maximum effort to meet the intent of the Critical Area policies and the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>design standards\u201d and, specifically, should conform to the nine directives set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\">\u201c[1] Create lots or parcels that maximize the opportunities for clustered development that protect habitat and agricultural resources;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">\u201c[2] Locate structures so as to minimize impact on habitat protection areas and agricultural areas;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">\u201c[3] Provide a minimally disturbed buffer along the shoreline;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">\u201c[4] Minimize soil erosion and runoff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">\u201c[51 Maximize protection of eroding shorelines;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">\u201c[6] Have a minimal impact or cause an improvement to stormwater, floodplain and stream characteristics;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">\u201c[7] Minimize impacts on non-tidal wetlands;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-11\">\u201c[8] Maximize protection of plant and wildlife habitats, particularly for threatened and endangered species, plant and wildlife common to the Chesapeake Bay Region, and anadromous fish propagation waters; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A67\">\u201c[9] Maximize protection of forests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">\u00a7 19.14(c)(l)(iv)[b]. Recommendations of the Planning Officer and the Planning Commission are to be submitted to the Council within sixty days after the application is filed. \u00a7 19.14(c)(l)(iv)[c].</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">Whether the recommendations are to grant or to deny the application, the Council \u201cshall introduce a bill (legislation) for the proposed amendment and hold a public hearing in order that interested parties and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard.\u201d \u00a7 19.14(c)(l)(iv)[d]. The Council is required to keep \u201c[a] complete record\u201d of the public hearing, including \u201cthe vote of all members of the Council in deciding all questions relating to the proposed growth allocation district boundary amendment.\u201d \u00a7 19.14(c)(l)(iv)[e]. Prior to voting on the growth allocation bill a majority of council members must make a site visit to the property \u201cto inspect the physical features of the property and to determine the character of the surrounding area.\u201d \u00a7 19.14(c)(l)(iv)[f]. If the Council votes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>favorably on the growth allocation bill, the Council submits the application to the Commission \u201cfor approval as an amendment to the County\u2019s Critical Area Program.\u201d \u00a7 19.14(c)(1)(iv)[g]. No provision is made in the County Zoning Ordinance regarding the Council\u2019s rejection of a growth allocation bill. Prior to the Council\u2019s rejection of the growth allocation requested in this case the Council had never failed to enact a growth allocation bill for a project that met the requisite criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The Council\u2019s power to make piecemeal reclassifications of properties within the boundaries of the Critical Area is governed under \u00a7 19.14(c)(1)(iv) (\u201cGrowth Allocation District Boundary Amendments in Critical Area\u201d). Section 19.14(c)(1)(ii) addresses the Council\u2019s power to make \u201c[ajmendments to the Official Zoning District Maps excepting properties within the boundaries of the Critical Area where growth allocation is requested.\u201d Unlike the growth allocation provisions, \u00a7 19.14(c)(1)(ii)[i] specifically provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">\u201cThe fact that an application for a district boundary amendment complies with all the specific requirements and purposes set forth in this Ordinance shall not be deemed to create a presumption that the proposed district boundary amendment would in fact be compatible with surrounding land uses and is not, in itself, sufficient to require approval.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah6\">Further, \u00a7 19.14(c)(l)(ii)[k], unlike the growth allocation provisions, addresses the denial of a district boundary amendment by imposing a one year waiting period before reapplication.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The appellant, Bucktail, LLC (Bucktail), was formed in 1995 to acquire and develop a 93.59 acre tract in the County known as Dawson\u2019s Farm. This property is located about six-tenths of a mile west of the town of St. Michaels. A portion of the property, 20.83 acres, is located outside of the Critical Area and is zoned Town Residential.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The remaining 72.76 acres of Dawson\u2019s Farm are within the Critical Area and, by that program, are zoned RCA. By statute, development in RCAs is limited to one unit per twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>acres, thereby limiting development of Bucktail\u2019s RCA parcel to three dwelling units. NR \u00a7 8-1808.1(d); <em>accord </em>\u00a7 19.3(a)(1)(ii)[a].</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">In August 1995, Bucktail applied for a growth allocation to reclassify by district boundary amendment the 72.76 acre parcel from RCA to LDA within the Critical Area, and to reclassify that parcel\u2019s underlying zoning from Rural Conservation (RC) (Critical Area only), \u00a7 19.3(a)(1)(h), to Rural Residential (RR) (Critical Area only). \u00a7 19.3(a)(1)(iii). RR zoning and LDA zoning permit development of one dwelling unit per five acres. Thus, with a growth allotment, that is, a reclassification to LDA in the overlaid Critical Area zoning, together with a reclassification to RR in the underlying Euclidean zoning, Bucktail would be able to develop fourteen dwelling units on the Critical Area parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In a memorandum to the Planning Commission, the planning staff opined that \u201c[Bucktah\u2019s] application has met all mandatory submittal requirements.\u201d Within a week thereafter the Planning Commission recommended approval of Buck-tail\u2019s application, subject to certain conditions that are not presently relevant. On January 28, 1997, Bills Nos. 640 and 641 were introduced into the Council.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Following a public hearing on the two bills, the Council voted four to one against Bill No. 641 on March 11,1997. The Council made findings of fact. Those relevant to the issues here are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">\u201c(5) The proposed District Boundary Amendment from RC Rural Conservation to RR Rural Residential is a Critical Areas Growth Allocation request and as such the Council must find that the request complies with the Critical Area Policies and applicable design standards set forth in Section 19.14(c)(iv) of the Zoning Code of Talbot County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>\u201c(6) The County Council finds \u2018upon the basis of the evidence of record\u2019 that the request for Critical Area Growth Allocation does not comply with all of the Critical Area Policies and applicable design standards as referenced in Section 19.14(c)(iv) of the Zoning Code of Talbot County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADa\">\u201c(7) The County Council finds that the Growth Allocation request is not consistent with the purposes and intent of the Talbot County Comprehensive Plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\">\u201c(8) The County Council finds that the proposed change will not be compatible with existing and proposed development and land use in the surrounding area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">\u201c(9) The County Council finds upon the basis of the evidence of record that there have been no population changes that would suggest this reclassification to be wise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">\u201c(10) The County Council finds that the availability of public facilities and the present and proposed transportation patterns do not support the reclassification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">\u201c(11) Five members of the Council inspected the site prior to voting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">\u201c(12) In light of the above findings, the Bill requesting Critical Area Growth Allocation and reclassification of the property, from RC Rural Conservation to RR Rural Residential will be denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Bill No. 640 was tabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">Bucktail petitioned for judicial review. Neighboring property owners, appellees John W. Renner, Richard J. Conway, Robert Porter, and Sidney H. Dickson (collectively RCPD), intervened in support of the County\u2019s decision. The circuit court affirmed, ruling that there was substantial evidence to support the Council\u2019s denial of the requested growth allocation, based on the findings that the request did not comply with all of the \u00a7 19.14(c)(l)(iv) criteria and that the request was not consistent with the County comprehensive plan nor with existing and proposed development in the area. Further, the court disagreed with Bucktail\u2019s argument that once it met the \u00a7 19.14(c)(l)(iv) criteria the Council must approve the growth allocation request.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Bucktail appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. On our own motion we issued a writ of certiorari prior to consideration of the matter by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">The appellees have moved to dismiss Bucktail\u2019s appeal because there is no statute authorizing review of the Council\u2019s action on a growth allocation application. If the matter is properly before us the parties join issue over the correct standard of review and over the application of the correct standard to the facts of this case. In addition Bucktail argues that the Council failed to render specific findings of facts as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The appellees have moved to dismiss, contending that there is no statute making the Council\u2019s action judicially reviewable. Bucktail\u2019s petition for appeal to the circuit court recites that it is filed \u201cpursuant to Maryland Rule 7-202.\u201d The cited rule, however, does not grant a right of judicial review, and it is inapplicable where judicial review is not authorized by statute. <em>Urbana Civic Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Urbana Mobile Village, Inc., </em>260 Md. 458, 462-63, 272 A.2d 628, 631 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The Charter that the County adopted in 1974 provides for a county manager form of government. Charter of Talbot County, Maryland (1977), Art. III. All powers which may be exercised by the County are vested in the Council. Charter \u00a7 202. A board of appeals is created under \u00a7 501 of the Charter which may hear and decide matters including \u201cZoning matters, exclusive of rezoning.\u201d Charter \u00a7 502(1). The County Zoning Ordinance, effective June 22, 1991, contains a provision for an \u201cappeal\u201d by \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Appeals\u201d to the Circuit Court for Talbot County. \u00a7 19.14(d)(1). There is, however, no provision in the Charter or Zoning Ordinance for judicial review of a zoning reclassification by the Council, comprehensive or piecemeal, within or without the Critical Area.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Bucktail\u2019s reply to appellees\u2019 dismissal argument is that its petition may be considered to invoke the original jurisdiction of the circuit court under the doctrine illustrated in <em>Criminal Injuries Compensation Board v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 331 A.2d 55 (1975). <em>Gould </em>held that there is an inherent right to judicial review of actions by an administrative agency, despite the fact that in <em>Gould </em>the applicable- statute expressly provided that there would be no judicial review, absent certain conditions which admittedly were not met in that case. <em>Id. </em>at 500-01, 512, 331 A.2d at 65, 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Recently, in <em>Gisriel v. Ocean City Board of Supervisors, </em>345 Md. 477, 693 A.2d 757 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 118 S.Ct. 702, 139 L.Ed.2d 645 (1998), we applied the <em>Gould </em>principle. In <em>Gisriel, </em>an \u201cappeal\u201d had been taken, pursuant to the Ocean City Charter, to the Circuit Court for Worcester County to review a determination by the City Council of Ocean City which in turn reviewed voter eligibility determinations by the Ocean City Board of Supervisors of Elections. Answering an argument that there was no right of appeal from the circuit court in view of Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-302(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ), we held that the complaint in the circuit court, in addition to invoking the judicial review jurisdiction of the circuit court, invoked its mandamus jurisdiction so that the right of appeal was conferred by CJ \u00a7 12-301. In this connection we said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">\u201cwhere a particular action against an administrative agency was allegedly brought under a statutory judicial review provision, and did not purport to be a mandamus action, this Court has looked to the substance of the action, has held that it could be treated as a common law mandamus or certiorari action, and has exercised appellate jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5C\"><em>Gisriel, </em>345 Md. at 500, 693 A.2d at 768. <em>See also Heaps v.

The appellees\u2019 response is that the Council\u2019s action was legislative. Appellees\u2019 point is not that legislative action is beyond challenge in the courts, but that the applicable standard of review is more favorable to the Council than substantiality of tne evidence. Appellees rely on the distinction made in <em>Department of Natural Resources v. Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. 211, 334 A.2d 514 (1975). <em>Linchester </em>involved the constitutionality, under the separation of powers doctrine, of a statute that permitted a <em>de novo </em>jury trial of the reasonableness of administrative action in granting or denying a permit to build in wetlands.

Here, the action under review is not comprehensive rezoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Appellees RCPD also cite <em>Board of County Commissioners v. Levitt &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>235 Md. 151, 200 A.2d 670 (1964), for the quotation that this Court has \u201crepeatedly held that the action of zoning or reclassification of zoning is a function that is legislative in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158, 200 A.2d at 674. Immediately following that quoted language we further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">\u201cHowever, this does not prevent the Council from making <em>administrative </em>findings of fact, drawing administrative inferences, and arriving at administrative conclusions and decisions, when hearing an application for rezoning, and the statute clearly anticipates such action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-8\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, a rezoning procedure is not necessarily wholly legislative or wholly adjudicatory. Piecemeal rezoning involves adjudicatory procedures, including administrative fact-finding, that form the basis of the legislative decision whether to approve or deny a rezoning application. As this Court has explained in a piecemeal rezoning case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">\u201c[i]t is clear to us, from the general law elsewhere and our previous decisions, that the provisions set forth above make it improper and inaccurate to characterize the whole proceeding at the hearing held by the Council when considering an application for reclassification and its action of denying or granting reclassification as quasi-legislative in nature or quasi-judicial in nature. The above provisions, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>question, required the members of the Council to resolve disputed questions of adjudicative facts (as contradistinguished from legislative facts or judicial <em>action) </em>concerning particular parties. And, when the Council was considering and determining these adjudicative facts concerning particular parties, it necessarily was performing a quasi-judicial function, even though its final action, in granting or denying the reclassification which was required to be based upon its findings of adjudicative facts, was quasi-legislative in character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><em>Hyson v. Montgomery County Council, </em>242 Md. 55, 64-65, 217 A.2d 578, 584 (1966) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The determination of whether a local zoning authority is acting in an adjudicative or legislative manner \u201cis dependent upon the nature of the particular act in which it is engaged.\u201d <em>Mayor of Rockville v.

This determination is not based on whether the zoning decision adversely affects an individual piece of property but whether the decision itself is made on individual or general grounds.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">\u201cThe difference between adjudicative and legislative facts is not easily drawn; ... adjudicative facts are facts about the parties and their activities, businesses and properties. They usually answer the questions \u2018of who did what, where, when, how, why, with what motive or intent\u2019 while legislative facts \u2018do not usually concern the immediate parties but are general facts which help the tribunal decide questions of law and policy and discretion.\u2019 The difference, broadly speaking, involves whether the decision is to be made on individual or general grounds. Simply because an individual has a protected interest does not entitle him to a trial-type hearing where the matter to be determined involves issues of legislative fact. That the effect of a zoning authority\u2019s decision may dramatically affect an individual is not determinative of the difference between adjudicative and legislative facts; rather, it is the nature of the decision\u2019s fact-finding process, not the ultimate effect of the decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>that determines the party\u2019s right to an adjudicatory hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><em>Montgomery County v.

The ordinance provided for a public hearing at which oral and written testimony could be submitted and of which a complete stenographic record was to be made. <em>Id. </em>at 64, 217 A.2d at 584. The county council was required to make its decision based on the evidence of record and approval or disapproval was to be on the merits. <em>Id. </em>This Court concluded that the ordinance conferred adjudicative functions on the county council when determining the facts at the rezoning hearing and therefore a right of reasonable cross-examination was permitted. <em>Id. </em>at 67, 217 A.2d at 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The County seeks to distinguish <em>Hyson </em>by comparing the procedural provisions in the ordinance governing that Montgomery County reclassification to the County\u2019s Zoning Ordinance. Section 19.14(c)(l)(iv)[e] of the County\u2019s Zoning Ordinance requires that \u201c[a] complete record shall be kept of the hearing including the vote of all members of the Council in deciding all questions relating to the proposed growth allocation district boundary amendment.\u201d In the instant matter, a full transcript of the public hearing was prepared. It included a forty-four page presentation by representatives of Bucktail and thirty-four pages of comments and questions from the audience. The record also includes numerous exhibits, including a memorandum and reports from the planning commission and its staff. The parties to the instant proceedings have indicated to us no unwillingness to proceed on the record that has been made, and there is no issue presented to us concerning any claimed right to cross-examination. Consequently, any difference between the procedure that took place in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>deciding this particular rezoning application and the procedure in <em>Hyson </em>does not require a conclusion that reclassification in the Critical Area is wholly legislative.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">A recent case illustrates how adjudicative fact-finding functions can result in a legislative decision. In <em>Mayor of Rockville v. Woodmont Country Club, </em>348 Md. 572, 705 A.2d 301, this Court considered whether there is a right of reasonable cross-examination at a hearing concerning the levy of a special assessment against a particular property in connection with the construction of a road and water main. The municipality argued that the special assessment hearing was legislative, in the nature of a tax, and that such legislative action is presumed correct even if the legislative body acted without any supporting evidence at all. <em>Id. </em>at 583-84, 705 A.2d at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">We disagreed, ruling that the hearing was adjudicative in nature: \u201cThe City\u2019s argument, however, confuses the legislative aspects of the special assessment process with the adjudicatory aspects of that process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584, 705 A.2d at 306. We explained that while the ultimate decision was legislative, the proceeding involved was adjudicative in nature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">\u201cThis Court has stated that the determination of <em>whether </em>to impose a special assessment and the <em>mode </em>of imposing a special assessment are legislative determinations. Nevertheless, the application of the mode of assessment to a particular piece of property to determine the specific amount to be assessed against that particular property is an adjudicative act. The proceeding to determine the amount of benefit to a specific piece of property is adjudicatory or quasi-judicial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">\u201c... In a case such as this, where the Council was holding a hearing, receiving written and oral testimony, and considering evidence to determine the specific amount of special benefit to a particular piece of property, the Council at that point was acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, even if earlier actions in the process or the final act of passing an ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>nance to levy a special assessment constitute legislative functions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 584-85, 705 A.2d at 306-07 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Similarly, in this case, while the Council\u2019s ultimate action in granting or denying a map amendment utilizing a growth allocation is legislative in nature, the process of applying the Zoning Ordinance standards to the particular facts of Buck-tail\u2019s property requires adjudicative or administrative fact-finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The case before us involves a chartered county which has determined not to confer on the board of appeals jurisdiction in piecemeal amendments of the zoning ordinance map, although such a conferral is permitted under the Express Powers Act, Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Art. 25A, \u00a7 5(U).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As pointed out for the Court by Chief Judge Prescott in <em>Hyson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-8\">\n<em>\u201cIt should be carefully noted and remembered that the holding in any zoning or rezoning case, here or elsewhere, cannot be accurately appraised without a knowledge and consideration of the constitutional and statutory provisions and the local laws and zoning regulations prevailing at the time of the decisions, below and here.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">242 Md. at 62, 217 A.2d at 583. None of the decisions that have been cited to us or that we have cited, <em>supra, </em>deals with a piecemeal rezoning by the county council of a home rule county where there is no express statutory provision for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Under the Regional District Act there is judicial review of the final action of the Montgomery County District Council on any application for a map amendment, and that proceeding is exclusive. Md.Code (1957, 1997 Repl.Vol., 1998 Cum.Supp.), Art. 28, \u00a7 8-105(a), (b). There is no express standard of review for those proceedings. Statutory judicial review is also applicable to a final district council decision in Prince George\u2019s County. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8-106(e). In such proceedings from the Prince George\u2019s County District Council there is a statutory standard of review which permits reversal or modification if, <em>inter alia, </em>the findings or decision are \u201cunsupported by competent, material and substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted\u201d or are \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8-106(i)(5), (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Under the provisions of the Zoning Enabling Act applicable to Baltimore City there is statutory judicial review of \u201ca zoning action by the local legislative body.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Art. 66B, \u00a7 2.09(a). \u201cNothing in [that] subsection shall change the existing standards for review of any zoning action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Section 4.08 of Article 66B is applicable to non-home rule counties and to municipalities. Section 4.08(a) provides for judicial review at the instance of any person aggrieved \u201cby a zoning action by the local legislative body.\u201d That subsection similarly does not \u201cchange the existing standards for review of any zoning action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By way of contrast, under Articles 25A and 25B, respectively dealing with home rule for chartered and for code counties, there are no express statutory provisions for judicial review of piecemeal rezoning, if that power is exercised by the county council or county commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Thus, the County\u2019s argument to us distills to the question of whether, by its silence in its zoning ordinance with respect to any judicial review at all, the County has limited judicial review of the denial of Bucktail\u2019s application to the question of whether that denial was within the power of the Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Absent a statutory standard of judicial review of administrative action the standard is that set forth in <em>Dickinson-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number><em>Tidewater, Inc. v.

Mayor of Baltimore, </em>180 Md. 176, 23 A.2d 649 (1942). That case was an appeal from a judgment of a court of the Eighth Judicial Circuit that sustained, against a challenge by protesting neighbors, the validity of an ordinance of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore that had reclassified an unimproved lot, 100 feet by 145 feet, from residential to commercial use and that sustained the action of the Baltimore City Board of Zoning Appeals in granting a special exception to use the then commercially zoned lot for a gasoline filling station. The appeal arose when the procedural distinction between law and equity was in full bloom. Distinguishing between the council\u2019s action and the board of appeals\u2019 action, the property owner argued that the validity of the ordinance could not be questioned on the statutory appeal from the board\u2019s action. The owner relied on many cases, cited at 180 Md. at 180, 23 A.2d at 651, for the proposition that the challenge to the validity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>an ordinance must be by a bill in equity. This Court held that the issue of the ordinance\u2019s validity could be heard by the court in the law action involving the appeal from the board, essentially to avoid a multiplicity of actions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 180-81, 23 A.2d at 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">On the merits of the challenge to the validity of the ordinance in <em>Ellieott, </em>this Court affirmed, essentially applying a substantial evidence or fairly debatable test. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6m\">\u201cThe nearest filling stations are a half mile to the west and a mile to the east. That provision may possibly be regarded as sufficient for the traffic, but it seems to the court that this is not so clearly true that the action of the City authorities and the Board should be reversed judicially as arbitrary and capricious. We must assume, if it is possible to do so, that these officials exercised their judgment on its sufficiency, and we cannot say that they did not, and acted without good reason. There will doubtless be some reduction in value of the neighboring property from construction of the additional filling station, some detraction from the beauty and attractiveness of the region as it has existed, but if the change is one within the police power of the City, not arbitrary and capricious, that is a detriment which must be suffered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 184, 23 A.2d at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Also instructive, and more recent, is <em>Bellanca v. County Commissioners of Kent County, </em>86 Md.App. 219, 586 A.2d 62, <em>cert. denied, </em>323 Md. 33, 591 A.2d 249 (1991). Kent County is a code home rule county, and, consequently, its zoning power is conferred through the incorporation by reference of Article 25A, Section 5(U) and (X) into Article 25B, Section 13. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Kent County\u2019s initial, comprehensive zoning pursuant to the Program the appellants\u2019 property had been zoned RCA. Shortly thereafter the appellants sought a piecemeal reclassification to LDA which the County Commissioners of Kent County denied, after having been advised by the Commission that the requested map amendment should be denied. The circuit court sustained that action. The Court of Special Appeals, speaking through Judge Robert M. Bell, now Chief Judge of this Court, affirmed on the ground that there was no mistake in the original zoning within the meaning of NR \u00a7 8-1809(h)(2)(i). The opinion makes no mention of any statute either providing for judicial review or establishing the standard for review. Nevertheless, the court said: \u201cBecause the standard of review is whether there is any substantial evidence in the record to support the decision of the County Commissioners, our focus is on whether that decision is supported by the record.\u201d <em>Bellanca, </em>86 Md.App. at 230 n. 10, 586 A.2d at 68 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Consistently with <em>Ellicott </em>and <em>Bellanca, </em>with the judicial review statutes for rezoning in jurisdictions other than the County, and with the Maryland law involving constitutionally based judicial review of administrative adjudicatory fact-finding in contexts other than rezoning, we hold that the standard for review in the instant matter is the substantiality of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Logically, the next step in our analysis would be to determine if the facts found by the Council are supported by substantial evidence.

Boardwalk Plaza Venture, </em>68 Md.App. at 662, 515 A.2d at 490 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">In the instant case, the Council made twelve \u201cFindings of Fact.\u201d Findings one through four pertain to the procedural history and have not been set forth in Part II, <em>supra. </em>Findings five through twelve are set forth in Part II, <em>supra. </em>Finding five simply refers to \u00a7 19.14(c)(l)(iv) as controlling. Finding eleven states that the required site visit was made, and finding twelve states that, \u201c[i]n light of the above findings,\u201d the application is denied. We are concerned here with findings six through ten.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Findings seven, eight, nine, and ten appear to be based on five criteria set forth in \u00a7 19.14(c)(l)(ii)[f] that are required to be considered for certain amendments to the zoning maps, as shown by the comparison set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>The introduction to subsection (ii) expressly states the scope of subsection (ii). It deals with \u201cAmendments to the Official Zoning District Maps excepting properties within the boundaries of the Critical Area where growth allocation is requested.\u201d \u00a7 19.14(c)(1)(h). In contrast, subsection (iv) deals with \u201cGrowth Allocation District Boundary Amendments in [the] Critical Area.\u201d Thus, the directly applicable criteria for Buck-tail\u2019s requested rezoning are the nine criteria established by \u00a7 19.14(c)(l)(iv)[b], which are set forth in Part I, <em>supra. </em>In a case such as the instant one, if the developer can satisfy the criteria of subsection (iv) on a request for rezoning from one dwelling unit per twenty acres to one dwelling per five acres, the developer will have complied with the requirements for rezoning a property in the Critical Area from RCA to LDA. It would seem that reclassification under the underlying zoning from RC to RR would then follow, simply because there are no additional applicable requirements in the zoning ordinance. Thus, findings seven through ten appear to be irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Finding six reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>\u201cThe County Council finds \u2018upon the basis of the evidence of record\u2019 that the request for Critical Area Growth Allocation does not comply with all of the Critical Area Policies and applicable design standards as referenced in Section 19.14(c)(iv) of the Zoning Code of Talbot County.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">This finding does not advise Bucktail, in terms of the facts and circumstances of the record, in which aspect(s) Bucktail\u2019s application fails to comply with the Critical Area criteria or policies. Thus, finding six is deficient under the legal principles reviewed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In the alternative, we shall assume that the requirements of subsection (ii), as well as those of (iv), must be complied with to obtain the reclassifications at both levels of zoning that are requested here. Findings seven through ten, <em>see </em>note 5, <em>supra, </em>suffer from the same deficiency as does finding six. These findings fail to advise Bucktail, in terms of the facts and circumstances of the record, in which aspect(s) the application is deficient under subsection (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Council findings six through ten are merely conclusory statements. Here, where the planning staff and the Planning Commission have recommended approval of Bucktail\u2019s project and found that it complies with all applicable requirements, it is not sufficient for the Council simply to express conclusions, without pointing to the facts found by the Council that form the basis for its contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The appellees, by brief and at oral argument, have pointed to certain facts in the record that arguably might justify the denial of Bucktail\u2019s application, but these arguments cannot cure the deficiency.

No argument is made in this case that under Article 25A the power to make piecemeal amendments of the zoning map must be conferred on the Board of Appeals, either originally or on review of the action of an administrative officer or agency or of a county council sitting in an adjudicatory manner. See <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People's Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>336 Md. 569, 587-91, 650 A.2d 226, 235-37 (1994); <em>Hope v.

At the time of the decision in <em>Ellieott </em>the rule was that an administrative zoning agency could not decide challenges to the validity of the zoning ordinance, even as it applied to the property involved. That rule is no longer the law. <em>See Holiday Point Marina Partners v. Anne Arundel County, </em>349 Md. 190, 199-200, 707 A.2d 829, 834 (1998) (citing cases).
