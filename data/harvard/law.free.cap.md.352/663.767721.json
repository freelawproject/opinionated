State, </em>332 Md. 571, 632 A.2d 797 (1993), to be a strict liability offense. For the reasons set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>forth below, we hold that Appellant\u2019s rights to due process under the Maryland and United States Constitutions were not violated when, upon being charged with statutory rape, the trial court prevented Appellant from presenting his defense that he reasonably believed the victim was above 13 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The facts in this case are not in dispute. According to the agreed statement of facts, on April 11, 1997, a police officer conducting a routine nighttime patrol discovered Timothy Owens and Ariel Correta Johnson in the rear seat of a parked car, dressing. When asked, Johnson told the police officer that she was 16 years old. After calling Johnson\u2019s residence, he discovered that her correct date of birth was October 16, 1983, making her 13 years old at the time of the incident. Owens was born April 27, 1978, making him 18 years old at the time. After compiling evidence that the two had just engaged in sexual intercourse, Owens was charged with second degree rape in violation of \u00a7 463(a), which states in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of rape in the second degree if the person engages in vaginal intercourse with another person: * * * (3) Who is under 14 years of age and the person performing the act is at least four years older than the victim.\u201d Owens elected to proceed by way of a not guilty agreed statement of facts, which the prosecutor recited into the record. It was not disputed that \u201c[t]he victim, if asked, would also testify that she had told the Defendant that she was 16 years of age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Owens\u2019 counsel made a motion to dismiss the charges, arguing that the statute was unconstitutional in that it violated Owens\u2019 due process rights under the United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Owens also argued that, notwithstanding this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Garnett, </em>the trial court should find that there was a reasonable mistake of fact that negates Owens\u2019 guilt. The trial judge denied that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>motion and also denied a subsequent motion for judgment of acquittal noting that, under <em>Garnett, </em>mistake of age could only be used as a mitigating factor at the time of sentencing. The judge then found Owens guilty of second degree rape and sentenced him to 18 months of imprisonment, with all but time served (12 days) suspended, and 18 months of probation. Owens was also ordered to register as a child sex offender, as required by \u00a7 792, and to submit to DNA testing. In sentencing Owens, the court specifically considered mistake of age as a mitigating factor. Owens appealed to the Court of Special Appeals and this Court, on its own motion, granted certiorari before review by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">In <em>Garnett, </em>we addressed whether Maryland\u2019s statutory rape law required the State to prove whether the defendant knew the female victim was younger than 14 years of age and whether the trial court erred by excluding evidence \u201cthat he had been told, and believed, that she was 16 years old.\u201d <em>Garnett, </em>332 Md. at 574, 632 A.2d at 798. In ruling that the defendant in <em>Garnett </em>could not present evidence that he was told and believed that the defendant had reached 16 years of age, the trial judge ruled that \u00a7 463(a)(3) requires proof of only three elements: (1) that there was vaginal intercourse; (2) that the complaining witness was, in fact, under 14 years of age; and (3) the defendant was at least four years older than the complaining witness with whom he had sexual intercourse. 332 Md. at 575, 632 A.2d at 799. The trial court concluded that statutory rape was a strict liability offense and, therefore, mistake of age could not be a defense. On appeal, the defendant argued that \u00a7 463(a)(3), which has no express <em>mens rea </em>requirement, should be judicially interpreted to allow a defense of a reasonable mistake of age. After reviewing the legislative history of Maryland sex crimes statutes, <em>Garnett, </em>332 Md. at 576, 632 A.2d at 799-800, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">\u201c[T]he Legislature explicitly raised, considered, and then explicitly jettisoned any notion of a <em>mens rea </em>element with respect to the complainant\u2019s age in enacting the law that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>formed the basis of current \u00a7 463(a)(3). In the light of such legislative action, we must inevitably conclude that the current law imposes strict liability on its violators.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-5\"><em>Garnett, </em>332 Md. at 587, 632 A.2d at 805. Thus, we held that the trial court had not erred in refusing to allow Garnett to present evidence that he had been told, and in fact believed, that the complaining witness was 16 years old. <em>Garnett, </em>332 Md. at 584-86, 632 A.2d at 803-05. Our holding that the statute did not afford defendant a mistake-of-age defense was consistent with the majority rule in that \u201ca defendant\u2019s knowledge of the age of a victim is not an essential element of statutory rape\u201d and that \u201c[p]roof of a statutory rape requires merely proof of an act of sexual intercourse and proof that the victim is below the prohibited age.\u201d Cohn Campbell, Annotation, <em>Mistake or Lack of Information as to Victim\u2019s Age as Defense to Statutory Rape, </em>46 A.L.R.5th 499, 508 (1997). We did not, however, address the constitutionality of \u00a7 463(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Although we did not address the constitutional question in <em>Garnett, </em>we noted that \u201c[t]he requirement that an accused have acted with a culpable mental state is an axiom of criminal jurisprudence.\u201d 332 Md. at 578, 632 A.2d at 800. In the instant case, we consider whether the \u201caxiom\u201d we noted in <em>Garnett </em>is of constitutional dimensions with respect to Maryland\u2019s statutory rape law. In particular, we must determine whether the legislature exceeded its powers under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Articles 20 and 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by precluding Appellant from raising his mistake-of-age defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The United States Supreme Court has never addressed the constitutionality of denying a defendant the ability to present a mistake-of-age defense to the crime of statutory rape. On a number of occasions, however, the Supreme Court has articulated its strong preference for finding within a criminal statute a <em>mens rea </em>element where none has been expressly included. Appellant cites <em>Morissette v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952), for the proposition that \u201cin order to convict a defendant of a criminal offense, the State must prove a culpable mental state.\u201d Morissette had been charged with \u201cunlawfully, wilfully and knowingly stealing] and convert[ing]\u201d U.S. government property when he took bomb casings from an Air Force practice bombing range. <em>Morissette, </em>342 U.S. at 247-48, 72 S.Ct. at 241-42, 96 L.Ed. at 292. He challenged his conviction on the ground that he should have been able to present the defense that he reasonably believed that the shell cases had been abandoned. <em>Morissette, </em>342 U.S. at 248-49, 72 S.Ct. at 242-43, 96 L.Ed. at 292-93. In assessing whether the federal larceny statute dispensed with a criminal intent requirement, the Court discussed its \u201cuniversal and persistent\u201d policy favoring some mental element to justify punishment. <em>Morissette, </em>342 U.S. at 250-51, 72 S.Ct. at 243, 96 L.Ed. at 293-94. In light of the common law\u2019s requirement of intent for the crime of theft, the Court -reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Similarly, in <em>Staples v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 600, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 128 L.Ed.2d 608 (1994), the Court interpreted the National Firearms Act to include a <em>mens rea </em>requirement, reversing a criminal conviction. The trial court had ruled that the prosecution did not have to prove that the defendant knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>that he possessed a weapon with characteristics that brought it within the prohibitions of the Act. Reversing the lower courts, the Supreme Court accepted the defendant\u2019s argument that the government should have been required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew the weapon he possessed was an automatic weapon required to be registered under the Act. <em>Staples, </em>511 U.S. at 619-20, 114 S.Ct. at 1804, 128 L.Ed.2d at 624-25. <em>See also United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., </em>513 U.S. 64, 78, 115 S.Ct. 464, 472, 130 L.Ed.2d 372, 385 (1994)(holding that the term \u201cknowingly\u201d in an obscenity statute required knowledge that the materials included sexual depictions of minors). We have similarly been reluctant to read into criminal statutes an intent of the legislature to forego a mens rea requirement. <em>See State v. McCallum, </em>321 Md. 451, 456-57, 583 A.2d 250, 252-53 (1991)(interpreting statute prohibiting driving with a suspended license to include a mental element); <em>Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 649, 547 A.2d 1041, 1046 (1988)(observing that the \u201cstatutory scheme strongly indicates an intention on the part of the General Assembly to require <em>scienter </em>as an element of the [possession of controlled substances and controlled paraphernalia] offenses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Appellant finds perhaps his strongest support that the absence of a mens rea requirement in a criminal statute is violative of due process in <em>Lambert v. California, </em>355 U.S. 225, 78 S.Ct. 240, 2 L.Ed.2d 228 (1957), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>355 U.S. 937, 78 S.Ct. 410, 2 L.Ed.2d 419 (1958). The defendant in <em>Lambert </em>was convicted of violating a Los Angeles felon registration ordinance. The Supreme Court addressed whether due process was violated when the ordinance was \u201capplied to a person who ha[d] no actual knowledge of his duty to register, and where no showing [was] made of the probability of such knowledge.\u201d <em>Lambert, </em>355 U.S. at 227, 78 S.Ct. at 242, 2 L.Ed.2d at 231. In finding that the defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated, the Court emphasized that the conduct made illegal [was] \u201cwholly passive.\u201d <em>Lambert, </em>355 U.S. at 228, 78 S.Ct. at 243, 2 L.Ed.2d at 231. \u201cIt is unlike the commission of acts, or the failure to act under circumstances that should alert the doer to the consequences of his deed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Despite its preference for a <em>mens rea </em>requirement when interpreting criminal statutes and its holding in <em>Lambert, </em>the \u201c[Supreme] Court has never articulated a general constitutional doctrine of <em>mens rea.\u201d Powell v. Texas, </em>392 U.S. 514, 535, 88 S.Ct. 2145, 2155-56, 20 L.Ed.2d 4254, 1269 (1968). Rather, within certain constitutional limits, states may \u201ccreate strict criminal liabilities by defining criminal offenses without any element of scienter.\u201d <em>Smith v. California, </em>361 U.S. 147, 150, 80 S.Ct. 215, 217, 4 L.Ed.2d 205, 209 (1959), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>361 U.S. 950, 80 S.Ct. 399, 4 L.Ed.2d 383 (1960). Several of the cases upholding strict liability statutes involve \u201cpublic welfare\u201d statutes, \u201cwhereby penalties serve as [an] effective means of regulation.\u201d <em>United States v. Dotterweich, </em>320 U.S. 277, 280-81, 284-85, 64 S.Ct. 134, 136, 138, 88 L.Ed. 48, 51, 53 (1943)(approving criminal sanction for misbranding of drugs \u201cthough consciousness of wrongdoing be totally wanting\u201d); <em>United States v. Freed, </em>401 U.S. 601, 609-10, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 1117-18, 28 L.Ed.2d 356, 362-63 (1971), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>403 U.S. 912, 91 S.Ct. 2201, 29 L.Ed.2d 690 (1971)(holding that the National Firearms Act imposes criminal liability on a person possessing hand grenades despite one\u2019s ignorance of illegality of such possession); <em>United States v. Balint, </em>258 U.S. 250, 252-54, 42 S.Ct. 301, 302-03, 66 L.Ed. 604, 606 (1922)(similar holding).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The Supreme Court, however, has never suggested that strict criminal liability may be imposed only for regulatory offenses. For example, in <em>United States v. Feola, </em>420 U.S. 671, 95 S.Ct. 1255, 43 L.Ed.2d 541 (1975), the Court interpreted a federal assault statute to not include a mens rea requirement as to the identity of the victim of a conspiracy. The Court held a criminal defendant liable for conspiracy to assault a federal officer when the defendant had no knowledge that the individual was a federal officer who would subject him to federal criminal jurisdiction. <em>Feola, </em>420 U.S. at 694-95, 95 S.Ct. at 1261-62, 43 L.Ed.2d at 558-59.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court also has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>upheld convictions and imprisonment for the strict liability crime of bigamy, even when the defendants reasonably believed they had a valid divorce that would have made the second marriage lawful. <em>Williams v. North Carolina, </em>325 U.S. 226, 238, 65 S.Ct. 1092, 1099, 89 L.Ed. 1577, 1586 (1945), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>325 U.S. 895, 65 S.Ct. 1560, 89 L.Ed. 2006 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Finally, this Court and the Supreme Court have held that under certain circumstances statutes that create conclusive, irrebuttable presumptions may violate due process. \u201c[P]ermanent irrebuttable presumptions have long been disfavored under the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Vlandis v. Kline, </em>412 U.S. 441, 446, 93 S.Ct. 2230, 2233, 37 L.Ed.2d 63, 68 (1973). In <em>Vlandis, </em>the Supreme Court invalidated a Connecticut statute that created an irrebuttable presumption affecting tuition rates at a state university. Under the statute, a student who applied to a Connecticut school while a non-resident or who was a non-resident in the year before applying remained a non-resident for tuition rate purposes for as long as he or she remained a student. <em>Vlandis, </em>412 U.S. at 443, 93 S.Ct. at 2232, 37 L.Ed.2d at 66. The Court said that the Due Process Clause forbids a state from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">\u201cdenying] an individual the resident rates on the basis of a permanent and irrebuttable presumption of nonresidence, when that presumption is not necessarily or universally true in fact, and when the State has a reasonable alternative means of making the crucial determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-7\"><em>Vlandis, </em>412 U.S. at 452, 93 S.Ct. at 2236, 37 L.Ed.2d at 71. <em>See also Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, </em>414 U.S. 632, 647, 94 S.Ct. 791, 799, 39 L.Ed.2d 52, 64 (1974)(public school policies presumed that pregnant women were physically unfit for classroom teaching); <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>649-50, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 1212, 31 L.Ed.2d 551, 557-58 (1972)(statute presumed that all unmarried fathers are unqualified to raise their children).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Applying a similar test in <em>Mahoney v. Byers, </em>187 Md. 81, 48 A.2d 600 (1946), this Court struck down a rule promulgated by the Maryland Racing Commission as violative of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The rule, designed to penalize horse trainers for drugging horses within the 48 hours prior to racing, prohibited persons from \u201cknowingly or carelessly\u201d permitting the administering of a drug. <em>Mahoney, </em>187 Md. at 83, 48 A.2d at 602. The rule then provided that a positive test of horse saliva or urine on the day of the race \u201cshall be conclusive evidence either that there was knowledge of the fact ... or that he was guilty of carelessness.\u201d <em>Mahoney, </em>187 Md. at 84, 48 A.2d at 602. We observed that, because there was no rule requiring trainers to keep watch over their horses day and night in the 48 hours prior to the start of a race, the presumption in the rule arose \u201cout of the thin air,\u201d and thus, we held the conclusive presumption invalid. <em>Mahoney, </em>187 Md. at 88, 48 A.2d at 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">At the outset, we note that our decision here is not concerned with the wisdom of Maryland\u2019s policy of imposing strict criminal liability on those who engage in sexual intercourse with children under age 14. Absent any constitutional prohibition, it is within the \u201clegislative power to define crimes and to fix their punishment.\u201d <em>Scarlett v. State, </em>201 Md. 310, 320, 93 A.2d 753, 757 (1953), <em>cert. denied, </em>345 U.S. 955, 73 S.Ct. 937, 97 L.Ed. 1377 (1953). Our only consideration is whether due process requires that Owens be allowed to defend the charge of statutory rape on the grounds that he reasonably believed that the victim was above the age of 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">An overwhelming majority of courts confronted -with a constitutional challenge to statutory rape laws have held that denying a defendant a mistake-of-age defense in a statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>rape case does not deprive him of his due process rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We are aware of only one court which has held that due process mandates a mistake-of-age defense to statutory rape, and that holding appears to be based on state, and not federal, constitutional analysis. <em>See State v. Guest, </em>583 P.2d 836 (Alaska 1978).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We decline to deviate from the majority rule and uphold the legislature\u2019s intent, as determined in <em>Garnett, </em>to make statutory rape a strict liability crime. While due process concerns undoubtedly place some limitations on the legislature\u2019s ability to create strict liability crimes, for the reasons set forth below, we find that \u00a7 463(a)(3) falls within those limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Appellant finds little support in any Court of Appeals or United States Supreme Court decision for the proposition that a mental element is constitutionally required for criminal liability, even when substantial penalties are involved. In support of his argument that the defense of mistake of age is constitutionally required, Appellant contends that the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>preme Court, in its <em>Morissette </em>and <em>X-Citement Video </em>decisions, and this Court, in our decision in <em>Garnett, </em>misinterpreted the common law, which, appellant argues, did allow for a reasonable mistake-of-age defense to statutory rape. Authorities are apparently divided as to whether, at common law, a mistake-of-age defense to statutory rape was permitted. A number of courts have stated, for example, that \u201cstatutory rape was universally regarded as a strict liability offense until well into the twentieth century.\u201d <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>841 F.2d 268, 270 (9th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>487 U.S. 1227, 108 S.Ct. 2887, 101 L.Ed.2d 922 (1988). <em>See also Garnett, </em>332 Md. at 587, 632 A.2d at 805 (noting the \u201ctraditional view of statutory rape as a strict liability crime\u201d). Conversely, other authorities have explained that, under the early common law and English statutes, mistake of age was a permissible defense to statutory rape. <em>See </em>Larry W. Myers, <em>Reasonable Mistake of Age: A Needed Defense to Statutory Rape, </em>64 Mich. L.Rev. 105, 109-10 (1965); <em>Garnett, </em>332 Md. at 605-06 n. 14, 632 A.2d at 814 n. 14 (Bell, J., dissenting). As Appellant\u2019s brief states, Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, widely accepted as authoritative on English criminal law, explain that \u201cto constitute a crime against human laws, there must be, first, a vicious will; and secondly, an unlawful act consequent upon such vicious will.\u201d 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries 21 (1769).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">It is not necessary for us to resolve the apparent dispute as to whether, at common law, a mistake-of-age defense to statutory rape was permissible. Regardless of the status of the defense at common law, we have determined that our statute does not include a mistake-of-age defense, and the cases simply do not support the proposition that due process mandates that the mistake-of-age defense be allowed. Significantly, our own cases and the Supreme Court cases that articulate the \u201cuniversal and persistent\u201d policy favoring a mens rea component for criminal liability, <em>Morissette, </em>342 U.S. at 250, 72 S.Ct. at 243, 96 L.Ed. at 293, involve interpretations of state or federal criminal statutes, not interpretations of the Due Process Clause. <em>See, e.g., Staples, </em>511 U.S. at 604, 114 S.Ct. at 1796, 128 L.Ed.2d at 615 (noting that its decision turned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>upon \u201ca question of statutory construction\u201d); <em>McCallum,, </em>321 Md. at 455-57, 583 A.2d at 252-53 (interpreting a driving with suspended license statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">In contrast to its policy of favoring inclusion of a mens rea element when interpreting a statute, when interpreting the Due Process Clause the Supreme Court has often endorsed the concept of strict criminal liability. In <em>Lambert, </em>the Supreme Court explicitly rejected Blackstone\u2019s view that a vicious will \u201cis necessary to constitute a crime, for conduct alone without regard to the intent of the doer is often sufficient.

Indeed, it is hard to imagine when a defendant, necessarily four years older than the victim under \u00a7 463(a)(3), would be \u201cmorally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>blameless\u201d when he or she engages in sexual intercourse with a child as young as age 13. <em>Tagne, </em>310 N.W.2d at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">We next consider Maryland\u2019s interest in enacting its statutory rape law and whether the law is suited to that interest.

Statutory rape laws may help prevent pregnancies, which carry \u201csignificant social, medical, and economic consequences for both the mother and her child, and the State.\u201d <em>Michael M. v. Sonoma County Superior Court, </em>450 U.S. 464, 470, 101 S.Ct. 1200, 1205, 67 L.Ed.2d 437, 443 (1981)(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Perhaps most significantly, an adult who engages in sexual activity with a child may cause the child serious psychological damage, regardless' of the child\u2019s maturity or lack of chastity. Since the adult will almost always be more physically mature and experienced in sexual matters, the risk of sexual exploitation is significant. Moreover, the effects on children of sexual exploitation often follow the child into adulthood, with societal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>consequences as well. As <em>the </em>New Jersey Supreme Court has recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-5\">\u201cSexual assault takes a heavy toll on its victims, particularly on children. Recent research indicates that a number of psychosocial problems\u2014including chronic depression and anxiety, isolation and poor social adjustment, substance abuse, suicidal behavior, and involvement in physically or sexually abusive relationships as either aggressor or victim\u2014are more common among adults molested as children than among those with no such childhood experiences. Victims of sexual abuse can suffer an impaired ability to critically evaluate the motives and behavior of others, making them more vulnerable to revictimization. An especially disturbing finding about child sexual abuse is its strong intergenerational pattern; in particular, due to the psychological impact of their own abuse, sexually abused boys have been found to be more likely than non-abused boys to turn into offenders against the next generation of children, and sexually abused girls are more likely to become mothers of children who are abused. And studies show that adult male aggressive behavior, particularly sexual aggression, is associated with the trauma of childhood sexual abuse. Thus, apart from the substantial personal trauma caused to the victims of such crimes, sexual crimes against children exact heavy social costs as well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-6\"><em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 N.J. 1, 662 A.2d 367, 375 (N.J.1995)(quoting Brief for the United States at 5-8 (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">The state\u2019s overwhelming interest in protecting children from these risks outweighs any interest that the individual may have in engaging in sexual relations with children near the age of consent. Although we need not reach the issue, it has been held that a person has no constitutional right to engage in sexual intercourse, at least outside of marriage, and sexual conduct frequently is subject to state regulation. <em>Cf. Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 </em>U.S. 186, 106 S.Ct. 2841, 92 L.Ed.2d 140 (1986), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>478 U.S. 1039, 107 S.Ct. 29, 92 L.Ed.2d 779 (1986)(upholding Georgia statute criminalizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>the act of sodomy). Many states still criminalize fornication<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and other sexual behavior.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Furthermore, given the substantial risks of sexual abuse and exploitation of children, the public policies behind statutory rape laws appear to be significantly stronger than, to take one example, the public policy of promoting \u201cthe integrity of family life\u201d through the crime of bigamy, for which the defendants in <em>Williams </em>were constitutionally imprisoned despite the absence of any criminal intent. <em>Williams, </em>325 U.S. at 238, 65 S.Ct. at 1099, 89 L.Ed. at 1586. Statutory rape laws may be deemed necessary by legislators to protect those whose \u201cimmaturity and innocence prevents them from appreciating the full magnitude and consequences of their conduct.\u201d <em>People v. Cash, </em>419 Mich. 230, 351 N.W.2d 822, 826-27 (Mich.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The crime of statutory rape also does not implicate other constitutional rights that heighten our level of inquiry. If, for example, First Amendment rights are implicated by a strict liability statute, we may be more likely to find the statute in violation of due process requirements. <em>See Smith, </em>361 U.S. at 153, 80 S.Ct. at 218, 4 L.Ed.2d at 211 (interpreting an obscenity statute to include a mens rea requirement in order to avoid \u201cimposing] a restriction upon the distribution of constitutionally protected as well as obscene literature\u201d); <em>X-Citement Video, </em>513 U.S. at 78, 115 S.Ct. at 472, 130 L.Ed.2d at 385 (interpreting the term \u201cknowingly\u201d in a federal statute regulating child pornography to include knowledge that the materials involve minors). The instant case does not implicate the First Amendment; rather, the statute at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>involves constitutionally permissible regulation of sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The legislature\u2019s decision to disallow a mistake-of-age defense to statutory rape furthers its interest in protecting children in ways that may not be accomplished if the law were to allow such a defense. Precisely because \u00a7 463(a)(1) eliminates the need for the state to prove that the potential offender knew or was unreasonable in the failure to recognize that the victim was under age 14, the statute \u201cmay reasonably be expected to have some deterrent effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Ransom, </em>942 F.2d 775, 777 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 1042, 112 S.Ct. 897, 116 L.Ed.2d 799 (1992); <em>see also People v. Gonzales, </em>148 Misc.2d 973, 561 N.Y.S.2d 358, 361 (Co.Ct.1990)(\u201c[T]he criminal consequences of violating the statutory age limit under present law deter sexual contact between older, more sophisticated adults, and often naive minors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Deterrence is accomplished by placing the risk of an error in judgment as to a potential sex partner\u2019s age with the potential offender. Moreover, even though a criminal statute that dispenses with any mens rea requirement could unconstitutionally infringe upon innocent conduct, <em>cf. Liparota v. United States, </em>471 U.S. 419, 426, 105 S.Ct. 2084, 2088, 85 L.Ed.2d 434, 440 (1985)(construing statute to include mens rea element \u201cis particularly appropriate where ... to interpret the statute otherwise would be to criminalize a broad range of apparently innocent conduct\u201d), we believe that the statute in question here does not intrude upon innocent conduct to the extent of outweighing the state\u2019s interest.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Where doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>exists as to a potential sexual partner\u2019s age, abstention from intercourse is a readily available solution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">\u201cThe defendant in a statutory rape case does not lack the ability to comply with the law; he must simply abstain from sexual intercourse when there is even the remotest possibility that his partner is below the statutory age. Moreover, unlike the defendant who reasonably believes his wife to be dead, remarries, and is convicted of bigamy, the man who contemplates intercourse with a partner of indeterminate age can resolve doubts in favor of compliance with the law without sacrificing behavior that society considers desirable---- [T]he maximization of deterrence for socially undesirable behavior may sometimes require the deterrence of socially neutral conduct as well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-7\"><em>Recent Cases, </em>78 Harv. L.Rev. 1257, 1258-59 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">The state\u2019s interest in protecting children would be significantly undermined if we were to find the statute unconstitutional. We have previously recognized that the state legislature\u2019s interest in furthering its objective most effectively helps to justify a strict liability statute. In <em>Ford v. State, </em>85 Md. 465, 473, 37 A. 172, 173 (1897), we considered a former Maryland statute that made it a crime for one to possess \u201cany book, list, slip or record of the numbers drawn in any lottery.\u201d The statute provided for a fine of $1000 and/or up to one year of imprisonment. . The defendant argued that his conviction under the statute was unconstitutional because it did not allow him to present evidence showing that he had no knowledge that the papers in his possession were subject to the statute. We acknowledged that the papers, which we deemed \u201cutterly unintelligible to any one not learned in the business,\u201d <em>Ford, </em>85 Md. at 477, 37 A. at 174, may not give notice to an innocent person of their illegal character, but we rejected the constitutional argument, concluding that the statute\u2019s lack of a mens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>rea requirement was consistent with the Due Process Clause. We noted the state\u2019s strong interest in thwarting the growth of the (then) illegal lottery business, and observed that \u201cthe statute has made the mere possession of the articles a crime because that is the most effectual way to break up the lottery business.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>85 Md. at 480, 37 A. at 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Similarly, the statutory rape statute effectively furthers a significant state interest. Aside from deterring sexual activity with children, by disallowing a mistake-of-age defense, the state avoids the risk that the inevitably emotional statutory rape trial will focus unjustifiably on the child\u2019s appearance and level of maturity. \u201cThe obvious problem is that because early adolescents tend to grow at a rapid rate, by the time of trial a relatively undeveloped young girl or boy may have transformed into a young woman or man.\u201d <em>Cash, </em>351 N.W.2d at 828. Defendant\u2019s assertion that he had made a reasonable mistake regarding the victim\u2019s age is best considered as a mitigating circumstance at sentencing, which is what occurred in this case. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Appellant contends that \u00a7 463(a)(3) unconstitutionally creates an irrebuttable presumption that the victim\u2019s mental state is irrelevant and that children under age 14 are incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">First, we note that \u00a7 463(a)(3) simply prohibits sexual intercourse with one who is \u201cunder 14 years of age\u201d when the person \u201cperforming the act is at least four years older than the victim.\u201d Intent is simply not relevant to the charges. As the Iowa Supreme Court has concluded, \u201c[h]ere we are not dealing with a presumption (or, more correctly, inference) at all. The statute is not concerned with presumptions or inferences. Rather it flatly prohibits the act defendant committed.\u201d <em>State v. Drake, </em>219 N.W.2d 492, 496 (Iowa 1974). <em>See also State v. Hill, </em>170 N.J.Super. 485, 406 A.2d 1334, 1336 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.1979)(\u201cPresumption does not play any part in the violation of the statute.\u201d). For the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>reasons stated above, the legislature may constitutionally prohibit sexual intercourse with a child below age 14 in order to protect the child\u2019s physical and mental health and welfare. Since Maryland\u2019s statutory rape statute directly prohibits vaginal intercourse with children below age 14 without regard to the minor\u2019s ability to consent, it does not utilize any presumption that unconstitutionally burdens the criminal defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Second and relatedly, under the statutory scheme of \u00a7 463(a)(3), age is not used to determine any element of the crime beyond the age itself. Thus, it is distinguishable from the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>LaFleur, Vlandis, </em>and <em>Stanley, </em>as well as our decision in <em>Mahoney. See </em>Part II, <em>swpra. </em>In each of these cases, the provision held to violate due process took one fact and used it to justify a separate, factual conclusion, and, moreover, the fact presumed bore little or no relation to the objective of the law. In <em>LaFleur, </em>the public school policies took the fact of pregnancy and presumed that pregnancy made women physically unfit for classroom teaching. 414 U.S. at 647, 94 S.Ct. at 799, 39 L.Ed.2d at 64. The statute in question in <em>Vlandis </em>presumed that one who applied to a state school while living out-of-state was a non-resident regardless of facts suggesting otherwise, for as long as that individual remained a student. 412 U.S. at 449-50, 93 S.Ct. at 2235, 37 L.Ed.2d at 70. In <em>Stanley, </em>the statute conclusively presumed that all unmarried fathers are unqualified to raise their children. 405 U.S. at 650, 92 S.Ct. at 1214, 31 L.Ed.2d at 558. In <em>Mahoney, </em>the regulation invalidated specifically stated that presence of drugs in saliva or urine \u201cshall be conclusive evidence\u201d that the trainer had knowledge or was careless in allowing the horse to be drugged. 187 Md. at 83-84, 48 A.2d at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">In sharp contrast, \u00a7 463(a)(3) does not presume that anyone engaging in sexual intercourse with one under the age of 14 intended to do so, or that the victim is incapable of consenting; rather, the statute protects children from sexual conduct, regardless of whether the defendant intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>engage in the prohibited conduct with one under age 14 and whether the victim purported to consent. Unlike the statutes stricken down as unconstitutional, \u00a7 463(a)(3) does not take as one fact (pregnancy, an application for admission when living out-of-state, the unmarried father, or a positive drug test) and use that fact to arrive at a separate conclusion (fitness for classroom teaching, resident status, fitness for raising children, or the administering of drugs to horses with knowledge or carelessness). In other words, \u00a7 463(a)(3) does not require intent to engage in intercourse with one under 14 years old and then presume that intent simply because of the victim\u2019s age; nor does it prohibit sexual intercourse without consent and then presume that children under age 14 are incapable of consenting. As a result, the irrebuttable presumption doctrine does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Finally, even if we were to agree that the statute creates an irrebuttable presumption that children age 13 and under are incapable of making an informed decision about whether to consent to sexual intercourse, the nexus between the presumption and the state\u2019s interest in protecting children is sufficient enough to ameliorate any due process concerns.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Rita Eidson, <em>The Constitutionality of Statutory Rape Laws, </em>27 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 757, 811 (1980) (concluding that the irrebuttable presumption doctrine may apply only to statutory rape laws \u201cwith a high age of consent,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>age 16). Basing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>one\u2019s ability to consent to sexual intercourse on the individual\u2019s meeting the age of 14 is not \u201cwholly unrelated\u201d to the state\u2019s objective of protecting minor children, and it is hard to imagine when the presumption would not \u201coperate to effectuate the State\u2019s asserted interest\u201d in protecting children from sexual abuse, exploitation and early pregnancy. <em>Vlandis, </em>412 U.S. at 449, 93 S.Ct. at 2235, 37 L.Ed.2d at 69-70. Therefore, even if the irrebuttable presumption doctrine would apply, we could not conclude that \u00a7 463(a)(3) is \u201cso arbitrary as to constitute a denial of due process of law.\u201d <em>Vlandis, </em>412 U.S. at 450, 93 S.Ct. at 2235, 37 L.Ed.2d at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">In sum, we find no constitutional barriers to placing on individuals engaging in sexual intercourse the risk that their sexual partner is below age 14, regardless of the reasonableness of their belief otherwise. The state has an unparalleled interest in protecting children from the potentially devastating effects of sexual abuse and exploitation, and the statutory rape statute furthers that interest.

Although I agreed \u201cthat an ordinary defendant\u2019s mistake about the age of his or her sexual partner is not a defense to a prosecution under \u00a7 463(a)(3),\u201d I disagreed with the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 463(a)(3) enacted a \u201cstrict liability\u201d offense \u201cwhere criminal \u2018liability is imposed regardless of the defendant\u2019s state of mind.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting <em>Dawkins v.

I went on to set forth my view of the <em>mens rea </em>requirement in \u00a7 463(a)(3) as follows (332 Md. at 590-592, 632 A.2d at 806-807):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-9\">\u201cIn the typical situation involving an older person\u2019s engaging in consensual sexual activities with a teenager below the age of consent, and the scenario which the General Assembly likely contemplated when it enacted \u00a7\u00a7 463(a)(3), 464A(a)(3), 464B(a)(3), 464C(a)(2), and 464C(a)(3), the defendant knows and intends that he or she is engaging in sexual activity with a young person. In addition, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>knows that the activity is regarded as immoral and/or improper by large segments of society. Moreover, the defendant is aware that \u2018consent\u2019 by persons who are too young is ineffective. Although in a particular case the defendant may honestly but mistakenly believe, because of representations or appearances, that the other person is above the age of consent, the ordinary defendant in such case is or ought to be aware that there is a risk that the young person is not above the age of consent. As the majority opinion points out, \u2018the traditional view [is] that those who engage in sex with young persons do so at their peril, assuming the risk that their partners are underage ____\u2019 It seems to me that the above-mentioned knowledge factors, and particularly the mental ability to appreciate that one is taking a risk, constitute the <em>mens rea </em>of the offenses defined by \u00a7\u00a7 463(a)(3), 464A(a)(3), 464B(a)(3), 4640(a)(2) and 4640(a)(3). In enacting these provisions, the General Assembly assumed that a defendant is able to appreciate the risk involved by intentionally and knowingly engaging in sexual activities with a young person. There is no indication that the General Assembly intended that criminal liability attach to one who, because of his or her mental impairment, was unable to appreciate that risk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-6\">\u201cIt is unreasonable to assume that the Legislature intended for one to be convicted under \u00a7 463(a)(3), or under any of the other statutes proscribing sexual activity with underage persons, regardless of his or her mental state. Suppose, for example, that Raymond Garnett had not had an I.Q. of 52, but rather, had been more severely mentally retarded as was the young woman involved in <em>Wentzel v. Montgomery Gen. Hosp., </em>293 Md. 685, 447 A.2d 1244, <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1147, 103 S.Ct. 790, 74 L.Ed.2d 995 (1983). The mentally retarded person in <em>Wentzel </em>had an I.Q. of 25-30, was physiologically capable of bearing a child, but was unable to comprehend the act of sexual intercourse, or even to understand the difference between the sexes. If someone so disabled, having reached Raymond\u2019s chronological age, then had \u2018consensual\u2019 sexual intercourse with a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>younger than fourteen years of age, I do not believe that he or she would have violated Art. 27, \u00a7 463(a)(3). Under the view that \u00a7\u00a7 463(a)(3), 464A(a)(3), 464B(a)(3), etc., define pure strict liability offenses without any regard for the defendant\u2019s mental state, presumably a 20 year old, who passes out because of drinking too many alcoholic beverages, would be guilty of a sexual offense if a 13 year old engages in various sexual activities with the 20 year old while the latter is unconscious. I cannot imagine that the General Assembly intended any such result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">I find the majority\u2019s opinion today somewhat confusing. Thus, in some portions of the opinion, the majority seems to be reaffirming the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Garnett. </em>The majority refers to \u00a7 463(a)(3) as a \u201cstrict liability\u201d offense (352 Md. at 681, 724 A.2d at 52), and indicates that the statute \u201cdispenses with any mens rea requirement ...\u201d (352 Md. at 685, 724 A.2d at 54). Other portions of the majority opinion, however, appear to reflect the views set forth in my dissenting opinion in the <em>Garnett </em>case. For example, the majority states that \u201cthe sexual intercourse proscribed by \u00a7 463(a)(3) ... involves conscious activity which gives rise to circumstances that place a reasonable person on notice of potential illegality.\u201d 352 Md. at 680, 724 A.2d at 51. The majority refers to the defendant being \u201con notice of the potential risks of miscalculating the victim\u2019s age.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The majority also suggests that a defendant violating \u00a7 463(a)(3) would not be \u201c \u2018morally blameless.\u2019 \u201d 352 Md. at 680-81, 724 A.2d at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">If the majority today is modifying the strict liability holding of <em>Garnett, </em>then I applaud the majority\u2019s action. If, on the other hand, the majority is reaffirming the holding in <em>Garnett, </em>I continue to disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">I would affirm the judgment of the circuit court for the reasons set forth in my dissenting opinion in <em>Garnett.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">BELL, Chief Judge, dissenting joined by CATHELL, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">In <em>Garnett v.

Guest, </em>583 P.2d 836, 839 (Alaska, 1978), in which the Supreme Court of Alaska recognized mistake of fact as a defense in statutory rape and opined, \u201cwhere the particular statute is not a public welfare type of offense, either a requirement of criminal intent must be read into the statute or it must be found unconstitutional,\u201d I concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>\"(a) Elements of offense.\u2014A person is guilty of rape in the second degree if the person engages in vaginal intercourse with another person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-10\">(3) Who is under 14 years of age and the person performing the act is at least four years older than the victim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>\u201cthe prosecution of statutory rape in Maryland necessarily brings into conflict the State\u2019s interests in protecting minors and defendants\u2019 due process rights because section 463(a)(3) operates \u2018to exclude elements of knowledge and diligence from its definition,\u201d\u2019 <em>Ransom, </em>942 F.2d at 776, quoting <em>Lambert, </em>355 U.S. at 228, 78 S.Ct. at 242, 2 L.Ed.2d at 231, and, thus, removes reasonable ignorance of the girl\u2019s age and consequent lack of criminal intent as a defense. The failure of section 463(a)(3) to require proof of a culpable mental state conflicts both with the substantive due process ideal requiring that defendants possess some level of fault for a criminal conviction of statutory rape and the procedural due process ideal requiring that the prosecution overcome the presumption of innocence by proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Notwithstanding the maxim that criminal statutes dispensing with the intent requirement and criminal offenses requiring no mens rea have a \u201cgenerally disfavored status,\u201d the rationale of parts V and VI of the majority opinion is that the legislature has absolute authority to create strict liability crimes. For the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>reasons reviewed, I do. not agree. On the contrary, I believe that due process both under the Fourteenth Amendment and under the Declaration of Rights, precludes strict criminal liability for statutory rape. Interpreting section 463(a)(3) as the majority does has the effect of largely relieving the State of its burden of proof and burden of persuasion. By making the defendant\u2019s intent, and, hence, blameworthiness, irrelevant, the Legislature has made inevitable, the petitioner\u2019s conviction. Moreover, upon conviction of the felony offense of statutory rape under section 463(a)(3), in addition to a substantial penalty of up to 20 years imprisonment, a defendant\u2019s reputation will be gravely besmirched. Where there is no issue as to sexual contact, which is more likely than not to be the case in statutory rape prosecutions, proof of the prosecutrix\u2019s age is not only proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt, it is absolutely dispositive of it and, at the same time, it is fatal to the only defense the defendant would otherwise have. So interpreted, section 463(a)(3) not only destroys absolutely the concept of fault, but it renders meaningless, in the statutory rape context, the presumption of innocence and the right to due process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-5\"><em>See id. </em>at 625-26, 632 A.2d at 824 (Bell, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Today, the majority holds, \u201cAppellant\u2019s rights to due process under the Maryland and United States Constitutions were not violated when, upon being charged with statutory rape, the trial court prevented Appellant.from presenting his defense that he reasonably believed the victim was above 13 years of age.\u201d 352 Md. 663, 667, 724 A.2d 43, 45 (1998). Thus, the Court answers the question that I anticipated in <em>Garnett. </em>And, as I did in <em>Garnett, </em>I dissent. Accordingly, what I said in my dissenting opinion, in <em>Garnett, </em>is directly relevant to the case <em>sub judice, </em>and I commend and urge its reading and consideration. To it, I also add the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights guarantee each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>individual due process of law. Due Process protects those liberties that are \u201cso rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\u201d <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 105, 54 S.Ct. 330, 332, 78 L.Ed. 674, 677 (1934). As Justice Chase observed more than 100 years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-4\">\u201cThere are acts which the Federal, or State, Legislature cannot do, without exceeding their authority. There are certain vital principles in our free Republican governments, which will determine and overrule an apparent and flagrant abuse of legislative power, as to authorize manifest injustice by positive law; or to take away that security for personal liberty, or private property, for the protection whereof the government was established.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-5\"><em>Calder v. Bull, </em>3 Dall. 386, 3 U.S. 386, 388, 1 L.Ed. 648, 649 (1798). Due process rights, which are integral to our republican form of government, protect all citizens, including the criminal accused, from unfair procedures and from deprivations of substantive rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The requisites of procedural due process are satisfied only when the accused is afforded both notice and a fair opportunity to be heard. <em>See Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 577, 579, 95 S.Ct. 729, 738, 42 L.Ed.2d 725, 737 (1974); (quoting <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950)); <em>Reed v.

In addition, a court must ponder three competing interests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-8\">\u201c[FJirst the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-5\"><em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18, 33 (1976); <em>Hare v. Motor Vehicle Administration, </em>326 Md. 296, 303, 604 A.2d 914, 917 (1992); <em>Brosan v. Cochran, </em>307 Md. 662, 671-72, 516 A.2d 970, 975 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">In this case, the majority concludes the mandates of procedural due process were satisfied, because the appellant was given sufficient notice of what actions constitute statutory rape. <em>See </em>352 Md. 663, 679-80, 724 A.2d 43, 51-52 (1998). The majority ignores the real issue. Even if the appellant were on notice that having sexual relations with someone below the consensual age constitutes statutory rape, this does not mean, and there is no evidence to suggest, that the appellant knew that the particular female with whom he was having sexual relations was underage. As the United States Supreme Court observed in <em>Staples v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 600, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 128 L.Ed.2d 608 (1994), notice means more than simply cursory knowledge of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">At issue in <em>Staples </em>was Art. 26, U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), of the National Firearms Act, which criminalizes possession of an unregistered firearm,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> imposing a sentence of up to ten years in prison, but is silent as to <em>mens rea. See </em>511 U.S. at 603-06, 114 S.Ct. at 1795-97, 128 L.Ed.2d at 614-16. The defendant in <em>Staples, </em>had possession of an AR-15 assault rifle, when his home was searched by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Firearms.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 603, 114 S.Ct. at 1795-96, 128 L.Ed.2d at 614. The defendant testified that the gun had never fired automatically, when in his possession. <em>Id. </em>at 603, 114 S.Ct. at 1796, 128 L.Ed.2d at 614-15. He requested a jury instruction that the Government had to prove \u201c \u2018he knew that the gun would fire fully automatically,\u2019 \u201d but that request was denied by the district court, and he was convicted and sentenced to 5 years probation and a $5,000 fine. <em>See id. </em>at 603-04, 114 S.Ct. at 1796, 128 L.Ed.2d at 615. Reversing the district court, the United States Supreme Court concluded that the government bore the burden of proving a defendant\u2019s knowledge as to the nature of the weapon beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>id. </em>at 619, 114 S.Ct. at 1804, 128 L.Ed.2d at 624, stating that it was \u201creluctant to impute [strict liability] to Congress where, as here, it would mean easing the path to convicting persons whose conduct would not even alert them to the probability of strict regulation____\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 615-16, 114 S.Ct. at 1802, 128 L.Ed.2d at 622-23. The Court also noted that \u201cpunishing a violation as a felony is simply incompatible with the theory of the public welfare offense,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 114 S.Ct. at 1804, 128 L.Ed.2d at 623-24, and reiterated its long line of cases holding that a defendant must have a guilty mind before being found guilty. <em>See </em>511 U.S. at 604-08, 114 S.Ct. at 1796-98, 128 L.Ed.2d at 615-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">I addressed the same issue and drew the same conclusion in my dissenting opinion in <em>Garnett:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-8\">\u201cA defendant who has knowledge that a victim has consented, in fact, to sexual relations, whether the consent is effective or not, is not thereby placed on notice as to the victim\u2019s age. Knowledge of consent simply does not equate with knowledge of age, just as intent to engage in sexual relations does not reveal, without more, with whom. Moreover, it is not a crime to engage in sexual relations with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>minor who is at least 16 years old; it may be morally wrong, in the minds of most Americans, but it is not a crime. It is only a crime if the defendant engages in such relations with a minor under a specified age, i.e., 14, as in section 463(a)(3), or 14 or 15, as in section 464C. But even when the act engaged in is necessarily a crime, e.g. possession of contraband, knowledge of the illegality\u2014that the contraband is knowingly possessed\u2014is still required. <em>See Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 547 A.2d 1041 (1988). Consequently, where the activity would be legal or, at least, not illegal, but for the ages of the participants, at the very least, the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the victim\u2019s age must be proven. Otherwise, a defendant who does not know he is acting illegally could be convicted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">332 Md. at 622-23, 632 A.2d at 822-23 (Bell, J., dissenting). This observation is most relevant to the case <em>sub judice, </em>where even the trial court recognized that the defendant\u2019s knowledge of his partner\u2019s age was not at all clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-6\">\u201c[I]n many instances... [a] 13 year old can look like a 13 year old or 12 year old; in other instances, a 13 year old can look like an 18 year old. So, I have no way of knowing whether this victim appeared to be older than she actually was. But I can only go by her statement to the police and to the Defendant that she was 16 years old.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The majority also overlooks the second prong of the procedural due process test. <em>See </em>352 Md. at 679-80, 724 A.2d at 51-52. The appellant was not given an opportunity to present a defense. By ignoring this fact, the Court apparently forgets that \u201c \u2018[t]he critical issue in a statutory rape case is \u2018the age of the rape victim..which serves two related, but distinct purposes: (1) it establishes the victim\u2019s capacity to consent and (2) it represents notice to a defendant of proscribed conduct.\u201d <em>See Garnett, </em>332 Md. at 621, 632 A.2d at 822 (Bell, J., dissenting). As one court has astutely observed, where as here, the \u201coutcome is determined not only by the child\u2019s age, but by the relative age of the defendant ... [and][w]hen the law requires a mathematical formula for its application, [one] cannot say that being provided the wrong numbers is immate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>rial.\u201d <em>Perez v. State, </em>111 N.M. 160, 803 P.2d 249, 251 (N.M. 1990). In fact, it is the child\u2019s age and the defendant\u2019s age, which lead to prosecution for actions that would otherwise go unpunished.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">By denying the appellant a fair opportunity to present his defense of lack of knowledge, and construing the statutory rape statute as a strict liability statute, the Court has permitted, and made the appellant the victim of, an irrebuttable presumption.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This can not pass constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Substantive due process functions to limit both the state\u2019s substantive power to regulate citizens\u2019 lives and to restrict the state from unconstitutionally denying liberty. <em>See generally </em>Laurence H. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law </em>\u00a7 15, at 1302-1435 (2d ed.1988). When the state deprives a person of life, liberty, or property it must have at least a rational basis, but when it infringes upon a fundamental right, it must demonstrate a compelling governmental interest and a narrowly tailored means of protecting only that interest. <em>See Zablocki v. Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374, 388, 98 S.Ct. 673, 682, 54 L.Ed.2d 618, 631 (1978); <em>Hill v. Fitzgerald, </em>304 Md. 689, 701, 501 A.2d 27, 33 (1985); <em>Attorney General v. Johnson, </em>282 Md. 274, 310, 385 A.2d 57, 78 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Assessing whether the State\u2019s interest outweighs the appellant\u2019s rights involves two competing considerations. The first is the nature of the interests involved. In other words, with respect to the defendant, it must be determined whether the right being infringed upon is \u201crooted so deep in the tradition and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental,\u201d <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 105, 54 S.Ct. 330, 332, 78 L.Ed. 674, 677 (1934), and as to the State, whether its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>interest is compelling. Second, the appellant\u2019s interests must be balanced against the relevant State interests. <em>See Youngberg v. Romeo, </em>457 U.S. 307, 321, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 2461, 73 L.Ed.2d 28, 40-41 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Here, the interest the appellant seeks to vindicate is his fundamental due process right to present a defense, a right guaranteed to every criminal defendant. <em>See White v. State, </em>324 Md. 626, 640, 598 A.2d 187, 194 (1991); <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>320 Md. 756, 761, 580 A.2d 196, 199 (1990). This right is, \u201cin essence, the right to a fair opportunity to defend against the State\u2019s accusations ....\u201d <em>Taliaferro v. State, </em>295 Md. 376, 403, 456 A.2d 29, 44 (1983) (quoting <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973)). Much like the rights of defendants protected by the Sixth Amendment, the right to present a defense is fundamental, in that it gives the appellant the opportunity \u201cto offer the testimony of witnesses, and to compel their attendance, if necessary, [which] is in plain terms the right to present a defense, the right to present the defendant\u2019s version of the facts as well as the prosecutions to the jury\u2014\u201d <em>Webb v. Texas, </em>409 U.S. 95, 98, 93 S.Ct. 351, 353, 34 L.Ed.2d 330, 333 (1972) (quoting <em>Washington v. Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 1923, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967)). It is clear, therefore, that the appellant\u2019s interest is deep rooted and serious. Indeed, the right is similar to other interests, of the defendant, that the United States Supreme Court has found to be fundamental in the criminal process. <em>See Douglas v. California, </em>372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963) (concerning right to counsel on first appeal); <em>Mayer v. Chicago, </em>404 U.S. 189, 92 S.Ct. 410, 30 L.Ed.2d 372 (1971) (concerning right to transcript in misdemeanor appeals); <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977) (concerning right to legal materials and access to courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The majority lists the state\u2019s interests as: promoting the physical and mental health of children, preventing the sexual exploitation and abuse of children, and preventing venereal disease and pregnancy. <em>See </em>352 Md. at 681-85, 724 A.2d at 52-54. To be sure, these interests are compelling. Even so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>this does not vitiate the appellant\u2019s due process rights and, in any event, must be narrowly tailored.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Aside from the fact that, rather than an exploitation or abuse of one of the parties, the facts of this case reveal only two teenagers engaged in a fully consensual act, <em>see State v. Yanez, </em>716 A.2d 759, 772 (R.I.1998) (Flanders, J., dissenting)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, Maryland\u2019s statutory rape law, as currently formulated is not the most narrowly tailored method for addressing those concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">To bolster its position, the majority cites <em>Bowers v. Hardwick, </em>478 U.S. 186, 106 S.Ct. 2841, 92 L.Ed.2d 140 (1985). Hardwick was charged with violating a Georgia penal statute, which criminalized sodomy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>478 U.S. at 187-88, 106 S.Ct. at 2842, 92 L.Ed.2d at 144. He brought an action in federal court, alleging: (1) the statute was unconstitutional in criminalizing consensual sodomy, (2) as a practicing homosexual the Georgia law placed him in imminent danger of arrest, (3) he had a fundamental Constitutional right to privacy in his own home, which encompassed the right to engage in sodomy, and (4) there was no rational basis for the law even if it did not infringe on his fundamental rights. <em>See id. </em>at 188, 195-96, 106 S.Ct. at 2842, 2846, 92 L.Ed.2d at 144, 148-49. Rejecting each argument, the Court declined to extend its fundamental rights jurisprudence as Hardwick proposed. <em>See id. </em>at 190-96, 106 S.Ct. at 2843-47, 92 L.Ed.2d at 145-49. The Court concluded that sodomy does not fall within one of the protected liberties embodied in the Bill of Rights. <em>See id. </em>at 191-92, 106 S.Ct. at 2844-45, 92 L.Ed.2d at 146-47. The Court also determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>that the Georgia law survived a rational relations review, even if it was based on the Georgia electorate\u2019s view that homosexual sodomy is \u201cimmoral and unacceptable.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 196, 106 S.Ct. at 2846, 92 L.Ed 2d at 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">From <em>Bowers, </em>the majority distills the following, \u201c[t]he state\u2019s overwhelming interest in protecting children from these risks outweighs any interest the individual may have in engaging in sexual relations with children near the age of consent.\u201d <em>See </em>352 Md. at 683, 724 A.2d at 53. Once again the majority has confused the analysis. The issue this case presents is not whether the appellant has a constitutional right to engage in sexual relations with a teenager younger than he is. I agree with the majority, appellant has no such constitutional right. Rather, the issue is the appellant\u2019s due process right to present a defense, as protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, <em>Bowers </em>is inapposite to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Finally, the State cannot demonstrate, nor has it even attempted to show, that Maryland\u2019s statutory rape law is the most narrowly tailored means to achieve the state\u2019s interest in protecting children, while infringing upon as few due process rights as possible. And, when the state has open to it less drastic ways of satisfying its legitimate interests, it may not choose a legislative scheme that broadly stifles fundamental liberties. <em>See Kusper v. Pontikes, </em>414 U.S. 51, 58-59, 94 S.Ct. 303, 308, 38 L.Ed.2d 260, 267 (1973) (citing <em>Dunn v. Blumstein, </em>405 U.S. at 343, 92 S.Ct. at 1003, 31 L.Ed.2d at 284-85). While some children may require the protection of strict liability, many others do not. There are reasonable options available to the State. Recognizing \u201cthe increased maturity and independence of today\u2019s teenagers...,\u201d <em>see Perez v. State, </em>111 N.M. 160, 803 P.2d 249, 251 (1990), the Model Penal Code has developed an approach that limits strict liability to those cases of sexual relations involving children under ten years of age. <em>See Garnett, </em>332 Md. at 610-11, 632 A.2d at 816-17 (Bell, J., dissenting). There are, in addition, other options utilized by other States, such as allowing the defendant to present a defense whenever the \u201cvictim\u201d lies about his or her age. <em>See id. </em>at 606-11, 632 A.2d at 815-17 (Bell, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Maryland\u2019s sexual offense statutes protect some, but by no means all, children and punish only a few alleged perpetrators. Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 463 and 464A<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> punish the defendant who is 17 years old or older and engages in sexual activity with a 13-year-old. Likewise, \u00a7\u00a7 464B<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and 464C<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> punish defendants who engage in sexual relations with a 14 or 15-year-old, when the defendant is four or more years older than his partner. These are the only statutes the Legislature has enacted to punish persons who engage in consensual sexual acts with underage partners. This statutory scheme demonstrates the following. First, the State is not as concerned about the sexual exploits of all children as it is those who are considered so immature that there can be little doubt that they are too young to give consent. In those cases, strict liability may well be appropriate. Second, the State has made arbitrary distinctions between persons engaging in sexual intercourse. The 18-year-old who has consensual sexual relations with a 14-year-old, reasonably believing him or her to be older, faces 20 years in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>prison, while the person who is 17 % years of age, who engages in the exact same conduct is guilty of no crime and, therefore, will face no punishment. The protection of those truly in need of strict liability protection certainly can be achieved short of putting at risk a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The fact that a majority of the States<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> hold that a defendant\u2019s due process rights may be ignored when the charge is statutory rape, is not a compelling reason for this Court to do likewise; whatever other courts may do does not provide a justification for us to sanction the infringement upon a defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial. Due process simply is not determined by reference to the number of courts ruling a particular way. It is of little consequence to the appellant that he was not sentenced to 20 years in prison, <em>see </em>352 Md. at 678, 724 A.2d at 50, because he will be forever branded with the stigma of being a child sex offender. Moreover, the applicable inquiry is not whether the appellant spent one day in jail or 20 years; if he did not receive a fair trial, his conviction should not be allowed to stand. Because, \u00a7 463(a)(3) violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the applicable provisions of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, the appellant\u2019s conviction should be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-8\">. That provision reads:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-8\">. Firearm is defined in \u00a7 5845(a) as \"(1) a shotgun having a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; (2) a weapon made from a shotgun if such weapon as modified has an overall length of less than 26 inches or a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-9\">\"(b) Machinegun. The term \u2018machinegun\u2019 means any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored -to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger. The term shall also include the frame or receiver of any such weapon, any part designed and intended solely and exclusively, or combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun, and any combination of parts from which a machinegun can be assembled if such parts are in the possession or under the control of a person.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b803-9\">. This gun is the civilian equivalent of the military M-16 rifle, but unless it has been modified it has a metal stop, which prevents it from firing repeatedly. The metal stop on the defendants\u2019 gun had been filed away and the gun could be fired repeatedly. <em>See Staples, </em>511 U.S. at 603, 114 S.Ct. at 1796, 128 L.Ed.2d at 614-15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b805-9\">.
