Mrs. D\u2019Antonio was driving a vehicle covered by an insurance policy issued by Valiant Insurance Company with $500,000 uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. Mrs. D\u2019Antonio, joined by her husband, filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against the State and the driver of the bus for damages for her injuries and loss of consortium. At the time, state law limited the State\u2019s liability under the Maryland Tort Claims Act, Maryland Code (1984,1993 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-101 et seq. of the State Government Article, to $50,000. The State tendered $50,000 in settlement of the suit, which the D\u2019Antonios did not accept, apparently fearing impairment of their right to recover uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits from their insurer, Valiant. The D\u2019Antonios then filed a claim with Valiant for uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits for any damages over $50,000, and Valiant denied the claim. Thereafter, the D\u2019Antonios filed an amended complaint adding Valiant as a defendant and alleging breach of the insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">Valiant filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that the D\u2019Antonios were not eligible for any uninsured/under-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>insured motorist benefits under the policy, even if the damages exceeded the State\u2019s liability limit of $50,000. Valiant relied on the provision of the policy which states that Valiant will pay damages \u201cwhich an \u2018insured\u2019 is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator\u201d of an uninsured/underinsured motor vehicle. Valiant contended that the D\u2019Antonios were not \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d more than $50,000 from the State because of the State\u2019s statutory immunity from damages in excess of $50,000. Valiant also argued that the D\u2019Antonios were not eligible for uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits under the policy because the policy excluded from the definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d any vehicle \u201cowned by any governmental unit or agency\u201d or \u201cowned or operated by a self-insurer.\u201d Because the bus was owned by the State of Maryland, which is both a governmental unit and a self-insurer, Valiant contended that the uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage of the policy was not triggered. The D\u2019Antonios filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, disputing Valiant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Agreeing with Valiant\u2019s argument, the circuit court granted Valiant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the D\u2019Antonios\u2019 motion. The court entered final judgment for Valiant pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-602(b), and the D\u2019Antonios filed a notice of appeal. Prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, both Valiant and the D\u2019Antonios filed in this Court petitions for a writ of certiorari which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">We have today filed our opinion in <em>West American Insurance Company v. Popa, </em>352 Md. 455, 723 A.2d 1 (1998), which decides, contrary to Valiant\u2019s position, the issues raised in Valiant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Consequently the grant of summary judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion in <em>West American Insurance Company v. Popa.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSIS</em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>\n<em>TENT WITH THIS OPINION.
