Because we believe petitioner suffered actual prejudice at his trial below, we shall not address whether a \u201cpresumption of prejudice\u201d would exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">We first shall review briefly the facts leading up to the trial. Petitioner John Howard Johnson owned and managed a 7-11 convenience store in Baltimore City. On July 24, 1993, while he was conducting a sales transaction with a customer, petitioner allegedly observed the victim, Andre Burton, shoplifting some goods. Petitioner ran over to Burton and attempted to restrain him, but Burton freed himself and fled the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">After quickly completing the sale interrupted by the altercation, petitioner armed himself with a handgun and left the premises in his car to search for the alleged shoplifter. Petitioner eventually found and confronted Burton, forced him into petitioner\u2019s car at gunpoint and, holding him there, drove away. At some point, Burton attempted to flee. Petitioner shot Burton in the back either while he was exiting petitioner\u2019s car or immediately thereafter. According to the defense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the gun accidentally discharged as it became entangled in the straps of a bag Burton attempted to take with him as he fled. Wounded, Burton escaped to a nearby gas station for help but died there before help could be rendered. The defense asserted at trial that petitioner\u2019s gun went off accidentally and that he left the scene unaware that Burton had been shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Petitioner was indicted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of first degree murder, unlawful use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, and illegally wearing and carrying a handgun. A second indictment charged petitioner with kidnaping and' the two proceedings were joined. Petitioner was tried by a jury, which convicted him of involuntary manslaughter, illegally wearing and carrying a handgun, and kidnaping. The jury failed to render a verdict as to the unlawful use of a handgun charge. The defense attorney filed a timely notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals on petitioner\u2019s behalf, but that appeal was dismissed subsequently because a timely brief in conformance with the requirements of Rule 8-503 was not filed. Petitioner, however, was granted post-conviction relief by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City due to ineffective assistance of counsel in that appeal. The remedy granted was this belated appeal. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed petitioner\u2019s convictions and we subsequently granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Petitioner argues several points on appeal, but his central claim and the only one we shall concern ourselves with is the repeated allegedly inappropriate conduct by the trial judge that, petitioner argues, denied him the right to a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The trial commenced, as it ended, with continuous, contentious side disputes between defense counsel and the trial judge. Even during his opening statement, defense counsel not only was threatened with contempt of court in the presence of the jury, but was told by the trial judge that if she were to find him in contempt, she would do so in front of the jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Now, that\u2019s the procedure. Now, during the case\u2014and different judges handle it differently. Some judges simply say \u201coverruled\u201d or \u201csustained.\u201d You may find that this judge makes comments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">THE COURT: ... [DJon\u2019t comment on my practice or things I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">... I\u2014it is not appropriate for you to distinguish my Court from any others as far as the jurors are concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, if it please the Court, we should take a balanced view, with as a[sic] little intervention as possible, except to call the balls and strikes, but I\u2019m afraid there is going to be a lot of intervention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">THE COURT: ... I asked you, and I\u2019m going to insist on telling you that you are not to comment about whatever you think of my way of conducting my court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Very well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">THE COURT: The jurors are to take what they hear in this courtroom and not hear it from you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And, of course, the law is that whoever is presiding should\u2014if they make comments, should\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">THE COURT: ... [/]/ <em>you do any more of this, I am going to find you, in front of this jury, in contempt of the Court. </em>Now, stop it right now, and stop it throughout the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And counsel has the duty to make objections if counsel feels that the presiding authority has gone too far. There will be a lot of objections in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-13\">Now, we are\u2014and I want to explain that because if you don\u2019t explain it to the jury in advance sometimes they misunderstand what\u2019s going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-14\">Now, in this particular case this is going to be a hard-fought case. And I want to ask you to forgive me if you think I\u2019m fighting too hard because I\u2019m going all out in this case....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Now, before we get into the facts, just let me point out one other procedure. Both Ms. Saxon and I are not rookies. Ms. Saxon has tried many, many, many murder cases. So have I. So don\u2019t get the impression that you need to give either one of us any kind of break or special consideration. We are both pros. We have both been doing it for a long time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">Now, obviously, I\u2019m a lot older than Ms. Saxon so I\u2019ve been doing it a little bit longer. But you\u2019re not talking about a rookie State\u2019s Attorney or a rookie defense lawyer. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Thereafter, throughout the trial, numerous incidents occurred between the trial judge and defense counsel in the presence of the jury: interruptions, insults, and other forms of inappropriate conduct. We note in particular some of these incidents. For instance, a troubling exchange occurred during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of State witness Mark Tackas, a crime lab technician with the Baltimore City Police Department. During that examination, the trial judge had defense counsel arrested for contempt in front of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGL\">BY [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">Q. And, ... you also assumed that there may have been a blood trail and so you went to look for one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">MS. SAXON [State\u2019s Attorney]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">THE COURT: He didn\u2019t assume it. He saw it____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, will you stop please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-11\">THE COURT: No.... You must ask him properly phrased questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019ve only been doing this for twenty-five years and, honestly, I\u2019ve never had this much interference in twenty-five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-13\">THE COURT: ... [D]o you want a repetition of something that happened? [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] I don\u2019t want\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So be it. I want to represent my client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">THE COURT: All right, so be it. <em>Mr. Sheriff, take him back.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>Are you going to lock me up again?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">THE COURT: <em>Afraid so....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: All right, Mr. Sheriff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-9\">THE COURT: We are taking another recess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>\u2014my second arrest.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-11\">THE CLERK: All rise, please. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">On December 21, 1994, during the cross-examination of another State witness, Alexander Jason, the judge interrupted defense counsel\u2019s questioning. She supplied her own version of the question, claiming it to be more proper. When defense counsel asked his version of the question again, the State\u2019s Attorney objected, but the trial judge overruled her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]. Was <em>it </em>[the seat in petitioner\u2019s car] <em>aflat seat like this table?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-14\">THE COURT: <em>What kind of seat did the one have that you examined?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Judge. May I ask my questions, Judge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-16\">THE COURT: Not if you do it improperly. Let\u2019s get this done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-17\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Was that improper? [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-18\">THE COURT: / <em>think mine would have made the same thing much simpler....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-19\">Q. <em>Was it aflat seat, Mr. Jason?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>MS. SAXON: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">THE COURT: <em>Overruled. </em>Was it? [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The exchange that followed was ripe with improper interjections by the judge and retorts by defense counsel. It also involved another contempt citation of him by the judge in front of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Mr. Jason, was this a bucket seat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">MS. SAXON: Objection.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">THE COURT: Overruled. What kind of a seat was it[?] Can\u2019t he tell us, not what kind of seat it wasn\u2019t ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t know what to do, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">[THE WITNESS]: Yes, it was a bucket seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-12\">THE COURT: I know what to do, have him describe the seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>You want to take over the case ? If you try the case for </em>me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-14\">THE COURT [Addressing defense counsel]: ... I\u2019m not going to sit here\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-15\">[DEFENSE <em>COUNSEL]:\u2014you will lose it.[</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-16\">Q. Mr. Jason, would how the hand and the gun were positioned have\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-17\">THE COURT: Sustained.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] The preface is improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, you are doing all of her work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">THE COURT: ... I am not allowing the questions to be asked in this form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, can you\u2014can I ask a favor, can you stop interfering?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP2\">THE COURT: No. No____ You may not. I\u2019ll ask you to obey my rulings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: All right. Do you want to ask the questions because every question I ask is wrong[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">THE COURT: ... <em>[</em><footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]t\u2019s <em>contempt again.m </em>Please just ask questions in accordance to my rulings which you well understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL], All right, Mr. Jason, she asked for a series of incomplete demonstrations. Would you step forward and demonstrate exactly what happened in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-12\">THE COURT: <em>Sustained.[</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>He doesn\u2019t know what happened but he can demonstrate what his hypothesis or theory is as to what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>Judge, there\u2019s an extra chair down here </em>if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-14\">THE COURT [Addressing defense counsel]: ... <em>I\u2019ve already got my list </em>but let\u2019s deal with that later. Now\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>Are you threatening me with contempt again?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-16\">THE COURT: <em>Yes, I not only threaten you, I\u2019ve found </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>you in </em>contempt.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] Would you want to demonstrate what your theory is as to how it happened? [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The exchange continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, Mr. Jason, would you come to the jury box without pointing the gun at the jury and demonstrate\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">THE COURT: <em>Maybe they\u2019d like to point it at you as well as us. </em>Come on, ... let\u2019s not go back and forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: You are unbelievable, Judge. <em>Can I hold you in contempt of Court? </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Later that day, apparently with the jury present, the judge insinuated that defense counsel was attempting to steal a marker from the courtroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">MS. SAXON: ... Where is the marker please ..., that you used?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">THE COURT: <em>They cost five bucks a piece. Belong to the City of Baltimore.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-13\">MS. SAXON: Would you mark\u2014Your Honor, I\u2019d like to mark\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, I know you weren\u2019t suggesting that [I] was going to be a thief about that, were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-15\">THE COURT: <em>It was in your pocket. I saw </em>you\u2014 [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, see wasn\u2019t [sic] in my pocket. It was here on the table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-16\">THE COURT: You gave it back so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-17\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Boy. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-18\">During defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of a witness, the judge encouraged the State to object, which resulted in another retort by defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. But you were not asked to look for other signs in the car that would not look to your naked eye to be blood but which might be blood, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">A. This question cannot be answered yes or no and you know it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">Q. Excuse me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">THE COURT: ... I <em>will sustain if I heard an objection </em>because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>Judge, do we have two prosecutors here? </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">Further examples of inappropriate conduct occurred on January 4, 1995, while Donald Wright, a medical examiner called as an expert by the State, was on the stand. After an extensive exchange between defense counsel and the trial judge during the direct examination of Wright, the judge sent the jury out, held the defense counsel in contempt, and sent him to the court holding cell. After the proceedings resumed, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, Judge, I want to\u2014I have a preliminary matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-11\">THE COURT: Bring the jury in____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, Judge, I want to address the Court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-13\">THE COURT: Now [addressing defense counsel], <em>I do not wish to hear from you.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, you don\u2019t have the option, unfortunately because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-15\">THE COURT: I do have the option---- I have the option of bringing the jury in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-17\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>I want to make a timely motion for mistrial and, Judge, I want to state my grounds </em>because I want you to do the job to react to counsel ... and if I\u2019m right I want you to agree with me and if I\u2019m wrong, I want you to disagree with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-18\">THE COURT: I disagree with you. <em>The motion\u2019s denied.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: <em>Well, Judge, you haven\u2019t heard my reasons. That\u2019s arbitrary and capricious.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">THE COURT: <em>I\u2019m being arbitrary and capricious then but I\u2019m </em>being\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, Judge, you\u2019ve got to stop. That is not fair\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">THE COURT: Bring the jury in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:\u2014because you\u2019re losing sight of the fact that [this] isn\u2019t [you] versus [me]. This is a trial involving Mr. Johnson and you have ceased to become an\u2014 .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">THE COURT: Bring the jurors in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:\u2014impartial and fair judge and, Judge, you\u2019ve got to change back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">THE CLERK: Here they come.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">THE COURT: Bring the jurors in. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay9\">Later, during defense counsel\u2019s recross-examination of Wright, the judge frequently interrupted the proceedings to ask her own questions and to prevent defense counsel from asking his questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">Similar occurrences took place during the examinations of Ronald Staffer and Lieutenant Charles J. Keys, firearms examiners with the Baltimore City Police Department. The judge often would rephrase counsel\u2019s questions or \u201csustain\u201d objections never made by the State prior to the interruptions. We note further that on the same day, during questioning by the State, the judge occasionally instructed the State\u2019s Attorney on how to ask proper questions of her witnesses. During these incidents, the defense counsel often complained about the judge acting as a prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">\n<em>The conduct of the trial judge impaired petitioner\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b488-15\">This Court recently addressed the right to a fair and impartial trial in <em>Jefferson-El v. State, </em>330 Md. 99, 622 A.2d 737 (1993). In that case, we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>A defendant in a criminal case has a right to a fair trial. <em>Spence v. State, </em>296 Md. 416, 423, 463 A.2d 808, 811 (1983); <em>Scott v. State, </em>289 Md. 647, 655, 426 A.2d 923, 928 (1981); <em>Smith v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 625, 635, 498 A.2d 284, 289 (1985). <em>See also Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23, 87 S.Ct. 824, 827-28, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710 (1967). It is well settled in Maryland that fundamental to a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial is an impartial and disinterested judge. <em>Boyd v. State, </em>321 Md. 69, 78, 581 A.2d 1, 9 (1990); <em>In re Turney, </em>311 Md. 246, 253, 533 A.2d 916, 920 (1987); <em>Costello v. State, </em>237 Md. 464, 473, 206 A.2d 812, 817 (1964); <em>Thanos v. Superintendent, </em>204 Md. 665, 667-68, 104 A.2d 926, 927 (1954); <em>Bd. of Medical Examiners v. Steward, </em>203 Md. 574, 581, 102 A.2d 248, 251-52 (1954); <em>Western Md. Dairy Corp. v. Brown, </em>169 Md. 257, 268, 181 A. 468, 473-74 (1935). \u201cA fair and impartial trial is a judicial process by which a court hears before it decides; by which it conducts a dispassionate inquiry and renders judgment only after receiving evidence.\u201d <em>Spence, </em>296 Md. at 423, 463 A.2d at 811, citing <em>People v. Diaz, </em>1 Ill.App.3d 988, 275 N.E.2d 210, 212-13 (1971). \u201cIt is beyond dispute that the trial judges perform a unique and persuasive role in that system: \u2018confidence in the judiciary is essential to the successful functioning of our democratic form of government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scott v. U.S., </em>559 A.2d 745, 748 (D.C.App.1989), citing <em>U.S. v. Quattrone, </em>149 F.Supp. 240, 242-43 (D.D.C.1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">It is because judges occupy a distinguished and decisive position that they are required to maintain high standards of conduct. <em>Dempsey v. State, </em>277 Md. 134, 149, 355 A.2d 455, 463 (1976); <em>Patterson v. State, </em>275 Md. 563, 579, 342 A.2d 660, 669 (1975); <em>See also Elmer v. State, </em>239 Md. 1, 10-11, 209 A.2d 776, 781-82 (1965); <em>Vandegrift v. State, </em>237 Md. 305, 311, 206 A.2d 250, 254 (1965). Their conduct during a trial has a direct bearing on whether a defendant will receive a fair trial because their opinion or manifestations thereof usually will significantly impact the jury\u2019s verdict. In addition, if the defendant has elected to be tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>by a jury, it is the province of that jury to decide the guilt or innocence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 105-06, 622 A.2d at 740-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">In <em>Apple v. State, </em>190 Md. 661, 59 A.2d 509 (1948), the defendant\u2019s counsel, as in this case, argued that the .trial judge\u2019s abrupt and harsh behavior toward him and his client when he took the stand demonstrated the judge\u2019s prejudice against the defense\u2019s case. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">A judge should at all times be impartial and courteous and should not permit his personal feelings, if he has any, to be exhibited before a jury, but unless there is some clear showing ... that his words or his actions influenced the jury adversely to the appellant, the mere fact that the trial was conducted in an impatient and somewhat peremptory way, does not justify a reversal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 670, 59 A.2d at 513. We ultimately affirmed the conviction in <em>Apple, </em>holding that the record, as a whole, did not show that the defendant \u201cwas prejudiced by any conduct of the judge trying the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">In another case questioning judicial conduct, <em>Bryant v. State, </em>207 Md. 565, 584-85,115 A.2d 502, 510 (1955), we stated that \u201c[i]t is a precept of the law that a judge should be impartial and courteous, and should not allow his personal feelings to be exhibited before the jury, but should be careful in his remarks during the progress of the trial.\u201d Like the defense attorney here, the defense counsel in <em>Bryant </em>argued that the trial judge had \u201cexhibited an antagonistic attitude\u201d toward him and his client. In particular, the counselor in <em>Bryant </em>argued that the trial judge \u201cinsinuated that he was impeding the progress of the trial\u201d and often made \u201cgestures and grimaces and ... brusque comments [that] manifested bias, created an atmosphere of resentment, and prejudiced the jury against him, thus depriving him of a fair and impartial trial and ... due process of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584, 115 A.2d at 510. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">The degree of severity of a trial judge\u2019s rebukes of an attorney, when the occasions require them, is left to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>discretion of the judge as long as they do not prevent a fair and impartial trial. Unless there is some clear showing that the judge\u2019s statements influenced the jury against the defendant, the mere fact that the trial was conducted in an impatient and brusque way does not justify a reversal of the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 585, 115 A.2d at 511. We ultimately held that the record in that case did not reveal \u201cthat the actions and statements of the trial judge prejudiced the jury against appellant so as to deprive him of a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Were the conduct in petitioner\u2019s case limited to a few moderate exchanges between the judge and the defense counsel not involving contempt matters, as <em>Apple </em>and <em>Bryant </em>appear to have involved, we might conclude here, as in those cases, that the record fails to demonstrate that this trial judge\u2019s behavior prejudiced petitioner\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial. The record before us, however, is not so limited. The judge\u2019s conduct ventured beyond limited incidents of harsh behavior or gestures; she interjected her own point of view often during the trial, her behavior was frequently disruptive, and her practice of premature rulings in the absence of an objection was, in the context of this case, unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">We are particularly concerned that the judge ordered defense counsel\u2019s arrest for contempt of court before the jury. Although this Court never has addressed the impact of such an incident on a defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial, the Court of Special Appeals has. <em>See Suggs v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 250, 589 A.2d 551 (1991). In <em>Suggs, </em>the trial judge informed the jury directly that one of defense counsel\u2019s questions was \u201chighly inappropriate.\u201d He then instructed the attorney not to repeat the question. When the defense counsel attempted to rephrase the question properly, the trial judge ordered the sheriff to \u201ctake a hold\u201d of him. He then ordered a recess and the jury left. During the hearing that followed, the trial judge recanted on having the counselor arrested but admonished him outside the jury\u2019s presence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>When the jury returned, the trial judge attempted to give a curative instruction. During that instruction, however, the trial judge told the jury that his own behavior was \u201cbecause the defendant\u2019s lawyer was about ten miles out of limit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257, 589 A.2d at 554. Noting the arrest of counsel in the jury\u2019s presence and his poorly-worded curative instruction, the Court of Special Appeals held that under the totality of the circumstances, the judge\u2019s comments \u201cpainted such a prejudicial portrait of the defense counsel as to deny appellant his right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>589 A.2d at 555. <em>See also Long v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 424, 432, 356 A.2d 588, 592 (1976) (holding that trial judge\u2019s order to arrest defense witness in front of jury and accompanying comments indicated his \u201cdisbelief of the witness,\u201d thus committing prejudicial error).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the judge\u2019s act of threatening the defense attorney with contempt began, as we have seen, during his opening statement and in the presence of the jury. That, along with defense counsel\u2019s actual arrest for contempt before the jury and the court\u2019s later remarks, \u201cit\u2019s contempt again,\u201d and \u201cI not only threaten you, I\u2019ve found you in contempt,\u201d in the presence of the jury, infringed upon petitioner\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial as in <em>Suggs. </em>Regardless of the conduct of defense counsel, arresting and citing him for contempt in separate incidents before the jury and repeatedly threatening him in the jury\u2019s presence, painted defense counsel in such a negative light that it deprived petitioner of a fair trial. <em>See Bryant, </em>207 Md. at 585, 115 A.2d at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The Court of Special Appeals said in <em>Scott v. State, </em>110 Md.App. 464, 677 A.2d 1078 (1996), a case concerning recusal but applicable to the behavior in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">Although judicial anger is understandable, a judge should not let his displeasure with litigants, witnesses, or lawyers unduly affect his conduct in the courtroom---- In this case, [the] Judge ... allowed his anger to get the best of him; as a result, he adopted an unjudicial attitude toward appellant [and his counsel]. We think it is important to repeat the following admonition of this Court in <em>Betz v. State, </em>99 Md.App. 60, 635 A.2d 77 (1994):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Many judges have experienced aggravating\u2014sometimes even defiant\u2014conduct on the part of lawyers and others (just as many lawyers, and others, have experienced aggravating conduct on the part of judges), and, in the press of attempting to move dockets and resolve cases fairly and efficiently, the experience can cause instant irritation. Judges, too, are human and have human emotions; they get angry, often for good reason. But, unlike other people, judges have the sovereign power to punish, to deprive persons of their liberty and property, and that alone requires that they restrain their irritation. Punishment for contempt should never be imposed in anger, as an immediate emotionally reflexive response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 489, 677 A.2d at 1090. Applying this reasoning to the case at hand, we note that the disagreements between the judge and counsel that resulted in contempt charges began during opening statement and later related primarily to the format of the questions he asked during trial. In the trial setting, although counsel and the judge have great responsibilities, the judge had the greater duty to restrain her anger. It was her responsibility to maintain control over the proceedings. Her failure to maintain control in an appropriate manner prejudiced petitioner and his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">A review of cases in other jurisdictions that have addressed the arrest or citation of a criminal defense attorney before the jury supports our view that petitioner\u2019s conviction must be reversed. In <em>Ash v. State, </em>93 Okla.Crim. 125, 129, 225 P.2d 816, 819 (1950), the trial judge cited the defense counsel for contempt before the jury and then ordered him to \u201cpurge himself of the charge of contempt before this court, before further participating in this trial.\u201d On appeal, the Oklahoma Criminal Court of Appeals reasoned that \u201c[t]he proper thing to do is to excuse the jury and thereafter fine counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 225 P.2d at 819. Noting that such a mistake was not <em>per se </em>reversible error, <em>id., </em>the Court held that, nevertheless, the defendant in that case had not received a fair trial. <em>Id. </em>at 132, 225 P.2d at 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Likewise, in <em>Meek v. State, </em>112 Nev. 1288, 1295-97, 930 P.2d 1104, 1109 (1996), the Supreme Court of Nevada held, <em>inter alia, </em>that the defendant\u2019s case had been prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s ruling the defense counsel in contempt and fining him before the jury. <em>See also United States v. Kelley, </em>314 F.2d 461, 463-64 (6th Cir.1963) (holding that trial judge\u2019s act of threatening defense lawyer twice with contempt \u201ctended to belittle the lawyer in the eyes of the jury,\u201d and \u201coperated to prevent the defendant from having a fair trial.\u201d); <em>Neal v. State, </em>36 Ala.App. 156, 158, 54 So.2d 613, 615 (holding as \u201cimproper and prejudicial\u201d trial court\u2019s statement to defense lawyer in front of jury, \u201cI ought to send you to jail.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>256 Ala. 373, 54 So.2d 616 (1951); <em>Alley v. State, </em>619 So.2d 1013, 1014-15 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1993) (reversing conviction when trial court deliberately threatened defense counsel with contempt before the jury and, on another occasion, stated to him, \u201cYou\u2019re liable to wind up in jail with him [the defendant] if you keep talking out.\u201d); <em>cf. State v. Collins, </em>66 Wash.2d 71, 74, 400 P.2d 793, 794-95 (1965) (holding that trial judge\u2019s \u201ccritical remarks directed to defense counsel, and his being adjudged in contempt of court, all in the presence of the jury\u201d violated defendant\u2019s state constitutional right to counsel). <em>But see Moulding v. State, </em>296 Ark. 328, 337, 757 S.W.2d 916, 920-21 (1988) (refusing to overturn conviction because, under the totality of the circumstances, including a curative instruction, trial court\u2019s finding defense counsel in contempt in front of the jury was not reversible error); <em>Burris v. State, </em>161 Tex.Crim. 210, 214, 276 S.W.2d 260, 262-63 (1953) (holding no error was committed when trial court held defense counsel in contempt in front of the jury, \u201c[t]hough it would have been the better practice to reprimand counsel and impose the fine in the absence of the jury\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>350 U.S. 830, 76 S.Ct. 61, 100 L.Ed. 741 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Our concern regarding fairness during the trial in this case does not stop with the arrests for contempt or the threatening of contempt. Interruptions, premature rulings on objections, <em>sua sponte </em>rephrasing of questions, and insults can all lead to an atmosphere resulting in unacceptable prejudice to a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>dant\u2019s right to a fair trial. In <em>Spencer v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 71, 543 A.2d 851 (1988), the Court of Special Appeals reversed a conviction after an inappropriate exchange between the trial judge and defense counsel occurred in which the judge insinuated in front of the jury that the defense counsel had lied to the court. The intermediate appellate court noted that a trial judge must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">insure that the trial is conducted in an orderly way and, in general, make sure that justice is done. He must, however, discharge his duties in a \u201ccalmly judicial, dispassionate and impartial\u201d manner. This is imperative in order to protect the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial inasmuch as the judge\u2019s position as the presiding judge gives him tremendous influence over the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 77, 543 A.2d at 854 (citations omitted). Ultimately, the Court of Special Appeals held \u201cunder the totality of the circumstances, the attack on defense counsel in front of the jury was reversible error because it denied appellant a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78, 543 A.2d at 855. The court reasoned that \u201ccomments made from the bench and directed to defense counsel directly impugned her integrity; they indicated that she was dishonest with the court and the jury. Such statements are likely to be devastating to the defense and, thus, should not be made in front of the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78, 543 A.2d at 854-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Appellate courts in other jurisdictions have overturned criminal convictions because the conduct or demeanor of the trial judges resulted in a violation of the defendant\u2019s fair and impartial trial rights. In <em>Earl v. State, </em>111 Nev. 1304, 1311, 904 P.2d 1029, 1033 (1995), for example, the Supreme Court of Nevada examined the trial court\u2019s conduct toward the defense counsel in the presence of the jury. At one point, the trial judge said to the prosecutor, \u201c[i]f you object I will sustain.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1310, 904 P.2d at 1033. During the same examination, the judge ordered a recess in order \u201cto tell you [defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>counsel] how to practice law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>During the defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, the trial court even insinuated that he may have been drinking. Citing the cumulative effect of these and other comments, the court overturned the defendant\u2019s conviction due to the prejudice the comments caused her case. <em>Id. </em>at 1311, 904 P.2d at 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In <em>People v. Wilson, </em>21 Mich.App. 36, 37, 174 N.W.2d 914, 915 (1969), the trial judge \u201crepeatedly disciplined counsel, often before the jury, questioned and cross-examined witnesses, often argumentatively, and \u2018clarified\u2019 testimony.\u201d The Michigan Court of Appeals, when reversing, held that \u201cthe trial judge too frequently interjected her personality and views into the proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38, 174 N.W.2d at 915-16. Noting that \u201c[t]rial judges who berate, scold, and demean a lawyer so as to hold him up to contempt in the eyes of the jury, destroy that balance of judicial impartiality necessary to a fair hearing,\u201d the court further held that the trial judge\u2019s behavior denied the defendant a \u201cfair, impartial, and orderly trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38-39, 174 N.W.2d at 916. <em>See also Wilkerson v. State, </em>510 So.2d 1253, 1254 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1987) (holding trial judge\u2019s repeated rebukes of defense counsel, including \u201c T can\u2019t trust you down there\u2019 ... worked to deny [defendant] a fair and impartial trial.\u201d); <em>Tyndall v. State, </em>234 So.2d 154, 155 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1970) (remanding for new trial because judge\u2019s tirade to defense attorney that evidence he sought to admit was \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d prejudiced \u201cdefendant\u2019s receiving a fair trial.\u201d); <em>People v.

She often ruled adversely to petitioner on objections that were not made. She implied to the jury that they should feel contempt for the defense counsel by her comment that the jury might like to point the murder weapon at him and at herself. The judge frequently interjected her own questions without giving witnesses the chance to answer the questions posed by either counsel. Often, these questions only reiterated the counselor\u2019s examination or, at some points, made the examination more complex to the witness. The judge even implied in front of the jury that the defense counsel was attempting to steal a courtroom marker, an obvious comment on his character. We note further that she frequently accused him of delaying the trial, and, as we have indicated, found him in contempt in the presence of the jury on at least two, and perhaps three, occasions and threatened him with contempt in their presence on other occasions. Under the totality of the circumstances, the cumulation of these abrupt and arbitrary comments, unnecessary interrogations, premature rulings from the bench, and the arrest and citations of the defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>attorney in the presence of the jury clearly violated petitioner\u2019s right to a fair trial. As a result, we must reverse petitioner\u2019s conviction and remand for a new fair and impartial trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Because we reverse for the reasons stated above, it is unnecessary to address appellant\u2019s remaining questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THAT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-11\">.
