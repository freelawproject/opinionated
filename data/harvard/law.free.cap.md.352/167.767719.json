We shall hold that Maryland\u2019s common law voluntariness requirement does not apply to confessions elicited purely by private individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Michael Pappaconstantinou (also known as Pappas) was employed with Auto Row Auto Parts (Auto Row) in Waldorf, Maryland for approximately three years until the company terminated him because it suspected that he had been stealing from the company. Following his termination, Pappas met with several Auto Row employees and signed the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">I, Michael John Pappas wrongfully took merchandise and money from Auto Row Auto Parts. I realize that I was correctly terminated from this establishment. Property was destroyed and incorrectly marked as return item [sic]. I realize that what I did was wrong and I unjustly cause [sic] a lot of difficulties to the members of Auto Row Auto Parts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Auto Row initiated criminal charges, and Pappas was found guilty by a jury of twelve counts of theft under $300 and one count of theft over $300 in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1997 Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">Pappas filed a pre-trial motion to suppress his confession, claiming that it was extracted both by threats and by promises not to prosecute, and was therefore involuntary and inadmissible. The trial court declined to address the issue pre-trial, but at the trial, when Pappas renewed his motion to suppress his handwritten confession, the court held a hearing outside the presence of the jury. The trial court concluded that Pappas\u2019 statement, in the nature of an admission, was not \u201cinherently unreliable.\u201d The trial court concluded that under the circumstances of the case, the statement was freely given, constitut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>ed competent evidence, and hence, was admissible in evidence. Pappas was convicted by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Pappas noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that his confession was involuntary under Maryland\u2019s common law voluntariness requirement. The intermediate appellate court affirmed, holding that the common law voluntariness test, as enunciated by appellant, was \u201cinapplicable in cases in which a private party has elicited a confession, which is later offered and received in evidence in a criminal prosecution of the confessor.\u201d <em>Pappaconstantinou v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 668, 677, 703 A.2d 1295, 1299 (1998). The court reasoned that \u201cprivately-extracted confessions should be viewed like any other hearsay statement, such as a declaration against penal interest, and that the test, therefore, should be whether the statement is inherently trustworthy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 677, 703 A.2d at 1299. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals, and shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Pappas argues before this Court that his confession was the result of an improper inducement because his former employers, representatives of Auto Row, promised not to prosecute him. Pappas concedes that there were no state actors involved in eliciting his confession, and as such, no federal constitutional principles are implicated. <em>See Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 166, 107 S.Ct. 515, 521, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986) (holding that governmental or state action is a necessary requirement to exclude evidence under the Due Process Clause); <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>327 Md. 494, 504, 610 A.2d 782, 786 (1992) (recognizing that \u201ccoercion by government agents is a necessary ingredient to a determination that a defendant\u2019s confession should be suppressed because the defendant\u2019s constitutional due process rights have been violated\u201d). Instead, Pappas argues that his statement was involuntary under Maryland\u2019s common law voluntariness doctrine. He urges this Court to draw no distinction between those statements made to private individuals, on the one hand, and those statements made to government agents. He advocates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>a rule that would exclude from evidence all involuntary statements on the grounds that Maryland\u2019s non-constitutional doctrine of voluntariness does not require state action to trigger the rule of exclusion. In the alternative, he suggests that if the application of Maryland\u2019s voluntariness doctrine is limited to those confessions elicited by \u201cpersons in authority,\u201d then \u201cpersons in authority\u201d should include those persons having the actual power to carry out an inducement. In Pappas\u2019 view, this class would include employers, security guards and alleged victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The State\u2019s position is not complicated. The State argues that the Court of Special Appeals properly rejected Pappas\u2019 contention that Maryland\u2019s common law voluntariness test and hence, the Maryland common law rule of exclusion, applies when the defendant confesses to a private person rather than a government agent. The State maintains that the proper standard for determining the admissibility of statements made to private individuals is an evidentiary test, <em>i.e., </em>whether the statement manifests sufficient indicia of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">A confession is admissible in evidence against an accused if it is \u201c(1) voluntary under Maryland non-constitutional law, (2) voluntary under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and (3) elicited in conformance with the mandates of <em>Miranda.\u201d Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 173-74, 699 A.2d 1170, 1178 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 118 S.Ct. 866, 139 L.Ed.2d 763 (1998) (quoting <em>Hoey v. State, </em>311 Md. 473, 480, 536 A.2d 622, 625 (1988)). Thus, the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d of a confession can be determined by the application of state evidentiary rules as well as a constitutional due process analysis. <em>See Reynolds, </em>327 Md. at 503, 610 A.2d at 786 (1992) (citing 1 McCormick on Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 146-47, at 564-74 (4th ed.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">It is only the first requirement for admissibility that is in issue in this case\u2014the admissibility of a statement under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Maryland non-constitutional law. Considerations of federal Due Process and <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not implicated when, as here, the defendant is not in police custody, and the confession is elicited through purely private action. <em>See Connelly, </em>479 U.S. at 166, 107 S.Ct. at 521. The Supreme Court held in <em>Colorado v. Connelly </em>that \u201ccoercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not \u2018voluntary\u2019 within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167, 107 S.Ct. at 522. The Court reasoned that \u201c[t]he aim of the requirement of due process is not to exclude presumptively false evidence, but to prevent fundamental unfairness in the use of evidence, whether true or false.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167, 107 S.Ct. at 522 (quoting <em>Lisenba v. California, </em>314 U.S. 219, 236, 62 S.Ct. 280, 290, 86 L.Ed. 166 (1941)). Even \u201c[t]he most outrageous behavior by a private party seeking to secure evidence against a defendant does not make- that evidence inadmissible under the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166, 107 S.Ct. at 521. The Court then left to the states to determine, under evidentiary laws of the forum, the reliability of confessions not involving coercive police activity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 167, 107 S.Ct. at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>It has long been the law in this State that before confessions may be admitted in evidence, \u201cthat they be not induced by threats or by promise of advantage to be derived from making them; and the burden of showing affirmatively that they were not so induced to be made in any given case is upon the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Green v. State, </em>96 Md. 384, 386, 54 A. 104, 104 (1903); <em>Nicholson v. State, </em>38 Md. 140 (1873). The seminal case in Maryland on the common law voluntariness of confessions is <em>Nicholson v. State. </em>In that case, our predecessors considered the admissibility in evidence of a confession made to a police detective by the accused while in police custody. <em>Id. </em>at 143. The defendant contended that the police detective Crone used language to induce his confession that would not otherwise have been made. <em>Id. </em>Before the detective was permitted to testify to the details of the confession, the trial court examined the circumstances under which the confession was given to determine whether any promise, threat or inducement had been made to the prisoner that would render the confession involuntary, and hence inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>Concluding that the statement was competent evidence and admissible evidence to be presented to the jury, writing for the Court, Chief Judge Bartol stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">[I]t is very clear upon all the authorities, that if the confession of the appellant had been induced by any threat of harm, or promise of worldly advantage held out to him by Crone, <em>or by his authority, or in his presence and with his sanction, </em>it ought to be excluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 153 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In the case of <em>Biscoe v. State, </em>67 Md. 6, 8 A. 571 (1887), the Court reversed the murder conviction because the confession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>made by the prisoner to the committing magistrate was not voluntary. The magistrate, believing it was his duty to elicit a confession from the prisoner, visited the prisoner five times. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 8 A. at 571. On the last visit, the magistrate told the prisoner \u201cthat it would be better for him to tell the truth, and have no more trouble about it\u201d; the prisoner confessed. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 8 A. at 571. The Court noted that at the time of the confession, the defendant was in the custody of the law and was pressed by one in authority. <em>Id. </em>at 8, 8 A. at 571-72. The Court reviewed several English cases, and quoted with approval from <em>Reg. v. Garnier, </em>2 Carr. <em>&amp; </em>K. 920:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">[T]he witness told the prisoner \u2018that it would be better for him to tell the truth.\u2019 ... After full argument of the case, Pollock, C.B., said: \u2018When a prisoner has been told that he had better tell the truth, and these expressions are used by, or <em>in the presence of a person in authority, </em>I always reject the evidence.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 8, 8 A. at 572 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In the case of <em>McCleary v. State, </em>122 Md. 394, 89 A. 1100 (1914), the Court affirmed the judgment of conviction for murder, rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim that his confession was involuntary. In considering various circumstances that would render a statement inadmissible because of threats or promises, the Court quoted from <em>Commonwealth v. Myers, </em>160 Mass. 530, 36 N.E. 481 (Mass.1894):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">[Confessions were not to be excluded because they were the admission of the person charged with the commission of a crime, but only where the circumstances were such under which they were made, that a reasonable presumption arises that they might have been induced by a promise or threat from <em>one in authority </em>and consequently were open to the objection that they might not be true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 406, 89 A. at 1105 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">In <em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 406 A.2d 415 (1979), the defendant claimed that his inculpatory statement to a police officer was involuntary because it was prompted by improper police inducement. We agreed, primarily because the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>had promised the defendant help if he would make a statement. <em>Id. </em>at 153, 406 A.2d at 420. In our discussion of voluntariness, we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">While any decision concerning the voluntariness of a statement necessarily must rest on the facts of the case involved, we nonetheless find that, with regard to promises and other similar forms of inducement designed to elicit a defendant\u2019s confession, this Court, in a series of cases that stretch back into the last century, has established certain boundaries within which <em>police conduct </em>must be contained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 151-52, 406 A.2d at 419 (emphasis added). \u201cThe rule in <em>Hillard </em>announces that a statement is rendered involuntary if it is induced by any <em>official </em>promise which redounds to the benefit or desire of the defendant.\u201d <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>327 Md. at 508-09, 610 A.2d at 789 (1992) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Stokes v. State, </em>289 Md. 155, 160, 423 A.2d 552, 554 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">A year after <em>Hillard, </em>we decided <em>Stokes v. State, </em>where we considered, <em>inter alia, </em>the question' of whether a promise not to arrest a near relative of the defendant, or a threat to do so, constitutes a form of inducement which will render a resulting statement involuntary. 289 Md. at 161, 423 A.2d at 555. Judge Digges, writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">A finding that an inducement is impermissible, as we determine the one in this case to be, may only result where the challenged statement was produced by <em>police </em>words or deeds which communicated a threat or promise to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 161, 423 A.2d at 555 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">This Court also considered the common law voluntariness requirement in <em>Hoey v. State, </em>311 Md. 473, 536 A.2d 622 (1988). The defendant had confessed to certain criminal acts to a police officer. <em>Id. </em>at 478, 536 A.2d at 624-625. At a suppression hearing before trial, the defendant\u2019s expert witness testified that the defendant was suffering from schizophrenia, \u201crendering] him incapable of making a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478, 536 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>A.2d at 624. In analyzing whether Hoey\u2019s confessions were given freely and voluntarily under Maryland non-constitutional law, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\">Under Maryland nonconstitutional law, a confession is inadmissible unless it is \u2018shown to be free of any coercive barnacles that may have attached by improper means to prevent the expression from being voluntary.\u2019 Thus, a confession is involuntary if it is induced by force, undue influence, improper promises, or threats. <em>Whether particular police conduct is deemed improper </em>depends on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s confession, and a number of factors should be considered: the defendant\u2019s age and education, the defendant\u2019s physical condition and mental capacity, the length of the interrogation, the manner of questioning, and whether there was any physical mistreatment of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 483, 536 A.2d at 627 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). <em>See also Smith v. State, </em>189 Md. 596, 603-04, 56 A.2d 818, 821-22 (1948) (stating that \u201c[b]efore a confession can be admitted in evidence, the State must show ... that no force or coercion was exercised <em>by the officers obtaining the confession, </em>to cause the accused to confess\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Finally, in <em>Reynolds, </em>327 Md. at 507, 610 A.2d at 788, Judge Chasanow, writing for the Court, stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">Maryland has followed the old common law rule, which has seemed to adopt a per se exclusion rule that <em>official </em>promises of leniency to a defendant in custody that induce a confession render the confession inadmissible.... If a confession \u2018had been induced by any threat of harm, or promise of worldly advantage held out to him by [the interrogating detective], or by his authority, or in his presence and with his sanction, it ought to be excluded.\u2019 <em>Nicholson v. State, </em>38 Md. 140, 153 (1873).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">(Alteration in original) (emphasis added). <em>See also State v. Kidd, </em>281 Md. 32, 35-36, 375 A.2d 1105, 1108 (1977) (\u201cFor a statement to be the free and voluntary act of an accused, it must be obtained without force applied, coercion used, hope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>held out or promise made <em>on the part of the authorities.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); <em>Carder v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 531, 539, 248 A.2d 495, 500 (1968) (holding that the voluntariness test does not apply to a civilian witness who was not associated with the police and whose only purpose was to assist the injured defendant). In summary, it appears that in every Maryland case applying the rule of exclusion to a defendant\u2019s incriminating statement, the incriminating statement in question had been made directly to an officer or sheriff, or in the presence and with at least the implicit sanction of legal authority. <em>See, e.g., Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. at 170, 699 A.2d at 1176; <em>Burch v. State, </em>346 Md. 253, 696 A.2d 443 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 571, 139 L.Ed.2d 410 (1997); <em>Hof v. State, </em>337 Md. 581, 655 A.2d 370 (1995); <em>Brittingham v. State, </em>306 Md. 654, 511 A.2d 45 (1986); <em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 406 A.2d 415 (1979); <em>State v. Kidd, </em>281 Md. 32, 375 A.2d 1105 (1977); <em>Biscoe v. State, </em>67 Md. 6, 8 A. 571 (1887); <em>In re Joshua David C., </em>116 Md.App. 580, 698 A.2d 1155 (1997); <em>Boyer v. State, </em>102 Md.App. 648, 651 A.2d 403 (1995); <em>Ringe v. State, </em>94 Md.App. 614, 618 A.2d 266 (1993); <em>Finke v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 450, 468 A.2d 353 (1983); <em>Law v. State, </em>21 Md.App. 13, 318 A.2d 859 (1974), <em>appeal after remand, </em>29 Md.App. 457, 349 A.2d 295 (1975); <em>Keller v. State, </em>2 Md.App. 623, 236 A.2d 313 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Our survey of Maryland case law turned up only two cases which arguably support Petitioner\u2019s proposition. The first of these cases is <em>Watts v. State, </em>99 Md. 30, 57 A. 542 (1904). In <em>Watts, </em>we held that the defendant\u2019s confession \u201cmade to Mr. Marley, a reporter of the \u2018Evening News,\u2019 by the defendant while in jail, in the presence of the Deputy Sheriff and the Jail Warden, and ... taken down in short hand by Mr. Linzey,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 35, 57 A. at 544, was inadmissible. Watts was in jail awaiting trial for the murder of his wife. <em>Id. </em>at 35, 57 A. at 544. The reporter told the defendant that \u201cit would be possibly better for him if he would make a clean statement, so it would not appear erroneously in the papers; that the papers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>would get it anyway, and as my paper was an evening paper, the correct statement would come out first.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35, 57 A. at 544. Watts confessed and was subsequently convicted. <em>Id. </em>at 35, 57 A. at 544. The Court, citing <em>Nicholson </em>and <em>Bram v. United States, </em>168 U.S. 532, 561, 18 S.Ct. 183, 194, 42 L.Ed. 568 (1897), reversed, concluding that the State had failed to show that the statement was not obtained by improper means. <em>Id. </em>at 35-36, 57 A. at 545. Although it is difficult to say with certainty whether the evidence was excluded on the basis of the reporter\u2019s statements alone, or whether the defendant\u2019s custody and a presumed acquiescence or sanction of the state officials constituted sufficient state involvement to implicate the voluntariness doctrine, the Court\u2019s citation to <em>Nicholson </em>suggests the latter interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The second case is <em>Scott v. State, </em>61 Md.App. 599, 487 A.2d 1204 (1985). Scott, a 15-year-old boy, had been identified by the victim of a rape as the perpetrator. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 487 A.2d at 1205. He was taken into custody and interrogated by the police. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 487 A.2d at 1205. At the suppression hearing, he testified that two police officers threatened him with a blackjack, and that his father threatened to hit him with a chair if he did not stop smiling. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 487 A.2d at 1205. Scott claimed that his confession was involuntary because he was threatened by the police and his father. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 487 A.2d at 1205. The intermediate appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that the police officers did not threaten the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 603-04, 487 A.2d at 1206. As to the father\u2019s remark, the court held that it was not a demand to confess, but rather a mere request to change a facial expression. <em>Id. </em>at 604, 487 A.2d at 1206. The court, in <em>dicta, </em>addressed the fact that the father was not a state agent. Judge Adkins, writing for the court, noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad8\">Preliminarily, we note that the father was not a State agent. The mere fact that no agency relationship existed, however, would not necessarily preclude a finding that the confession was involuntary. In <em>Watts v. State, </em>99 Md. 30, 57 A. 542 (1904) for example, a reporter\u2019s exhortation to a defendant to confess rendered the defendant\u2019s confession involuntary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>In a recent analysis of the case, the Court of Appeals noted that the plea to confess was made \u2018with the sheriff present.\u2019 <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 152, 406 A.2d 415.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><em>Scott, </em>61 Md.App. at 604, 487 A.2d at 1206. The <em>Scott </em>court seemingly placed significance on the fact that the statement was made in the presence of one with authority over the prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Both <em>Watts </em>and <em>Scott </em>involved confessions elicited in the presence of police while the defendant was in police custody. Neither case stands for the proposition that a confession elicited by <em>purely private conduct </em>is subject to Maryland\u2019s common law voluntariness requirement. Although the language in <em>Scott </em>at first blush might suggest that private conduct may trigger the exclusionary rule, the context requires the conclusion that when a confession is made in the presence of one having legal authority over the accused, and in the language of <em>Nicholson, </em>\u201cwith his sanction,\u201d the conduct is not considered private conduct and is sufficient to trigger the common law voluntariness rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">We hold that Maryland\u2019s common law voluntariness requirement does not apply to confessions elicited by purely private conduct. Consistent with our prior case law, the voluntariness requirement is applicable when a confession is elicited by one in authority, or in his or her presence and with his or her sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Because we believe that the primary purpose of Maryland\u2019s per se exclusionary rule for involuntary confessions is to protect against government overreaching, we reject Petitioner\u2019s argument that \u201cpersons in authority,\u201d or apparent official authority, should not be limited to state actors. We also reject Petitioner\u2019s argument that the rule should include those persons, such as employers, who have \u201creal authority\u201d over the accused and the power to carry out a threat or promise. Exclusion of confessions elicited by purely private persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>does not further the goal of protecting citizens from overreaching conduct of police or government.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The fear that a confession elicited by private individuals may be untrue or inherently untrustworthy is properly addressed under the laws governing the admissibility of evidence in this state. As the Court of Special Appeals observed with respect to evidence derived by private persons, \u201c[W]e ask the questions that are the concern of the common law of evidence\u2014Is it competent?, Is it trustworthy?, Will it enhance the accuracy of the verdict?\u201d <em>Jacobs v. State, </em>45 Md.App. 634, 646, 415 A.2d 590, 597 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We begin with the proposition that all relevant evidence is admissible. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-402 (Relevant evidence generally admissible; irrelevant evidence inadmissible). Relevant evidence \u201cmeans evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-401. (Definition of \u201crelevant evidence\u201d). Obviously, evidence that the trial judge deems unreliable or untrustworthy is not probative to any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the case, and hence, is not relevant evidence. In addition, Md. Rule 5-403, Exclusion of relevant evidence on grounds of prejudice, confusion or waste of time, permits a trial judge to exclude evidence if the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 5-601 (General Rule of competency); 10 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 403.02[3] (2d ed. 1984) (\u201cIf the relevance of the proffered evidence is suspect or slight but would be prejudicial then any justification of its admission is slight or non-existent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>In <em>McCleary v. State, </em>122 Md. 394, 89 A. 1100 (1914), the defendant excepted to the admission of his confession on the grounds that his alleged confession was involuntary. Noting that it is the fundamental duty of the trial court to pass upon the admissibility of evidence, our predecessors applied the precedent set out in <em>Nicholson v. State, </em>and concluded that the evidence as to the involuntary nature of the confession was insufficient to warrant exclusion of it, but rather is to be considered as to the weight to be accorded it. <em>Id. </em>at 408, 89 A. at 1106. The Court quoted with approval from the Supreme Court of Connecticut in <em>State v. Willis, </em>71 Conn. 293, 41 A. 820 (1898), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">The English decisions which have developed the existing practice in excluding admissions are not concerned with their admissibility' as- relevant, but mainly, if not wholly, with their weight. The question is, shall this evidence, admissible as relevant, be excluded because in the opinion of the judge the conditions for the declaration come within those conditions that make such an admission too unreliable to go to the jury? and the decisions illustrate the diverse exercise of this judicial discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 408-09, 89 A. at 1106.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">So, too, today under the laws governing the admission of evidence in this State. The trial judge has the duty and the discretion to decide in the first instance whether under all the circumstances the evidence is admissible. Once the court decides the question of the admissibility <em>vel non </em>of a confession, the defendant is entitled to have the jury hear and consider whether a private person made any threats or promises and whether it had any effect upon him or her in deciding to confess. The jury is entitled to consider this testimony, and give it whatever weight it chooses.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">We now turn to the issue of whether the trial court erred in determining that Pappas\u2019 written statement to his employers was sufficiently reliable to be admissible against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>him at his trial. In our review of the trial court\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress, we consider only those facts presented during the suppression hearing. <em>Trusty v. State, </em>308 Md. 658, 670, 521 A.2d 749, 755 (1987). Petitioner\u2019s account at the hearing varied greatly from Auto Row\u2019s account. Although acknowledging these differences, the trial court found that the meeting at issue and the discussion of prosecution was as much the product of Petitioner \u201cbringing up the topic of prosecution\u201d as it was of the Auto Row employees. The court concluded that Petitioner\u2019s statement was \u201cnot the product of such promise or threat as to render it inherently unreliable.\u201d The trial court was not clearly erroneous in determining that Petitioner\u2019s confession was sufficiently reliable to be admissible at Petitioner\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
