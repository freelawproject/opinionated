During his direct testimony, the investigating detective was permitted to testify, over defense counsel\u2019s repeated objections, that after Petitioner was arrested, the detective advised him of his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), even though Petitioner had made no subsequent statement to the police. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed Petitioner\u2019s convictions in an unreported opinion. We granted Petitioner a writ of certiorari to answer the question, \u201cIf the defendant chose to remain silent when questioned by the police after his arrest, may the State elicit testimony that the police read the defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights?\u201d Our answer is in the negative. Because we conclude that the disputed testimony bore no relevance to any issue in the case and was highly prejudicial, we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">On May 3, 1996 Hulbert Clark was returning from a local store with three friends after an afternoon of playing basketball in the neighborhood park. While walking eastbound along the 4000 block of Chesterfield Avenue in Baltimore City between six o\u2019clock and six-thirty in the evening, Clark and his companions, Dwayne Green, William Roberts and Antoine Williams, were approached by Petitioner, Sean Dupree. Dupree exchanged greetings with the group and at some point shortly thereafter, according to Green, became engaged in \u201cloud talking\u201d with Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Green testified that after a mutual exchange of \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d with Dupree, his attention had been momentarily diverted from his friends but was drawn back by a \u201ccommotion\u201d between Dupree and Clark. While unable to distinguish all that the two were saying, Green recalled that Dupree was saying \u2018What\u2019s up, what\u2019s up\u201d in a \u201ctone of voice [that] didn\u2019t sound like a regular greeting.\u201d As Green turned back to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>wards this commotion, he observed Dupree holding Clark in his chest area and pointing a handgun at Clark\u2019s head. Dupree pulled the trigger and shot Clark in the head. Green stated that Dupree shot Clark another two times, once as the victim was falling and again as his body hit the ground. The shooting took place less than two feet in front of Green. As Dupree turned toward Green, the latter fled to an alleyway where he remained momentarily until he was certain Dupree had left the area. Green then returned to the scene of the shooting. After seeing Clark\u2019s lifeless body and Antoine Williams kneeling down nearby in what appeared to be a state of prayer, Green ran to his house nearby \u201cto dial 911.\u201d Green testified that at no point did he ever see Clark with a gun. Moreover, he reasoned that neither Clark\u2019s attire of sweatpants and a tee-shirt, which he had just put back over his torso only moments before the shooting, nor Clark\u2019s activity of playing basketball all afternoon would have been suitable to carrying a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In his testimony, William Roberts reiterated Green\u2019s account of their returning from the local store along with Clark and Antoine Williams when Dupree approached and joined the group. Roberts further testified that he and Williams were walking ahead of the other three, with Dupree and Clark following together in the middle and Green trailing along directly behind them, when he heard three gunshots. He turned to see what had happened and observed Clark lying on the ground and Dupree running towards a nearby alley. Roberts then ran to Green\u2019s house and called Clark\u2019s mother to inform her that her son had just been shot. Roberts acknowledged on cross-examination that Dupree and Clark had been speaking to each other before the gunshots occurred but he was unable to distinguish what the two were saying. In addition, Roberts confirmed that he too had witnessed Williams kneeling down in prayer over Clark\u2019s body. Because he could not be located, Antoine Williams did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Detective Richard Petrey testified that, as the primary detective assigned to investigate the shooting death of Hulbert Clark, he responded to the scene within minutes and shortly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>received from a fellow officer the name of Sean Dupree as a suspect. Unable to locate Dupree at his home, the detective obtained a warrant for Dupree\u2019s arrest. On May 31, 1996 Detective Petrey had Dupree profiled on local television news programs as being wanted for murder. The next day Dupree turned himself in to the police. During Detective Petrey\u2019s direct testimony regarding his post-arrest interview of Dupree, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">Q. And, upon meeting the Defendant what, if anything, was done by you at the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">A. Okay. There is a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">THE COURT: Come on up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">During the ensuing bench conference, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: He continues his constitutional right to remain silent, which just the fact that he didn\u2019t say anything is not incriminating. So, he has a constitutional right not to say anything, so I object to any line of questioning whether he said anything or didn\u2019t say anything. The truth is he didn\u2019t say anything as the State related to us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: His rights were enforced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: All I want to do is ask him is did he explain his rights to him, did he understand them, did he proceed to make a statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I submit he has a constitutional right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: That\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s going to say. He didn\u2019t say anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Then why is it being brought up? There is no statement that is coming in. There\u2014it will only leave an impression with the jury that there is something wrong with him not saying something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>THE COURT: Well, you can ask him did he ask\u2014did he advise him of his rights according to procedure and then stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">THE COURT: He\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The assistant state\u2019s attorney then continued the direct examination of Detective Petrey:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">Q. Detective Petrey, upon your first meeting with the Defendant did you advise him of his rights according to Police Department procedure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-10\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-11\">Q. Would you advise the jury what you advised the Defendant of with regard to his rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-12\">A. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-14\">THE COURT: Go ahead, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-15\">THE WITNESS: There is a Police Department form that we use. It\u2019s form, Form 69, that we use with everybody who is taken into custody and on this form their name appears, age, their educational level, their date\u2014I\u2019m sorry\u2014the date and the time is put on to the form also. In addition to the form in the upper right hand corner I noted certain things about the Defendant such as he was left handed, that he did not require glasses, that he had no drugs or alcohol, he was on no medication, and that he could read or write.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-16\">BY [THE PROSECUTOR]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-17\">Q. Now, when you advised him of his rights was there anyone else with you at the time other than the Defendant? A. Yeah, that would have been Detective Hoover.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-18\">Q. And, upon advising the Defendant of his rights did you get the understanding that he understood what he was being advised of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-19\">A. Yes, after each of the rights, number one through five, there is a small line at the rear of each right where the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Defendant initials and that indicates that he does understand his rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">During cross-examination of the detective, defense counsel pressed the point that the scene of the shooting had not been secured for a number of minutes before the first police officer arrived and therefore the area around Clark\u2019s body was subject to possible \u201ctampering.\u201d In addition, the defense elicited from Detective Petrey that the police had not been able to locate Antoine Williams, the third eyewitness to the shooting (and the last person known to be near Clark\u2019s body before police arrived), since the summer of 1996, some nine months prior to the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Dupree took the stand in his own defense and testified that he ran into the group while he was walking down the street. Dupree explained what transpired thereafter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">I spoke to them. They said what\u2019s up. I said nothing. That\u2019s when [Clark] turned, said bitch, you run up on me like that again I kill you. I said what? He said you heard me, nigger. What\u2019s up? So, he shoved his hand down his pants like so. He put his hands down, so he . shoves his hand down his pants like he was going for his gun, so I grabbed mine and shot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Dupree testified that it was this gesture by Clark and his seeing the butt of a black gun that caused him to react in panic by shooting Clark aimlessly with his own \u201c22\u201d that he had bought \u201coff the street.\u201d After shooting Clark, Dupree dropped his own gun and ran. Dupree further related that all he knew about Clark was that he was from Atlanta and that because they \u201cdidn\u2019t have a relationship\u201d Dupree \u201cdidn\u2019t know how to take him.\u201d Clark had made threats to Dupree in the past, \u201c[l]ike nigger, you don\u2019t know where I\u2019m from. You don\u2019t know.\u201d Hence, he took Clark\u2019s threatening gesture seriously and \u201creacted accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">During portions of his closing argument the prosecutor addressed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">So, what does Sean Dupree do? Well, the little punk that he is he just runs out of there and what does he do? He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>don\u2019t come\u2014he don\u2019t run around to ... where he lives and say mama, I\u2019ve just done a terrible thing, call the cops, you know, I just killed somebody. No he runs for not one, two or three days, not even for a week or two. He stays away for four solid weeks, says he calls his mother one time in four weeks after he just killed somebody. Now, does that make any sense? Why does he stay away? Because he just killed somebody for absolutely no reason at all. <em>Why doesn\u2019t he tell the officers I\u2019m sorry, I had a gun, I saw a gun. Why can he not tell the officers that he had\u2014that Hulbert had a gun? </em>Because Hulbert Clark did not have a gun. That\u2019s called\u2014that defense is called desperation and speculation. I got to think of something quick to tell these twelve people, that I was trying to defend myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">Maybe he thinks I can get away with this. I\u2019ll stay away for a month, finally turn myself in. <em>Why didn\u2019t he tell the cops [Hulbert Clark] had a gun? </em>Because he didn\u2019t. Because he didn\u2019t. Hulbert did not have a gun. He wants you to believe he had a gun so he can think of this perfect or imperfect self-defense, but ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we have got to call this what it is.... This is first degree murder. [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The jury convicted Dupree of second degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1998 Supp.) Article 27, \u00a7 411 and \u00a7 36B (d), respectively. The trial court sentenced Dupree to the Department of Corrections for a term of twenty years, the first five without the benefit of parole, on the handgun count, and to a consecutive term of thirty years on the murder count. Dupree noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. That court affirmed Dupree\u2019s convictions in an unreported opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Petitioner argues that Detective Petrey\u2019s testimony informing the jury that he advised Dupree of \u201chis rights according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>procedure\u201d violated Dupree\u2019s rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as well as his rights under Articles 22 and 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The State was permitted to accomplish indirectly what it is constitutionally forbidden to do directly, that is, present to the jury evidence that Dupree remained silent after being apprised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Dupree asserts that the detective\u2019s testimony regarding his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, combined with the absence of any statement by the defendant thereafter, left the jury with the unmistakable impression that Dupree chose to exercise his right to remain silent, a choice that some persons commonly view as indicative of guilt. Dupree also argues that the challenged testimony, short of any constitutional infringement, was nonetheless \u201cinadmissible under the rules of evidence in that it was plainly irrelevant to any issue in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The State counters that there was no constitutional error in Petitioner\u2019s trial because \u201cthere was absolutely no mention to the jury that Dupree even exercised his Fifth Amendment privilege ... nor was there any attempted use of this silence by the prosecution.\u201d By itself, Detective Petrey\u2019s testimony that he advised Dupree of his <em>Miranda </em>rights did not amount to reversible error. The State stresses that it is the particular <em>use </em>of post-arrest silence that must be reviewed for possible constitutional violation, not the mere mention that an arrestee was advised of his rights. Because the State did not exploit the \u201csingle reference to the fact that Dupree was advised of his \u2018rights,\u2019 \u201d Dupree\u2019s conviction should be affirmed. Moreover, Dupree\u2019s contention for the first time before this Court that the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks comprised the illicit exploitation misapprehends the State\u2019s argument. The prosecutor\u2019s summation referenced Dupree\u2019s flight from the scene and month-long absence before turning himself in to the police; in no way did it focus upon Dupree\u2019s post-arrest silence. Finally, the State does not specifically rebut Petitioner\u2019s relevancy argument but contends that \u201c[a]ny error in admitting testimony of Dupree\u2019s \u2018rights\u2019 advisement was harmless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">As we embark upon our duty to resolve the question presented in this case we take note of this Court\u2019s decision in confronting a similar matter almost two decades ago. <em>State v. Raithel, </em>285 Md. 478, 404 A.2d 264 (1979), presented the question \u201cwhether a trial court\u2019s use of an accused\u2019s silence at a prior suppression hearing to impeach his credibility when the defendant subsequently testifies at a second suppression hearing is permissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479, 404 A.2d at 264. The Court of Special Appeals had reversed Raithel\u2019s convictions for first degree murder, assault with intent to rape, and carrying a deadly weapon on the ground that the Fifth Amendment \u201cprivilege against self-incrimination prevents an accused\u2019s silence at a prior hearing from being considered in assessing his credibility.\u201d <em>Raithel v. State, </em>40 Md.App. 107, 117, 388 A.2d 161, 167 (1978). This Court affirmed the intermediate court but under a different rationale. Judge Eldridge, writing for the court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">[N]othing is better settled than the principle that courts should not decide constitutional issues unnecessarily. In the instant case, the Fifth Amendment issue only arises if the defendant\u2019s silence at the first suppression hearing was proper impeaching evidence as a matter of Maryland evidence law. In our view, under the circumstances of this case, the defendant\u2019s silence should not have been considered by the trial court regardless of any Fifth Amendment considerations. Consequently, we resolve the question presented in this case on that non-constitutional ground, and we do not reach any of the constitutional issues dealt with by the Court of Special Appeals and the State in its argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-6\"><em>Raithel, </em>285 Md. at 484, 404 A.2d at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">In the present case, the constitutional issues debated by Petitioner and the State need be resolved by this Court only if the testimony regarding Dupree\u2019s receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings was proper as a matter of Maryland evidentiary law. Under our rules of relevancy, if evidence lacks any tendency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt more probable or less probable, that evidence must be excluded. <em>See </em>Maryland Rules 5-401 and 5-102. It is well settled that \u201cthe admission of evidence is committed to the considerable and sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 404, 697 A.2d 432, 439 (1997), and cases cited therein. <em>See also Hunt v. </em>State, 321 Md. 387, 425, 583 A.2d 218, 236 (1990); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 527, 495 A.2d 1, 21 (1985); <em>Durkin v. State, </em>284 Md. 445, 453, 397 A.2d 600, 605 (1979). The trial court\u2019s determination of relevancy will, however, be overturned on appeal for clear abuse of discretion. <em>See Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. at 404-05, 697 A.2d at 439; <em>White v. State, </em>324 Md. 626, 637, 598 A.2d 187, 192 (1991); <em>Johnson, </em>303 Md. at 527, 495 A.2d at 21; <em>Durkin, </em>284 Md. at 453, 397 A.2d at 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">We hold that because the disputed testimony lacked the threshold relevancy necessary for admissibility, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing its presentation to the jury. It is therefore unnecessary to address the constitutionality of informing the jury of <em>Miranda </em>advisement where no pre-trial statement by the defendant is to be offered. We find it helpful, nevertheless, to consider similar cases, the majority of them based upon related constitutional grounds, in reasoning through and arriving at our decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">It is well established that' the prosecution\u2019s use for impeachment purposes of a criminal defendant\u2019s silence at the time of arrest, after the defendant has been advised of <em>Miranda </em>rights, is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of due process. <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 619, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 2245, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). It is fundamentally unfair to induce the defendant\u2019s silence by giving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, only then to punish the invocation of the constitutional right to remain silent by using that silence to impeach the defendant\u2019s testimony at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 618, 96 S.Ct. at 2245. In reaching this conclusion the Supreme Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Silence in the wake of <em>[Miranda </em>] warnings may be nothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of these <em>Miranda </em>rights. Thus, every post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous because of what the State is required to advise the person arrested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 617, 96 S.Ct. at 2244 (citing <em>United States v. Hale, </em>422 U.S. 171, 177, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 2137, 45 L.Ed.2d 99 (1975) in which the Court had ruled, under its supervisory authority over the federal courts, that the use of post-arrest, post-<em>Miranda </em>silence was impermissible because silence at the time of arrest is likely to be ambiguous and thus enjoys only dubious probative value).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The issue presented in the instant case is of a similar kind, yet different degree. Petitioner\u2019s central contention is that presentation to the jury of the mere advice of <em>Miranda </em>rights to a defendant upon arrest constitutes a violation of the rule pronounced in <em>Doyle </em>where no pre-trial statement by the defendant is to be admitted into evidence. There appears to be no case, state or federal, that has found a <em>Doyle </em>violation under such circumstances. In fact, several courts have held that the admission of testimony as to the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, despite the defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to remain silent, does not amount to constitutional error. <em>United States v. Whitley, </em>734 F.2d 1129, 1135 (6th Cir.1984), <em>abrogation on other grounds recognized by United States v. Robinson, </em>887 F.2d 651, 653 (6th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Jonas, </em>639 F.2d 200, 205 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Collins v. State, </em>464 N.E.2d 1286, 1290 (Ind.1984); <em>State v. Carter, </em>335 N.C. 422, 440 S.E.2d 268, 273 (N.C.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">A somewhat related conclusion is universally accepted: evidence concerning the advice of <em>Miranda </em>rights followed by testimony as to the defendant\u2019s waiver of those rights, and as to any inculpatory statement given thereafter by the defendant, is permissible in order to enable the jury to assess the voluntariness of the putative waiver and to accord the subsequent statement whatever weight and credibility the jury deems appropriate. <em>See, e.g., United States v. De La Luz </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>Gallegos, </em>738 F.2d 378, 381-82 (10th Cir.1984) (\u201cA relevant purpose for admitting testimony that a defendant was advised of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>is to lay a proper foundation for the admission of any statements made by a defendant thereafter\u201d because it is the jury that must ultimately determine voluntariness of and proper weight to give to such statements.) (citations omitted); <em>State v. Stuckey, </em>680 S.W.2d 931, 938 (Mo.1984) (no error in simply showing that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given; prosecution was entitled to show defendant\u2019s statements were made voluntarily and that defendant had been clearly advised he was under no obligation to make any statement). <em>See also United States v. Two Bulls, </em>577 F.2d 63, 66 (8th Cir.1978) <em>(per curiam). Cf. Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 151, 406 A.2d 415, 419 (1979) (For criminal trials, the common law of Maryland requires \u201cthat the voluntary nature of a confession be twice established before it can be utilized by the trier of fact, together with any other evidence, in determining guilt or innocence\u2014initially, to the satisfaction of the trial judge, out of the hearing of the jury, as a mixed question of law and fact, and then, if the statement has been placed in evidence, by a determination of the trier of fact, be it court or jury, that beyond any reasonable doubt the confession was freely and voluntarily made.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In contrast, it is much less clear whether testimony as to <em>Miranda </em>warnings followed by an indirect reference to and/or comment upon the fact that the arrestee remained silent in the wake of such warnings constitutes a <em>Doyle </em>violation. Some courts have determined that the admission of such testimony is not error unless expressly or purposefully used by the prosecution as substantive evidence of guilt or as impeachment. <em>See Noland v.

Even so, the reasoning provided by some of these opinions, as well as others, regarding the evidentiary value of <em>Miranda </em>warnings in the context of a defendant\u2019s silence or statement is instructive. The Ninth Circuit has unequivocally stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5F\">The <em>only relevant purpose </em>for showing that [the defendant] was advised of his rights is to lay a proper foundation for the admission of any statements given thereafter by an accused. In the present case there were absolutely no statements given to [the police] by [the defendant]. By eliciting such testimony, the government put before the jury the fact that [the defendant] remained silent and requested an attorney. The natural tendency of the use of the testimony in this manner is to prejudice the defendant by attempting to create an inference of guilt in the jury\u2019s mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsL\"><em>Wycoff, </em>545 F.2d at 681 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The Eighth Circuit <em>per curiam </em>has concurred in this assessment of the limited relevance of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, declaring that absent certain atypical situations, \u201cthe detailed conversation relating to <em>Miranda </em>warnings ordinarily ought not be admitted into evidence if no statement is given.\u201d <em>Two Bulls, </em>577 F.2d at 66. Similarly, the Fifth Circuit has noted, \u201c[S]ince no statements obtained as a result of any prior interviews were introduced in evidence, the <em>Miranda </em>requirements are not relevant.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>459 F.2d 319, 322 n. 2 (5th Cir.1971) (citing <em>Allen v. United States, </em>384 F.2d 926, 927 (5th Cir.1967) <em>(per curiam) </em>(\u201cWe note further that the <em>Miranda </em>requirements would not be relevant where no evidence was introduced at the trial.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In another Eighth Circuit case, the court frowned upon the prosecutorial practice of eliciting testimony as to <em>Miranda </em>warnings where no statement had been given. While finding the practice to be non-error constitutionally, or, alternatively, harmless error under the circumstances of the case, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>opined that \u201cit is clearly advisable that it should not be done.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>584 F.2d 252, 261 (8th Cir.1978) (harmlessness of assumed error based upon prosecution\u2019s not pursuing <em>Miranda </em>testimony further and not mentioning it in closing argument as well as defense counsel\u2019s declining trial court\u2019s offer to instruct jury to disregard testimony in question).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In circumstances where, rather than giving no statement, the defendant offered explanations that were \u201cexculpatory or innocuous,\u201d the Ninth Circuit again stated forcefully the rationale for prohibiting testimony as to <em>Miranda </em>issues unless a subsequent <em>inculpatory </em>statement is to be presented to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">[W]hen the defendant\u2019s subsequent statements are <em>exculpatory </em>or <em>innocuous </em>... voluntariness is simply not an issue. In such cases, there is nothing to indicate that the defendant\u2019s statements were involuntarily made, and the defendant does not oppose their admission into evidence. Thus, the testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s invocation of <em>Miranda </em>rights is not probative, although it is potentially highly prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">Unlike cases where the defendant has subsequently made inculpatory statements, in cases ... where the defendant has made only exculpatory or innocuous statements, <em>Miranda-related </em>testimony will be far <em>more </em>prejudicial than the defendant\u2019s subsequent statements: it is the only evidence creating an inference that the defendant is guilty. As a result, the potential prejudicial impact of the <em>Miranda-. </em>related testimony will far outweigh any possible probative value such testimony could have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-8\"><em>United States v. Valencia, 773 </em>F.2d 1037, 1042 (9th Cir.1985) (citations omitted). Based upon this rationale, the court held that admission of testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s refusal to sign a Miranda-waiver form violated due process. <em>Id. </em>It stands to reason, <em>a fortiori, </em>that where the defendant has offered <em>no </em>statement, the prejudice inherent in the admission of Miranda-related testimony far outweighs any probative value such testimony could have: it lays ground for the double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>inference that the defendant invoked his right to remain silent and is therefore guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Finally, Dupree\u2019s invocation of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Zemo v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 308, 646 A.2d 1050 (1994) is appropriate. There the unanimous court held, \u201cThe jury, of course, has no need to know the course of an investigation unless it has some direct bearing on guilt or innocence. That an event occurs in the course of a criminal investigation does not, <em>ipso facto, </em>establish its relevance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310, 646 A.2d at 1053. Here, the prosecutor\u2019s entire justification for proffering the disputed testimony was simply to show that Dupree\u2019s \u201crights were enforced.\u201d More specifically, the <em>Zemo </em>opinion\u2019s cogent assessment of the nugatory probative value of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, notwithstanding the court\u2019s own explicit limitations regarding its pronouncement, applies with full force to the instant case, our resolution of which purposefully avoids the constitutional inquiry undertaken by <em>Zemo, </em>instead relying solely upon the pertinent evidentiary considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXz\">What legitimate relevance to the appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence, we ask initially, did it possibly have that he had been \u201cread ... <em>Miranda?\u201d </em>If he had given a <em>\u201cMirandized\u201d </em>statement that the State were offering in evidence, then, to be sure, the State might have to show its compliance with <em>Miranda </em>at the very threshold of admissibility. Where no statement was being offered and tested for admissibility, on the other hand, the appellant\u2019s silence in response to the <em>Miranda </em>warnings was immaterial. <em>Indeed, the very giving of the Miranda warnings was immaterial. </em>Indeed, the very fact that the appellant had even been interviewed was immaterial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">Nothing of any conceivable significance was being established by such references. What, moreover, was the possible downside? Every lawyer knows that <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required only when a suspect is in the throes of custodial interrogation. Every layman knows that the police give <em>Miranda </em>warnings to those whom they have arrested and whom they are about to question for involvement in a crime. The gratuitous reference to <em>Miranda </em>told the jury something about the appellant. In the world view of the laity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>\u201cgood guys\u201d don\u2019t get <em>\u201cMirandized.\u201d </em>At the very least, those who the police think are \u201cgood guys\u201d don\u2019t get <em>\u201cMirandized\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 315, 646 A.2d at 1056 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Likewise, in the instant case, the prosecution\u2019s needless insistence that the jury be informed that Dupree was \u201cread his rights\u201d put before the jury evidence that was immaterial to any issue in the trial. Because Dupree gave no statement to the police at the time of his arrest, the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not needed by the jury to complete its appointed task. That Detective Petrey advised Dupree of his right to remain silent, which may or may not have been the catalyst of Dupree\u2019s subsequent silence, is irrelevant. Under these circumstances, the trial court abused its discretion in admitting such testimony. <em>See </em>Maryland Rules 5-401 and 5-402.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">We now turn to consider whether the error committed by the trial court was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number><em>See Dorsey v. </em>State, 276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976). Given that error occurred in Dupree\u2019s criminal prosecution, his convictions cannot stand unless, upon our own independent review of the record, this Court is able to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 659, 350 A.2d at 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Once the State put before the jury the fact that Dupree had been advised of his rights yet offered no evidence of a subsequent statement by Dupree, the inference of Dupree\u2019s silence, and thus his guilt, lay dangling for the jury to grab hold. It may well be so that the jury did \u201ctake the bait.\u201d In our nation, the advice of rights upon arrest, and particularly of the right to remain silent upon arrest\u2014or to refuse to testify during one\u2019s criminal trial, or to \u201cplead the Fifth\u201d\u2014is widely known. Combined with this commonplace knowledge of the right to remain silent and what it signifies is the taint its invocation places on those who exercise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Yet the clear prejudice against Dupree derives from the State\u2019s closing remarks, however arguably subtle or possibly misinterpreted they might have been.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Without a doubt, the prosecutor was attacking Dupree\u2019s credibility in general and his plea at trial of self-defense in particular. It may well be true that the prosecutor tried valiantly and earnestly to avoid comment on Dupree\u2019s post-arrest, post <em>-Miranda </em>silence and meant only to impeach his trial defense by directing the jury\u2019s attention to the month-long period between the scooting and Dupree\u2019s surrender. It was at best a risky trial tactic in light of the heavy burden the State faces should error be established. Neither unfair nor unjustified, however, is the interpretation that the State, in offering the evidence of <em>Miranda </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>warnings and in summing up the evidence as it did, wanted the jury both to consider and to penalize Dupree for exercising his constitutional right to remain silent upon his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Dupree\u2019s hopes of acquittal on the basis of perfect self-defense or a conviction reduced from murder to manslaughter because of imperfect self-defense hinged upon the jury\u2019s crediting his testimony. His trial defense was not a frivolous one: Green and Roberts, the two eyewitnesses who testified, were both uncertain as to the nature of the verbal and/or physical altercation between Dupree and Clark before the shooting occurred. In addition, the absence of Antoine Williams, the last person known to be near Clark\u2019s fallen body before police arrived, gave rise to the possibility that Williams had \u201ctampered\u201d with evidence by absconding with the gun that Dupree claimed Clark had used to threaten him before he shot in self-defense. Hence, any attack upon Dupree\u2019s credibility \u201cstruck at the jugular\u201d of his trial testimony, <em>United States v. Harp, </em>536 F.2d 601, 603 (5th Cir.1976) <em>(per curiam), </em>and \u201cwent to the heart of [his] sole defense,\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>558 F.2d 1225, 1230 (5th Cir.1977). Given the circumstances of this case and the likely, if not probable, prejudice to Dupree\u2019s exculpatory explanation at trial, we cannot find the evidentiary error committed by the trial court harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

In some instances the rule in <em>Doyle </em>may be altogether inapplicable.

It can be argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Greer v. Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987), effectively abrogated the principal holding of <em>Wycoff, </em>545 F.2d 679 (9th Cir.1976). The Ninth Circuit found a <em>Doyle </em>error in the admission of the disputed testimony yet held it to be harmless in part because \"the trial judge admonished the jury to completely disregard the testimony\" with instructions that were \"prompt and forceful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 682. Under similar circumstances, the Supreme Court ruled that no <em>Doyle </em>violation occurred because the trial court did not permit the inquiry forbidden by the rule in that case, explicitly sustaining defense counsel's objection to the disputed testimony and later instructing the jury to disregard any questions to which an objection was sustained. <em>Miller, </em>483 U.S. at 764-65, 107 S.Ct. at 3108.

Succeeding this passage from <em>Zemo </em>was the following advisory footnote, relied upon by the Court of Special Appeals as the sole basis for rejecting Dupree's claims in the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">Our mention of the gratuitous reference to the giving of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings is only for the purpose of placing in fuller context the subsequent gratuitous reference to the appellant\u2019s silence in response to those warnings. <em>We are by no means intimating that a gratuitous reference to the giving of </em>Miranda <em>warnings would ever, in and of itself, constitute cause for reversal. </em>Any citation of our remarks above as authority for such a proposition would be an erroneous citation as support for a principle for which this opinion does not stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-11\"><em>Zemo v.

The intermediate court in the instant case determined that Detective Petrey\u2019s testimony amounted to no more than such a \"gratuitous reference.\u201d The State\u2019s purposeful elicitation of the disputed testimony, over defense counsel\u2019s repeated objection, would seem to indicate that the reference was hardly gratuitous. More importantly, the footnote appeared in the context of addressing the possibility of a violation of the appellant\u2019s right to due process, a violation the court ultimately recognized.
