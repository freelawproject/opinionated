Hers was the only testimony offered in her behalf. The defendant, his wife,, and superintendent all testified that her employment was by the week,, and conditioned upon her services proving satisfactory, and that her discharge was caused by her failure to meet the requirements of her duties. There were no circumstances tending to corroborate plaintiff\u2019s inherently improbable testimony, but she had judgment for the full amount claimed. As there was a failure to establish her cause o\u00a3 action by a preponderance of evidence, there must be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-16\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-17\">LEHMAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b147-18\">SEABURY, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Av0\">The court below was the lawfully-constituted judge of the weight of the evidence. Having the witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>before it when they gave their testimony, it was in a much better position to judge of the credibility of the witnesses than are the justices of this court, who have only the written record before them. The mere fact that-these interested witnesses contradicted the plaintiff is' no ground for the reversal of this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"A28\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
