As the plaintiff left a north-bound street car at the uptown corner of Fourth street and the Bowery, and was walking toward the sidewalk, she was struck and knocked down by a horsed and wagon driven by the servant of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-17\">This judgment should be reversed because of the persistent attempts of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to bring improper evidence before the jury. In his opening address to the jury, counsel for the plaintiff stated that the driver had been arrested. Defendant\u2019s counsel moved for the withdrawal of a juror; but the motion was not granted. In response to this motion, counsel for the plaintiff said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-18\">\u201cI concede that it has nothing to do with the case; but it is a fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-19\">Thus, while conceding its immateriality, he reiterated the improper statement. Upon the cross-examination of the \"driver,- counsel for the plaintiff asked him if he had been arrested. To this question defendant\u2019s counsel objected, and the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-20\">\u201cI rule it out. Strike out the testimony on that subject.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>Subsequently the court stated that it would allow the -witness \"\u201cto state what was done,\u201d and the witness replied to this question: - \u201cI was arrested.\u201d Counsel for the plaintiff then asked the witness: \u201cWere you arraigned before the magistrate?\u201d This question was objected to, and allowed-by the court, and the defendant excepted. Although it does not appear that the witness answered \"this question, it was clearly improper for the counsel for the plaintiff to have asked it. Counsel for the plaintiff then asked the witness whether he was fined. Defendant\u2019s counsel objected, and the court sustained the objection, and the defendant\u2019s counsel again moved to have the trial declared a mistrial, \u201con the ground that evidence had been introduced prejudicial to the rights of the defendant.\u201d The court denied the motion, and the defendant duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-3\">We think that the repeated attempts of plaintiff\u2019s counsel to bring before the jury the fact that the defendant\u2019s- driver had been arrested after the accident constituted not only misconduct on his part, but that in this case, where evidence was conflicting, it was prejudicial to the rights of the defendant. The questions propounded by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel which are quoted above disclose a deliberate purpose to bring improper evidence before the. jury. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel persisted in this purpose, although the learned court ruled that the evidence should be excluded, and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel himself stated that he conceded \u201cthat it has nothing to do with the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">The deliberate and persistent attempt of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to prejudice the jury against the defendant by propounding improper questions is worthy of condemnation. A verdict cannot stand unless it is the result of a fair trial, and when a persistent attempt has been made to arouse the prejudice of the jury it cannot-be said that a fair trial has been had.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
