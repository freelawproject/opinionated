Proc., by omitting \u201cthereof\u201d and interpolating \u201cthe truth of.\u201d No point was or is made of inserting \u201cthe truth of\u201d; but, deferring to the rulings in Rochkind v. Perlman, 123 App. Div. 808, 108 N. Y. Supp. 224, 1151, and Jurgens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>v. Wichmann, 124 App. Div. 529, 108 N. Y. Supp. 881 (both drafted by the same deft hand), that \u201cthis is no denial. Section.500 of the Code of Civil Procedure * * * means that the defendant must deny that he has any knowledge- or information thereof; that is, of such allegations sufficient to form a belief as to their truth. The so-called denial in this answer * * * is too slovenly and loose. This artificial form of denial has to be followed with substantial strictness in order to be good\u201d\u2014-the learned trial justice imposed $30 trial fee and all plaintiff\u2019s taxable disbursements for allowing the withdrawal of a juror. At Special Term the defendant was permitted to amend in the exact language of the Code without imposition of further terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">This was well enough in this department. The pleader had but followed a poor paraphrase, so commonly adopted that- it appears in several of the cases here upon appeal, and has been let pass time and again by the court of resort next above upon this side of the affluent East river, which often divides law and practice as did the Mahratta ditch, upon one brink of which the widow\u2019s suttee was commended to and of the pious, while on the other it was abhorrent to the law and religion. In Hidden v. Godfrey, 88 App. Div. 496, 85 N. Y. Supp. 197, it was ruled of the.absence of the fateful \u201cthereof\u201d: \u201cWe think, however, that the weight of authority, as well as reason, is in favor of requiring, not a literal, but a reasonably strict, compliance with the terms of this section of the Code\u201d\u2014and an order below' to the contrary was reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">GILDERSLEEVE, P. J., and SEABURY, J., concur in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
