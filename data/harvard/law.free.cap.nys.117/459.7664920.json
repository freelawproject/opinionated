The complaint then continues: \u201cPlaintiff further complains and alleges more especially as to defendant Warner,\u201d that he and Warner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>had been copartners under two agreements which are set forth in the complaint\u2014neither Wells nor Korb was a party to these agreements \u2014and that there has been withheld by Warner and his codefendants a large sum of money, \u201csay $10,000,\u201d over and above all just set-offs or counterclaims. Plaintiff then alleges as against the defendant Korb that Korb was in his employ, and that Korb joined with his codefendants in withholding certain fees due to the plaintiff amounting to $2,-000. And plaintiff demands judgment that an accounting be taken of all the matters in the complaint specified; that the plaintiff have such mistakes, errors, and erroneous charges corrected and reformed; that a receiver be appointed to take charge of the remaining joint matters of business of the plaintiff and the defendants; and that the plaintiff have judgment against th\u00e9 defendants for $15,000 and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The cause of action against Wells has no relation to or connection with either of the other defendants. The controversy as to this cause of action is between the plaintiff and Wells, to which the other defendants are not parties. So far as any action is alleged against Warner, neither Wells nor Korb has any connection with it, and it is difficult to see that there is any cause of action alleged against Korb at all except in relation to one fee in the case of Day v. Cook; but it is nowhere alleged that Korb has ever received any portion of that fee, or that Korb was under any obligation to the plaintiff to account to him for the fee. It is clear that neither Korb nor Warner had any relation to the cause of action against Wells, and neither Wells nor Korb has any relation to the cause of action against Warner. It is enough to say that, as to this demurring defendant is not directly connected with either of the causes of action against Wells or Warner,he is not a proper party to an action to enforce such causes of action, and for that reason the demurrer should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">It follows that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to the plaintiff to amend the complaint within 20 days on payment of costs in this court and in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
