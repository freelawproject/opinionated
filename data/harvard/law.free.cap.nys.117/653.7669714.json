Upon the trial, after proving the rendition of the services, the injury to the personal property, and the furnishing of the board, the plaintiff repeatedly sought to prove, by herself and an independent witness, both of whom were shown competent, the value of the services and of her property destroyed, which was objected to, and the objection sustained. This was error, and requires the reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-19\">It is argued that we are precluded from considering this error for the reason that the record contains no exceptions to the rulings. No exceptions are necessary to give this court jurisdiction to review errors of law committed upon the trial of an action in the Municipal Court. Philips v. Hine, 61 App. Div. 428, 70 N. Y. Supp. 593; McGrath v. Home Insurance Co., 88 App. Div. 153, 84 N. Y. Supp. 374. The cases cited by the learned counsel for the respondent, to sustain his contention, are not applicable to an appeal from the Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-20\">The judgment of the Municipal Court must be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
