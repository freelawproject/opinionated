The contract provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-4\">\u201cShould there be a default in meeting any payment, or note, as it falls due, it is agreed that all the remaining notes shall at once become due and payable, anything in the notes to the contrary notwithstanding. * * * In the event of the refusal to accept said scale when tendered, it is agreed that the sum first above mentioned, i. e., $140, less any previous actual cash payments, shall at once become due and payable as liquidated damages and not as a penalty. * * * It is agreed that the title to the said scale shall not pass until the purchase price or any judgment for the same is paid in full, and shall remain your [plaintiff\u2019s] property until that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">The scale was presented to defendant, who refused to accept the same, and plaintiff sues for $130, being the $140 liquidated damages, as provided in the contract, less $10 actually paid by defendant. The court found for defendant. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Defendant claims that he was induced by false representation to the effect that other people were satisfied with the scale, which was a correct weighing machine, and that defendant\u2019s machine was false, to sign the contract, and that before signing the contract plaintiff\u2019s representative told him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-7\">\u201cIf the scale does not suit you, you need not keep it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Defendant admits he never used the scale, but says he was told by other unnamed people, not called as witnesses, that it was imperfect. This is purely hearsay and vague. Defendant says plaintiff\u2019s agent told him that defendant\u2019s scales were false and exposed him to a criminal prosecution, which representation inspired defendant with fear, and he agreed to take plaintiff\u2019s scale because plaintiff said it was correct. The remarks concerning defendant\u2019s scales were an expression of opinion, rather than a statement of fact, and, in any view, defendant could easily have ascertained the truth of this assertion, as he did <em>-r </em>for defendant afterwards had his own scales tested and they were found to be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">Section 139 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1533, c. 580} provides that no action arising on a written contract of conditional sale of personal property shall be maintained in that court, but that \u201can action may be maintained to recover a sum or sums due and payable for installment, payment or hiring.\u201d In the case at bar there was due the entire amount, less $10 actual payment, under the terms of the contract, because of defendant\u2019s refusal to accept the scale, so that all installments were due. Therefore this action can be maintained to recover such installments.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
