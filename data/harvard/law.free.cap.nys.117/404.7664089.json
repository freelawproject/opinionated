Defendants moved for judgment upon the ground that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and from the order denying said motion they appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">This complaint contains allegations appropriate to three causes of action\u2014breach of contract, negligence, and deceit. The facts alleged do not sufficiently set forth a complete cause of action upon any theory. The motion for judgment should, therefore, have been granted. As the plaintiff may be able to sufficiently allege a good cause of action, the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs, with leave, however, to the plaintiff to serve an amended complaint within 10 day's after the service of the order to be entered hereon, upon payment of the costs of appeal and the costs of the action. If such amended complaint be served and costs paid, the motion for judgment will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Entry of judgment is stayed for 10 days after service of this order. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
