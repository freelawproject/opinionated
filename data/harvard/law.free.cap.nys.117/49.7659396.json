It appeared that he was a native of Sweden, but inquiry has failed to disclose any knowledge of him, his family, or next of kin. Letters of administration were issued to the public administrator, whereupon the Comptroller of the State of New York applied to the surrogate to have an appraisal of the property subject to a transfer tax. The surrogate, after reciting that the property was in the hands of the administrator, and that the next of lcin of the decedent were unknown, and the amount of the taxes unknown, ordered that taxation upon the shares of the persons entitled to share of the decedent\u2019s estate is and the same hereby is suspended until such time as the persons are discovered and ascertained. From that order the Comptroller appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-21\">The Comptroller claims that this property can be collected under the tax law. Laws 1896, p. 795, c. 908, as amended by Laws 1897, p. 150, c. 384, and Laws 1899, p. 100, c. 76. I do not think that this section applies. Upon the death, of the decedent his personal property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>vested in the administrator, and his next of kin were entitled to the property upon proving their relationship to the deceased. No such person has appeared, and no such person has been found to be in existence. There has been no transfer \u201cdependent upon contingencies or conditions whereby they may be wholly or in part created, defeated, extended or abridged.\u201d Matter of Vanderbilt, 172 N. Y. 69, 64 N. E. 782, had relation to a trust estate in which the ultimate beneficiaries were uncertain, and what is said in that case relates to such an estate. The only uncertainty as to the ownership of this property depends upon the fact as to whether the deceased left next of kin. The presumption is that the deceased left next of kin, but there is no presumption that he left a widow or descendants. It is presumed therefore that the property vested in the next of kin of the deceased, and is therefore taxable under section 220 of the tax law (Laws 1896, p. 868, c. 908, as amended by Laws 1908, p. 808, c. 310, \u00a7 1), and, as it does not appear that it is exempt under section 221 of the tax law, the tax imposed by subdivision 6 of section 220 applies, and it is taxable at the rate of 5 per centum.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, and the property of the decedent taxed at the rate of 5 per centum, with $10 costs and disbursements of this.appeal to be paid out of the estate. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
