Plaintiff\u2019s assignor, a merchant, and defendant, a manufacturer of patterns, entered into a contract whereby the former agreed to purchase from the latter certain paper patterns and \u201cto pay for all goods purchased during any month on or before the 15th of the succeeding month,\u201d The latter agreed upon the termination of the contract to take back all patterns plaintiff\u2019s assignor had in stock and pay 100 per cent, of the wholesale price charged for same. The plaintiff\u2019s assignor tendered the goods left on hand on the expiration of the contract ; but these goods were not accepted or paid for by the defendant, because of an alleged breach of the contract on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-15\">Plaintiff\u2019s assignor purchased certain patterns in the month of September, 1908, which were not paid for on or before October 15th, as provided for by the contract, nor since. This breach on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor justified the defendant in refusing to accept the goods- when tendered on October 31st. The right of the plaintiff to obtain the benefits of the contract in question was dependent upon his assignor\u2019s compliance with the prior conditions therein contained. The contract between the parties called for the performance of a condition on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor prior to the time when he could insist upon the acceptance of the patterns. The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>tiff was not entitled to recover until he established the performance of that condition by his assignor or proved a waiver on the part of the defendant. Not having proved either performance or a waiver by defendant, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
