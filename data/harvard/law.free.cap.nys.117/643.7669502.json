It was; shown by the moving papers that the dismissal was without previous notice, and without an opportunity to secure information from defendant\u2019s books as to the amount of compensation due him under the-contract; that the books are now in the possession of the defendant - and that an inspection can be had without serious inconvenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">The defendant did a large business during the time of Etheridge\u2019s employment, and there is no way of showing the amount he was entitled to receive except by recourse to the books. Many of the mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>ters now in dispute will undoubtedly be eliminated by an inspection, and we are of the opinion that the order should have been granted. We think, however, that there is no occasion to take the time plaintiff asks for the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the proceeding remitted to the Special Term, with instructions to make a proper order for the inspection of defendant\u2019s books. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
