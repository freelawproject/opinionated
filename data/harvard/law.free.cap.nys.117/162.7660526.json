At the trial it appeared that the plaintiff delivered the baggage to the defendant at her residence, to be transferred to the Grand Central Station, and received a coupon check for identification marked: \u201cClaim Coupon No. 5,947.\u201d On the reverse side there was the clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-18\">\u201cIt is agreed by the person receiving coupon receipt that he, for himself or as agent of the owner of the article shipped, will limit the value of the same to $25.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-19\">The trial court held that this limitation was binding on the plaintiff. It does not appear that the plaintiff knew of this limitation, or as a reasonable person should be presumed to have examined the coupon to see exactly what was printed upon it. Scofield v.
