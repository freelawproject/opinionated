Defendant appeals from that part of the order which grants judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>The reason alleged for granting the order seems to be that the first defense is insufficient to raise an issue, but that the second defense had merit. A summary judgment should not be given on an answer, tinless the answer as a whole is frivolous, since, if one of the defenses is good, the whole answer is clearly not frivolous. Strong v. Sproul, 53 N. Y. 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">The order is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
