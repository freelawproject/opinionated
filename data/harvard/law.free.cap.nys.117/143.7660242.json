It appears that the committee had no power or authority to borrow this money; but, if we accept the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, the Socialist Labor party received the benefit of the money, and the loan and its purpose were both reported to the national convention. I think that this report gave to the party a knowledge of the transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>tion, and that its silent acquiescence, with such knowledge, in the benefits received, was a sufficient ratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\">Judgment and order appealed from should therefore be affirmed, with costs to the respondent.
