The contract began January 1, 1907, and was for one year. The $40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>per month was paid to and including August, 1908, when defendant refused to continue the contract. Plaintiff\u2019s bill of particulars is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-3\">Balance for work done during the months of January, February,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">March, April, May, June, July, and August, 1908, at $5.83 per month .........................................................$ 43 64</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">To work, labor, and services, and materials furnished, pursuant to contract, during the months of September, October, November, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">December, 1908, at the agreed price of $45.83 per month.......... 183 32</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">To extra work during said period................................. 125 40</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">$352 26</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">The case was tried without a jury, there was a conflict of testimony on several material points, and the court gave judgment for plaintiff in the full amount, from which the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">The evidence showed that a similar contract for $500 had existed between these parties for the year 1906-07, the monthly payments being $35, and for that year defendant paid plaintiff up.to January, 1908, $795, making $395 for extra work. The parties entered upon and continued the performance of the renewal contract for eight months. This contract necessarily was to have been performed within one year, for the reason that it was not made until several days after January 1, 1908, to expire December 31, 1908. Therefore the statute of frauds,-if pleaded, was not a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">Concededly plaintiff was prevented by defendant from doing, and did not, work under this renewal contract after September, 1908. There was no evidence upon which to base his damages for defendant\u2019s said breach, and the $183.33 for that period should not have been allowed. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to the extra work prior to said breach, $135.40, was not successfully controverted; nor did defendant satisfactorily show that plaintiff failed to perform his part of the contract to the time of the breach. Therefore the $43.64 being the balance at the time of about $46 per month up to September, 1908, after deducting the $40 per month paid, is allowable.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">The judgment should be modified, by deducting therefrom the sum of $183.33, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs to either party of this anneal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
