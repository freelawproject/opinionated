On the trial the partnership agreement was received in evidence, and the court thereupon gave judgment for the defendant, \u201cwithout prejudice to a new action in the proper court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-18\">It would seem that by a liberal construction of the oral complaint, \u201cBreach of contract and partnership agreement,\u201d plaintiff might have proved a claim for damages for the breach. No partnership accounting was ever asked or involved. Only one question was put to the plaintiff as to what he did after the agreement was signed, and that was not answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-19\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
