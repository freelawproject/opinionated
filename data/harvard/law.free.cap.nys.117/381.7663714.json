He was the president of a lamplighters\u2019 union, composed of employes of a street lighting company, and the ,gist of the charge against him is that he conspired to assault other employes of the company and prevent them from doing their work. The testimony directly implicating the defendant was given by three members of the union, and the principal ground urged for reversing the judgment is that they were accomplices, and a conviction could not be had upon their uncorroborated testimony. Code Cr. Proc. \u00a7 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-19\">But their testimony is not uncorroborated. Besides, one of these witnesses was not an accomplice in any view. He did not participate in any of the unlawful acts shown. He was a member of the union, attended two of its meetings, and heard what the defendant there said; but that was all. He participated in no act which made him an accomplice in the commission of the crime for which the defendant has been convicted. The defendant had a fair trial, there is an abundance of evidence to sustain the conviction, and no errors were committed which call for the interference of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-20\">The judgment of conviction should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
