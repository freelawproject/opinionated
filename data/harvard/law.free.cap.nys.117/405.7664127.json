The contract was that he should make the tender to the lessor \u201cor his legal representative,\u201d and it was held below that this meant the heirs and not the administrator. This construction seems to have been erroneous. The contract could not have contemplated that the money should be tendered to the heirs for the obvious reason that they would not be entitled to it, but that on the contrary it would be payable to the ad-' ministrator. It certainly was not meant that there should be a tender of the money to persons not entitled to it and who could not receive it. The law will not presume an absurd intention as against a reasonable and obvious one. And that the administrator comes within the phrase legal representative is not to be disputed. The case is the very same as it would be if the phrase \u201cor his legal representative\u201d were not in the contract. The question would be then as now who is entitled to .receive the money, the vendor being dead, for the tender of the money must be made to the person entitled to receive it. If we had to deal with a contract of sale, simpliciter, no one would dispute that there was an equitable conversion \u00f3f the realty into personalty by such -contract, and that the administrator would be the only person entitled to receive the purchase money, for such is the settled rule in this state. Potter v. Ellice, 48 N. Y. 321; McCarty v. Myers, 5 Hun, 83. The contention is that the rule does not apply to this case because of the option. The contrary is fully established in other jurisdictions, and is the general rule, although the 'point' has not arisen in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>this state.

Perf. \u00a7 200. It would seem that the rule should not be changed in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the final award of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
