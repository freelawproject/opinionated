Under the complaint, put in issue by a general denial in the answer, proof was requisite of plaintiff\u2019s proper performance in a workmanlike manner, at least substantial performance, of its undertaking and due discharge of its duty as bailee of the model. Both were asserted by Walter; but searching of his assertions on cross-examination was cut off by the learned trial justice, who, upon the introduction of the pleadings of an action in the Supreme Court regarded as a bar the pendency of another action pending (1) for damages because of alleged breaches on the part of the Walter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>Company in damaging the ceilings and parts of the panels intrusted to it, and (2) for damages because of the careless, unworkmanlike, and unskillful manner in which the plaintiff performed its work and destroyed or permanently injured the models intrusted to it, held that the only question remaining .was the acceptance by the defendant of the work .and material. .\u2018This was'reversible error, since, despite the other action pending, the defendant was entitled to probe the proof offered against him, and to disprove any fact necessary to be established by the plaintiff to authorize a recovery on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
