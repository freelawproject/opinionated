Deen, 74 N. Y. 531, 534)\u2014a rule of law that has been iterated and reiterated by our court of last resort (Thomas v. Scutt, 127 N. Y. 133, 27 N. E. 961; House v. Walch, 144 N. Y. 418, 39 N. E. 327; Murdock v. Gould, 193 N. Y. 369, 86 N. E. 12; Lossing v. Cushman, 88 N. E. 649, decided by the Court of Appeals June 1/ 1909, and reported in: the Law Journal of June 8th), and applicable herein, were this action founded upon the contract of lease; but it does not apply where the original contract, though entire, was oral, but in part reduced, to writing, and so \u201cto be proved by the uncertain testimony of slippery.\" memory\u201d (Chapin v. Dobson, 78 N. Y. 74, 79, 34 Am. Rep. 512).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">The evidence discloses that the defendant appellant executed- and s delivered a lease of the premises to the plaintiff in the latter part of..\" the year 1904, for a term of five years, to commence May 1, 1905&gt; and that the plaintiff paid the rent for the fffst- month; and, according to the testimony adduced by the plaintiff, the defendant, discovering that he could not give possession, went to the plaintiff and <em>saidt</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-8\">\u201cI have given you a lease which I cannot deliver to you. I find that it is a year hence, but not during the time as specified in that lease. Will you do something to relieve me? These people next door w\u00e1nt $5,000 to get out * * . * I will give you the benefit of whatever I can, if you will release * * <em>* </em>i will draw up a new lease, and I will make any alterations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">This was the contract between the parties, and the entire contract \u2014the nromise by the plaintiff to surrender its rights under the -lease. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>of 1905 in consideration of the promise of the defendant to make a new lease to commence May 1, 1906, and to make the alterations the subject of the present claim, of which the making of the lease for 1906 was only a part. Therefore it was not erroneous to admit the evidence, oral or written, of what occurred between the parties antecedent to the execution and exchange of the new lease for 1906; and as the trial justice has found, so let the judgment stand.</p>\n<p id=\"ASt\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
