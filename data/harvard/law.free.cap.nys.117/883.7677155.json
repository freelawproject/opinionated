Nevertheless it is not Susceptible to the criticism that causes of action are improperly united. There is but one cause of action alleged, viz., damages for breach of contract of employment -by wrongful discharge by both defendants from an employment entered inte with both defendants upon a promise by .both defendants to pay for service a stipulated amount per week from the 3d of June, 1908, until the 1st day of March, 1909; the wrongful discharge being alleged to have occurred on the 3d of October, 1908. ' The plaintiff sues for $840, a sum equal to the amount he would have earn\u00e9d for the balance of the period if he had been permitt\u00e9d to perform. No other cause of action can be spelled out of this complaint, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>being alleged that both of the defendants made the contract, and that both .breached it, they are properly made parties defendant in an action to recover damages therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The interlocutory judgment appealed from should be reversed, with costs, -and the demurrer overruled,-with costs to the appellant, and the defendants, upon payment thereof and within 20 days, have leave to withdraw the demurrer and plead over. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
