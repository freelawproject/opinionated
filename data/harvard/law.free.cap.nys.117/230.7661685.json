Miss Sargeant testified that after the assignment she knew the claim no longer belonged to her but accepted the $135 as part of a new understanding. This explanation is irreconcilable with the language of the receipt, to wit, \u201cthe balance due on the sketches.\u201d On cross-examination she was- asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-3\">\u201cThis new understanding was in substitution for any previous understanding, was it not? (Excluded. Exception.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">This was error. The situation in which Miss Sargeant had placed herself entitled defendant to the fullest cross-examination. Much is sought to be made of the correspondence in evidence and notes at interview, but all of it is prior to the receipt dated September 7, 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
