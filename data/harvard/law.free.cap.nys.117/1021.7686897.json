The plaintiff, bringing her household goods; well packed, boxed, and crated, from her Massachusetts residence to her town hous\u00e9, shipped them at Brookline, \u201ca pretty large car load, two tiers,\u201d as said the defendant\u2019s yardman in New York, in the New York Central\u2019s car, whence they were taken to the warehouse in this city of the other defendant, which does not appeal, and thence to her house, where, on the unpacking, they were found badly broken and damaged. The jury\u2019s verdict was for $293 against the storage company and $600 against the New York Central, whose bill of lading for \u201cH. H. Goods, 12,000 (lbs.),\u201d had marked upon it, \u2018\u2018Value restricted to $5.00 per 100 lbs.\u201d The shipment was made up, truly, of parcels large and small, of little size and weight, of large bulk and <em>heavy; </em>but from the description the shipment as a whole, and not as of individual articles, must be deemed as in the mutual contemplation of the parties making and acceding to- the limitations of liability by the hundredweight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-3\">Now it is contended, with citation of cases in states over the Union, mostly horse cases, cases of mules, sheep, jacks, and other live stock affreighted by the head, in Arkansas, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri,-Montana, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas, that the learned trial justice erred by declining substantially to make a new contract for the parties, in refusing to charge that the recovery could be had only on. the basis of the .weight of the separate articles at \"the rate of $5 per 100 pounds, which would have been in derogation of the contract pleaded by the defendant and containing the saving limitation by the hundredweight. It complains, also, that the learned trial justice in effect instructed the jury that a verdict might be found against the defendant for $600, because that in a colloquy the court remarked, to compose counsel\u2019s fears that the verdict might be for more, that it would not allow a judgment against the New York Central for more than $600. To that no exception was taken. The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"A9H\">GILDERSEEEVE, P. J., concurs.
