The action is for negligence. The plaintiff\u2019s story is that he was a passenger on the rear platform of one of the'bridge cars, and that, at the place where the cars let go of the cable, the bumper or platform of the car behind the one he was on overrode the platform upon which he was standing, catching and crushing his foot. The plaintiff testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-19\">\u201cWe came across the bridge until they let go of the cable on this side. The forward cars let go first. The last car hung to it until: it-gave two or three very hard, violent jerks. The last platform crowded over the top of the one that I was on, catching my foot and jamming it, striking it twice real.hard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-20\">The plaintiff\u2019s story .seems improbable, but it cannot be said that it was incredible as a matter of law. If the' accident happened as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>claimed by the plaintiff, the defendant was called upon to explain it. If- it- was impossible, as the defendant now contends, evidence should, have been presented to show that. From our knowledge of the operation of these trains, we cannot say that the accident could not have happened. The truth of the plaintiff\u2019s story was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
