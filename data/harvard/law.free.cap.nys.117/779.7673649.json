The remedy of the defeated party is to appeal from the judgment entered upon the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-16\">This is an action for libel. The defendant is the publisher of a daily newspaper, known as the New York World. The alleged libel consisted in the publication in the issue of that paper on the 10th day of December, 1905, of the following article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-17\">\u201cGreat Names Forged in \u2018Fads and Fancies.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-18\">\u201cFac-Simile Signatures of President Roosevelt, Grover Cleveland and Bishop Potter Employed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-20\">\u201cAll have Denied Any Connection with Book.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-21\">\"Col. Mann Declines to Make Any Explanation of Matter to Reporters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-22\">\u201cWhen Col. Mann, the publisher of Fads and Fancies, sent out solicitors to obtain subscribers at $1,500 upward, he had decided that the book should contain portraits of and reading matter about three distinguished men who were not to be treated as \u2018coons,\u2019 and the following were not asked to pay:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-23\">\u201cPresident Theodore Roosevelt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-24\">\u201cEx-President Grover Cleveland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-25\">\u201cBishop Henry Codman Potter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-26\">\u201cA part of the original scheme was that each subscriber should sign his name in each of about one hundred copies. That plan was given up for variout reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-27\">\u201cThe book as it is now being distributed to subscribers has an index, not alphabetical, giving the name of each person whose fads and fancies are the subject of an article, and opposite his name is a fac-simile of his signature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>\u201cThe obvious purpose is to make it appear that the signatures stand for the subscribers\u2019 satisfaction with the sketches and for a testimony that each signer is a bona fide paid-up member of this syndicate of elegant publicity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-5\">\u201cIn this table of contents appear fac-similes of the signatures of President Roosevelt, Mr. Cleveland and Bishop Potter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The learned counsel for the respondent contends at the outset that the demurrer was properly overruled under the rule that a demurrer searches the record and that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. We are of opinion that this objection is not well taken. The claim made in behalf of the respondent is that the complaint fails to show that the article published charges the plaintiff with the crime of forgery; and in support of that contention it is argued that the forgery charged may have been committed by the board of directors or some officer-of the Town Topics Publishing Company, which, it is alleged in the complaint, was the publisher of \u201cFads and Fancies of Representative Americans,\u201d concerning which the alleged libelous article was published. The difficulty with that contention is that the alleged libelous article charges the fact to be that the plaintiff was the publisher of \u201cFads and Fancies,\u201d and it does not in any manner connect the Town Topics Publishing Company therewith. The headlines of the article published charge that great names were forged in the publication known as \u201cFads and Fancies,\u201d and, since it charges that the plaintiff was the publisher of \u201cFads and Fancies,\u201d the inference would be drawn by a reader of average intelligence that the plaintiff either forged the names or aided and abetted in forging the same, and was therefore guilty of the crime of forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"Apu\">The demurrer is upon the ground that the defense to which it relates is insufficient in law upon the face thereof. This defense is pleaded as a \u201csecond, further and separate defense, and as an absolute defense, and in justification of the alleged libels set forth in the complaint.\u201d The defense then alleges that the alleged libels set.forth in the complaint \u201cwere and are true, and alleges upon information and belief that it was and is true as followsand then a long statement of facts is set forth, many of which are not directly connected with the alleged libelous article and have no direct bearing thereon. It is thus seen that the matter is not pleaded in mitigation, but as a complete justification. The sufficiency of the defense, therefore, is to be tested by the rigorous rule that the justification must be as broad as the charge. If this defense rested with the allegation that the alleged libels were true, it would, of course, withstand the demurrer; but the allegation that the allegations were true is qualified by the statement, in effect, that they were true as therein alleged. The matters therein alleged in this defense show that a literary work or book, entitled \u201cFads and Fancies of Representative Americans,\u201d, commonly known as \u201cFads and Fancies,\u201d to which the libelous article relates, was edited, printed, published, and distributed, not by the plaintiff, but by the Town Topics Publishing Company, a domestic corporation of which he was president. It also contains allegations that, prior to the publication of \u201cFads and Fancies,\u201d a denial by President Roosevelt that he gave his photograph for publication therein, \u201cor that he had ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>indirect 'dealings\u201d with said publication, and-a letter written by 'President Roosevelt to one Mrs. Hampton, stating in substance that he had ndt authorized the use of his photograph, and that he \u201cgave no authorization for either picture or article, and * * * would very much prefer if nothing whatever about\u201d him appeared, and that he hoped nothing would appear, came to the knowledge of the plaintiff; and that \u201cFads and Fancies\u201d was published and delivered to the subscribers thereof with the guilty knowledge on the part of the plaintiff that the index thereto, in which it is charged by defendant that \u2022the names of President Roosevelt, Ex-President Cleveland and Bishop Potter appeared without their knowledge or authority, \u201cwas intended to convey the meaning, and did mean, that each person whose name was in the said list or index was a bona fide paid-up subscriber to the said book, \u2018Fads and Fancies of Representative Americans,\u2019 when, as a matter of fact, there was contained in the said index the names of persons who were not bona fide subscribers, to wit, Theodore Roosevelt, Grover Cleveland, and Henry Codman Potter; that there were contained in the said book also biographical sketches of persons which had not been approved of by the subjects thereof, to wit, Theodore Roosevelt; that the placing in the said list or index of the names and autographs of persons who were not actual and bona fide subscribers to the said book, to wit, the names and autographs of Theodore Roosevelt, Grover Cleveland, and Henry Codman Potter, was done with a guilty knowledge and with a criminal intent, and.with the intent to conceal a crime, and with the intent to defraud\u201d; and that the plaintiff, with a view to obtaining the subscriptions to \"Fads and Fancies\u201d of J. Pierpont Morgan, George Gould, and others, wrote certain letters to them in which he falsely stated, as an inducement to obtain their subscriptions, that President Roosevelt and Ex-President Cleveland were subscribers to said literary publication, and that by means of such false representations he obtained subscriptions from each of them, and on said subscriptions obtained from each of them \u201c$1,500 and upwards,\u201d well knowing that said Roosevelt and Cleveland were not subscribers to \u201cFads and Fancies,\u201d and that the plaintiff, in order to obtain for use in the index of subscribers to \u201cFads and Fancies\u201d the autograph signatures of said Roosevelt, Cleveland, and Potter, \u201cobtained and reproduced such autograph signatures from some other document, book, or writing than a subscription contract for the said book known as \u2018Fads and Fancies,\u2019 \u201d These are the only allegations contained in this defense tending to connect the plaintiff with \u201cFads and Fancies\u201d or with the publication thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">It is quite clear, we think, that the justification is not as broad as the charge. Moreover, we are of opinion that if the allegations of this defense are susceptible of the construction, which we think they are not, that they connect the plaintiff with all of the things therein alleged to have been done with respect to the publication of \u201cFads and Fancies,\u201d either as a principal or .as an accessory, still, the crime of forgery as charged in the alleged libelous article is not shown to have been committed, nor is any crime of forgery shown to have-been committed. ' It is manifest that the alleged libelous article charges par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>ticularly the crime of forging names or signatures, wHich would be forgery in the second degree, as defined in subdivision 2 of section 511 of the Penal Code, in that the names or signatures were forged in the index to the article with the intent to defraud others by inducing them to subscribe and pay subscriptions for \u201cFads and Fancies.\u201d No name or signature was forged. Certain autograph signatures were obtained, according to the allegations in this defense, and used without authority; but they were genuine signatures. Nor would it avail the defendant if the alleged libelous article could be construed as charging the crime of forgery in the third degree, which is defined in subdivision <em>8 </em>of section 514 of the Penal Code, as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-4\">\u201c(3) Who shall alter, or who shall cause, aid, abet, or otherwise connive at, or be a party to the uttering of any letter, telegram, report of other written communication, paper or instrument, purporting to have been written or signed by another person, or any paper purporting to be a copy of any such paper or writing where no original existed, which said letter, telegram, report of other written communication, paper or instrument, \u2022 or paper purporting to be a copy thereof, as aforesaid, the person uttering the same shall know to be false, forged or counterfeited, and by the uttering of which the sentiments, opinions, conduct, character, prospects, interests or rights of such other person shall be misrepresented or otherwise injuriously affected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Assuming, without deciding, that the allegations of the defense in question' are such as connect the plaintiff, either as principal or as accessory, with all the facts therein charged, then the forgery, in the most favorable view to be taken of the facts for the defendant, would consist in \u201cuttering\u201d the publication known as \u201cFads and Fancies,\u201d containing an index purporting to have been signed by the individuals named, whose signatures were used without authority, knowing that the same was false in that the index was not signed by them; for on that view of the case there is no allegation in this defense to the effect that the sentiments, opinions, conduct, character, prospects, interests, or rights of individuals named were either \u201cmisrepresented or otherwise injuriously affected.\" The mere fact that they did not sign the index, and that, their signatures therein were used without their authority, do not show that their sentiments have been misrepresented or injuriously affected. Upon no theory, therefore, is the defense, as pleaded, a complete justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">It follows that the appeal from the decision should be dismissed, and that the interlocutory judgment should be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, but with leave to the defendant to amend its answer upon payment of the costs of this appeal and of the demurrer. \u25a0 All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
