Plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified to the facts, as alleged in the complaint, that the car had come to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>istop, and that it suddenly started before the plaintiff had an opportunity to reach the pavement; and- the defendant\u2019s witnesses testified that the plaintiff attempted to get off the car while it was \"still in motion, though going very slowly. There was evidence to justify the ' jury in finding for the plaintiff; but we are of the opinion'that the trial court erred in refusing the defendant\u2019s request -to charge.</p>\n<p id=\"A-v\">The court in its charge had stated generally the rules in reference to the defendant\u2019s negligence, and- the duty of the plaintiff to establish absence of contributory negligence; but there . was nothing in the charge which called the attention of the jury to the fact that the pleadings alleged that the car had come to a standstill, and that it was started without giving the plaintiff an opportunity to alight in safety; that the only ground of negligence asserted was the starting of the car from a standstill. At the close of the charge counsel for -the defendant asked the court to charge \u201cas it was held in Anderson v. Railroad Company, that if they find that the plaintiff stepped off this car while in motion they must find for the' defendant.\u201d Counsel for plaintiff stated that he consented, if ,the court would charge it this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\u201cThey are to take into consideration whether the car was moving sufficiently to make it dangerous for him to step off. If the car was moving slowly, it would not be negligent to step off the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">To this the court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">\u201cIs that not covered in my charge about his stepping off\u2014rany act for which 'he was to blame, and the accident is caused by that, he is guilty of contributory negligence?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">This clearly left the jury in a position to believe that, if the car was only moving slowly, they might determine whether this constituted contributory negligence, when the only issue of negligence tendered by the pleadings was whether the car stopped, and then started before the plaintiff had a chance to alight. Counsel for defendant stated that he was quoting the Anderson Case, and that it held as he had requested the court to charge. The court asked, \u201cWhat is that again?\u201d and counsel repeated the request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">\u201cIf the plaintiff stepped off the ear while in motion, they cannot find a verdict for the plaintiff, and must find for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">To this the court said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can charge that absolutely,\u2019\u201d and after counsel had noted an exception the court continued, \u201cI will not charge that other than I have charged.\u201d This refusal to charge is error. It disregards the rule that judgments should be rendered in conformity with the allegations and proofs of the parties; secundum allegata et probata being a fundamental rule in the administration of justice. Wright v. Delafield, <em>25 </em>N. Y. 266, 268; Furst v. Zucker, 125 App. Div. 591, 110 N. Y. Supp. 63. In the Wright Case it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\">\u201cParties go to court to try the issues made by the pleadings, and courts have no right impromptu to make new issues for them on the trial, to their surprise or prejudice, or found judgments on grounds not put in issue and distinctly and fairly litigated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqQz\">The only-issue here was whether the car, being stopped to let the .plaintiff alight, was started before he had an opportunity to do so in safety. That was the only ground on which the plaintiff claimed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>right to recover; but by the court\u2019s refusal to charge, and practical acquiescence in the attitude of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, the jury were, permitted to give a verdict if they concluded that the car had not been stopped, but was moving only slowly, which was an issue not tendered; and upon this view the verdict might have been found upon the very evidence which the defendant submitted to defeat the recovery\u2014 to meet the issue tendered by the complaint. Direct authority for this holding may be found in Coleman v. Met. St. R. Co., 82 App. Div. 435, 81 N. Y. Supp. 836, and authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The judgment and order of the Municipal Court should be reversed, and a' new trial ordered; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">BURR and MILLER, JJ\u201e concur.
