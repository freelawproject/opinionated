Short to accept said application.\u201d The contention is that this is insufficient for lack of an allegation that the defendant was notified by the plaintiff of such acceptance, and the court below so held. The complaint is not required to allege the evidence by which the acceptance is to be proved, but only the conclusion of fact that the application was accepted. There could be no acceptance excepting by notice in some way to the defendant, but it does not follow that such notice has to be alleged in the complaint. The method of acceptance is not a matter of pleading but of evidence. It is the office of a pleading to allege the ultimate facts to be established, and not the evidence or facts to establish them. The cases cited to uphold the decision below are not cases of pleading at all, but \u00f3f evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b397-6\">BURR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGy\">I think that the construction of the complaint adopted by the court below was too narrow and technical. Undoubtedly, to maintain the action, it will be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, not only that he found a person able, ready, and willing to make the loan; but that the fact was communicated to the defendant. I think, however, that all this is included in the word \u201caccept.\u201d To accept means to assent to. Webster\u2019s International Dictionary, title \u201cAccept\u201d; Century Dictionary, Id. An assent implies communication of the mental operation, not the concealment of it. A person does not accept an office when he forms the determination in his own mind to enter upon the discharge of its duties, but when he communicates that determination to the appointing power. That the word \u201caccept\u201d was so employed in this pleading is manifest. The complaint alleges the employment of the plaintiff to procure, within four days, an \"acceptance\u201d of defendant\u2019s application for a loan. It would hardly be contended that the word \u201cacceptance\u201d meant procuring some one who formed the determination in his mind that he would make the lpan. It goes further than that. So the subsequent allegation that he did procure one George W. Short to \u201caccept\u201d the application carries with it the same meaning. If upon the trial plaintiff cannot prove that Short\u2019s determination was communicated to the defendant, then he has not'proved an acceptance of the loan. Tor this reason I concur with Mr. Justice GAYNOR, and think the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Interlocutory judgment of the County Court of Queens county reversed, with costs.

The complaint alleges that the defendant employed the plaintiff to procure, within four days, an acceptance of her application for a loan of $650, agreeing to pay him, if successful, a commission of $150; that within the time limited the \"plaintiff procured one George W.\u2018Short-to accept said'application, and the said George W. Short was a person ready, willing, and able to make such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>loan for the time and upon the terms and security hereinbefore alleged in paragraph second\u201d; that no part of such commission had been paid, although demanded. The demurrer is based upon the ground that there is no allegation that the plaintiff ever communicated to, or notified the defendant that he had procured a person ready, able, and willing to consummate the loan. The defendant was entitled to be advised of this fact, and until she was so informed, and given the opportunity to consummate the loan, the plaintiff was not entitled to commissions. Gerding v.
