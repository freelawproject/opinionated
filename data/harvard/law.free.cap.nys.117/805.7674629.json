This may not be said to have been contradicted by \"hearsay admission of such person, later in January, that he was the president of the defendant, which, appearing specially by counsel for the purpose of traversing the return, was entitled to prevail. This is not the forum for discussing whether the statutory method for effecting service upon corporations may be converted into an instrument by which a corporation may evade its creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">Judgment reversed, with costs to the appellant.
