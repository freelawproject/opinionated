The evidence of the only witnesses upon the part of respondent who claim to have any knowledge of the facts is unsatisfactory, and insufficient to predicate a finding that we have had a false and untrue return before us. The deputy- commissioner, before whom the relator was tried, testified that as far as he is able to recall the testimony contained in the return is substantially the evidence that was adduced before him upon the trial. He also states that there was nothing in the evidence taken before him which would warrant the dismissal of the officer, the relator, and that he so informed the defendant. Furthermore, the police commissioner makes no affidavit stating that he ever read any evidence of any sort on which to base his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Under the circumstances, the motion must be denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
