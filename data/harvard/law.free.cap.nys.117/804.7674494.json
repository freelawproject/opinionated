The plaintiff alleges that the assets were less and the liabilities greater, and claims for the deficiency in the one and the excess in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">It appears from the accounts enumerated in the defendant\u2019s bill of particulars that 110 persons were indebted to the company and that 61 persons were creditors of it. It will be necessary, therefore, not merely to compute the summaries of amounts, but also to examine into the correctness of the several accounts. Moreover, it is said in an exhibit, attached to the defendant\u2019s affidavit as the memorandum between the parties, that the relative liabilities depend upon the net difference between the amounts actually collected on the outstandings and the liabilities, which confirms the view that, not only the accounts as they may appear upon a book or books of secondary entry, but also the original entries, will needs be investigated. It is difficult to reconcile even the later cases upon compulsory references. The controversy herein exhibited, however, involving data so numerous that no contemporary save the blind Senator would be expected to carry them in mind, seems to be really within the principles not condemned in any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">The allegation in the answer that on or about the 17th. day of April, 1907, the defendant paid the assignor the sum of $300, which was accepted in full satisfaction and discharge of all damages, hardly presents an issue to be disposed of first and separately, for from a phrase in the same agreement it looks as if this $300 wer\u00e9 merely a part of the transaction upon which the account depends, and not a payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
