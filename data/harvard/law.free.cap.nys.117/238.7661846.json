Co hai rubato lire ottocento.\u2019 That said words meant, and were understood to mean by the persons then present and hearing the same: \u2018You are a thief. You have stolen from us 800 lire.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The demurrer is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">\u201cThe defendants above named, and each of them, demur to the complaint herein on the ground that causes of action have been improperly united, in that the plaintiff has joined in one action several and distinct causes of action against each defendant, alleged to have spoken the slanderous words mentioned in the complaint herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">We think that the demurrer was not well made. The point of the demurrants is that an action for slander can be maintained against but one person. But since the judgment of the Court of Appeals in Green v. Davies, 182 N. Y. 499, 75 N. E. 536, this is not the rule in this state. The learned counsel for the respondents would limit the force of that judgment as a precedent in this case, in that the court in Green\u2019s Case, supra, but \u201cindicates that there is a possibility\u201d for holding several defendants for the slander, provided they procure the utterance, or the utterance was \u201cin pursuance of a common agreement\u201d; whereas, this complaint states that the slanderous words were spoken by each of them, and not by one person, either under procurement or under agreement. Cullen, C. J.,.in Green v. Davies, supra, while disavowing any suggestion that repetition of a slander is part of the original slander, says for the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-11\">\u201cBut if the two slanders were uttered In pursuance of a common agreement between the parties that such slanders should be uttered, then each is jointly liable with the other for their utterance, and separate causes of action for slander may be joined in the same complaint under section 484 of the Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">It is true that in Green\u2019s Case, supra, there was specific allegation of conspiracy; but, as pointed Out in that case (citing authorities), this was not essential. The fact that a slander is spoken by more than one conspirator does not negative the existence of the conspiracy to utter that slander.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">In fine, I think that the plaintiff would be entitled under this complaint to prove that these slanders were uttered in pursuance of a common agreement, within the rule of Green\u2019s Case, supra, and hence that the judgment and the interlocutory judgment must be reversed, with costs, with leave to the defendants to plead on payment of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
