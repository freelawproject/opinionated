It further appears that there was a clear space between the coal hole and the house, which the plaintiff could have used.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-20\">It is obvious that the plaintiff, under the circumstances, has not shown a freedom from contributory negligence; but the plaintiff claims that this was an action, not for negligence, but for nuisance, m that an insecurely fastened coal hole upon the street is unlawful and constitutes a nuisance, and relies upon the case of Berger v. Content, <em>47 </em>Misc. Rep. 390, <em>94 </em>N. Y. Supp. 12. In that case the complaint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>while almost in the same words as the complaint in the case under consideration here, alleges that the defendant \u201cwrongfully and negligently permitted said coal hole to be and continue, and the same then and there was, so badly, insufficiently, and defectively covered and protected that by means thereof the plaintiff\u2019s wife * * * necessarily and without fault or negligence on her part fell into said hole.\u201d The plaintiff in that case, therefore, alleged a wrongful continuous act, which necessarily produced the injury, and therefore comes within the rules announced in the case of Uggla v. Brokaw, 117 App. Div. 586,102 N. Y. Supp. 857, that, where the' facts alleged show a nuisance, a recovery might be had upon that theory, \u201cnotwithstanding the fact that the plaintiff characterizes the failure of the defendant to properly construct -and attach the structure as negligence, and the subsequent maintenance thereof as negligence.\u201d In the case under consideration, however, there are no such allegations, and the case is in no wise to be distinguished from Campion v. Rollwagen, 43 App. Div. 118, 59 N. Y. Supp. 308, where the court held that plaintiff must show an absence of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Even if, however, we should hold that the complaint could be sustained as an action for nuisance, I still think that judgment should have been given for defendant. In the case of Clifford v. Darn, 81 N. Y. 56, where a recovery was sustained by reason of a nuisance arising from the wrongful construction of a coal hole, the court held that the plaintiff need not prove a want of contributory negligence, adding, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">\u201cIf the plaintiff caused the injury himself, as if he voluntarily jumped into the hole, he could not recover; but he was bound to no special care to avoid such an accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">In this case the plaintiff not only failed to use special care, but he voluntarily assumed the risk of stepping on the coal hole, when he had actual notice that it was not in place, and when he had a clear passageway along the sidewalk. Whalen v. Citizens\u2019 Gaslight Co., 151 N. Y. 70, 45 N. E. 363. It seems to me that, when a person voluntarily assumes the risk of injury from a nuisance, he is precluded in any event from a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
