Notwithstanding general statements to the contrary, it was sufficiently shown at the trial that none of the creditors, satisfaction of whose accounts was made in the resolution upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>which the plaintiff\u2019s case depended a condition precedent to the payment of any dividend, had been paid before the beginnnig of this action, and consequently that no cause of action existed at its inception.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
