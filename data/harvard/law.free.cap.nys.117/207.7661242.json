The action is brought pursuant to section <em>42, </em>c. <em>275, </em>p. 583, of the Laws of 1892, and section 151 of the Building Code of the City of New York, to restrain the maintenance of a school in the building in question on the ground that it was altered in violation of section 105 of the Building Code, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">\u201cFireproof Buildings.\u2014Every building hereafter erected or altered, to be used as a hotel, lodging house, school, theater, jail, police station, hospital, asylum, institution for the care or treatment of persons, the height of which exceeds 36 feet 6 inches, excepting all buildings for which specifications and plans have been heretofore submitted to and approved by the department Of buildings, and every other building the height of which exceeds 75 feet, except as herein otherwise provided, shall be built fireproof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">The proof is that the defendant, the owner, filed with the superintendent of buildings on March 13, 1908, an application and plans for the alteration of the building for an office building and stores. The plans were approved and the alterations were made. It was undisputed that, at the time of the filing of the plans, there was no intention -on the part of the owner or the lessee to sublet any part of the building for use as a school. Some time in May, 1908, a lease of the third and fourth floors of the building was made to Mr. Browne for the use of a school, known as \u201cBrowne\u2019s Business College.\u2019\u2019 Of course, desks, \"blackboards, and the like school fixtures were installed; but it does not appear that any substantial changes were made in the building itself, other than as called for by the plans and specifications. It will be noticed that the statute is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">\u201cEvery building hereafter erected or altered, to be used as a * * * school, * * * shall be built fireproof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">The statute does not forbid the use of a building, not fireproof, for a school. Having in good faith made the alterations for the purposes stated in the application (the defendant\u2019s good faith is not questioned), the statute can have no application to the case. Of course, the defendant could not evade the statute by resort to subterfuge; but, as there was no such claim made, it, was error to grant the order. The statute is not to be extended to a case not'fairly within its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">The order should be reversed, and the motion to confirm referee\u2019s report granted, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
