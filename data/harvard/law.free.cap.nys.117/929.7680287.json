F. Percival Hyatt [plaintiff\u2019s assignor], or order, the same from my salary in any manner J. F. Percival Hyatt may deem expedient. I also agree to pay you the same rate of commission on all. subsequent engagements at all Thompson &amp; Dundy\u2019s enterprises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-19\">In March, 1906, the defendant entered into a written contract with Thompson &amp; Dundy for a four years\u2019 engagement, to begin Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>her 4, 1906; but, Thompson &amp; Dundy giving up the Hippodrome in June, he in August made a new contract, upon and for like terms and time, with Shubert &amp; Anderson, who took the Hippodrome some time in July or August, but who, so far as appears, did not in any maimer represent Thompson &amp; Dundy.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">In this action, brought to recover commissions on the subsequent engagement, the plaintiff has recovered a judgment against the defendant, which cannot be sustained. The liability of the defendant for commissions, under the contract with plaintiff\u2019s assignor, upon all subsequent engagements in one of Thompson &amp; Dundy\u2019s enterprises, accrued only upon the moneys accruing from the engagement under the 1906 contract with Thompson &amp; Dundy. It nowhere appearing that Shubert &amp; Anderson succeeded to that contract by or with the assent of the parties, and their contract with the defendant appearing to be new and independent, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
