The evidence is that there was no sale, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>that certain machines were sent to Wanamaker on approval and for purposes of demonstration, and that they were afterwards returned. No liability, therefore, arises under the guaranty as the evidence stood.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
