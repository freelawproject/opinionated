He is entitled to the damages he has sustained by the loss of her society and for the medical expenses. The proof of the medical expenses included proof of payment of $50 to a physician who was called to attend the plaintiff\u2019s wife more than one year after the accident, and his services were not properly connected with the accident. The verdict of $250 should therefore be reduced to $200.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">Judgment modified as indicated, and affirmed as modified, without costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
