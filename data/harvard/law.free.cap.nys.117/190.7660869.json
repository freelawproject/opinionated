She left a son by her first husband as sole heir and next of kin. The son filed an exception that the administrator had failed to account for $3,150 of which the deceased died possessed, and which came into the administrator\u2019s hands. .This was not proved. It was claimed, however, that some sort of a lottery ticket\u2014of what lottery does not appear\u2014was owned by the deceased, that it won at or about the time of her death, and that the administrator collected the money on the ticket after her burial. There is no evidence that she ever purchased the ticket. The wife of the son testified that she saw the deceased purchase lottery tickets at times, but in no way identifies the one in dispute. She also testified that the administrator showed her some money two days after his wife\u2019s burial, had $3,000 in his hands, and put it under her nose and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-16\">\u201cHow would yo\u00fa like to have this? Mother won it on her dying bed. At 5 o\u2019clock she died and at 5 o\u2019clock we got it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-17\">This appears none too probable, and is inconsistent with the idea that the husband wanted to conceal that it was his wife\u2019s and keep it. On the other hand the husband testified that he was a regular buyer of lottery tickets of an old man who called at his house regularly to sell them\u2014for such is the covert way in which that illegal business is extensively carried on\u2014and purchased the one in question. In this he is corroborated. There is evidence that when the wife purchased tickets of this same man it was for her husband, and that her husband\u2019s name was given. It cannot be said with any degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>certainty that the ticket belonged to the deceased instead of to her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The decree should be modified in accordance with this opinion, and as thus modified affirmed, with costs to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
