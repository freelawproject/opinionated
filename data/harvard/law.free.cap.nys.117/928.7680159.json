She was awarded $100. It would seem that, if her evidence was credible enough to entitle her to any compensation for her pain and disability, it entitled her to more.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-18\">The order denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion to set aside and vacate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>judgment must be reversed, the judgment vacated, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">GILDERSLEEVE, P.
