The pleadings admit the routes of the two roads. The accident occurred through a collision of cars on each road. There is no dispute as to plaintiff's injuries. The court dismissed the complaint \u201cfor failure of proof of negligence.\u201d On the pleadings and evidence plaintiff made out a prima facie case, at least sufficient to put defendants to some proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event, with leave to appeal to the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-14\">LEHMAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b126-15\">SEABURY, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AL\">To sustain the judgment about to be rendered it is necessary to hold that the doctrine of \u201cres ipsa loquitur\u201d is .applicable to this case. I do not think that this doctrine is applicable to this case, and I therefore dissent. Elliott v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 127 App. Div. 300, 111 N. Y. Supp. 358.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
