The answer is a general denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-18\">The uncontradicted evidence of an intimate friend of the deceased, who was a disinterested witness, called for plaintiff, shows that deceased bought a number of articles from plaintiff, of considerable value, and promised to pay therefor; also plaintiff himself showed sales of goods to deceased that were unpaid. No evidence was introduced by defendant. This friend of the deceased gives evidence of what she heard in the presence of both deceased and plaintiff regarding the transactions and admissions of the deceased, which certainly seem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>strong enough to make out a prima facie cas\u00e9. We think the judgment is against the evidence, and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
