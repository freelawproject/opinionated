The pot was placed there by the cook, and the piece of fat fell on the floor through the carelessness of the cook in cutting meat. The cook seems to have had no control over plaintiff, and not to have been a superintendent representing the defendant, so far as plaintiff was concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-21\">It will be remembered that this action is brought under the employer\u2019s liability act (Raws 1902, p. 1748, c. 600), and, in order to hold the master liable under the act, it must be shown, not only that the negligence was that of one exercising superintendence, but that he was engaged in an act of superintendence at the time. Falk v. Havemeyer, 123 App. Div. 657, 108 N. Y. Supp. 140; Droge v. Robins Co., 123 App. Div. 537, 108 N. Y. Supp. 457; Quinlan v. Lackawanna Steel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>Co., 107 App. Div. 176, 94 N. Y. Supp. 942; affirmed 191 N. Y. 329, 84 N. E. 73; Williams v. Steamboat Co., 122 App. Div. 188, 106 N. Y. Supp. 975; Bellegarde v. Bag Co., 90 App. Div. 577, 86 N. Y. Supp. 72. The evidence does not warrant a conclusion that the accident happened through the negligence of defendant in failing to provide a safe place for plaintiff to work in. The case seems to have been tried upon the theory that the piece of fat was the proximate cause of the accident. The evidence does not show that in the absence of the piece of fat the condition of the passageway was unsafe or dangerous. The accident evidently happened through the personal and individual carelessness of the cook. Whether aided or not by negligence on plaintiff\u2019s part is not necessary here to determine. Defendant was not an insurer of plaintiff\u2019s safety, but he merely owed the duty of guarding against such dangers as would seem to a reasonably prudent man likely to occur under ordinary circumstances. Kirwan v. Am. Litho. Co., 124 App. Div. 180, 108 N. Y. Supp. 805; King v. Reid, 124 App. Div. 121, 124, 108 N. Y. Supp. 615; Glens Falls P. C. Co. v. Travelers\u2019 Ins. Co., 162 N. Y. 399, 403, 56 N. E. 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
