Preliminarily, however, we must decide whether the existence of an employment relationship was properly treated by the trial court as a legal, rather than factual, issue. We conclude that the question of relation was a matter of law for the trial court to decide, and affirm that court\u2019s determination that the worker was an employee of the utilizing company.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The facts of this case are undisputed and may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Bay Services, Inc. (Bay), is a temporary help agency in the business of supplying unskilled labor to various industrial customers. When a client requests a Bay worker, Bay selects an employee from among its available labor pool and assigns the worker to the job. The client is then free to utilize and direct the employee as the particular situation demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">The client records the number of hours worked by the employee and is billed accordingly. Bay pays the worker a designated wage and maintains workmen\u2019s compensation insurance to cover any unforeseen mishaps. Bay also pays unemployment insurance assessments for its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>All temporary workers are interviewed and hired by Bay. Bay reserves the right to fire the employee if performance on the assigned job is unsatisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">On February 18, 1981, Safway Steel Products, Inc. (Safway), contacted Bay and requested two temporary help workers. Bay selected Whitehead and another worker and assigned them to the job. The men reported to Safway and were directed by it to perform several menial tasks. The first day passed without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The men returned to Safway the next day and resumed their duties. Whitehead was given the task of loading steel scaffolding onto a trailer. While Whitehead was thus engaged, a bundle of scaffolding fell on him and caused serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Whitehead filed for, and received, workmen\u2019s compensation benefits through Bay for his injury. He also instituted a negligence suit against Safway for the same occurrence. A jury trial was elected and trial commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, Safway moved for a directed verdict, claiming that Whitehead was its employee and that his exclusive remedy was under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws. The court (Bothe, J.) denied the motion and the case was submitted to the jury without the defense presenting evidence. After deliberation, the jury determined that Whitehead was not an employee of Safway and that the latter was negligent in the operation of its plant. The panel awarded damages to Whitehead.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Safway\u2019s subsequent motion for judgment n.o.v. was granted by the trial court. According to Judge Bothe, the uncontradicted evidence demonstrated that Safway controlled Whitehead\u2019s work. This meant that Whitehead was an employee of Safway and that his only remedy for the occupational injury was through the workmen\u2019s compensation laws. Whitehead\u2019s negligence action was thereby dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">Whitehead appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Prior to consideration by that court, we granted certiorari <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>on our own motion to resolve these issues of public importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">We must first consider whether the existence of an employer/employee relationship between Safway and Whitehead was properly treated as a legal matter, capable of resolution by judgment n.o.v. Armed with authority, the parties present two competing views on this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Safway contends, as it successfully did below, that when the evidence in a labor case is undisputed, the question of relation between the parties becomes one of law for the court to decide. In Safway\u2019s opinion, it is only where (1) the evidence is disputed, <em>and </em>(2) different inferences can be drawn from the evidence, that the existence of an employer/employee relationship should be determined by the fact-finder. Safway argues that, in the instant case, all of the facts were presented by Whitehead, and the defense rested without calling a witness; thus all remaining issues concerning the employment relationship were legal matters properly resolved by judgment n.o.v. As authority for this proposition, Safway cites <em>Tavel v. Bechtel Corporation, </em>242 Md. 299, 303, 219 A.2d 43, 45 (1966), where it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEi\">\u201c[wjhere the terms and manner of employment are disputed <em>and </em>different inferences may be drawn therefrom, the issue is a mixed question of law and fact, to be determined by the trier of the facts, under proper instructions, <em>but where the essential terms and manner of employment are undisputed, the question is one of law for the court\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Whitehead admits that the evidence is uncontested. Contrary to the approach espoused by Safway, however, Whitehead asserts that a jury must determine the question of relation whenever (1) the evidence is disputed, <em>or </em>(2) differing inferences can be drawn from the facts adduced at trial. Taking this argument to its logical conclusion, a factfinder would decide the employment relation any time the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>disagreed as to the inferences which could be made from the presented evidence. Whitehead reasons further that the fact that the jury decided against Safway proves that differing inferences from the submitted evidence were possible. Precedent for Whitehead\u2019s position is derived from <em>L. &amp; S. Construction Co. v. State Accident Fund, </em>221 Md. 51, 59, 155 A.2d 653, 657-58 (1959), where we said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-_\">\u201con appeal from the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission ... where the facts or inferences therefrom, or both, are in dispute, such questions [e.g., relation of parties] are to be determined by the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In order to resolve this apparent conflict between the two cases cited by the parties, and ascertain the precise role of the judge and jury in deciding employment issues, we examine initially our past decisions in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In our first consideration of the proper role of judge and jury in employment cases, we admitted that the greatest difficulty in these cases is in determining, upon the facts, who is to be regarded as the master of a particular worker. <em>Deford v. State, Use of Keyser, </em>30 Md. 179, 203 (1869). To leave trial courts with some guidance, we stated as a general rule that a jury should determine, as matters of fact, terms and manner of employment; \u201cit being for the court to declare the legal relation that existed between the parties, <em>upon any given state of facts.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied) <em>Id. </em>at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Several decades later, in <em>Sacker v. Waddell, </em>98 Md. 43, 56 A. 399 (1903), we again acknowledged that whether a worker was acting as a servant \u201cfrequently depends upon such a variety of facts that it falls outside of any definite rule and for that reason becomes, under proper instructions, a question of fact for the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 56 A. at 401. Where the facts make it doubtful that the relation of master/servant existed on a particular occasion, a jury should determine the question. <em>Id. </em>However, upon any given state of facts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>or upon clear facts, the legal relation that existed between the parties must be decided by the court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Later cases of the Court further clarified the occasions when a jury, or a court, should decide employment issues. A court, we said, should not determine whether an incident arose out of and in the course of employment if there is a need to decide between opposing witnesses. <em>Jewel Tea Co. v. Weber, </em>132 Md. 178, 182, 103 A. 476, 477 (1918). We also stated \u201cno action of the Court should control the exercise of their [the jury\u2019s] admitted right to weigh the credibility of evidence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Western Md. R. Co. v. Kehoe, </em>86 Md. 43, 54, 37 A. 799, 801 (1897). Furthermore, situations could exist where uncontradicted evidence in a labor case arguably yields differing inferences so as to require jury determination of substantive issues, <em>see Todd v. Easton Furniture Co., </em>147 Md. 352, 356, 128 A. 42, 43-44 (1925) (uncontradicted evidence may have permitted jury to determine injury occurred during course of employment, contrary to trial court\u2019s legal conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Nevertheless, we continued to authorize courts to decide ordinarily factual matters as legal issues where the evidence on the point was undisputed. This principle was first utilized in <em>Harrison v. Central Con. Co., </em>135 Md. 170, 108 A. 874 (1919), where we determined that a certain injury to a laborer occurred, as a matter of law, in the course of his employment. The determination of this particular issue had been accomplished previously by factfinders. <em>See Jewel Tea, supra, </em>132 Md. at 182, 103 A. at 477. We justified this conclusion as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>135 Md. at 180, 108 A. at 878. Subsequent decisions of the Court adhered to this rule. <em>See, e.g., Bogatsky v. Swerdlin, </em>152 Md. 18, 22, 135 A. 416, 418 (1926), citing <em>Todd, supra </em>(\u201cif the facts are conceded or undisputed, there is no issue of fact to be submitted to the jury\u201d); <em>Barnes v. Myers, </em>163 Md. 206, 208-09, 161 A. 279, 280 (1932) (as a matter of law, on admitted evidence, worker was an independent contractor and not an employee); <em>Beyer v. Decker, </em>159 Md. 289, 291, 150 A. 804, 805 (1930) (as matter of law, on undisputed facts, employee not within coverage of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act). <em>Accord, Baltimore Trans. Co. v. State, </em>184 Md. 250, 265, 40 A.2d 678, 685 (1945) (whether or not the circumstances of a given case are legally sufficient to overcome the presumption that an employee lent to another with a vehicle continues to be the servant of his master is ordinarily a question for the jury, \u201cbut where the rebutting testimony is uncontradicted it becomes one for the court to determine as a matter of law\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\u201c[t]he question as to whether the injury occurred out of or in the course of employment is ordinarily, like negligence or want of probable cause, a mixed question of law and fact; <em>but when the facts have been ascertained and agreed upon by the parties, or are undisputed and there is no dispute as to the inferences to be drawn from the facts, the question becomes one of law and may be decided by the Court.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Against this lengthy historical background emerged the language in <em>Tavel </em>(question of law where facts undisputed) and <em>L. &amp; S. Construction </em>(question of law where facts or inferences undisputed). The two standards have appeared interchangeably in opinions other than those already cited, including, for the <em>Tavel </em>standard, <em>Thompson v. Paul C. Thompson &amp; Sons, </em>258 Md. 391, 394-95, 265 A.2d 915, 917 (1970); <em>Lupton v. McDonald, </em>241 Md. 446, 450, 217 A.2d 262, 264 (1966); <em>Clayburn v. Soueid, </em>239 Md. 331, 337, 211 A.2d 728, 731 (1965); <em>Sun Cab Co. v. Powell, </em>196 Md. 572, 582, 77 A.2d 783, 787 (1951); <em>Williams Construction Co. v. Bohlen, </em>189 Md. 576, 579-80, 56 A.2d 694, 695 (1948). The test espoused in <em>L. &amp; S. Construction </em>appears in <em>Marine v. Service Trucking Co., 225 </em>Md. 315, 319, 170 A.2d 188, 190 (1961); <em>Greer Lines Co. v. Roberts, </em>216 Md. 69, 80, 139 A.2d 235, 240 (1958); <em>Globe Indemnity Co. v. Victill Corp., </em>208 Md. 573, 585, 119 A.2d 423, 429 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The most recent pronouncement which defines legal and factual issues is found in <em>Mackall v. Zayre Corp., </em>293 Md. 221, 443 A.2d 98 (1982). In the case, we state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u201c[i]f there is evidence to support an inference that more than one individual or company controls or directs a person in the performance of a given function, the question whether an employer-employee relationship exists is a question of fact to be determined by a jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 230, 443 A.2d at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">With the historical review behind us, we now turn to the proper rule for distinguishing questions of law from matters of fact in the employment field. First, the decisions of this Court make clear that whenever evidence in a labor case is disputed, <em>and </em>differing inferences from the evidence are possible, a jury must determine the underlying employment issues. Both of the cases which the parties cite for our perusal support this point. <em>See Tavel, supra, </em>242 Md. at 303, 219 A.2d at 45; <em>L. &amp; S. Construction, </em>221 Md. at 59, 155 A.2d at 657-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Second, where the evidence on an issue is uncontradicted, ordinarily a court may decide the issue as one of law. <em>Tavel, supra, </em>and cases cited therein; <em>Bogatsky, supra, </em>152 Md. at 22, 135 A.2d at 418; <em>Deford, supra, </em>30 Md. at 204. While the trial court should take some pains to ensure that conflicting inferences are not possible on the presented evidence, <em>see Todd, supra, </em>147 Md. at 356, 128 A.2d at 43-44, something more than conjecture of a party is necessary to establish that \u201cconflicting inferences\u201d are possible in a given case. At the very least, a party must point to <em>evidence </em>in the case that control of a given function is vested in more than one person. <em>Mackall, supra, </em>293 Md. at 230, 443 A.2d at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">In the present case, Whitehead concedes that all control of specific tasks while he was at Safway belonged entirely to Safway. This significant fact rendered the employment issue proper for judgment n.o.v., and renders his unsupported claim of \u201cconflicting inferences\u201d a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The apparent conflict between the language employed in the <em>Tavel </em>and <em>L. &amp; S. Construction </em>line of cases similarly fails to provide any support for Whitehead\u2019s position recited earlier in this opinion. The frequency with which the two tests have been interchangeably used, and the long-standing policy of this Court to reserve for the trial court the determination of employment issues in undisputed cases, convinces us that the two lines of cases were merely slightly divergent roads to the same Mecca.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">The decisions reached in the <em>L. &amp; S. Construction </em>line of cases proves this last point. Under Whitehead\u2019s reading of the case, a factfinder would always decide employment issues since, as between the parties, the inferences possible in a case are invariably contested (otherwise, trial would not be necessary to resolve the dispute.) Nevertheless, when this Court has employed the <em>L. &amp; S. Construction test, </em>we have not hesitated to rule, as a matter of law, upon the employment issue. <em>See, e.g., Globe Indemnity, supra </em>(employer-employee relationship); <em>Greer Lines Co., supra </em>(employer-employee relationship).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">It follows that Judge Bothe properly treated the question of relation as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">It remains to be determined whether Judge Bothe correctly decided that as a legal matter, Whitehead was an employee of Safway. This Court has traditionally considered five criteria in determining whether or not an employer/employee relationship exists between two parties. These criteria, developed from the common law standard for determining the master/servant relationship, <em>see Sun Cab, supra, </em>196 Md. at 577, 77 A.2d at 784-85, include (1) the power to select and hire the employee, (2) the payment of wages, (3) the power to discharge, (4) the power to control the employee\u2019s conduct, and (5) whether the work is part of the regular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>business of the employer, <em>Mackall v. Zayre Corp., supra, </em>293 Md. at 230, 443 A.2d at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Of the five factors, the factor of control stands out as the most important. We have said, for example, that whether the employer \u201chas the right to control and direct the employee in the performance of the work and in the manner in which the work is to be done\u201d is the \u201cdecisive,\u201d <em>Mackall, supra, </em>293 Md. at 230, 443 A.2d at 103, or \u201ccontrolling\u201d test, <em>L. &amp; S. Construction, supra, </em>221 Md. at 57, 155 A.2d at 656; <em>Keitz v. National Paving Co., </em>214 Md. 479, 491, 134 A.2d 296, 301 (1957). We have also recognized, in speaking to the interrelationship of the factors, that <em>\u201cstanding alone, </em>none of these indicia, <em>excepting ()) </em>[the factor of control], seems controlling in the determination as to whether such a relationship exists.\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Keitz, supra, </em>214 Md. at 491, 134 A.2d at 301; <em>L. &amp; S. Construction, supra, </em>221 Md. at 57, 155 A.2d at 656. Thus, for our purposes, \u201cdecisive,\u201d besides \u201ccontrolling,\u201d means \u201cconclusive,\u201d \u201cdeterminative,\u201d and \u201cdefinitive.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Collegiage Dictionary (Copyright 1974). This view is consistent with that expressed in other jurisdictions, where control has been variously described as \u201cthe most vital factor,\u201d <em>Brinkley Heavy Hauling Co. v. Youngman, </em>223 Ark. 74, 264 S.W.2d 409, 411 (1954), \u201cthe most important factor,\u201d <em>Crepps v. Industrial Commission, </em>402 Ill. 606, 614, 85 N.E.2d 5, 9 (1949), \u201cthe most significant factor in all cases,\u201d <em>Carlson v. Industrial Commission, </em>213 Cal. 287, 2 P.2d 151, 153 (1931), <em>cert. denied, </em>284 U.S. 681, 52 S.Ct. 199, 76 L.Ed. 575 (1932), \u201cthe most stressed element,\u201d <em>Piantanida v. Bennett, </em>17 N.J. 291, 111 A.2d 412, 414 (1955), \u201cthe final test,\u201d <em>Hinds v. Dept. of Labor &amp; Industries of State of Washington, </em>150 Wash. 230, 272 P. 734, 735 (1928), and \u201cthe crucial test,\u201d <em>Jay Lines, Inc. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>66 Pa.Comwlth 299, 443 A.2d 1370, 1372 (1982), when determining whether the employer/employee relationship exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>We believe that the control exercised by Safway over Whitehead clearly establishes an employer/employee relationship. Safway instructed Whitehead on the task to be performed, supervised his work, and was free to reassign him to any other duties that warranted attention. If Whitehead\u2019s work was unsatisfactory, Safway was free to dismiss him and request an additional worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Moreover, the amount Safway was billed by Bay for its use of the temporary worker was greater than what Bay paid Whitehead. This extra cost doubtlessly helped cover, besides Bay\u2019s profit margin, such expenses as Bay\u2019s payment of Whitehead\u2019s unemployment and workmen\u2019s compensation insurance. In other words, Safway actually contributed to the insurance protection of one of its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Of course, the fact that Whitehead was admittedly the employee of Bay at the precise time he worked for Safway does not alter this conclusion. A worker may simultaneously be the employee of two employers. <em>Mackall, supra, </em>293 Md. at 229, 443 A.2d at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">While this Court has not previously determined that temporary services workers are employees of the company to which they are sent, other jurisdictions have considered the issue. They are generally in accord with our holding that temporaries such as Whitehead, who work in employment circumstances similar to the one here present, are as a matter of law, employees of the customer. <em>See, e.g., Simmons v. Atlas Vac Machine Co., </em>493 F.Supp. 1082 (E.D. Wisc. 1980) (temporary worker may not sue employer to which he is assigned for negligence because of employer-employee relationship); <em>Rumsey v. Eastern Distribution, Inc., </em>445 So.2d 1085 (Fla.App.1984) (temporary services worker injured while on assignment to Eastern not entitled to sue appellee in tort; Rumsey was an employee of Eastern and his exclusive remedy was under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws); <em>Hoffman v. National Machine Co., </em>113 Mich.App. 66, 317 N.W.2d 289 (1982) (employee of labor broker also an employee of company to which he is tempo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>rarily sent; tort suit prohibited due to employment relationship and existence of workmen\u2019s compensation legislation); <em>Fox v. Contract Beverage Packers, Inc., </em>398 N.E.2d 709 (Ind.App.1980) (employer of Manpower temporary worker immune from negligence suit because of employer-employee relationship and workmen\u2019s compensation laws); <em>Danek v. Meldrum Mfg. &amp; Engineering Co., </em>312 Minn. 404, 252 N.W.2d 255 (1977) (Labor Pool employee also an employee of Labor Pool customer; workmen\u2019s compensation provides sole remedy for injured worker); <em>English v. Lehigh County Authority, </em>286 Pa.Super. 312, 428 A.2d 1343 (1981) (employer-employee relationship existed between Kelly Labor Services employee and company to which worker is assigned). <em>See generally, </em>1C Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>(1982 Ed.), \u00a7 48.23.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Whitehead suggests that the control exercised by Safway is no greater than the control displayed by the alleged employer in <em>L. &amp; S. Construction, supra. </em>In that case, a tractor and an operator for the tractor were sent by the L. &amp; S. Construction Company to the Weygant Engineering and Construction Company (Weygant) to temporarily assist the latter in an earth moving assignment. Weygant informed the operator as to which tasks needed his attention and had the right to remove him from the job at any time. 221 Md. at 55-56, 155 A.2d at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">We ruled that on this evidence, we could not agree with L. &amp; S. that, as a matter of law, the worker was an employee of Weygant. <em>Id. </em>at 60, 155 A.2d at 658. We explained in our holding that \u201ccontrol over details as to what work is to be done and the way in which it is to be done ..., will not of itself cause the employee to become the servant of the person to whom he is sent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59, 155 A.2d at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Whitehead utilizes this language to argue that Safway\u2019s simple control over the details of his work does not establish that, as a matter of law, he was \u201ccontrolled\u201d by Safway so as to make him the employee of Safway. This reasoning is flawed for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">First, control over the details of work which was insufficient to prove an employer-employee relationship in <em>L. &amp; S. Construction </em>is far different than the amount of control exercised by Safway. Weygant was only concerned with moving dirt and packing it to form a road. Weygant could only point to what was to be done; it had no right to order the employee to change his manner of operation or remove the tractor from the job. <em>Id. </em>at 60-61, 155 A.2d at 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In the instant case, Safway had the right to instruct Whitehead on the tasks to be performed, had the power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>reassign him to a different job within the plant, and supervised and directed his actions and rate of work. Safway could have discharged the employee from its premises if Whitehead\u2019s work was unsatisfactory. The control over Whitehead by Safway was thus far greater than what was present in <em>L. &amp; S. Construction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Second, as we recognized in <em>Keitz v. National Paving Co., supra, </em>in cases where a servant is lent to another with the personal property of the original master, there is a presumption that the employee remains the servant of his general employer. 214 Md. at 490-91, 134 A.2d at 301. No such presumption exists in the temporary services cases, where the worker is assigned and directed to perform any number of unspecified tasks for his special employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Additionally, as we acknowledged in <em>L. &amp; S. Construction, </em>the power to hire or discharge a worker can be vested in one person and the power of control in another, and that in such a case the person having the power of control is the master. <em>Id. </em>at 56, 155 A.2d at 656. Such is the case at hand: Bay had the actual authority to hire and fire Whitehead, but Safway retained the power to control Whitehead while he was in its employ.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Finally, as we recognized in <em>Mackall, supra, </em>the correct test for determining questions of law is whether there is conflicting inferences, from the evidence, on the issue of control \u201cin the performance of a given function.\u201d 293 Md. at 230, 443 A.2d at 103. There is no dispute, in the given case, as to this decisive element. Insofar as the language quoted in <em>L. &amp; S. Construction </em>conflicts with this precept, the earlier case is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">An analysis that is perhaps more helpful than the traditional common law test in identifying the relationship that existed between Safway and Whitehead is provided by the \u201clent employee\u201d or \u201cdual employment\u201d doctrine. <em>See Thompson, supra, </em>258 Md. at 395, 265 A.2d at 918. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>doctrine, which specifically envisions situations identical to the one at bar, is set forth in 1C Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 48.00, and consists of a three-prong test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-4\">\u201cWhen a general employer lends an employee to a special employer, the special employer becomes liable for workmen\u2019s compensation only if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">(a) the employee has made a contract of hire, express or implied, with the special employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">(b) the work being done is essentially that of the special employer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">(c) the special employer has the right to control the details of the work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">When all three of the above conditions are satisfied in relation to both employers, both employers are liable for workmen\u2019s compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\"><em>William J. Burns Int\u2019l v. Ferris, </em>16 Md.App. 568, 578-79, 299 A.2d 487, 492-93 (1973). Cf. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>258 Md. at 395, 265 A.2d at 918.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This analysis has proven particularly helpful in jurisdictions other than our own which have considered whether an employee of a labor broker is also an employee of the customer. <em>See, e.g., Eaddy v. A.J. Metler Hauling &amp; Rigging Co., </em>325 S.E.2d 581, 582-83 (S.C.App.1985); <em>Rumsey v. Eastern Distribution, supra, </em>445 So.2d at 1086; <em>Danek v. Meldrum Manufacturing &amp; Engineering, supra, </em>312 Minn, at 408-09, 252 N.W.2d at 258-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">Applying the lent employee test to the facts of this case, we again conclude that Whitehead was an employee of Safway. Part (a) of the test, whether an express or implied contract of hire existed between the parties, is satisfied if the employee consents to the special employment relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>ship. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>258 Md. at 395, 265 A.2d at 918; <em>Rumsey, supra, </em>445 So.2d at 1086; <em>Danek, supra, </em>312 Minn, at 408-09, 252 N.W.2d at 259. <em>See generally, </em>Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 48.10. The element of consent is especially critical in workmen\u2019s compensation cases because of the relinquishment, by the employee, of his right to sue his special employer in tort. Larson, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 48.10. Of course, in exchange for the right to sue, the employee gains all of the traditional benefits associated with coverage under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws. <em>See generally, Stanley v. Western Maryland Ry. Co., </em>301 Md. 204, 207-08, 482 A.2d 881, 882-83 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">There can be little doubt in the instant case that Whitehead consented to work for Safway. The contract between Whitehead and Bay specifically informed the worker that he would be assigned to client locations. Before accepting assignment, Whitehead was apprised of the customer\u2019s name and address and the nature of the work. Whitehead could decline assignment, if he chose, without fear of reprisal. Whitehead voluntarily reported, on two separate occasions, to the Safway plant, and submitted to the special employer\u2019s direction and control. All of these factors satisfy element (a). <em>See Danek, supra, </em>312 Minn, at 308-09, 252 N.W.2d at 259-60, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Elements (b) and (c) are satisfied and need not be discussed at any length. Element (b) is met because the tasks performed by Whitehead at Safway were exclusively that of the special employer. Element (c), control over the details of work, was conceded from the outset by Whitehead.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Since all of the conditions of the test are satisfied, the determination of the trial court has again proven correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Whitehead lastly directs us to the interrogatories sent to Safway which ordered the company to furnish the names of all employees. In its answers, Safway did not include Whitehead. Whitehead maintains that this oversight dem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>onstrates Safway\u2019s subjective belief that he was not the company\u2019s employee, and must lead to an appropriate ruling by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">The parties\u2019 subjective belief as to whether an employment relationship exists is not dispositive of the legal question of whether one is the employer of another, \u201cexcept as such belief indicates an assumption of control by the one and submission to control by the other.\u201d <em>Sun Cab, supra, </em>196 Md. at 580, 77 A.2d at 786. Here, the inescapable conclusion is that Whitehead voluntarily submitted to Safway\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">For these reasons we conclude that the judgment of the lower court should be</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-4\">. Larson identifies several cases where the customer of a labor broker was held <em>not </em>liable for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. See <em>Id. </em>at notes 65.1, 66.1. These cases did not involve the issue <em>sub curia </em>(whether a worker is an employee of the customer), and are hence easily distinguishable. For example, in <em>Smith v. Kelly Labor Services, </em>239 So.2d 685 (La.App.1970), the court held that the customer did not have to contribute to a workmen\u2019s compensation award given to an employee injured on the customer\u2019s premises. The court had no difficulty concluding that the customer was a special employer and Kelly a general employer. <em>Id. </em>at 688. Nevertheless, the customer did not have to contribute to the award since Kelly had contracted to hold the customer harmless in the event of injury to the worker. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">In <em>Williams v. Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc., </em>236 So.2d 524 (La.App.1970), the sole issue before the court was whether the labor broker was an employer of a worker injured at the site owned by the customer. It was conceded that the worker was an employee of the customer. <em>Id. </em>at 526. The court ruled that Williams was an employee of Atlantic, the general employer. <em>Id. </em>at 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The court in <em>Levinson v. Payson, 73 </em>Mich.App. 655, 252 N.W.2d 567 (1977) was unable to conclude whether, as a matter of law, the temporary services customer was an \"employer under the [state] Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act.\u201d 252 N.W.2d at 568. The court readily agreed that the customer, Payson, was an \u201cemployer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The case was remanded, however, for the lower court to determine whether the additional express statutory requirements under the State Act were met. <em>Id. </em>at 568-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Similarly, in <em>White v. Extra Labor Power of America, </em>54 Mich.App. 370, 221 N.W.2d 214 (1974), the court pronounced it \"beyond dispute\u201d that an injured worker was an employee of both the temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>services agency and the company to which the worker was provisionally sent. 221 N.W.2d at 216. The latter did not have to pay state workers\u2019 compensation, however, since only Extra Labor paid the worker\u2019s wages. <em>Id. </em>at 216-17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b137-11\"><em>. </em>The <em>Thompson </em>Court, despite its reliance on 1A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, inadvertently described the test for lent employees as \u201cthe consent of the employee, which may be expressed or implied; the right to control and direct the worker; <em>and the responsibility for the payment of wages, which must be considered but is not necessarily determinative.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied) <em>Id. </em>at 395, 265 A.2d at 918.

The Court has not previously perceived any divergence in Maryland case law regarding the test to be applied in deciding whether an issue is a legal or factual one, and I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>perceive no such divergence. In <em>Talley v. Dept. of Correction, </em>230 Md. 22, 28-29, 185 A.2d 352 (1962), a case dealing with whether a Workmen\u2019s Compensation claimant had suffered a compensable injury, the Court set forth the applicable standard as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">\u201c[WJhere the facts are conceded, undisputed, or uncontroverted, and the inferences to be drawn therefrom are plain, definite and undisputed ..., their legal significance is a matter of law to be determined by the court, but where the facts, or inferences therefrom, or both, are in dispute, such questions are to be determined by a jury (or where the case is submitted to the court, by the judge as questions of fact, not of law).... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In explaining the test, the Court relied on <em>Moore v. Clarke, </em>171 Md. 39, 187 A. 887 (1936); <em>Barnes v. Myers, </em>163 Md. 206, 161 A. 279 (1932); <em>Beyer v. Decker, </em>159 Md. 289, 150 A. 804 (1930); <em>Harrison v. Central Construction Co., </em>135 Md. 170, 108 A. 874 (1919); and <em>L. &amp; S. Co. v. State Accident Fund, </em>221 Md. 51, 155 A.2d 653 (1959). Although the majority opinion here cites these same cases as espousing \u201ctwo tests,\u201d the Court in <em>Talley </em>saw no disharmony whatsoever in them. In light of the case law, discussion of \u201ctwo tests\u201d is confusing.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">As the majority notes, the criteria usually examined to determine whether an employer-employee relationship exists, listed in <em>Mackall v. Zayre Corp., </em>293 Md. 221, 230, 443 A.2d 98 (1982),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">\u201cinclude (1) the power to select and hire the employee, (2) the payment of wages, (3) the power to discharge, (4) the power to control the employee\u2019s conduct, and (5) whether the work is part of the regular business of the employer. The decisive test in determining whether the relation of employer and employee exists is whether the employer has the right to control and direct the employee in the performance of the work and in the manner in which the work is to be done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>The majority, relying on language in <em>Mackall, L. &amp; S. Co., supra, </em>221 Md. at 57, 155 A.2d 653, and <em>Keitz v. National Paving Co., </em>214 Md. 479, 134 A.2d 296, 136 A.2d 229 (1957), asserts that the fourth criterion, \u201cthe factor of control,\u201d is \u201cfor our purposes, \u2018decisive,\u2019 ... \u2018controlling,\u2019 ... \u2018conclusive,\u2019 \u2018determinative,\u2019 and \u2018definitive.\u2019 \u201d The Court takes the position that, once the factor of control is established, the one exercising control is an employer as a matter of law. Largely equating the power to control the employee\u2019s conduct with the power to control the performance of specific tasks, the majority concludes \u201cthat the control exercised by Safway over Whitehead clearly establishes an employer/employee relationship.\u201d Maryland case law provides no support for this reasoning or conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">First, the Court has in the past been unclear whether the factors such as the right to hire and discharge indicate a right to control or whether the right to control is a criterion separate and distinct from the other factors. <em>Compare L. &amp; S. Co., </em>221 Md. at 57, 155 A.2d 653, <em>with Thompson v. Paul C. Thompson &amp; Sons, </em>258 Md. 391, 395, 265 A.2d 915 (1970). The cases are consistent, however, in that, regardless of the way the Court has viewed the control criterion, all of the factors are given weight in determining the employer-employee relationship. <em>See, e.g., Mackall, supra, </em>293 Md. at 231, 443 A.2d 98; <em>Thompson, supra, </em>258 Md. at 396, 265 A.2d 915; <em>Marine v. Service Trucking Co., </em>225 Md. 315, 321, 170 A.2d 188 (1961); <em>L. &amp; S. Co., supra; Snider v. Gaultney, </em>218 Md. 332, 337-338, 146 A.2d 869 (1958); <em>W.J. Dickey v. State Tax Comm., </em>212 Md. 607, 611-612, 131 A.2d 277 (1957); <em>Charles Freeland v. Couplin, </em>211 Md. 160, 170-172, 126 A.2d 606 (1956); <em>Sun Cab Co. v. Powell, </em>196 Md. 572, 578-582, 77 A.2d 783 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Second, the cases cited by the majority make clear that the control factor is decisive only in the sense that evidence of control will support a determination <em>by the trier of facts </em>that an employer-employee relationship existed. In <em>Mackall, supra, </em>293 Md. 221, 443 A.2d 98, the Court decided that the plaintiff could simultaneously be the employee of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>two employers. The employee in that case worked for a company, Alden, which rented a concession stand for the sale of wigs in a Zayre department store. Immediately after listing the five criteria and commenting that the decisive test is whether the employer has the right to control and direct the employee, the Court applied all of the criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">\u201cHere there was evidence to show that both Alden and Zayre participated in the selection and hiring of Mackall. Both participated in the payment of her wages. Both had the power to discharge her. The retail sale of wigs and millinery was a part of the regular business of both. Most important, there was evidence to show that both exercised control over Mackall in the performance of her duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231, 443 A.2d 98.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The Court concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u201cThe evidence was more than sufficient to support an inference that both Alden and Zayre simultaneously were Mackall\u2019s employers. Thus, <em>the question whether the employer-employee relationship existed was a question of fact to be determined by the jury. Id. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">In <em>L. &amp; S. Co., supra, </em>221 Md. 51, 155 A.2d 653, the Court was presented with the question whether, at the time he was fatally injured, a tractor operator was the employee of L. &amp; S. Construction Company, of Weygandt Engineering and Construction Company, or of both. L. &amp; S. had furnished the tractor and operator to Weygandt, and the operator was killed while performing work for Weygandt. The case was tried before the court, and evidence was introduced to show that Weygandt directed the employee in the performance of his work. Despite this evidence, the trial judge found as a fact that L. &amp; S. was the sole employer of the deceased when the accident happened. On appeal, this Court held that the evidence of control by L. &amp; S., coupled with its hiring, payment of wages and right to dismiss the employee, was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s <em>factual </em>determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>In <em>Keitz, supra, </em>214 Md. 479, 134 A.2d 296, 136 A.2d 229, the issue was whether the driver of a dump truck owned by the driver\u2019s general employer, Sudbrook, was also the employee of National Paving Company, the company to which the truck and the employee\u2019s services had been furnished. While hauling for National, the employee was involved in a traffic accident, injuring another driver. The Court, in holding that the trial court had erred in directing a verdict that National was not the truck driver\u2019s employer, pointed to the following evidence in the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-4\">\u201cAfter Redmond Sudbrook ascertained the number of trucks National wanted for the next day\u2019s work, he told the drivers in the evening what they were supposed to do the following morning, and if they were told to go to National or to haul asphalt for, or bring stone or dust from the quarry to, National, anyone in authority at National could tell them what to do. In fact, it was \u2018agreed on\u2019, a \u2018regular part of the procedure\u2019, and \u2018by agreement\u2019 that Sudbrook\u2019s drivers were to take and obey whatever orders or instructions were given them by National\u2019s superintendents or other supervisory personnel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADI\">The Court listed the five criteria which may be considered in determining the existence of the employer-employee relationship and discussed the \u201cdecisive\u201d test of the right to control the servant. The Court noted that, based on the testimony,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">\u201cthe jury might have concluded, that National and its superintendents had an almost unlimited right to control and direct Ogle in the performance of National\u2019s work, once he had reported to National. While his principal duties involved hauling from three different sources, there is nothing in the testimony that states that it was not at liberty to require of him trips elsewhere. Sud-brook\u2019s trucks ran side by side with National\u2019s in the performance of National\u2019s business. Ogle stated that \u2018whatever National\u2019s superintendent told (him) to do, (he) would do\u2019. This clearly seems to have permitted National a wide latitude in controlling and directing his work, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>as is anticipated in the relationship of master and servant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492, 134 A.2d 296, 136 A.2d 229.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The Court concluded that this evidence of control and direction \u201cwas legally sufficient <em>... to require the submission to the jury </em>of the question whether [the employee] was the servant of National when the accident occurred.\u201d 214 Md. at 493, 134 A.2d 296, 136 A.2d 229 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">A case not discussed by the majority, <em>Charles Freeland v. Couplin, supra, </em>211 Md. 160, 126 A.2d 606, decided whether a person killed in a logging accident was an employee or an independent contractor. The deceased, Ernest M. Couplin, had been hired to cut timber on Freeland\u2019s land. The trial court had submitted the issue to the jury after denying Freeland\u2019s prayer for a directed verdict. In addition to the five factors previously mentioned, the Court listed a sixth which may be considered in determining the existence of an employment relationship, namely \u201cwhether or not the parties believe they are creating the relationship of master (employer) and servant (employee).\u201d 211 Md. at 170, 126 A.2d 606. On the question of control, the Court commented that the facts seemed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlO\">\u201cto indicate control that could not be exercised over an independent contractor who was being paid only by the ton for cut timber. Freeland, as owner, was interested in getting as much as possible out of the standing timber, and therefore controlled the cutting to that end. <em>Legally, as owner of timber he had the absolute right to exercise complete control over the cutting. </em>And he exercised such right with reference to what was to be cut, approximately when it was to be cut (though Couplin chose his own working hours) and that the cutting was done according to specifications and without wastage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 126 A.2d 606 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The Court, finding evidence of five of the six factors it listed, held that the trial court had properly denied the directed verdict prayer. The Court did not, despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>overwhelming evidence of control, hold that Freeland was, as a matter of law, Couplin\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The majority also cites <em>L. &amp; S. Co., supra, </em>221 Md. at 56, 155 A.2d 653, for the proposition that \u201cthe power to hire or discharge a worker can be vested in one person and the power of control in another, and that in such a case the person having the power of control is the master.\u201d This proposition was stated originally in <em>Sun Cab Co. v. Powell, supra, </em>196 Md. at 578, 77 A.2d 783. In context, it lends no support to the majority\u2019s position. In <em>Sun Cab Co., </em>the Court recognized the possibility that a contract might give one person the power to hire and discharge and vest complete control in another. In such a situation, where there is no question that the employee is somebody\u2019s employee, the one who exercises no control cannot, as a matter of law, be an employer or master. For other examples of this principle, <em>see Auto. Trade Ass\u2019n v. Harold Folk Enter., </em>301 Md. 642, 660-661, 484 A.2d 612 (1984); <em>B.P. Oil Corp. v.

Until today, no Maryland case has held that, just because someone exercises control, he must, as a matter of law, be an employer. These cases point out the illogic of the majority\u2019s opinion. The majority states that Safway possessed \u201call\u201d or \u201cabsolute\u201d control of Whitehead in the performance of his job. If so, Bay could have exercised no control in this respect. Therefore, Bay could not as a matter of law be Whitehead\u2019s employer. Yet, the majority states that Bay was also Whitehead\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Finally, this Court could be no clearer in stating a proposition than when it held, in <em>L. &amp; S. Co., supra, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASE\">\u201c[t]he fact that control over details as to what work is to be done and the way in which it is to be done may be exercised by the person to whom the employee is sent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>will not of itself cause the employee to become the servant of the person to whom he is sent.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atx\">Assuming arguendo that Safway\u2019s control over details was greater than the control in <em>L. &amp; S. Co., </em>this aspect is, of itself, not enough to establish an employment relationship as a matter of law in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Turning to the specific facts of the present case, Bay Services selected Whitehead and sent him to Safway. Bay paid Whitehead\u2019s wages. Whitehead was paid much less than Safway\u2019s employees. Bay had the right to fire Whitehead, Safway having the right only to dismiss him from the job at Safway. Safway controlled Whitehead\u2019s conduct only as to assigning specific tasks. Whitehead received no fringe benefits whereas Safway employees did. All of Safway\u2019s employees were union members; Whitehead was not. Bay, as a matter of policy, called each day to every company to which it sent workers to determine if the workers were performing satisfactorily. The jury could easily have inferred from this that, if a worker were doing an unsatisfactory job, Bay would correct the situation. Additionally, a company to which Bay sent a worker had no authority, without first getting permission from Bay, to ask that worker to return the following day. Moreover, the plaintiff produced some evidence that Bay considered itself the plaintiff\u2019s exclusive employer and that Safway did not consider itself his employer. As the majority notes, \u201c[t]he parties\u2019 subjective beliefs\u201d in this area are \u201cnot dispositive.\u201d Nevertheless, it has been recognized that such subjective beliefs are evidence of a party\u2019s right to control another. 1 Restatement (Second), <em>Agency, </em>\u00a7 220 comment <em>m </em>(1958). <em>See Anderson Nurs. Homes v. Walker, </em>232 Md. 442, 444, 194 A.2d 85 (1963) (belief of the parties is a criterion to be used in determining employer-employee relationship); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number><em>Charles Freeland v. Couplin, supra, </em>221 Md. at 170, 126 A.2d 606 (belief of parties is to be considered).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">It is true that the basic facts relating to Whitehead\u2019s relationship to Bay and Safway were undisputed. Moreover, this may not be a case where any individual fact leads to conflicting inferences. Nevertheless, it is a case where some undisputed facts lead to one inference and other undisputed facts lead to a different inference. For example, Bay\u2019s hiring of Whitehead and payment of his wages lead to the inference that Bay and not Safway was Whitehead\u2019s employer. Similarly, the difference in salaries between Whitehead and Safway employees, Whitehead\u2019s lack of employment benefits as compared to Safway employees, his non-union status, the understanding of the parties, etc., all lead to the inference that Safway <em>was not </em>Whitehead\u2019s employer. On the other hand, Safway\u2019s direction of Whitehead on the job and the fact that the work Whitehead did was part of the regular business of Safway support an inference that Safway <em>was </em>Whitehead\u2019s employer. In several recent cases, in various contexts, this Court has emphasized that such conflicting inferences are for the trier of facts to resolve. <em>See, e.g., Board of Educ., Mont. Co. v. Paynter, </em>303 Md. 22, 491 A.2d 1186 (1985); <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 490 A.2d 1296 (1985); <em>Balto. Lutheran High Sch. v. Emp. Sec. Adm., </em>302 Md. 649, 490 A.2d 701 (1985); <em>Comptroller v. Haskin, </em>298 Md. 681, 472 A.2d 70 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The evidence Whitehead produced was sufficient to support a jury conclusion that Safway\u2019s control over him was minimal and that Bay was his exclusive employer. I would hold that the trial court erred in granting the motion for judgment n.o.v.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Judge R0D0WSKY has authorized me to state that he concurs with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-12\">. <em>But see </em>1C Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1982), \u00a7 48.23, pp. 369-373 and cases there cited (\u201cthere is substantial <em>contra </em>authority\u201d). <em>See, e.g., Hill v. Erdle Perforating Company, </em>53 A.D.2d 1008, 386 N.Y.S.2d 265 (1976), where the court, on facts substantially the same as those in the present case, held that the question was one of fact for the jury to decide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\"><em>. </em>The Court in <em>L. &amp; S. Co. </em>did not, as the majority suggests, confine this rule to cases involving the lending of machinery along with an employee to operate it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\">. Moreover, if the majority is correct that this case presents an issue of law, the legal conclusion would appear to be contrary to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>reached by the majority. While not dealt with in the trial court or on appeal, the facts of this case present the issue of whether Whitehead was a casual employee of Safway, thus making worker\u2019s compensation provisions inapplicable under Maryland Code (1957, 1979 Repl. Vol.), Art. 101, \u00a7 67. In <em>Wood v. Abell, </em>268 Md. 214, 300 A.2d 665 (1973), this Court held that an employee hired for various odd jobs not to exceed one or two weeks with no promise of future or continuous employment was as a matter of law a casual employee and thus his survivors were not barred from maintaining a third party action against his casual employer. <em>See also </em>1C Larson, <em>supra, </em>note 1, \u00a7 51.12.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
