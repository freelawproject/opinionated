His first trip was reported in <em>Huffington v. State, </em>295 Md. 1, 452 A.2d 1211 (1982), where we reversed and remanded for a new trial. Upon the remand after that reversal the case was removed to the Circuit Court for Frederick County for trial. In <em>Huffington v. State, </em>302 Md. 184, 486 A.2d 200 (1985), we rejected his contention that to again try him would place him in double jeopardy. After our per curiam order in that case (but before the filing of the opinion) Huffington was tried in the Circuit Court for Frederick County. A jury convicted him of two counts of first degree murder, breaking and entering, and handgun offenses. The same jury sentenced him to death for each murder. The case reaches us under the provisions of Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 414 providing for automatic review by this Court whenever the death penalty is imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The facts surrounding the incident leading to Huffing-ton\u2019s conviction are fully set forth in our earlier opinion. We shall here set forth only such facts as are necessary to a clear understanding of each of the issues presented by Huffington in his appeal. We shall consider his contentions seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">i. Refusal to admit the testimony given by Rassa at the trial of Kanaras</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Deno Kanaras was the alleged accomplice of Huffington in the incidents here in question. Kanaras was convicted by a Kent County jury of felony murder, theft, and daytime housebreaking. See <em>Kanaras v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 568, 460 A.2d 61, <em>cert. denied, </em>297 Md. 109 (1983). At Kanaras\u2019 trial Stephen Rassa testified in rebuttal as a State\u2019s witness. Prior to that rebuttal testimony Kanaras had testified that he had been free from drugs for some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>time before the homicides in question. The purport of Rassa\u2019s testimony was that a few days before the incident in question Kanaras was still involved with drugs. Rassa told of a visit made by him and Kanaras to the homicide victims for the purpose of purchasing cocaine. At Kanaras\u2019 trial Rassa testified that Kanaras \u201csaid he wouldn\u2019t mind robbing Joe Hudson and killing him.\u201d Rassa said that five days before Hudson and Becker, the victims in the case at bar, were actually killed, when Rassa and Kanaras approached Hudson\u2019s trailer for the purpose of purchasing cocaine, Kanaras entered first armed with a gun and with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">After laying a foundation of unsuccessful attempts to subpoena Rassa as a witness, Huffington offered the record of Rassa\u2019s testimony at the Kanaras trial in Kent County. He sought its admission as prior evidence to establish that Kanaras might have killed the victims in the case at bar. The trial judge denied admission, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\u201cThe whole thrust of the cases in this area is that the right of cross-examination be fully afforded, and if it has not been afforded, then it is not only a violation of Article 21 of the Maryland Constitution but also before [sic] the amendment to the United States Constitution. It\u2019s clear from the proffered testimony in this case, and I find as a fact, that in the trial in which the Rassa transcript is sought to be used, Mr. Rassa was the State\u2019s witness, and accordingly, to grant your motion I would be depriving the State of its right to cross-examine fully Mr. Rassa in this case, which is a different case from the present case. The case in which the transcript is from, as I understand it, is the <em>State v. Kanaras </em>rather than the <em>State v. Huffington, </em>and so the situation is entirely different from the situation which caused me to grant the State\u2019s motion in connection with the Bognani testimony. Accordingly, the motion is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">There is no dispute here on the issue of Rassa\u2019s availability as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>The rule applicable to prior testimony was set forth for the Court by Chief Judge Murphy in <em>Crawford v. State, </em>282 Md. 210, 383 A.2d 1097 (1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A66\">\u201cOur predecessors have consistently held that testimony taken at a former trial may as a general rule be admitted at a subsequent trial where it is satisfactorily shown that the witness is unavailable to testify. <em>Contee v. State, </em>229 Md. 486, 184 A.2d 823 (1962); <em>Bryant v. State, </em>207 Md. 565, 115 A.2d 502 (1955); <em>Hendrix v. State, </em>200 Md. 380, 90 A.2d 186 (1952). These cases generally recognize that where an opportunity was afforded to the accused to cross-examine the witness at the former trial, there is no violation of the state or federal constitutional right of confrontation. The rule has generally been applied without distinction between the admissibility of testimony given at a former trial and testimony given at a preliminary hearing since, as Professor McCormick states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u2018If the accepted requirements of the administration of the oath, adequate opportunity to cross-examine on substantially the same issue, and' present unavailability of the witness, are satisfied then the character of the tribunal and the form of the proceedings are immaterial, and the former testimony should be received____\u2019 McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 258 (2d ed. 1972).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">Other text writers are in accord. <em>See </em>2 <em>Jones on Evidence </em>\u00a7 9.22 (6th ed. 1972); 3 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 650 (13th ed. 1973).\u201d 282 Md. at 214-15, 383 A.2d at 1100.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">The rule was recognized ninety years ago in a criminal context by the Supreme Court. See <em>Mattox v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 237, 15 S.Ct. 337, 39 L.Ed. 409 (1895). The Court discussed such testimony in the context of a claim that admission of testimony would violate the constitutional provision relative to confrontation of witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-11\">\u201cThe primary object of the constitutional provision in question was to prevent depositions or <em>ex parte </em>affidavits, such as were sometimes admitted in civil cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>being used against the prisoner in lieu of a personal examination and cross-examination of the witness in which the accused has an opportunity, not only of testing the recollection and sifting the conscience of the witness, but of compelling him to stand face to face with the jury in order that they may look at him, and judge by his demeanor upon the stand and the manner in which he gives his testimony whether he is worthy of belief. There is doubtless reason for saying that the accused should never lose the benefit of any of these safeguards even by the death of the witness; and that, if notes of his testimony are permitted to be read, he is deprived of the advantage of that personal presence of the witness before the jury which the law has designed for his protection. But general rules of law of this kind, however beneficent in their operation and valuable to the accused, must occasionally give way to considerations of public policy and the necessities of the case. To say that a criminal, after having once been convicted by the testimony of a certain witness, should go scot free simply because death has closed the mouth of that witness, would be carrying his constitutional protection to an unwarrantable extent. The law in its wisdom declares that the rights of the public shall not be wholly sacrificed in order that an incidental benefit may be preserved to the accused.\u201d 156 U.S. at 242-43, 15 S.Ct. at 339-40, 39 L.Ed. at 411.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aku\">On the issue in question see Annot., 15 A.L.R. 495 (1921), and the supplements thereto, 79 A.L.R. 1392 (1932), 122 A.L.R. 425 (1939), and 159 A.L.R. 1240 (1945). Obviously, as pointed out in 15 A.L.R. at 559, there can be no constitutional objection to admission of evidence on <em>behalf </em>of an accused in a criminal proceeding. The further observation is made that in admitting testimony on behalf of an accused courts generally have followed the rules which they have adopted with respect to permitting or rejecting testimony in favor of the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">On the problem at hand E. Cleary, <em>McCormick\u2019s Handbook of the Law of Evidence, </em>\u00a7 254 (3d ed. 1984) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>\u201cUsually called \u2018former testimony\u2019, this evidence may be classified, depending upon the precise formulation of the rule against hearsay, as an exception to the hearsay prohibition on the one hand, or as a class of evidence where the requirements of the hearsay rule are complied with,' on the other. The former view is accepted generally by the courts, rules, and textwriters; the latter was espoused by Wigmore.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 759-60.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">On cross-examination McCormick states in \u00a7 255:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">\u201cMore important, and more often drawn in question, is the requirement that the party against whom the former testimony is now offered, or a party in like interest, must have had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine. Actual cross-examination, of course, is not essential, if the opportunity was afforded and waived. The opportunity must have been such as to render the conduct of the cross-examination or the decision not to cross-examine meaningful in the light of the circumstances which prevail when the former testimony is offered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 761-62.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">McCormick also mentions another frequent issue in \u00a7 256, that of identity of parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">\u201c[T]he natural next step is to recognize, as progressive courts have done, that neither identity of parties nor privity between parties is essential. These are merely means to an end. Consequently, if it appears that in the former suit a party having a like motive to cross-examine about the same matters as the present party would have, was accorded an adequate opportunity for such examination, the testimony may be received against the present party. Identity of interest in the sense of motive, rather than technical identity of cause of action or title, is the test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 765.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The importance of cross-examination is explained by Martin, <em>The Former-Testimony Exception in the Proposed Federal Rules of Evidence, </em>57 Iowa L.Rev. 547 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>\u201cGiven the faith which the Anglo-American adversary system places in the efficacy of cross-examination, it is not surprising that the most important feature of the former-testimony exception is that which requires such testimony to have been given in a situation where an opportunity existed to utilize that truth-testing device. The former-testimony exception to the hearsay rule is unique in this respect, as no other exception makes cross-examination a requirement for admissibility, and it is not usually discussed in connection with evidence admitted under other exceptions. It was this opportunity to cross-examine which led Wigmore to characterize former testimony as unobjectionable under the hearsay rule, rather than as admissible as one of its exceptions. In order to ensure the reliability of former testimony, the proposed Federal Rules retain the requirement that the opponent be given the opportunity to develop the testimony by cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553-54.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Professor Martin says, \u201c[The] crucial question is whether, given that the opponent can not now cross-examine the witness, the examination on the prior occasion was fairly equivalent to cross-examination in the present situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">\u201c(b) Hearsay exceptions. \u2014 The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">(1) Former testimony. \u2014 Testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of the same or another proceeding, if the party against whom the testimony is now offered, or, in a civil action or proceeding, a predecessor in interest, had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMU\">The issue of cross-examination is discussed in J. Weinstein <em>&amp; </em>M. Berger, 1 <em>Weinstein\u2019s Evidence </em>11 804(b)(l)[02]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>\u201cThe prime guaranty of reliability in the case of prior testimony or depositions resides in their having been subjected to cross-examination prior to the present trial. When this condition and the requirement of an oath are met, the character of the tribunal before which the former trial was held is immaterial. \u2018If the tribunal was empowered to compel cross-examination, or did in fact compel cross-examination, the prior testimony should be admissible.\u2019 Similarly in the case of depositions, the condition of cross-examination is satisfied if the deposition is taken \u2018before an officer authorized by law to take depositions and empowered to compel cross-examination.\u2019 If the opportunity to cross-examine was lacking the prior testimony must be excluded. Even should it be determined that the tribunal conducting the original hearing lacked jurisdiction, admission of the prior testimony should depend on \u2018whether the sworn statements of the witness, now dead or unavailable, about the facts of which he had knowledge, were made under such circumstances of opportunity and motive for cross-examination as to make them sufficiently trustworthy to be used in the effort to ascertain the truth.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">\u201cActual cross-examination is not required, \u2018but merely an <em>opportunity to exercise the right to cross-examine if desired.\u2019 </em>Respresentation by the same counsel at both trials is not required. If the party against whom the previous statement is now offered is the party against whom the testimony was previously offered, it is usually compatible with fair practice to make him bear the consequences of any deficiencies in the cross-examination or decision not to exercise that right. But situations may arise where because of particular circumstances, the existence of an opportunity to cross-examine would not have resulted in any testing of the reliability of the previous statement, where the conduct of the cross-examination or the decision not to cross-examine is not \u2018meaningful in the light of the circumstances which prevail when the former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>testimony is offered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>804-74 to -76. (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The case relied upon by the State that is closest to the factual situation before the Court is <em>Commonwealth v. Meech, </em>380 Mass. 490, 403 N.E.2d 1174 (1980). There the defendant attempted to introduce at his trial testimony given by a witness for the prosecution before the grand jury. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">\u201cThe common model for the exception is one where the prior testimony was given by a person, now unavailable, in a proceeding addressed to substantially the same issues as in the current proceeding, with reasonable opportunity and similar motivation on the prior occasion for cross-examination of the declarant by the party against whom the testimony is now being offered....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">\u201cThe usual formula would not be fulfilled if grand jury testimony were subsequently offered against the indicted defendant, for he would not have had a chance to cross-examine. See <em>United States v. Fiore, </em>443 F.2d 112, 115 &amp; n. 3 (2d Cir.1971), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 984 [93 S.Ct. 1510, 36 L.Ed.2d 181] (1973). Nor is it nominally fulfilled where, as here, the defendant offers the testimony against the Commonwealth, for the Commonwealth was not in the position of a cross-examiner at the grand jury hearing; rather it was presenting the testimony through direct examination. However, it has been recommended by commentators, and on occasion held by courts, that a party\u2019s having tendered the testimony on direct should serve as the equivalent for the present purpose of his having cross-examined upon it. There is some support for this view as to grand jury testimony on the theory, perhaps, that the government should be considered bound to the trustworthiness of the evidence it chose to present to the grant jury as a basis for an accusation of crime. (See, however, note 12 <em>infra.)</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">\u201cBut even if the proposition were accepted that the defendant might in some circumstances use the grand jury testimony of a now unavailable witness at trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>McDonald\u2019s testimony would still be of dubious acceptability. \u25a0 For it is an important ground of this hearsay \u2018exception\u2019 that there be substantial identity between the issues at the earlier and later proceedings \u2014 this to ensure \u2018that the former handling of the witness was the equivalent of what would now be done if the opportunity were presented.\u2019 Where this similarity is absent, the testimony will not be fortified in the material respect \u2014 that is, in its relation to the particular proposition sought to be proved in the later proceeding. See <em>United States v. Wingate, </em>520 F.2d 309, 316 (2d Cir.1975); <em>State v. Augustine, </em>252 La. 983, 999 [215 So.2d 634] (1968). The problem is encountered here. The Commonwealth\u2019s purpose in examining McDonald before the grand jury was not to inquire into the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility; it was to provide eyewitness proof about the defendant\u2019s possession of the supposed murder weapon in the vicinity of the crime near the time of death.\u201d 380 Mass, at 494-96, 403 N.E.2d at 1177-78.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\"><em>United States v. Atkins, </em>618 F.2d 366 (5th Cir.1980), is instructive. The court there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">\u201cAdmission of Inglet\u2019s testimony, given during government cross-examination of him in a December 19, 1978, James[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] hearing, also was not erroneously denied. Fed. R.Evid. 804(b)(1) permits admission of former testimony if the declarant is unavailable at trial and \u2018if the party against whom the testimony is now offered ... had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.\u2019 The defendant sought to use Inglet\u2019s testimony that his source of cocaine in Miami was a man named Robert, whose last name he did not know, in order to establish that Inglet was dealing with someone other than Robert Atkins, whose name was known to Inglet. Defense counsel for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Atkins did not participate in the <em>James </em>hearing, and the hearing did not concern Atkins but only some of his codefendants. In addition, the government did not contend that Atkins was the Miami supplier being discussed by Inglet in the <em>James </em>hearing but rather that he was the contact man. Thus, the government did not have the motivation to question Inglet in order to make him acknowledge that the Robert of whom he spoke in the James hearing was in fact Atkins. Accordingly, Inglet\u2019s former testimony did not meet the requirements of 804(b)(1) for admission, and his challenge to its exclusion by the judge is without merit. <em>See, e.g., Peterson v. United States, </em>344 F.2d 419, 425 (5th Cir.1965).\u201d 618 F.2d at 373.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">We find <em>Atkins </em>persuasive. It follows along with the authorities we have heretofore quoted. When the State presented the testimony of Rassa at Kanaras\u2019 trial it was in a different context and for a different purpose from that for which Huffington desires to offer it in the case at bar.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The motivation on the part of the State for questioning Rassa was entirely different at that trial from the motivation the State would have had to question Rassa on cross-examination at Huffington\u2019s trial had Rassa been present as a live witness to offer the testimony sought to be introduced. Much has been written on the importance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>cross-examination. In the words of the federal rule the party against whom the testimony is now offered did not have at the time of Kanaras\u2019 trial a similar motive in developing the testimony of Rassa. Given the wide discretion which trial judges have in admitting evidence, we find no error on the part of the trial judge,</p>\n<p id=\"A3T\">ii. Mitigating factor of not being the sole proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 413(g)(6) provides that a mitigating factor which a sentencing authority may find to exist is that the act of the defendant was not the sole proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death. Huffington contends that because his cohort, Kanaras, was convicted of felony murder in the death of Becker (one of the individuals found to have been murdered by Huffington), then Huffing-ton is entitled as a matter of law to an instruction in his favor on this mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">There is both a short and a somewhat longer answer to Huffington\u2019s contention. The short answer is that at no time did he request such an instruction. Not having requested such an instruction, the point is deemed waived. Maryland Rule 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">A somewhat longer answer is that the sentencing authority, in this instance the jury, would be expected to return its finding based upon the evidence adduced before it. Evidence of Kanaras\u2019 conviction was not adduced. Had it been, the finding made by the jury at Kanaras\u2019 trial would not be binding upon the jury at Huffington\u2019s trial because it would not be based upon the same evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The real answer is that contained in <em>Evans v. State, </em>304 Md. 487, 499 A.2d 1261 (1985), where Judge Eldridge said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">\u201c[W]e conclude that the General Assembly intended the words \u2018proximate cause\u2019 to apply only to direct physical causes of the victim\u2019s death, and not to acts of a principal in the second degree or an accessory before the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>which aided or abetted the act directly causing death.\u201d 304 Md. at 534, 499 A.2d at 1285.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Footnote 16 of that opinion provides further clarification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">\u201cThe type of situation which the Legislature likely had in mind by the language of \u00a7 413(g)(6) is illustrated by the following. If the perpetrator inflicts a serious wound under circumstances that would justify a conviction for murder if death should ensue, and death does ensue partly by reason of negligent medical treatment or refusal of the victim to accept medically recommended care, the perpetrator will not be excused from liability for the murder. <em>See DeVaughn v. State, </em>232 Md. 447, 194 A.2d 109 (1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>376 U.S. 927, 84 S.Ct. 693, 11 L.Ed.2d 623 (1964). Nevertheless, in a capital punishment case there would exist as a mitigating factor an additional proximate cause of death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">\u201cWe need not in this case, however, explore the range or scope of acts which might fall within the language of \u00a7 413(g)(6). We go no further than our holding that the act of a principal in the second degree or accessory before the fact is not what the Legislature had in mind.\u201d 304 Md. at 534-35, 499 A.2d at 1286.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Huffington simply was not entitled to such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">iii. The presentence investigation report</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1984 Cum.Supp.) Art. 41, \u00a7 124(d), adopted by Ch. 297 of the Acts of 1983 and effective July 1, 1983, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">\u201cIn any case in which the death penalty is requested under Article 27, \u00a7 412, a presentence investigation, including a victim impact statement, shall be completed by the Division of Parole and Probation, and shall be considered by the court or jury before whom the separate sentencing proceeding is conducted under Article 27, \u00a7 413.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 413(c)(l)(iv) states that evidence admissible in a capital sentencing proceeding includes \u201c[a]ny presentence investigation report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Huffington contends that the trial court erred in admitting two portions of the presentence investigation report. The first concerns that portion of institutional history pertaining to infractions not leading to criminal prosecutions committed while Huffington was incarcerated prior to trial. The second pertains to the admission of Huffington\u2019s version of the facts pertaining to his activities at the times here pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">For reasons to be hereafter developed we find Huffing-ton\u2019s contentions to be without merit. There is another reason for overruling his contentions, however. The presentence investigation came in without objection. It is true that when the presentence investigation was being considered by the trial judge Huffington made specific objections to the portions of the report to which he now objects. However, the report was received in evidence without objection on behalf of Huffington. The record reflects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">\u201cCassilly [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Excuse me, Your Honor, could we ... now that we\u2019ve finally gotten our presentence put together, can we distribute this to the Jury at this point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">\u201cCourt: You\u2019ll want to put that in?

The institutional history</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The section of the presentence investigation report pertaining to institutional history states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">\u201cOn or about 12/6/83 the defendant, John Norman Huffington was cited for 1) refusing to obey a direct order and 2) creating a security threat. The defendant received ten days in disciplinary isolation for each of those infractions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">\u201cEvidently the defendant offered resistance to Deputy Minnick while being searched. As to the second infraction the defendant apparently interfered with the searching of other inmates in the cell block.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-8\"><em>Bartholomey v. State, </em>267 Md. 175, 297 A.2d 696 (1972), involved the Maryland death sentence cases remanded to us by the Supreme Court of the United States for reconsideration in the light of its holding in <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972). In discussing the procedure to be followed by trial judges in re-sentencing those defendants, Chief Judge Murphy said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">\u201c[T]o aid the sentencing judge in fairly and intelligently exercising the discretion vested in him, the procedural policy of the State encourages him to consider information concerning the convicted person\u2019s reputation, past offenses, health, habits, mental and moral propensities, social background and any other matters that a judge ought to have before him in determining the sentence that should be imposed. <em>Skinker v. State, </em>239 Md. 234, 210 A.2d 716 (1965); <em>Scott v. State, </em>238 Md. 265, 208 A.2d 575 (1965); <em>Costello v. State, </em>237 Md. 464, 206 A.2d 812 (1965); <em>Driver v.

The sentencing judge may, but need not, obtain a presentence report under Article 41, \u00a7 124(b). Of course, the sentencing judge may take into consideration the defendant\u2019s conduct after the offense was committed, <em>viz., </em>he may consider evidence of events occurring after the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>of the original sentencing to whatever extent he may deem necessary. <em>North Carolina v.

State, </em>289 Md. 460, 425 A.2d 632 (1981), Judge Digges said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201cIn considering what is proper punishment, it is now well-settled in this State that a judge is not limited to reviewing past conduct whose occurrence has been judicially established, but may view \u2018reliable evidence of conduct which may be opprobrious although not criminal, as well as details and circumstances of criminal conduct for which the person has not been tried.\u2019 <em>Henry v. State, </em>273 Md. 131, 147-48, 328 A.2d 293, 303 (1974).\u201d 289 Md. at 481, 425 A.2d at 643.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">We are not concerned here with crimes, as in <em>Scott v. State, </em>297 Md. 235, 465 A.2d 1126 (1983), with which an accused was charged but had not yet been convicted. We believe that under our prior cases this institutional history was properly admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">b. Huffington\u2019s statement</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">It is customary in a presentence investigation for the defendant\u2019s version of the relevant facts to be set forth. The events leading to the death of the victims apparently occurred in the early morning hours of May 25, 1981. Huffington has summarized in his brief the relevant evidence adduced at trial. That pertaining to the critical time is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">\u201cAt 2:00 a.m., Appellant, Kanaras, Hudson and Becker all left the nightclub and drove to the trailer. Once inside the trailer, Appellant paid Hudson $275.00 for three and one-half grams of cocaine. At that point, all concerned had ingested various quantities of cocaine and marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>\u201cAfter completing the transaction, Appellant and Kanaras returned to Appellant\u2019s apartment and ingested more cocaine. Appellant then began making telephone calls in an effort to find a buyer for additional cocaine retained by Hudson. Appellant ostensibly found a buyer, and had Kanaras drive him back to Hudson\u2019s trailer. Arriving between 3:30 and 4:00 a.m., they picked up Hudson and drove him to the rural Wheel Road area of Harford County. According to Kanaras, after the three men exited the car Appellant shot and killed Hudson and removed a quantity of cocaine from the latter\u2019s pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">\u201cAppellant then turned the gun on Kanaras, forcing him to drive back to the Hudson trailer for the purpose of stealing money. Once inside the trailer, Appellant killed Diane Becker by striking her on the head with a vodka bottle and then stabbing her some 33 times with a knife. Under duress, Kanaras then helped Appellant steal a large amount of cash and Becker\u2019s purse, which contained narcotics and paraphernalia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">\u201cKanaras\u2019 testimony continued that for the next several hours he remained with Appellant, helping him to dispose of evidence and to establish an alibi by attending a local \u2018fiddler\u2019s convention.\u2019 Kanaras remained with Appellant and refrained from informing anyone of the killings even after the disposal of the gun and knife used in the homicides because he remained \u2018scared\u2019 of Appellant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The version obtained by the Parole and Probation agent as set forth in the presentence investigation report was as follows for the critical period:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">\u201cAbout 1:45 a.m. the defendant and Kanaras left the Golden 40 and followed Hudson\u2019s car to an Edgewood 7-11 Store and then to Hudson\u2019s Motorhome. Diane Becker walked over to their car and asked them to wait until the people in the other car left. After the other vehicle left, the defendant and Kanaras entered the motorhome and all four (4) sat down. Hudson and the defendant discussed a future cocaine deal and Kanaras <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>bought some cocaine from Hudson, after which Huffing-ton and Kanaras left. They drove back to Huffington\u2019s apartment and both went inside. Kanaras allegedly wanted to party, but the defendant said he was tired and wanted to go to bed. Kanaras then left and the defendant went to sleep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">\u201cOn 5/25/81 at about 9 a.m., Kanaras returned to Huffington\u2019s apartment and asked him to go partying. After showering, the defendant and Kanaras did some cocaine and drove around, heading toward the Fiddler\u2019s convention in Cecil County____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\u201cAbout 6:30 p.m. Kanaras called him asking him to cover for him, to tell anyone who asked, that they were at the Fiddler\u2019s Convention all night. The defendant claimed that at that time he did not know why Kanaras asked him to cover for him----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">\u201cThe defendant stated that he protected Kanaras with an alibi. He claimed that Kanaras never explained why he needed an alibi. The defendant denied participation in the crimes and denied his guilt to the charges. When asked if he had knowledge of or a hunch who committed the offense, the defendant said, T couldn\u2019t say.\u2019 He stated that he feels \u2018fed up\u2019 and has \u2018lost a lot of respect for the judicial system.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">Relying upon <em>Estelle v. Smith, </em>451 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 1866, 68 L.Ed.2d 359 (1981), Huffington claims that the admission of his statement violates his rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution as delineated in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). He makes no contention relative to Sixth Amendment rights. In <em>Estelle </em>the Court said, \u201cWe can discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of respondent\u2019s capital murder trial so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned.\u201d 451 U.S. at 462-63, 101 S.Ct. at 1873, 60 L.Ed.2d at 369. The Court further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">\u201c \u2018Volunteered statements ... are not barred by the Fifth Amendment,\u2019 but under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number><em>pra, </em>we must conclude that, when faced while in custody with a court-ordered psychiatric inquiry, respondent\u2019s statements to Dr. Grigson were not \u2018given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences\u2019 and, as such, could be used as the State did at the penalty phase only if respondent had been apprised of his rights and had knowingly decided to waive them. <em>Id., </em>at 478 [86 S.Ct. at 1630]. These safeguards of the Fifth Amendment privilege were not afforded respondent and, thus, his death sentence cannot stand.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">We simply do not find <em>Estelle </em>or Huffington\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights applicable to the statement in the case at bar. We have set forth Huffington\u2019s version of the evidence and the statement in question at some length in order that there may be no misunderstandings. It is true that Huffington in his statement indicated that he had been in the company of Kanaras and of the victims, Diane Becker and Joseph Hudson. However, according to the statement given by Huffington, at the time when the alleged crimes were being committed he was home by himself and asleep. We find no infringement of Huffington\u2019s rights against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">iv. Victim participation</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 413(g)(2) provides that a mitigating factor shall be that \u201c[t]he victim was a participant in the defendant\u2019s conduct or consented to the act which caused the victim\u2019s death.\u201d Huffington contends that Hudson was a participant in the conduct leading to his death and hence Huffington was entitled as a matter of law to this mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Art. 27, \u00a7 413(g), enacted by Ch. 3 of the Acts of 1978, is modeled after \u00a7 210.6(4)(c) of the Model Penal Code. The latter states relevant to mitigating factors, \u201cThe victim was a participant in the defendant\u2019s homicidal conduct or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>sented to the homicidal act.\u201d There are no relevant cases, annotations, or legislative references concerning either section which we have been able to find. Accordingly, the commentary note to the Model Code provision is of importance. II <em>Model Penal Code and Commentaries, </em>\u00a7 210.6 (1980) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\">\u201cParagraph (c) addresses the case where the victim is partially responsible for his own death. This circumstance obtains chiefly in two kinds of situations. First, there are occasions in which the defendant and his victim are engaged jointly in an activity highly dangerous to each. If each person\u2019s participation depends upon the cooperation of the other, a murder conviction may lie for the death of one actor, even though both share responsibility. An example may be the case of Russian roulette, at least where the defendant actually fires the shot that kills his partner. A second situation within the scope of Paragraph (c) is the true mercy killing. There the defendant\u2019s homicidal act may not have occurred had the victim not consented to it. In either of these contexts, the conduct of the victim in bringing about his own death deserves consideration as a mitigating factor in assigning a death sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140-41.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Huffington contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">\u201cHudson\u2019s activity falls within the first situation. Accompanying known drug dealers to a rural area in the middle of the night has much in common with \u2018Russian roulette\u2019 \u2014 the chance of becoming a victim of crime in that circumstance is probably better than one in six. Hudson\u2019s activity was illegal, foreseeably dangerous, and very much a part of <em>Appellant\u2019s </em>conduct. Absent the victim\u2019s participation in this illegal and dangerous activity, there would have been no murder. The mitigating factor should have been returned and considered.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Kanaras testified as to Hudson\u2019s death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>\u201cAh, I parked the car, and where the car was parked it wasn\u2019t too much room on each side of the road, it was like a slight embankment on one side and an embankment on the other side, so two people really couldn\u2019t fit together coming out of the car, so I got out of the driver\u2019s side of the car and Joe Hudson got out of the passenger side of the car, and we met at the \u2014 the back of the car, and John Huffington was right behind too, about three or four steps, and as we walked up to the house, that\u2019s when I heard these shots \u2014 -four or five shots rang out, and I saw Joe Hudson fall \u2014 fall to the ground to his \u2014 on his side, and he rolled \u2014 he rolled over .... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">This was the evidence before the jury. It does not make Hudson out as a participant in Huffington\u2019s conduct which caused Hudson\u2019s death. According to the testimony Hudson and Huffington were joint participants and co-conspirators in an alleged drug sale. The conduct which caused Hudson\u2019s death related to Huffington\u2019s carrying and concealing a loaded pistol and the firing of such pistol at Hudson\u2019s back. It is beyond the stretch of anyone\u2019s imagination to say that Hudson participated in this conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">We have recently stated, \u201cIt is the accused\u2019s burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of a mitigating circumstance. [Section] 413(g); <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 730, 415 A.2d 830, 848-49 (1980).\u201d <em>Stebbing v. State, </em>299 Md. 331, 361, 473 A.2d 903, 918 (1984). In the case at bar Huffington failed to carry his burden concerning proof of the mitigating factor that Hudson participated in the acts causing his death. Moreover, the issue was not presented to the trial court. Hence, it is deemed waived. Rule 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">v. Arbitrariness in seeking the death penalty</p>\n<p id=\"AHX\">At one point in the proceedings Huffington proffered a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence. Huffington asserts that defense counsel was \u201cunder the impression that the State had conditionally accepted the offer,\u201d but then rejected it when the parents of Becker found it unac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>ceptable. Huffington moved to strike the notice of intention to seek the death penalty, contending consideration of the wishes of the family made this an arbitrary factor. He relies upon <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976), and <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The State responds that it \u201chad already made [the] decision [to seek the death penalty], given notice to [Huffing-ton], and proceeded to trial prior to the alleged \u2018arbitrary\u2019 action.\u201d It contends that the feelings of victims\u2019 families are legitimate considerations and that in any case it is not bound to accept a proposed plea agreement. It further asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">\u201cIn this case the Court at sentencing invoked a novel procedure when it allowed the defense to place plea negotiations before the sentencing jury and argue that the State\u2019s consideration thereof should be a mitigating factor. In other words, the jury was allowed to determine whether the State\u2019s response to the defense\u2019s offer was some indication that the death penalty was not appropriate in this case. The State protested such action below and it is the State\u2019s position here on appeal that this procedure gave Appellant more than he was entitled to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>297 Md. 563, 468 A.2d 45 (1983), the accused mounted an attack upon our death sentence statute based upon what he called the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cunbridled exercise of discretion\u201d under Art. 27, \u00a7 412(b). We considered <em>Gregg </em>and <em>Furman </em>and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">\u201cAbsent any specific evidence of indiscretion by prosecutors resulting in an irrational, inconsistent, or discriminatory application of the death penalty statute, Calhoun\u2019s claim cannot stand. To the extent that there is a difference in the practice of the various State\u2019s attorneys around the State, our proportionality review would be intended to assure that the death penalty is not imposed in a disproportionate manner.\u201d 297 Md. at 605, 468 A.2d at 64.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>We do not regard consultation with the family of the victim here, after the State had already made a decision to seek the death penalty and after trial had begun, as any evidence of indiscretion by a prosecutor. We hold this contention to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">vi. The indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">At Huffington\u2019s first trial a special verdict form was used. The jury convicted him of two felony murders and specifically acquitted him on charges that the two murders were premeditated. <em>Huffington v. State, </em>302 Md. 184, 186, 486 A.2d 200, 201 (1985). The conviction was reversed on appeal. As Huffington puts it, \u201cThe State elected to try the second case on the same indictment, which appears to have been modified to reflect the exclusion of premeditated murder from the case.\u201d The charge of murder of Hudson reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">\u201cThe Jurors of the State of Maryland, for the body of Harford County, do on their oath present that JOHN NORMAN HUFFINGTON, late of said County, on or about the 25th day of May, 1981, in the County aforesaid, unlawfully, willfully and of deliberately premediated [sic] malice aforethought did kill and murder Joseph Mallison Hudson, Jr., contrary to the form of the Act of Assembly in such case made and provided, and against the peace, government and dignity of the State.\u201d \u201c(Murder, First Degree, Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 467, 410, 412, 443, 640)\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Except for not striking out the inapplicable sections of the Code, the count in the indictment pertaining to the death of Diane Becker is identical, including the misspelling of \u201cpremeditated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Huffington challenges his indictment on the ground that \u201c[t]he charging documents ... listed the elements for premeditated murder, but not felony-murder.\u201d He objects on jurisdictional grounds and constitutional grounds. In the trial court no pretrial motion was made pertaining to the adequacy of the indictment. There was a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, an issue which we considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>and rejected in <em>Huffington v. State, </em>802 Md. 184, 486 A.2d 200 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">In <em>Williams v. State, </em>302 Md. 787, 490 A.2d 1277 (1985), Chief Judge Murphy recently said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">\u201cUnder Maryland Rule 4-252(a) (formerly Rule 736a), a motion alleging a \u2018defect\u2019 in the charging document \u2018other than its failure to show jurisdiction in the court or its failure to charge an offense\u2019 must be filed within a designated time period prior to trial or the defect is waived.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The rule provides in subsection (c) that a motion \u2018asserting failure of the charging document to show jurisdiction in the court or to charge an offense may be raised and determined at any time.\u2019 A claim that a charging document fails to charge or characterize an offense is jurisdictional and may be raised, as here, for the first time on appeal. <em>See Putnam [v. State, </em>234 Md. 537, 200 A.2d 59 (1964) ]; <em>Baker [v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 148, 250 A.2d 677 (1969)]; Maryland Rule 885. Where the claimed defect is not jurisdictional, it must be seasonably raised before the trial court or it is waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">To like effect see <em>Hall v. State, </em>302 Md. 806, 809, 490 A.2d 1287, 1288 (1985). It follows, therefore, that any constitutional claim is waived because there was not a motion filed within the time limited by the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">The indictment was in the statutory form. Judge Cole recently said for the Court in <em>Robinson v. State, </em>298 Md. 193, 202, 468 A.2d 328, 333 (1983), \u201c[A]t least as a matter of state non-constitutional law, the legislatively enacted short-form indictment is presumed to be sufficient to charge the offense named in the statute,\u201d referring to felony-murder. Hence, Huffington cannot prevail on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">vii. The constitutional issues</p>\n<p id=\"AJo\">Huffington recognizes, as indeed he must, that we have heretofore found the Maryland Capital Punishment Statute-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>to be consistent with the requirements of the Constitution of the United States. However, he draws upon the dissent by Justice Marshall, joined by Justice Brennan, to the denial of certiorari by the Supreme Court in <em>Stebbing v. Maryland, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 276, 83 L.Ed.2d 212 (1984), and suggests that \u201cserious flaws exist in Maryland\u2019s statutory scheme.\u201d He asserts that \u201cin at least two respects\u2014 manditoriness and a defendant\u2019s burdens \u2014 the Maryland procedure is substantially different from procedures found constitutional by the Supreme Court.\u201d Hence, he \u201curges reconsideration of these issues under Amendments Eight and Fourteen of the United States Constitution and Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Cases in which we have considered and rejected constitutional attacks similar to that here raised include <em>Foster v. State, </em>304 Md. 439, 471, 499 A.2d 1236, 1252 (1985); <em>Evans, </em>304 Md. at 536, 499 A.2d at 1286; <em>Colvin v. State, </em>299 Md. 88, 122-27, 472 A.2d 953, 970-72 (1984); <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>297 Md. 563, 635-38, 468 A.2d 45, 80-81 (1983), and <em>Tichnell, </em>287 Md. at 720-34, 415 A.2d at 843-50. We deem the matter to be settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">viii. Multiple murders</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Huffington contends that the State improperly used the death of more than one person as an aggravating factor while at the same time seeking two death sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Yol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 413(d)(9) lists that \u201c[t]he defendant committed more than one offense of murder in the first degree arising out of the same incident\u201d as an aggravating circumstance which may be considered by the sentencing authority. Separate findings and sentencing determination forms were submitted to the jury pertaining to the death of each of the victims. In each instance the jury found that the defendant committed more than one offense of murder in the first degree arising out of the same incident. In each instance the jury also found as an aggravating factor that Huffington committed the murder while committing or attempting to commit robbery, arson, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>or rape or sexual offense in the first degree, a factor spelled out in Art. 27, \u00a7 413(d)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Huffington argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">\u201cObviously, the legislature intended that only one death sentence be returned in a case where more than one person was killed: Imposition of a second death sentence is redundant, and is inconsistent with the purpose of making the additional murder(s) an aggravating factor. Such double punishment is improper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">In the recent case of <em>Thomas v. State, </em>301 Md. 294, 483 A.2d 6 (1984), the def\u00e9ndant was convicted of murdering a husband and wife in the same incident. The State sought two death sentences. The trial judge, as the sentencing authority, found with respect to both homicides the aggravating factor authorized by \u00a7 413(d)(9), namely that Thomas committed more than one offense of murder in the first degree arising out of the same incident. We said, \u201cWe find no error in the trial court\u2019s application of \u00a7 413.\u201d <em>Thomas </em>is dispositive of this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">ix.

State, </em>301 Md. 294, 483 A.2d 6 (1984), Chief Judge Murphy said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">\u201cThe principles governing proportionality review of a death sentence in Maryland have been stated in a number of our cases. <em>Stebbing v.

The fundamental object of the statutorily mandated appellate review process is the avoidance of the arbitrary or capricious imposition of the death penalty by affording similar treatment to similar capital cases. <em>Tichnell, </em>297 Md. at 466, 468 A.2d 1. The focus of \u00a7 414(e)(4) is upon capital cases in which the sentencing authority determined to impose a life or death sentence; the subsection aims to assure that upon consideration of both the crime and the defendant the aggravating and mitigating circumstances present in one capital case will lead to a result similar to that reached under similar circumstances in another capital case, thus identifying the aberrant sentence and avoiding its ultimate imposition. <em>Id. </em>297 Md. at 465, 468 A.2d 1. Our procedure is to review all reports filed by trial judges in capital sentencing cases, as re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>quired by Maryland Rule 772A, and to select those which we deem \u2018similar' within the contemplation of the statute.\u201d 301 Md. at 334-35, 483 A.2d at 27.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Huffington is now 23 years of age and was about two and a half months short of 19 years of age at the time of the incident in question. As we have indicated, in each of the two homicides the jury found the aggravating factors that the defendant committed more than one offense of murder in the first degree arising out of the same incident and that he committed each murder while committing or attempting to commit robbery, arson, or rape or sexual offense in the first degree. Mitigating circumstances found by a preponderance of the evidence were the youthful age of the defendant at the time of the crime and that he had not previously been found guilty of a crime of violence, entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a charge of a crime of violence, or had a judgment of probation on stay of entry of judgment entered on a charge of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The evidence shows that Huffington murdered. Joe Hudson by shooting him five times in the back and head and that he then stole drugs from Hudson\u2019s person. It further shows that Huffington then went to Hudson\u2019s mobile home and there murdered Diane Becker by striking her with a bottle and then stabbing her thirty-three times. He took money and drugs from the home before fleeing.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In <em>Tichnell v.

In the process of our review in this case we have considered each of the reports submitted by trial judges under Maryland Rule 4-343.

According to the report of the trial judge he and his cousin entered a dwelling house through a basement window. Once inside they went up the basement steps to the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>floor where they discovered the presence of the victim, who was 78 years old, small in stature, weighed but ninety pounds and was home alone. When their demands for money were not satisfied they grabbed her and shoved her into a spare bedroom. In the course of this episode the victim was brutally beaten with a broom handle, stomped on and kicked, tied, and strangled to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The jury found as an aggravating circumstance that the murder was committed while committing or attempting to commit robbery, arson or rape or sexual offense in the first degree. Mitigating circumstances found were that the defendant was not the sole proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death and, under \u201c[o]ther mitigating circumstances,\u201d the life sentence of the co-defendant. The jury sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\"><em>Donald Thomas. </em>Thomas was 23 years old when he committed the acts which brought him to the bar of justice. The trial judge in his report summarized the facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">\u201cSomehow on the night of October 1-2, 1981, the Defendant and the deceased, Donald Spurling, were in joint company with each other. This association appeared friendly. After visiting at least one person, and a bar, they subsequently ended up at the Spurling residence in Baltimore County. For some motivation unbeknownst to the Court, the Defendant killed, with multiple stab wounds, Donald Spurling. Mrs. Spurling, who was apparently awakened by some noise, was subsequently stabbed to death by multiple wounds by the Defendant and sexually molested by the Defendant either during or after her life [sic]. The Defendant then went to the second floor and raped a young woman in her bed, who was a boarder of the Spurling residence. She ultimately escaped by jumping out of the second story window.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">The trial judge found as the sole aggravating circumstance that Thomas had committed more than one murder. No statutory mitigating circumstances were found to exist. The judge did find under \u201c[o]ther mitigating circumstances\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u201cdemographic characteristics and background of defendant.\u201d The trial judge, as the sentencing authority, concluded that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and imposed the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\"><em>Willie Green. </em>Green was 40 years of age when he and an accomplice murdered two employees of a restaurant in the course of a robbery. The victims were both stabbed to death. One victim had his hands tied behind him and his throat was slit. Two aggravating circumstances were found to exist, that Green committed more than one murder in the first degree arising out of the same incident and that the murders were committed during the commission of a robbery. Mitigating circumstances found were that the defendant was not the sole proximate cause of the deaths of the victims and that it was unlikely in view of his age that he would engage in further criminal activity. The trial judge was the sentencing authority. He found by a preponderance of the evidence that the mitigating factors outweighed the aggravating factors. Accordingly, life sentences were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\"><em>Eugene Sherman Colvin. </em>Colvin broke into a house. In the course of the crime he encountered the victim who was visiting in the home of her daughter. The victim was stabbed twenty-eight times about the throat. The weapon used was an eight-inch serrated knife taken from the kitchen of the home. About $10,000 in jewelry was removed from the residence. The victim\u2019s money was taken. Colvin was found guilty of premeditated murder, felony murder, robbery with a deadly weapon, and housebreaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">As an aggravating circumstance the jury found that the murder was committed while committing or attempting to commit robbery, arson, or rape or sexual offense in the first degree. No mitigating circumstances were found. Colvin had been convicted several times of burglary, assault, and larceny. The jury imposed the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\"><em>James Arthur Calhoun. </em>Calhoun was 28 years of age when he became involved in an incident leading to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>conviction of premeditated first degree murder of a Montgomery County police officer who had responded to a security alarm at a mercantile establishment. The officer, in company with the assistant manager of the store and a representative of the burglar alarm system for the store, entered a room inside the store where Calhoun and an accomplice had concealed themselves. Calhoun pressed a gun against the officer\u2019s head and shot him to death. Calhoun\u2019s accomplice, Curtis Monroe, shot and killed the alarm system representative and wounded the assistant manager. Calhoun and Monroe took money from the store and fled. The jury found as aggravating factors: (1) The victim was a law enforcement officer who was murdered in the performance of his duties; (2) the defendant committed the murder in furtherance of an escape or an attempt to escape from or evade the lawful custody, arrest or detention of or by an officer or guard of a correctional institution or by a law enforcement officer, and (3) the defendant committed the murder while committing or attempting to commit robbery. The only mitigating circumstance found was set forth under \u201c[ojther mitigating circumstances.\u201d The jury stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">\u201cThis jury feels that a substantial mitigating factor is the defendant\u2019s background, which has been such that he has never been integrated into society. Therefore, he has been and is unable to conform with its norms and moral values.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The jury imposed a death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\"><em>Curtis Wayne Monroe. </em>Monroe is the same Monroe mentioned relative to James Arthur Calhoun. The incident is also the same. The report of the trial judge relative to the facts, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">\u201cThe police officer was pulled into a room, subdued, and shot in the head by Calhoun. At the same time, Monroe began firing a handgun, wounding the assistant manager, Douglas Cummins, and firing two shots into the alarm technician, David Myers, resulting in the death of Mr. Myers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Monroe waived a jury and elected to have the sentencing procedure before the trial judge. As an aggravating circumstance it was found beyond a reasonable doubt that Monroe \u201ccommitted the murder while committing or attempting to commit robbery, arson or rape or sexual offense in the first degree.\u201d The trial judge noted two mitigating circumstances. First, he found that it was unlikely the defendant would engage in further criminal activity that would constitute a continuing threat to society. Second, under \u201c[ojther mitigating circumstances,\u201d he found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">\u201cDefendant has been employed, has a wife and two children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">\u201cThe actions of the defendant causing the murder, along with his background when compared to the other first degree murder cases occurring since the enactment of Article 27, Section 413, in which the death penalty has not been imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">\u201cEfforts by the defendant since his incarceration to further his education.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Life imprisonment was imposed. In his report to us the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">\u201cThe primary consideration in not imposing the death penalty was the Court\u2019s own proportionality test in comparison to other offenses in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County in which the death penalty had been sought but not imposed, and a comparison between Curtis Wayne Monroe and the co-defendant James Arthur Calhoun, who received the death penalty, indicated that the imposition of the death penalty was not appropriate in this case. Other mitigating circumstances did not outweigh the aggravating factor and the nature of the offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-10\"><em>Jackie Hughes. </em>While a manager of a restaurant was walking to a nearby bank to deposit weekend receipts, Hughes approached him from behind, grabbed him, spun him around, and shot him in the stomach. After a brief struggle Hughes wrested away the deposit. The victim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>who was licensed to carry a handgun, fired several shots at Hughes at close range. A jury found Hughes guilty of first degree murder on the basis of the fact that it was a deliberate, willful and premeditated murder as well as a felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The jury found as an aggravating factor that the murder was committed while committing or attempting to commit a robbery. As a mitigating factor it found that Hughes had not previously been convicted of a crime of violence, etc. It also checked on the sentencing form that other mitigating circumstances existed. However, it listed no such circumstances. The jury returned a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\"><em>Brian Keith Quickley. </em>Quickley and two others entered a furniture store in Harford County. An accomplice lured the victim to an area of the store isolated from the cash register. Quickley there shot the victim once between the eyes and again, as he was falling, in the back of the neck. The three individuals then left the store, taking television sets with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The jury found one aggravating circumstance, that the defendant committed the murder while committing or attempting to commit a robbery. It found two mitigating circumstances. The first was the youthful age of the defendant at the time of the crime. The second, under \u201c[ojther mitigating circumstances,\u201d was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">\u201cThe defendant is at the borderline range of intelligence with severe intellectual limitations both at the verbal and performance measured levels. His overall Intelligence Quotient was scored at 71. He is the product of an impoverished, social and educational environment. His academic progress has been limited. He has been in and out of Special Education and last attended the ninth grade. Extensive materials (tests, reports, etc.) from Juvenile Services, Harford County Public School System, the Maryland Children\u2019s Center and various social service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>groups have been filed in these proceedings as exhibits that demonstrate these inabilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The jury sentenced him to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">We find the sentences not disproportionate to those imposed in similar cases. It thus follows that the death sentences must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">. <em>\"James\" </em>refers to <em>United States v.

We take cognizance of the fact that the dissent differs with our view as to the purpose for which the Rassa testimony was offered at the trial of Kanaras. We point out that in <em>Kanaras v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 568, 460 A.2d 61, <em>cert. denied, </em>297 Md. 109 (1983), Judge Alpert said for the Court of Special Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">\"In the instant appeal, the rebuttal testimony clearly explained and replied to the evidence which had been offered by the appellant in his defense.

I always bought them.\u2019 Thus, the State was entitled to prove that Kanaras had been involved in drug transactions as a seller. Judge Rasin correctly observed that the central matter at issue in the case was drugs. When the defendant asserted that he was not a drug dealer, the State was entitled to rebut this evidence.\u201d 54 Md.App. at 594, 460 A.2d at 75-76.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b635-5\"> Of course, we do not hold that the same Fifth Amendment concerns are necessarily presented by all types of interviews and examinations that might be ordered or relied upon to inform a sentencing determination.\u201d 451 U.S. at 469, 101 S.Ct. at 1876, 60 L.Ed.2d at 373.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-7\">\u201c2 For good cause shown, the rule permits the trial court to order otherwise.\u201d 302 Md. at 792, 490 A.2d at 1279-80.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b650-8\">McAULIFFE, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AVA\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">I cannot agree that the trial judge properly excluded a transcript of the testimony of Stephen Rassa. Rassa\u2019s testimony was critical to Huffington\u2019s defense, and Rassa could not be found. Huffington therefore offered a transcript of testimony given by Rassa as a State\u2019s witness in the prosecution of Deno Kanaras, but this evidence was rejected on the ground the State had no opportunity to cross-examine its own witness. The majority recognizes that direct-examination by the party against whom the testimony is offered may be sufficient to justify the admission of previous testimony, but affirms on the basis that the motives of the State at the time it offered the evidence differed significantly from those of Huffington when he offered it. A careful analysis of the facts will disclose, however, that Huffington and the State each wanted to develop precisely the same facts from Rassa, and that each did so for the purposes of impeaching Kanaras\u2019 credibility and discrediting his claim of duress. That the State\u2019s motive in the first case was to convict Kanaras by discrediting his testimony and its motive in the second case was to convict Huffington by relying on Kanaras\u2019 testimony is simply irrelevant. It is the identity of the motives of the two parties who offer the testimony that is material, and not the shifting motives of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">The general rule applicable in this situation is not in dispute. Professor Wigmore wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-11\">[T]he whole notion of cross-examination refers to one\u2019s right to probe the statements of an opponent\u2019s witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>not one\u2019s own witness; thus, if A has taken X\u2019s deposition or called X to the stand, and B has cross-examined, it is not for A to object that he has not had the benefit of cross-examination; that benefit was not intended for him nor needed by him; it was intended only to protect against an opponent\u2019s witness, who would be otherwise unexamined by A; and if A has had the benefit of examining a witness called on his own behalf, he has had all that he needs, and the right to probe by cross-examination is B\u2019s, not A\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">5 Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 1389 at 105 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">And in a more recent text the authors pose and answer the question in this fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">Is the opportunity for direct and redirect examination the equivalent of the opportunity for cross-examination? If party A (or his predecessor in interest) calls and examines a witness in the first hearing, and this testimony is offered against A in a second trial, may it come in against the objection of want of opportunity to cross-examine? The decisions sensibly hold that it may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\"><em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 255 at 762 (E. Cleary 3d ed. 1984).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Fed.ft.Evid. 804(b)(1) is to the same effect, and describes the circumstances under which the former testimony of an unavailable witness will not be excluded by operation of the hearsay rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-10\">Testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of the same or another proceeding, if the party against whom the testimony is now offered, or, in a civil action or proceeding, a predecessor in interest, had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">The pivotal question, then, is whether the State had a motive similar to that of Huffington to develop the testimony of Rassa. This in turn requires a consideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>issues intended to be addressed by the testimony in each case, and as indicated by the following advisory committee note to Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1) the question is whether there exists a \u201csubstantial\u201d identity of issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The common law did not limit the admissibility of former testimony to that given in an earlier trial of the same case, although it did require identity of issues as a means of insuring that the former handling of the witness was the equivalent of what would not be done if the opportunity were presented. Modern decisions reduce the requirement to \u201csubstantial\u201d identity. Since identity of issues is significant only in that it bears on motive and interest in developing fully the testimony of the witness, expressing the matter in the latter terms is preferable. (Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">We look first at Huffington\u2019s motive in seeking to introduce the testimony of Rassa. It was clear from the State\u2019s evidence that only two persons in addition to the victim were present on the occasion of each murder \u2014 Kanaras and Huffington. Kanaras was therefore the State\u2019s principal witness against Huffington. Kanaras testified that he was with Huffington on the night of the murders, but that Huffington killed each victim. Kanaras denied any previous knowledge that Joseph Hudson or Diane Becker were going to be robbed or murdered, and he further asserted that while he had been forced by Huffington at gunpoint to provide some assistance he did not assist in any way in the actual killing of the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Kanaras testified he had known Hudson and Huffington for some time, and had purchased drugs from both of them. On the night in question he and Huffington were attempting to purchase cocaine when they met Hudson and Becker (Hudson\u2019s girlfriend) at a bar. Arrangements were made to buy the drug from Hudson, and Kanaras drove Huffington to the trailer shared by Hudson and Becker. Kanaras said Hudson sold them 3.5 grams, which appeared to be about half the supply Hudson had on hand. He said he and Huffington then returned to Huffington\u2019s apartment where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>they used some cocaine and Huffington apparently made calls in an attempt to broker the sale of Hudson\u2019s remaining cocaine. Acting on the belief that Huffington had found a buyer, and upon the promise that Huffington would give him some additional cocaine for providing transportation, Kanaras said he drove Huffington back to the Hudson trailer, where Hudson joined them. He then drove, at the direction of Huffington, to a rural area in Harford County and stopped near a farmhouse. According to Kanaras, he was walking alongside Hudson toward the farmhouse to meet the prospective purchaser when Huffington fired five shots into Hudson. Kanaras said that Huffington then reloaded the pistol, rolled the body of Hudson over, and fired two more shots into Hudson\u2019s head at point-blank range. Kanaras admitted that the weapon used had once been owned by him, but claimed he had sold it to Huffing-ton about five weeks earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Kanaras said Huffington then pointed the gun at him and ordered him to drive back to the trailer. Once inside the trailer Kanaras was directed to search for Hudson\u2019s money. Following a successful search, Kanaras said Huffington struck the sleeping Diane Becker several times with a heavy bottle, and then repeatedly stabbed her with a knife Huffington produced from his boot. Kanaras testified he was then forced to accept a large amount of the money that had been stolen from Hudson, and to assist Huffington in destroying or disposing of evidence and attempting to establish an alibi. Kanaras denied he had been to Hudson\u2019s trailer during the week preceding the murders, and denied having possessed a gun at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Rassa\u2019s testimony dealt with the events of May 20, 1981, five days before the murders. Rassa testified he and Kanaras had driven to Hudson\u2019s trailer on that date, to buy cocaine. In response to direct questions by the State\u2019s Attorney, Rassa described the events immediately preceding entry into Hudson\u2019s trailer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">A. Well, there had been a lot of discussion on the way down Long Bar Harbor Road between Deno and myself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>and Deno had told me he was interested in going to Joe\u2019s trailer \u2014 Joe Hudson \u2014 to buy some cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-4\"><em>% </em>5js sjs sfc j}: &gt;*:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">Deno became very quiet.

Okay. As he was pulling his car to a stop outside of the motor home \u2014 excuse me \u2014 I want'to be absolutely sure. I can remember that as the car was coming to a stop he turned towards me and he reached underneath of my seat, and I said, \u201cWhat are you doing\u201d, and he said, \u201cI\u2019m getting my gun.\u201d And I said, \u201cLeave it there. Don\u2019t get your gun. I don\u2019t want any parts of anything like this.\u201d And I looked both ways outside of the car because I didn\u2019t want to be seen. I wasn\u2019t really sure what was going to happen at that time____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-10\">I said, \u201cCome on, Deno, let\u2019s go in.\u201d, and he said, he reached under the seat again, and I said again, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d, and he said, \u201cI\u2019m just getting my gun. I just want to show it to you,\u201d And I said, \u201cDeno, I don\u2019t need to see your gun. I\u2019ve seen it before. Just leave it there.\u201d At that time I said to Deno \u201cIs there something you\u2019re not telling me? Do you owe Joe money?\u201d And there was no reply. I looked at him and I said, \u201cDo you actually think that you could actually rob and shoot somebody in the middle of a crowded trailer park like this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>in daylight, and do you actually think you could shoot someone?\u201d And there was no reply. Deno then \u2014 excuse me \u2014 I said to Deno \u2014 no, excuse me again \u2014 Deno said, \u201cI have a knife in the glove compartment.\u201d And I said, \u201cAre you crazy?

Rassa directly contradicted Kanaras\u2019 testimony that he had not been to the Hudson trailer on May 20th, that he had not had a gun on that date, and that he had not discussed robbing Hudson at that time. Furthermore, if the jury believed that Kanaras was contemplating a robbery of Hudson just five days before the robbery and murders occurred, and was discussing with Rassa the possible use of the very types of weapons actually thereafter used, the jury would most likely refuse to believe Kanaras\u2019 protestations of being an innocent pawn in the hands of Huffington. Rassa\u2019s evidence permitted a reasonable inference that Kanaras had been a principal actor in the robbery and murder, and such evidence may well have created a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors that Huffington was the actual killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Turning to the State\u2019s motive in offering the testimony of Rassa during the trial of Kanaras, it is apparent that it was substantially, if not precisely identical to Huffington\u2019s motive. Testimony given by Kanaras in his own behalf was the same as that later given by him against Huffington. <em>See Kanaras v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 568, 570-72, 460 A.2d 61, <em>cert. denied, </em>297 Md. 109 (1983). Kanaras\u2019 defense was that he did not knowingly aid or abet in the death of Hudson, and that any assistance rendered thereafter was under duress. Following Kanaras\u2019 testimony, the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>offered the testimony of four rebuttal witnesses. The proffered testimony of these witnesses was summarized by the Court of Special Appeals as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">It was proffered that Stephen Rassa would testify that on May 20, 1981, shortly before purchasing cocaine from Hudson and Becker, Kanaras supposedly had to be dissuaded from robbing Hudson and stealing his cocaine. It was further proffered that Dale Saunders, Jr. would testify that Huffington and Kanaras came to \u201cshake him down for money\u201d due on a drug debt. Maryland State Trooper Gary Aschenbach, according to the State\u2019s proffer, would testify that while working undercover in early 1981, Kanaras had purchased drugs for him, had on one occasion carried a gun in anticipation of a large drug deal, and had expressed interest in an illegal scheme to destroy a boat for money. The testimony of Thomas Wagner, according to the State, would show that Kanaras had shown him what was to be the murder weapon. <em>Kanaras v. State, supra, </em>54 Md.App. at 589, 460 A.2d 61.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALU\">Expressing some uncertainty that all the evidence proffered by the State was properly offered as rebuttal, the trial judge allowed the State to reopen its case, and thus Rassa\u2019s testimony became a part of the State\u2019s case in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The majority states that \u201cthe purport of Rassa\u2019s testimony was that a few days before the incident in question Kanaras was still involved with drugs\u201d and that this evidence was offered in rebuttal to Kanaras\u2019 earlier testimony that he had been free from drugs for some time before the murders. From this the majority concludes that the very limited objective of the State in offering this testimony differed substantially from the broader scope later intended by Huffington, and that the State therefore had no reasonable opportunity or motive to fully develop the facts about which Huffington was later concerned. The majority\u2019s conclusion is not supported by the facts. Kanaras had at all times readily admitted his involvement as a buyer and user of drugs. He did deny, however, that he sold drugs. The Court of Special Appeals held that rebuttal evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>would be proper to show that Kanaras had been involved as a seller, but this clearly was not the principal thrust of Rassa\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A fair reading of the entirety of Rassa\u2019s testimony discloses an intent on the part of the State to discredit Kanaras\u2019 testimony, and show him to have been a principal. The Court of Special Appeals summed up the intent of the State when it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">[A]n important facet of the State\u2019s case was to prove that the appellant was a voluntary participant in the crimes. As such, it was proper to show that Kanaras both needed and lusted for money, had participated in prior drug transactions, and may have specifically considered robbing Hudson. The additional State\u2019s evidence supplied a motive for the crimes and supplied evidence of advance preparation for the crimes. As such, it was admissible to show an independent intent and motive to commit the crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\"><em>Kanaras v. State, supra, </em>54 Md.App. at 595, 460 A.2d 61.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afq2\">The importance of Rassa\u2019s testimony to assist the trier of fact in assessing the credibility of Kanaras is perhaps best illustrated by the argument of the State\u2019s Attorney in support of the State\u2019s motion to have Kanaras called as a court\u2019s witness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The following reasons, I\u2019m going to basically go through a skeleton sketch of what he would testify and and why we don\u2019t believe we can believe him. His first indication would be that the first time that he had heard this particular incident or that this came about that he was aware that anybody was going to rob Joseph Hudson and Diane Becker was that night that it actually occurred \u2014 first of all, a witness tes \u2014 has testified, a State\u2019s witness has testified in a prior trial that Kanaras had discussed with him and tried to get him to rob Hudson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>sometime prior to this, and therefore we believe \u2014 it is the State\u2019s contention that we believe \u2014 what we believe is that Kanaras wanted to rob Hudson, didn\u2019t have the whatever to do it by himself, and continued looking for someone to help him with this robbery after that contact with that particular individual, and that he was successful in finding this other person in the person of the defendant before the Court. That\u2019s the State\u2019s theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"AeZ\">The previous sworn testimony of Rassa was necessary for the proper presentation of the defendant\u2019s case and substantial reasons existed to assume its reliability. The testimony was admissible under accepted rules of evidence in this State, and in any event admissible to afford the defendant due process of law. <em>Green v. Georgia, </em>442 U.S. 95, 99 S.Ct. 2150, 60 L.Ed.2d 738 (1979); <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973). I would reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">I am authorized to state that Judges ELDRIDGE and COLE concur in the views here expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-8\">. Rassa did not testify to any sale of drugs by Kanaras, but he did say that he and Kanaras had on occasion jointly attempted to sell methamphetamine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b657-9\">. This motion was denied, and Kanaras was called as a State\u2019s witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
