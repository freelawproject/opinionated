The Maryland Beer Franchise Fair Dealing Act, Maryland Code (1974, 1981 Repl.Vol.), Art. 2B, \u00a7 203A <em>et seq. </em>(the \u201cAct\u201d) was enacted in 1974. In \u00a7 203A(a) of the Act, the General Assembly expressly recognized the problem confronting beer distributors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Act protects beer distributors from unlawful inducements, threats and terminations by beer manufacturers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Since 1974, however, the nature of beer distribution, in this State and nationwide has changed dramatically. There are now far fewer manufacturers of beer products, and distributors typically handle several brands of beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Appellant, E and S, is a Maryland corporation engaged in the distribution of beer products. Appellee, Pabst Brewing Company, Inc. (\u201cPabst\u201d) is a Delaware corporation which produces beer products.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">On June 16, 1982, E and S entered into a Distribution Agreement with Pabst whereby E and S was granted the exclusive right to sell in Howard County, Maryland, four \u201clabels\u201d or brands of Pabst\u2019s products. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Agreement did not expressly accord E and S the distribution rights in Pabst beer products other than those stated in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In March of 1983, Pabst merged with Olympia Brewing Company (\u201cOlympia\u201d). Consequently, Pabst acquired the brands labelled \u201cHamm\u2019s,\u201d \u201cHamm\u2019s Special Light,\u201d \u201cOlympia,\u201d \u201cOlympia Light,\u201d and \u201cMaxx Lager.\u201d This boosted Pabst\u2019s beer brand inventory to at least eleven.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Subsequent to its merger with Olympia, Pabst solicited marketing proposals from several beer distributors for the distribution of Hamm\u2019s and Hamm\u2019s Special Light in a selected number of Maryland distribution territories. E and S was one of approximately ten distributors to submit a marketing plan. After reviewing the plans, Pabst chose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>A.E. Davies, Inc. (\u201cDavies\u201d), rather than E and S, to distribute the Hamm\u2019s beers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The agreement between Pabst and Davies which became effective April 12, 1983, granted to Davies the exclusive right to distribute Hamm\u2019s and Hamm\u2019s Special Light beers in Howard County, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">On or about March 31, 1983, E and S instituted this action for injunctive relief in the Circuit Court for Frederick County, Maryland, claiming that Pabst violated sections 203B and 203E. The case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (1982) on or about April 26, 1983. Judge Hargrove of that court certified questions to this Court on joint motion of the parties and further proceedings were stayed pending our resolution thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Whether \u00a7 203E of the Maryland Beer Franchise' Fair Dealing Act, Maryland Code (1974, 1981 Repl.Vol.), Article \u25a0 2B, \u00a7 203A <em>et seq., </em>requires a beer franchisor to grant to a distributor of specified brands of beer in a given territory, the right to distribute a brand of beer which the franchisor acquired after the execution of the original distributorship agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">We are called upon to once again apply the familiar rules of statutory construction. This Court has repeatedly discussed and applied these well-founded principles.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The principles are particularly applicable to the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">In resolving the first certified question before us, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>we initially look to the language in the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If it is clear and unambiguous, then we need look no further. <em>See Mayor of Baltimore v. Hackley, </em>300 Md. 277, 283, 477 A.2d 1174, 1177 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Section 203E reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">\u201cEstablishment of dual distributorships in same territory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">\u201cNo franchisor, who shall designate a sales territory for which any franchisee shall be primarily responsible or in which any franchisee is required to concentrate its efforts, shall enter into any franchise or agreement with any other beer distributor for the purpose of establishing an additional franchisee for its brand or brands of beer in the territory being primarily served or concentrated upon by a licensed franchisee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Maryland Code (1974, 1981 Repl.Vol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">E and S argues that the language set forth in \u00a7 203E requires a manufacturer of beer products to market all of its brands or \u201clabels\u201d through a single distributor in a given territory.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The reasonableness of this proposition is simple and clear to E and S: that, in enacting Article 2B, entitled \u201cAlcoholic Beverages,\u201d of which \u00a7\u00a7 203A <em>et seq. </em>are but one part, the legislature sought to put in place a comprehensive scheme designed to completely preempt freedom of contract in this area and regulate all relationships existing between manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors of alcohol. The result of this interpretation is equally reasonable and understandably attractive to E and S. A manufacturer would have to comply with the statute by providing <em>all </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>its brands of beer, whether the subject of a franchise agreement or not, to a single distributor in a given territory, or not sell beer in that territory. To buttress its argument, E and S seizes the words \u201cor brands\u201d from the phrase \u201c... for the purpose of establishing an additional franchisee for its brand or brands ...\u201d to illustrate the legislature\u2019s intention that <em>all </em>brands of beer newly manufactured or subsequently acquired by a franchisor be provided to a single distributor in a particular sales territory. We disagree. We find subsection (a) of \u00a7 203A particularly instructive in our determination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A plain reading of that section makes clear the concern of the legislature that temperance in alcohol consumption be promoted. To effectuate this intent, the legislature sought to protect the local beer distributor from those practices of manufacturers motivated to induce or coerce the weaker distributors into stimulating sales of beer products.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">In light of \u00a7 203A(a), we must construe \u00a7 203E, not only so as to render it effective, <em>Pickett v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>291 Md. 648, 661, 436 A.2d 449, 456 (1981), but with reference to the purposes the legislature sought to accomplish. <em>See Cook v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 634, 642, 490 A.2d 1311, 1314 (1985); <em>Howard County Ass \u2019n for Retarded Citizens, Inc. v. </em>Walls, 288 Md. 526, 530, 418 A.2d 1210, 1213 (1980). We conclude that the proper and intended interpretation of \u00a7 203E, that beer manufacturers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>are prohibited from selling any <em>particular </em>brand or brands of beer through <em>more than one </em>distributor in a <em>particular </em>territory, is consistent with those policy considerations enunciated in \u00a7 203A(a) and gleaned from the Act as a whole. Such an interpretation lends itself to the protection of local distributors and the promotion of temperance by limiting each distribution channel to a particular brand or brands of beer. Moreover, neither the distributor nor the manufacturer are in any way prejudiced by such a limitation. The distributor is assured that its franchise agreement will not be jeopardized or terminated by a manufacturer absent a showing of good cause under \u00a7 203C. Further, the manufacturer is assured that its distributor will focus its attention on promoting, marketing and selling the brand or brands of beer assigned exclusively to the distributor.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">E and S presses that \u00a7 203E accomplishes more, suggesting a manufacturer must confine <em>all </em>of its <em>brands </em>to a single distributor in a given territory. We think this argument proves too much and presents a host of problems. A court must shun a construction of a statute which will lead to absurd consequences. <em>Coerper v. Comptroller, </em>265 Md. 3, 6, 288 A.2d 187, 188 (1972); <em>Doswell v. State, </em>53 Md.App. 647, 653, 455 A.2d 995, 999 (1983). We illustrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">First, to adopt such an interpretation would be to bestow upon all distributors a right akin to a first refusal in all those brands of beer made or acquired by their manufacturers, without regard to existing franchise agreements <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or whether the new labels had been acquired by the manufacturer subsequent to execution of the franchise agreement. We are unable to construe any language of \u00a7 203E as granting such broad powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Second, were E and S to prevail, Pabst would be forced either to terminate existing Olympia distributors in those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Maryland counties having a Pabst distributor, such as E and S, or maintain a distribution arrangement utilizing both Pabst distributors and Olympia distributors to carry Hamm\u2019s beers in direct contravention of \u00a7 203E. We do not believe the legislature intended to create such a situation. <em>Coerper, </em>265 Md. at 3, 288 A.2d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">E and S contends such a situation is easily remedied by resort to the Act\u2019s elaborate termination provisions, set forth in sections 203C and D.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree and find this contention without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Our prior discussion makes clear that the legislature, in drafting the Act, did not intend to create a situation whereby a beer manufacturer would be forced to choose between violating \u00a7 203E in maintaining two or more distributors in a given territory for the promotion of a particular brand or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>brands of beer, and terminating one or more of its franchise agreements so as to avoid a \u00a7 203E violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">If a manufacturer opts for the latter choice, a distributor may well find its franchise agreement terminated for reasons wholly unrelated to its performance under the agreement. It is questionable whether the reasons for termination in such a case would constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d as that phrase is contemplated in \u00a7 203C.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, a manufacturer may be forced to arbitrarily choose which distributor or distributors to terminate if such factors as performance and ability are indistinguishable or equally satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Clearly, to interpret these provisions as placing a manufacturer in such a position would also be to place the rights of distributors under the Act in jeopardy. We decline to do so. To do otherwise would be to render the Act inconsistent and ineffective. <em>Pickett v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>291 Md. 648, 661, 436 A.2d 449, 456 (1981); <em>see Mayor of Baltimore v. Hackley, </em>300 Md. 277, 283, 477 A.2d 1174, 1177 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">We now consider E and S\u2019s attempt to construe the term \u201cdual distributorships,\u201d as that term appears in the caption to Article 2B, \u00a7 203E, as illustrative of the legislature\u2019s intention to prevent a manufacturer of beer products from working with more than one distributor in a particular territory, regardless of the number of brands a manufacturer has. We summarily dismiss this argument as wholly misplaced. E and S ignores the settled rule that a caption is not part of the law, unless expressly provided or part of the law as enacted. <em>Smelser v. Criterion Ins. Co., </em>293 Md. 384, 444 A.2d 1024 (1982); <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>39 Md.App. 547, 553, 387 A.2d 622, 625 (1978). The caption quoted by E and S is not part of \u00a7 203E as enacted. 1974 Md.Laws Ch. 877. It constitutes a mere \u201ccatchword\u201d indicative of the content of that section. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Md.Code, Art. 1, \u00a7 18; <em>Montgomery County v. Eli, </em>20 Md.App. 269, 275-76, 315 A.2d 136, 140 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Whether \u00a7 203B of the Maryland Beer Franchise Fair Dealing Act, Maryland Code (1974, 1981 Repl.V\u00f3l.), Article 2B, \u00a7 203A <em>et seq., </em>grants a beer distributor the right to order and receive a brand of beer that is not covered by the distributor\u2019s franchise agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">We now turn our attention to the second and last question certified to us for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">E and S first argues that, even assuming <em>arguendo, </em>that Pabst were correct in its interpretation of \u00a7 203E, Pabst still must contend with its violation of \u00a7 203B.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is uncontroverted that the marketing plan submitted by E and S for the distribution of the Hamm\u2019s label contained an order.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is further uncontroverted that Pabst did not deliver any beer in response to that order. E and S concludes that Pabst\u2019s subsequent franchise agreement with Davies granting Davies the right to distribute the Hamm\u2019s beers was not only in direct contravention of its distribution agreement with E and S, but also violated \u00a7 203B since Pabst did not fulfill E and S\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">We think this argument must fail. Inherent in E and S\u2019s argument is the assumption that, by virtue of its existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>distributorship agreement with Pabst, E and S has a right under the Act to receive from Pabst delivery of all brands of beer ordered by it. The Hamm\u2019s beer would, of course, fall prey to this assumption. As we have discussed, however, the Act bestows no such authority upon a distributor such as E and S, simply by virtue of a distributorship agreement. Absent this, E and S\u2019s argument cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Pabst offers yet another interpretation of \u00a7 203B. It contends \u00a7 203B was enacted as part of a general scheme to prevent unfair conduct by beer manufacturers. Pabst concedes that when a beer distributor places an order with a manufacturer, that manufacturer may fulfill the order. However, Pabst argues that a distributor is only entitled to delivery by a beer manufacturer if that distributor is authorized to distribute those brands of beer ordered, by way of a franchise or agreement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Section 203B specifically provides \u201cNo beer manufacturer shall ... (3) fail or refuse to deliver to a beer distributor <em>having a franchise, or agreement, </em>any beer publicly advertised by it or its agents for immediate sale promptly after <em>such </em>beer distributor\u2019s order shall have been received.\u201d Md.Code, Art. 2B, \u00a7 203B. (emphasis supplied). We must construe a statute as a whole; a court may not insert or omit words to make a statute express an intention not evidenced in its original form. <em>Hackley, </em>300 Md. at 283, 477 A.2d at 1177.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">It is clear that, when read in conjunction with \u00a7\u00a7 203A and E, as well as the remaining provisions of the Act, \u00a7 203B only contemplates entitling delivery of brands of beer publicly advertised by beer manufacturers to those beer distributors having distribution rights to those brands under a franchise or agreement. Such an interpretation is reasonable and consistent with the underlying policy declarations surrounding the entire Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>QUESTIONS OF LAW ANSWERED AS HEREIN SET FORTH; COSTS TO BE EQUALLY DIVIDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\">.
