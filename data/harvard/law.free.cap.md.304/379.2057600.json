Cockrell, a member of the Bar of this Court. The petition asserted that Cockrell violated Disciplinary Rules 1-102(A), (1), (4), (5), (6);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Disciplinary Rule 6-101 (A) (3);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Disciplinary Rule 7-101 (A), (1), (2), (3)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in his repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>sentation of Mozella Ziglar. The petition also asserted that Cockrell, in his representations of Alice Tanner, violated Disciplinary Rules 1-102 (A) (1), (5), (6); Disciplinary Rule 6-101 (A) (3); and Disciplinary Rules 7-101 (A) (1), (2), (3). It was further asserted that Cockrell violated Disciplinary Rules 1-102 (A) (1), (3), (4), (5), (6); Disciplinary Rules 9-102 (A) (1), (2)* <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in his representation of various clients between January 1, 1982 and May 29, 1984. Finally the petition alleged that Cockrell violated Maryland Code, Art. 10, sec. 44, relative to escrow funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Pursuant to Rule BY9 b, we referred the matter for hearing to a judge of the Third Judicial Circuit of Maryland. Following a hearing, the hearing judge made written findings of fact and conclusions of law in each of the three matters which, after reviewing the record, we adopt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZY\">\n<em>\u201cFindings of Fact: Ziglar Case</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6k\">\u201cPursuant to obtaining a decree of divorce, this Court by clear and convincing evidence finds Ms. Ziglar paid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Respondent $260.00. A Bill of Complaint for a Divorce A Vinculo Matrimonii was drawn up but the decree was never finalized because of Respondent\u2019s failure to serve the husband, pursuant to then-Maryland Rule 530 which states in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-4\">Rule 530. Dismissal for Lack of Jurisdiction or Prosecution ...,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">C. For Lack of Prosecution \u2014 Exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">An action is subject to dismissal for lack of prosecution at the expiration of one year from the last docket entry other than an entry made under this Rule, Rule 124, or Rule 125, except that an action for divorce a mensa et thoro and for permanent alimony is subject to dismissal under this section only after two years from the last docket entry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">In addition, we note that no effort was made by Respondent to serve by publication. Mr. Cockrell testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD9\">Her husband was never located, and on the question of the Daily Record, after we had problems locating him I told her, I said \u2018We can run an order of publication, but that will take time.... I told her the better way would be to try to locate her husband, and that\u2019s what happened to the case, Your Honor. (T. 39).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">In mitigation, Mr. Cockrell argued that he was just serving the best interest of his client:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">... If you can find your husband now, no problem, we can get it through earlier, but if I have to go through this procedure, it\u2019s got to run in the paper 3 weeks in a row to get it through, and the expense involved____ (T. 39).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">Mr. Cockrell also argued that Ms. Ziglar\u2019s purpose in contacting the Grievance Commission was not to file a complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-13\">... She was simply trying to locate me. If she had contacted me at that point, I would have gone ahead and proceeded with it. (T. 38).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Ms. Ziglar made repeated attempts to contact Respondent, but to no avail until the Attorney Grievance Commission intervened. At this point she was apprised that her case had been dismissed. She requested and received her $260.00 fee back from Mr. Cockrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\n<em>Conclusions of Law: Ziglar Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ACG\">The Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated the three disciplinary rules cited above [DR 1-102, DR 6-101, and DR 7-101] by his inattention to the case and by his failure to properly process the divorce action. He did not keep his client informed and did not respond to her reasonable requests for information. However, the Court does not find by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. [DR 1-102(A)(4) ].</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\n<em>Findings of Fact: Tanner Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AxV\">This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent was presented with a plethora of professional problems in regards to Alice Tanner. And as Mr. Cockrell testified, undoubtedly he was treating her as a \u2018whole person\u2019 and \u2018keeping her on this side of sanity\u2019 as far as her relationship with her husband was concerned. More specifically, however, he was asked to represent her when she was injured on August 26 and September 8, 1981 while riding an MTA bus (Court files, Petitioner\u2019s Exhibits 11, 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">In the instant proceeding, William Edgar Carson, a Transit Casualty Company claims supervisor, testified as to the claim filed by Alice Tanner. Mr. Carson, in reading from his records, showed a letter of representation from Mr. Cockrell dated September 21, 1981. (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 9). Then his records reflected a series of phone calls made by the casualty company to Respondent which were never acknowledged. Finally, on January 20, 1983, Mr. Ed Brizendine, his supervisor, wrote a letter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Mr. Cockrell informing him that a year and four months had passed and that the case would be closed if he was not advised to the contrary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">Dear Mr. Cockrell: It has been a year and four months since we have received your letter of representation in regard to this case. To date we have received no documentation of any description, despite numerous efforts to contact you and your office. If you are still interested in this case, please so advise and furnish documentation. If you are not interested please so advise, and we will close it____ (T. 101).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Mr. Carson testified that no response was obtained and the file was closed on May 18, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">In response, Mr. Cockrell testified that he could not file a claim because, in turning the case over to his paralegals, he is not sure whether the medical report from Dr. Mitchell was received; and if received, was somewhere in the warehouse files:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">Q. Mr. Cockrell, it is true, is it not that none of your files demonstrate any medical records on Mrs. Tanner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">A. To my knowledge I never got it (Dr. Mitchell\u2019s report). Certainly the records do not show, but that takes us back to the warehouse again. (T. 125, 126).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhM\">Mr. Cockrell further testified that there was no other medical evidence of the accident other than Dr. Mitchell\u2019s report. In support of his efforts to contact Dr. Mitchell, Respondent submitted a letter from his office requesting the report (Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 4). In support of his efforts to contact Ms. Tanner\u2019s employers, Respondent submitted a letter drafted by his paralegal, Miss Haines (Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 5). He then introduced a profile sheet on Ms. Tanner (Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 6) and a series of letters dated July 9, 1984 (Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 7), July 22, 1984 (Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 9), and September 12, 1984 (Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 10), informing Ms. Tanner that her case was still in the process of being settled. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Alice Tanner died on August 25, 1984 as a result of an automobile accident. (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">As to bringing a claim on behalf of the estate, Mr. Cockrell testified that it was a personal injury claim and without her deposition to introduce into evidence, everything would be hearsay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">... I\u2019ve had some unfortunate experiences in prior cases like this, where you go to a lot of time, trouble and expense and everything, where there\u2019s a missing ingredient ... it\u2019s a personal injury matter, and without her deposition ... and she\u2019s dead ... Everything that I have, practically, would be hearsay. (T. 124).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aih\">Therefore, when asked to respond to the Transit Casualty Company\u2019s interrogatories, \u2018he could not make out a case.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\n<em>Conclusions of Law: Tanner Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ARG\">This Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated the three disciplinary rules cited earlier [DR 1-102, DR 6-101, and DR 7-101] by his neglect of a legal matter entrusted to him, by his failure to respond to the Transit Casualty Company\u2019s request for documentation thereby causing the insurance claim to be dismissed, and by his failure to keep his client informed and to respond to her reasonable requests for information.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\n<em>The Allen Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">The Respondent, by his acts or omissions in the Allen Complaint, was charged with violating the following Disciplinary Rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">Disciplinary Rule 1-102 Misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">(A) A lawyer shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-11\">(1) Violate a Disciplinary Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-12\">(3) Engage in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>(4) Engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">(5) Engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">(6) Engage in any other conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-p\">Disciplinary Rule 9-102</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">Preserving Identity of Funds and Property of a Client.</p>\n<p id=\"AVc\">(A) All funds of clients paid to a lawyer or a law firm other than advances for costs and expenses, shall be deposited in one or more identifiable bank accounts maintained in the state in which the law office is situated and no funds belonging to the lawyer or law firm shall be deposited therein except as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">(1) Funds reasonably sufficient to pay bank charges may be deposited therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-11\">(2) Funds belonging in part to a client and in part presently or potentially to the lawyer or law firm must be deposited therein, but the portion belonging to the lawyer or law firm may be withdrawn when due unless the right of the lawyer or law firm to receive it is disputed by the client, in which event the disputed portion shall not be withdrawn until the dispute is finally resolved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzI\">Code of Professional Responsibility, Maryland Rule 1230, Appendix F, Annotated Code of Maryland, and Article 10, Section 44 of the Annotated Code of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">\n<em>Findings of Fact: The Allen Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">Several complaints alleging commingling of funds have been lodged against the Respondent in what has been designated \u2018the Allen Complaint.\u2019 It was that complaint, brought before the Grievance Commission on May 29, 1984, that gave rise to the investigation into other escrow accounts held in Mr. Cockrell\u2019s name. Deposits into the First National Bank of Maryland account, the \u2018Allen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Complaint\u2019 account, by checks drawn on other accounts, alerted the Grievance Commission to the Union Trust and Equitable Trust accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Respondent entered a continuous objection to the inclusion of the above-named bank records in the \u2018Allen Complaint\u2019 at a bench conference (T. 137) and later in a Supplemental Memorandum, dated May 23, 1985. Relying strenuously on <em>In Re Ruffalo, </em>[390 U.S. 544] 83 S.C. 1222 [20 L.Ed.2d 117] (1968), and <em>Bar Ass\u2019n. v. Cockrell, </em>274 Md. 279 [334 A.2d 85] (1975), Respondent contended that he did not receive proper notice of these charges. He also argued that these \u2018additional matters\u2019 should have been remanded to the Inquiry Panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Turning to the notice issue, the Court finds that <em>Ruffalo </em>and <em>Cockrell </em>are not supportive of Respondent\u2019s position. In <em>Ruffalo, </em>additional charges were brought against the accused attorney on the basis of his testimony in the state court proceeding. In Maryland, the proceedings referred to in <em>Ruffalo </em>begin when the Petition for Disciplinary Action is filed in the Court of Appeals. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n. v. McBurney, </em>282 Md. 116, 124 [383 A.2d 58] (1978). The United States Supreme Court held that this absence of fair notice as to the precise nature of the charges deprived the attorney of procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Similarly in <em>Cockrell, </em>the original charges were based on the testimony Cockrell had given at the first Panel Hearing. The disposition of the original complaint was referred to a new panel of judges for consideration of the supplemental charges. The Court of Appeals, relying on <em>Ruffalo, </em>concluded that these new charges could not form the basis for disciplinary action because the evidentiary foundation was \u2018tainted,\u2019 <em>supra </em>[274 Md.] at 287, [334 A.2d 85]. Judge Digges, <em>supra </em>[274 Md.] at 285 [334 A.2d 85], quoted for the Court from <em>Ruffalo, supra </em>[390 U.S.] at 551 [88 S.Ct. at 1226]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">The charge must be known before the proceedings commence. They become a trap when, after they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>underway, the charges are amended on the basis of the testimony of the accused. He can then be given \u25a0 no opportunity to expunge the earlier statements and start afresh.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Here, unlike the situation in <em>Cockrell, supra, </em>Respondent has known from the outset the nature of the charges against him. Respondent knew he was being charged with commingling of clients\u2019 funds at the Inquiry Panel proceedings. The purpose of an Inquiry Panel is investigatory in nature and informal to the extent that the rules of evidence need not apply. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n. v. Stewart, </em>285 Md. 251, 259 [401 A.2d 1026] (1979); <em>McBurney, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">As to notice, the above-cited cases stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">More important, if a lawyer is given notice and the opportunity to defend in a full and fair hearing before a three-judge panel,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the question whether he was accorded due process of law by the Inquiry Panel and the Review Board is ordinarily immaterial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Accordingly, we find that Respondent was afforded notice and opportunity to defend following the institution of disciplinary proceedings in the Court of Appeals. Indeed, the charges brought in Paragraphs 23-26, <em>supra, </em>are not limited to the \u2018Allen Complaint\u2019 but address the complaints of clients in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">At this point, we should also address Respondent\u2019s reliance on <em>Ruffalo </em>to support his allegations that Disciplinary Proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature thereby entitling the accused attorney to a claim of privilege. This reliance led Respondent to object to the introduction of his deposition into testimony. (T. 52). This Court finds that <em>Ruffalo </em>is inapposite. <em>Ruffalo </em>deals with notice and due process. Once again, we must look to Maryland law for guidance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>A disciplinary action against an attorney does not involve a potential criminal or quasi-criminal sanction for the purpose of the privilege against self-incrimination provided by the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n. v. Sugarman, </em>273 Md. 306 [329 A.2d 1] (1974).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">In support of the charges of commingling and misappropriating clients\u2019 funds, the Attorney Grievance Commission produced an expert witness, Mr. Bauer. Mr. Bauer testified that (1) Respondent had deposited his own funds into escrow accounts; (2) Respondent had deposited the funds of one client into an escrow account upon which he drew to pay other debts. This account resulted in several negative balances.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">As to the first item, Mr. Bauer compiled four charts: An Analysis of Deposits of Attorney\u2019s Funds into the Paul J. Cockrell Escrow Account at First National Bank of Maryland, Account # 082-0002-2 (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit No. 14, 15); ... at Equitable Trust Company (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit No. 16); and ... at Union Trust Bank (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit No. 17). The First National Bank Charts (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibits No. 14, 15) were the only ones analyzed during testimony. One chart indicated a series of checks for deposit from Capital Savings and Loan Association made out to Paul J. Cockrell for $2,550; $4,250; and $2,500 and American Express Money Orders on Capital Savings and Loan Association to Paul J. Cockrell from Paul J. Cockrell for $500, $300, $1,000, $650, and $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Next, Mr. Bauer turned to clients funds deposited in the First National Bank Account (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit No. 14). As Mr. Bauer explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">This is an analysis of the bank account with the starting date, the opening balance, January 7th of 1983, of zero... On January 19th, 1983, there was a check deposited for $9,350.00, and the check payee was James and Bessie Sommerville, individually, and Paul Cockrell, their attorney. This check was from Ohio Casualty and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>indicated that the insured was Reginald Groom. Following that there were withdrawals from the account..... (T. 161).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Mr. Bauer then recites a series of withdrawals, none of which relate to the Sommerville settlement until February 2, 1983, when a check was issued to James Sommerville for- $3,061.58. After more unrelated withdrawals, another check was issued to James Sommerville for $582.12. That check was returned for insufficient funds. At this point, Mr. Bauer testifies, the account shows a negative overdraft of $267.54.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Mr. Bauer concludes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">For this all entire three pages the only money in there was that from the check issued to James and Bessie Sommerville of $9,350.00 on January 19th, since there was a zero balance when that was deposited in the account and there were no other deposits. (T. 164, 165).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">When asked whether there were any other accounts whose balance fell below the amount of the deposit, Mr. Bauer testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">.. .1 believe it was in all three banks; First National, Union Trust, and Equitable. (T. 165).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">When asked whether there were any other checks returned to clients for insufficient funds, Mr. Bauer replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">On November 26th there was a check written to Mayor and City Council for Juanita Davenport for $912.91 at a time when there was $175.78---- (T. 166).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">It should be mentioned that Mr. Bauer\u2019s thorough presentation presented excellent corroboration for the testimony of James L. Sommerville and Juanita Davenport, who preceded him. Both testified that they had engaged Mr. Cockrell as their attorney in personal injury suits. The settlement checks were handed over to Respondent. Subsequently, each had a check returned for insufficient funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Mr. Cockrell\u2019s general defense to his using escrow accounts for personal purposes was the economic instability of his personal and professional life. He alleges that because his personal accounts were being attached, he had to turn to his escrow accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Mr. Cockrell never directly addresses the reasons for the negative balances in all three accounts. His defense consists of attempting to establish that Mr. Sommerville and Ms. Davenport had received all the monies due them. His Supplemental Memorandum, <em>supra </em>at 5, specifically addresses the $912.91 check # 1249 to Ms. Davenport from the Union Trust Account. Mr. Cockrell alleges that he had given her the check which she endorsed in return for cash which he paid her. However, he submits a photostatic copy of the front of the check only. Accordingly, we find merit in the Grievance Commission\u2019s allegations that Ms. Davenport never received the check or the cash. The records reflect that the check was never negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\n<em>Conclusions of Law: Allen Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent was commingling his personal funds and his client\u2019s funds in two First National Bank of Maryland accounts, # 082-0002-2 and # 053-8059-6, labeled Paul J. Cockrell, Attorneys Account; Union Trust Bank account # 313-23074, labeled Paul J. Cockrell, Attorney Escrow Account; and Equitable Trust Bank account # 604-0521-0, labeled Mr. Paul J. Cockrell, Attorneys Escrow Account. In addition, we find that the Respondent failed to maintain separate bank accounts for the deposit of funds of clients, and misappropriated the funds of one or more clients and converted such funds to his personal and/or business use as evidenced by the negative balances in all the above-named accounts. In light of the above, the Respondent clearly violated the disciplinary rules cited earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Exceptions have been taken by both Bar Counsel and Cockrell. Bar Counsel excepts to the failure of the hearing judge to find that Cockrell violated Art. 10, \u00a7 44, Maryland Code. We agree and will sustain this exception. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">\u201c(a)(1) ... In no event shall the attorney commingle any such funds [deposit or other trust moneys] with such attorney\u2019s funds or use any such funds for any purpose other than the purpose for which they were entrusted to the attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Having found that Cockrell commingled and misappropriated the funds of his clients, it is obvious that he should also have been found to have violated section 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Cockrell, in his exceptions, does not clearly set forth his exceptions, but merely refers us to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">a. his Memorandum and Case Summary filed on May 21, 1985;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">b. his Supplemental Memorandum and Case Summary filed on May 23, 1985;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">c. \u201cfor reason set forth in all pleadings, testimony, and related data by Respondent ... as well as Respondent\u2019s Exhibits... \u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">d. and for reasons set forth in all pleadings, exhibits, testimony and other data set forth in the cases of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">1. <em>Smith v.

RUSSELL, JR., et al., Case No. HAR 83-3911 filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland on November 14, 1983....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Finally, we are referred to \u201ca MEMORANDUM AND CASE SUMMARY filed or intended to be filed in support of the within EXCEPTIONS TO STATEMENT OF THE COURT; FINDINGS OF FACT; AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, in the above-captioned case____\u201d (No such memorandum has been filed, however.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Cockrell requests that all of the above be incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">In our view Cockrell has not properly excepted to the hearing judge\u2019s findings and conclusions. What he has done is to leave it up to us to ferret out his exceptions for him; this we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">As we stated above, we agree with the findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the hearing judge. Thus, having concluded that Cockrell violated several disciplinary rules, the appropriate sanction remains to be determined. Bar Counsel seeks disbarment; what Cockrell urges is not at all clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">In our view, where an attorney is found to have seriously neglected cases entrusted to him by clients and, most particularly, has commingled clients\u2019 funds with his and misappropriated funds of his clients in several instances, disbarment is the appropriate sanction. We have consistently held that when an attorney is found to have betrayed the high trust imposed in him by appropriating to his own use funds of others entrusted to him, then, absent the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>compelling extenuating circumstances, disbarment should follow as a matter of course. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Velasquez, </em>301 Md. 450, 483 A.2d 354 (1984), and cases cited therein. We find no such compelling circumstances here. This violation alone would be sufficient to call for disbarment. Here, however, we have other Disciplinary Rule violations mainly concerned with neglect. Keeping in mind the purpose of disciplinary proceedings, being to protect the public and not to punish an offending attorney,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we feel constrained to impose disbarment in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus it follows that the name of Paul J. Cockrell shall be stricken from the rolls of those entitled to practice law in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE BY 15 c, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST PAUL J. COCKRELL.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-5\">.
