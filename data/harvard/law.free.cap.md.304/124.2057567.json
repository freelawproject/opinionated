Kelley was injured when an unnamed assailant shot him in the chest during an armed robbery of the grocery store where he was employed. The weapon used in the crime was a Rohm Revolver Handgun Model RG-38S, Serial Number 0152662, designed and marketed by Rohm Gesellschaft, a West German corporation. The handgun was assembled and initially sold by R.G. Industries, Inc., a Miami-based corporation which is a subsidiary of the West German corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Kelley and his wife filed a tort action against Rohm Gesellschaft and R.G. Industries in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, setting forth several theories for recovery. The first count was based on strict liability, with the plaintiffs claiming that the handgun was \u201cabnormally dangerous.\u201d Count two, also sounding in strict liability, alleged that the handgun was defective in its \u201cmarketing, promotion, distribution and design,\u201d rendering it \u201cunreasonably dangerous.\u201d Count three rested on a negligence theory. In a fourth count, the plaintiffs sought damages for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">One of the defendants, R.G. Industries, had the case removed to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441 and 1446. R.G. Industries then filed an answer to the declaration and moved for summary judgment on the ground that it was not involved in the marketing or distribution of the handgun in question. Thereafter the parties filed a stipulation that R.G. Industries be dismissed from the case, without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The remaining defendant, Rohm Gesellschaft, moved to dismiss the declaration for failure to state a claim, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rohm argued in its memorandum in support of the motion to dismiss that \u201cthe [plaintiffs\u2019 contentions [must] fail because the handgun performed as it was supposed to perform and because Rohm Gesellschaft is not responsible for the criminal and tortious acts of Mr. Kelley\u2019s assailant.\u201d At a hearing on the motion, the United States District Court found that there were no controlling precedents in this Court on the strict liability issues and certified the following questions to us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">\n<em>\u201cQuestion 1</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">Is a handgun, which inflicts injury as the norm, rather than the exception, a defective or unreasonably dangerous product?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\n<em>\u201cQuestion 2</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\">Is the marketing of handguns an abnormally dangerous activity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">(a) Does the abnormally dangerous activity doctrine extend to instances in which the alleged tortfeasor is not an occupier of land?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">(b) Does the abnormally dangerous activity doctrine apply where harm is brought about by some third person or persons over whom the tortfeasor had no control?\u201d Oral argument was then held before this Court. As a</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">result of matters raised at oral argument which were not specifically addressed in the certification order, the plaintiffs requested that the order be withdrawn and that a new order be filed. Pursuant to the request, the United States District Court withdrew the original Order of Certification and substituted a \u201cFurther Order of Certification\u201d posing the following four questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">\n<em>\u201cQuestion 1</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">Is a handgun, which inflicts injury as the norm, rather than the exception, a defective or unreasonably dangerous product?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">If the answer to Question 1 is \u201cNo,\u201d then</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKu\">\n<em>\u201cQuestion 2</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">Is a Rohm Revolver Handgun Model RG38S, which inflicts injury as the norm, rather than the exception, a defective or unreasonably dangerous product?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-12\">\n<em>\u201cQuestion 3</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-13\">Is the marketing of handguns an abnormally dangerous activity?

In answering this question, it may be that the Court of Appeals of Maryland may desire to address itself to the following sub-questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">(a) Does the abnormally dangerous activity doctrine extend to instances in which the alleged tortfeasor is not an occupier of land?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">(b) Does the abnormally dangerous activity doctrine apply where harm is brought about by some third person or persons over whom the tortfeasor had no control?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In addition, the Further Order of Certification provided that this Court was not restricted in its consideration and determination of the matter by the phrasing of the certified questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">In considering the certified questions, and pursuant to the above-mentioned provision in the federal court\u2019s order, we have rephrased the questions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">1) Is the manufacturer or marketer of a handgun, in general, liable under any strict liability theory to a person injured as a result of the criminal use of its product?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-10\">2) Is the manufacturer or marketer of a particular category of small, cheap handguns, sometimes referred to as \u201cSaturday Night Specials,\u201d and regularly used in criminal activity, strictly liable to a person injured by such handgun during the course of a crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-11\">3) Does the Rohm Revolver Handgun Model RG38S, serial number 0152662, fall within the category referred to in question 2?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">The first question will be addressed in Part II of this opinion, the second in Part III, and the final question in Part IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Kelley maintains that a manufacturer and marketer of a handgun, which inflicts injuries such as his, should be held liable under either of two strict liability theories. First, Kelley asserts that the manufacturer or marketer is strictly liable because the manufacturing or marketing of handguns is an \u201cabnormally dangerous activity.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 519-520. Second, Kelley argues that the manufacturer or marketer is strictly liable because handguns are \u201cabnormally dangerous products\u201d under Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 402A. For the following reasons, however, neither of these two doctrines, nor any of the other previously recognized strict liability principles, could properly be applied to hold, in general, the manufacturer or marketer of a handgun liable to a person injured by the handgun during the course of a crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Kelley\u2019s first premise for the imposition of liability is under the Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 519 and 520. These sections recognize the liability of one engaged in an abnormally dangerous or ultrahazardous activity even though that person may have exercised the utmost care to prevent harm. Whether an activity is \u201cabnormally dangerous\u201d under these sections depends on its satisfying the following six factors, specified in \u00a7 520:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">\u201c(a) existence of a high degree of risk of some harm to the person, land or chattels of others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">(b) likelihood that the harm that results from it will be great;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">(c) inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>(d) extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-4\">(e) inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">(f) extent to which its value to the community is outweighed by its dangerous attributes.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Regardless, however, of whether a handgun might satisfy these factors, Maryland law would not permit liability to be imposed on a handgun manufacturer or marketer under this theory. This Court has refused to extend the abnormally dangerous activity doctrine to instances in which the alleged tortfeasor is not an owner or occupier of land. <em>Toy v. Atlantic Gulf &amp; Pacific Co., </em>176 Md. 197, 4 A.2d 757 (1939). <em>See also Yommer v. McKenzie, </em>255 Md. 220, 257 A.2d 138 (1969); <em>Kirby v. Hylton, </em>51 Md.App. 365, 443 A.2d 640 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The thrust of the doctrine is that the activity be abnormally dangerous in relation to the area where it occurs. If a gasoline station owner has faulty tanks which leak gasoline into the underground water supply, that might be abnormally dangerous if the land in which the tanks are buried is located in a well populated area. In such a situation, the hazard bears a relation to the occupation and location of the land on which the activity occurs. <em>See Yommer v. McKenzie, supra. </em>The dangers inherent in the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime, on the other hand, bear no relation to any occupation or ownership of land. Therefore, the abnormally dangerous activity doctrine does not apply to the manufacture or marketing of handguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Other jurisdictions which have addressed the issue are in accord. <em>See, e.g., Perkins v. F.I.E. Corp., </em>762 F.2d 1250, 1268 (5th Cir.1985), <em>rev \u2019g Richman v. Charter Arms Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>571 F.Supp. 192 (E.D.La.1983) (\u201c[marketing handguns] is not a land-related activity, and the injuries of which the plaintiffs complain were not caused by the marketing itself, but rather resulted only when there was substandard conduct on the part of third parties\u201d); <em>Martin v. Harrington and Richardson, Inc., </em>743 F.2d 1200, 1203-1204 (7th Cir. 1984) (ultrahazardous activity doctrine applies only to the use of a product, not to its manufacture or sale); <em>Riordan v. International Armament Corp., </em>132 Ill.App.3d 642, 87 Ill.Dec. 765, 769, 477 N.E.2d 1293, 1297 (1985) (\u201cWe have found no decision other than <em>Richman </em>that has held that the lawful sale of a non-defective product can be an ultra-hazardous activity.\u201d); <em>Burkett v. Freedom Arms, </em>299 Or. 551, 704 P.2d 118 (1985). <em>See also </em>Note, <em>Legal Limits of a Handgun Manufacturer\u2019s Liability for the Criminal Acts of Third Persons, </em>49 Mo.L.Rev. 830 (1984) (criticizing the imposition of liability under the ultrahazardous activity doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Kelley next contends that a handgun is an abnormally dangerous product, and he argues that a handgun manufacturer or marketer should be strictly liable according to Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 402A. Section 402A provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">\u201c(1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">(a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">(b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">(2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) applies although</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA1\">(a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>(b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Maryland adopted \u00a7 402A in <em>Phipps v. General Motors Corp., </em>278 Md. 337, 363 A.2d 955 (1976). In so doing, this Court held that in order for a plaintiff to recover under this theory, he must establish that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">\u201c(1) the product was in a defective condition at the time that it left the possession or control of the seller, (2) that it was unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer, (3) that the defect was a cause of the injuries, and (4) that the product was expected to and did reach the consumer without substantial change in its condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">278 Md. at 344, 363 A.2d 955. <em>See also, e.g., Ellsworth v. Sherne Lingerie, Inc., </em>303 Md. 581, 495 A.2d 348 (1985); <em>Sheehan v. Anthony Pools, </em>50 Md.App. 614, 440 A.2d 1085 (1982), <em>aff'd., </em>295 Md. 285, 455 A.2d 434 (1983); <em>Eaton Corp. v. Wright, </em>281 Md. 80, 375 A.2d 1122 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\"><em>Phipps </em>and its progeny expressly require that the product be defective when sold. In determining whether a product is defective, in its design or its manufacture, Maryland cases have generally applied the \u201cconsumer expectation\u201d test. As this Court explained in <em>Phipps:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">\u201c[f]or a seller to be liable under \u00a7 402A, the product must be both in a \u2018defective condition\u2019 and \u2018unreasonably dangerous\u2019 at the time that it is placed on the market by the seller. Both of these conditions are explained in the official comments in terms of consumer expectations. As Comment g explains, the requirement of a defective condition limits application of \u00a7 402A to those situations where \u2018the product is, at the time it leaves the seller\u2019s hands, in a condition not contemplated by the ultimate consumer, which will be unreasonably dangerous to him.\u2019 An \u2018unreasonably dangerous product is defined in Comment i as one which is \u2018dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>sumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfE\">278 Md. at 344, 363 A.2d 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">A handgun manufacturer or marketer could not be held liable under this theory. Contrary to Kelley\u2019s argument, a handgun is not defective merely because it is capable of being used during criminal activity to inflict harm. A consumer would expect a handgun to be dangerous, by its very nature, and to have the capacity to fire a bullet with deadly force. Kelley confuses a product\u2019s <em>normal function, </em>which may very well be dangerous, with a defect in a product\u2019s design or construction. For example, an automobile is a dangerous product, if used to run down pedestrians. In such situation, injury would result from the nature of the product \u2014 its ability to be propelled at a great speed with great force. But that same automobile might also be defective in its design or construction, <em>e.g., </em>if the gasoline tank were placed in such position that it could easily explode in a rear-end collision. Only in the second instance, regarding the placement of the gasoline tank, would the design of the product be defective, exposing the product\u2019s manufacturer to liability under \u00a7 402A. Similarly, a handgun is dangerous because its normal function is to propel bullets with deadly force. That alone is not sufficient for its manufacturer to incur liability under \u00a7 402A. For the handgun to be defective, there would have to be a problem in its manufacture or design, such as a weak or improperly placed part, that would cause it to fire unexpectedly or otherwise malfunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Another test used to determine whether a design defect exists under \u00a7 402A is the \u201crisk/utility\u201d test, applied in <em>Barker v. Lull Engineering Co., Inc., </em>20 Cal.3d 413, 143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443 (1978). In <em>Barker, </em>the plaintiff machinery operator sued the defendant manufacturer for injuries received while trying to escape from the malfunctioning machinery. The plaintiff alleged that the machinery was defective because it was not equipped with certain safety devices. The plaintiff appealed from a jury\u2019s verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>for the defendants, arguing that the trial court had erred in instructing the jury that strict liability for a product design must be \u201c \u2018based on a finding that the product was unreasonably dangerous for its intended use.\u2019 \u201d 20 Cal.3d at 422, 143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443. The Supreme Court of California agreed with the plaintiff, and reversed. In so doing, the court articulated a dual definition for a design defect, the second part of which rests on a balancing of the product\u2019s risks and utilities (20 Cal.3d at 432, 143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\">\u201c[A] product may be found defective in design, so as to subject a manufacturer to strict liability for resulting injuries, under either of two alternative tests. First, a product may be found defective in design if the plaintiff establishes that the product failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner. Second, a product may alternatively be found defective in design if the plaintiff demonstrates that the product\u2019s design proximately caused his injury and the defendant fails to establish, in light of the relevant factors, that, on balance, the benefits of the challenged design outweigh the risk of danger inherent in such design.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Since the <em>Barker </em>decision, numerous jurisdictions have adopted a risk/utility test as an alternate standard for the determination of design defects under \u00a7 402A. <em>See, e.g., Caterpillar Tractor Co. v. Beck, </em>593 P.2d 871 (Alaska 1979); <em>Rucker v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>77 Ill.2d 434, 33 Ill.Dec. 145, 396 N.E.2d 534 (1979); <em>Hunt v. City Stores, Inc., </em>387 So.2d 585 (La.1980); <em>Back v. Wickes Corp., </em>375 Mass. 633, 378 N.E.2d 964 (1978); <em>Duke v. Gulf &amp; Western Mfg. Co., </em>660 S.W.2d 404 (Mo.App.1983); <em>Cepeda v. Cumberland Engineering Co., Inc., </em>76 N.J. 152, 386 A.2d 816 (1978); <em>Wilson v. Piper Aircraft Corp., </em>282 Or. 61, 577 P.2d 1322 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">While no decision of this Court in a product liability case has expressly rested upon an application of the risk/utility test, we did state in <em>Phipps </em>that \u201cin some circumstances the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>question of whether a particular design is defective may depend upon a balancing of the utility of the design and other factors against the magnitude of that risk.\u201d 278 Md. at 348, 363 A.2d 955. Also, the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Sheehan v. Anthony Pools, supra, </em>50 Md.App. at 620 n. 6, 440 A.2d 1085, in referring to the factors used in the risk/utility analysis, said that \u201c[tjhese factors rationalize what most courts do in deciding design cases, although not all the factors are necessarily weighed nor is the risk/utility analysis denominated as such.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">We believe, however, that the risk/utility test is inapplicable to the present situation. This standard is only applied when something goes wrong with a product. In <em>Barker, </em>an unbalanced machine tipped over. In <em>Back v. Wickes Corp., supra, </em>a motor home exploded, and in <em>Duke v. Gulf &amp; Western Mfg. Co., supra, </em>a power press caught the plaintiff\u2019s hands. These products malfunctioned. On the other hand, in the case of a handgun which injured a person in whose direction it was fired, the product worked precisely as intended. Therefore, the risk/utility test cannot be extended to impose liability on the maker or marketer of a handgun which has not malfunctioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In sum, regardless of the standard used to determine whether a product is \u201cdefective\u201d under \u00a7 402A, a handgun which functions as intended and as expected is not \u201cdefective\u201d within the meaning of that section. This has been the consistent conclusion in other jurisdictions which have confronted the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">For example, in <em>Patterson v. Rohm Gesellschaft, </em>608 F.Supp. 1206 (N.D.Tex.1985), plaintiff\u2019s decedent died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a .38 caliber Rohm during a crime. The plaintiff argued that the gun\u2019s manufacturer was strictly liable under \u00a7 402A. Rejecting the \u201cdefective design\u201d claim, the court stated that \u201ca gun, by its very nature, must be dangerous and must have the capacity to discharge a bullet with deadly force.\u201d 608 F.Supp. at 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Riordan v. International Armament Corp., supra, </em>the court rejected the plaintiffs contention that a handgun was defectively designed because it was small and easily concealable, saying, \u201c[the] size and concealability of the defendants\u2019 handguns were not conditions which caused the handgun to fail to perform in the manner reasonably to be expected in light of its nature and intended function.\u201d 87 Ill.Dec. at 770, 477 N.E.2d at 1298. The court held that a handgun could not be deemed defective \u201cwhere the plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by that product\u2019s operation precisely as it was designed to operate.\u201d <em>Ibid. Accord, Richman v. Charter Arms Co., </em>571 F.Supp. 192, 196-197 (E.D.La. 1983), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Perkins v. F.I.E. Corp., </em>762 F.2d 1250, 1268 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Martin v.

This Court has repeatedly said that \u201cthe common law is not static; its life and heart is its dynamism \u2014 its ability to keep pace with the world while constantly searching for just and fair solutions to pressing societal problems.\u201d <em>Harrison v. Mont. Co. Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 442, 460, 456 A.2d 894 (1983). <em>See Felder v. Butler, </em>292 Md. 174, 182, 438 A.2d 494 (1981). The common law is, therefore, subject to judicial modification in light of modern circumstances or increased knowledge. <em>Jones v. State, </em>302 Md. 153, 161, 486 A.2d 184 (1985); <em>Boblitz v.

Indeed, we have not hesitated to change the common law to permit new actions or remedies where we have concluded that such course was justified. <em>Boblitz v. Boblitz, supra </em>(authorizing negligence action by one spouse against another); <em>Moxley v. Acker, </em>294 Md. 47, 447 A.2d 857 (1982) (changing common law so as to permit an action of forcible detainer even though force is not present); <em>Adler v.

Mont. Co. Bd. of Educ., supra, </em>295 Md. at 460-461, 456 A.2d 894; <em>Condore v. Prince George\u2019s Co., supra, </em>289 Md. at 532, 425 A.2d 1011; <em>Austin v.

Exceptions are also created for persons engaged in hunting and target practice, and for home and business protection if confined to the real estate owned or leased by the persons having the handguns. An allowance is also made for a person who does not fit within any of those exceptions, but who, under \u00a7 36E, has proven, upon application to the Maryland State Police, that he has \u201cgood and substantial reason\u201d to carry a handgun and meets certain other qualifications.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>The express statutory provisions allowing persons to possess and carry handguns in certain specified instances demonstrate that not all handguns or handgun usage is inconsistent with Maryland public policy. In our view, generally to impose strict liability upon the manufacturers or marketers of handguns for gunshot injuries resulting from the misuse of handguns by others, would be contrary to Maryland public policy as set forth by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">There is, however, a limited category of handguns which clearly is not sanctioned as a matter of public policy. To impose strict liability upon the manufacturers and marketers of these handguns, in instances of gunshot wounds caused by criminal use, would not be contrary to the policy embodied in the enactments of the General Assembly. This type of handgun, commonly known as a \u201cSaturday Night Special,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> presents particular problems for law enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ment officials.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Saturday Night Specials are generally characterized by short barrels, light weight, easy conceala<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>bility, low cost, use of cheap quality materials, poor manufacture, inaccuracy and unreliability. These characteristics render the Saturday Night Special particularly attractive for criminal use and virtually useless for the legitimate purposes of law enforcement, sport, and protection of persons, property and businesses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The legislative policies of both the United States Congress and the Maryland General Assembly reflect the view that \u201cSaturday Night Specials\u201d comprise a distinct category of handguns that, because of their characteristics, should be treated differently from other handguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The Gun Control Act of 1968 was originally enacted by Congress as Title IV of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 <em>et seq. </em>The Act prohibits, <em>inter alia, </em>the importation into the United States of Saturday Night Specials by banning the importation of <em>any </em>firearm <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or ammunition not specifically excepted. Section 922, titled \u201cUnlawful acts,\u201d provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\"><em>\u201c(l) </em>Except as provided in section 925(d) of this chapter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to import or bring into the United States or any possession thereof any firearm or ammunition; and it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been imported or brought into the United States or any possession thereof in violation of the provisions of this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Section 925, titled \u201cExceptions: Relief from disabilities,\u201d allows the importation of firearms for the use of law enforcement, military, or other governmental purposes, \u00a7 925(a), and then further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">\u201c(d) The Secretary [of the Treasury] may authorize a firearm or ammunition to be imported or brought into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>United States or any possession thereof if the person importing or bringing in the firearm or ammunition establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the firearm or ammunition\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">(1) is being imported or brought in for scientific or research purposes, or is for use in connection with competition or training pursuant to chapter 401 of title 10;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">(2) is an unserviceable firearm, other than a machine-gun as defined in section 5845(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (not readily restorable to firing condition), imported or brought in as a curio or museum piece;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">(3) is of a type that does not fall within the definition of a firearm as defined in section 5845(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and is generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes, excluding surplus military firearms; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">(4) was previously taken out of the United States or a possession by the person who is bringing in the firearm or ammunition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">The Secretary may permit the conditional importation or bringing in of a firearm or ammunition for examination and testing in connection with the making of a determination as to whether the importation or bringing in of such firearm or ammunition will be allowed under this subsection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Pursuant to the above-quoted provision, the Secretary of the Treasury has promulgated regulations concerning the importation of firearms, collected at 27 C.F.R. part 178. Section 178.112 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\">\u201c(a) No firearm or ammunition shall be imported or brought into the United States by a licensed importer (as defined in \u00a7 178.11) unless the Director [of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms] has authorized the importation of the firearm or ammunition, or the firearm or ammunition is listed on the Importation List compiled by the Director as provided by paragraph (c) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">\u201c(c) The Director may compile an Importation List of firearms and ammunition which he determines to be generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes.... No firearm shall be placed on the Importation List unless it is found that (1) the caliber or gauge of the firearm is suitable for use in a recognized shooting sport, (2) the type of firearm is generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to such use, and (3) the use of the firearm in a recognized shooting sport will not endanger the person using it due to deterioration through such use or because of inferior workmanship, materials or design.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has drawn up what it terms a \u201cPartial List,\u201d revised periodically, of handguns not authorized for importation, and a separate \u201cPartial List\u201d of those handguns which meet the criteria for importation with an approved permit. The criteria the Bureau applies in classifying handguns for importation are set forth in its \u201cFactoring Criteria For Weapons,\u201d BATF Form 4590. There are two prerequisites that an imported handgun must meet before the factoring criteria are applied: It must have a positive manually operated safety device, and a combined height and length of not less than 10 inches. Factoring criteria include the handgun\u2019s overall size,\" weight, frame construction, caliber, safety features and sporting modifications. The Bureau also reserves the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>right to refuse the importation of any handgun which meets the factoring criteria but, nevertheless, otherwise fails to satisfy the \u201csporting purposes\u201d test of \u00a7 925(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The ban on the importation of any firearm, except those used for law enforcement, military or sporting purposes, indicates Congressional belief that there is a category of firearms which has little or no legitimate purpose. This is reflected in Congressional reports, hearings and floor debates. For example, the Preamble to the Act, as originally enacted, stated (\u00a7 901(a)(7) of P.L. 90-351, 82 Stat. 225, 226):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">\u201c(7) that the United States has become the dumping ground of the castoff surplus military weapons of other nations, and that such weapons, and the large volume of relatively inexpensive pistols and revolvers (largely worthless for sporting purposes), imported into the United States in recent years, has contributed greatly to lawlessness and to the Nation\u2019s law enforcement problems[.]\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Another indication of Congressional policy to single out Saturday Night Specials as having little legitimate purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>in today\u2019s society, and to restrict the public\u2019s access to such weapons, is found in S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d sess. at p. 76-80, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1968, at pp. 2164-2167:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-4\">\u201cThe problem of firearms misuse in crimes of violence in the United States has been adequately documented by the Judiciary Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency, commencing with the subcommittee\u2019s hearings record of 1963 and including the hearing records of 1964, 1965, and 1967.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">\u201cThere is no further need to detail the committee\u2019s findings in this report, in view of the fact that they are included in the above-referenced hearing records and in Judiciary Committee Report 1866, 89th Congress, second session.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">\u201cHowever, a summary of the major problem areas documented by the committee is appropriate to outline the extent and the scope of the firearms abuse problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">jjs sfc ij; s[s \u2022[\u00ab 5(!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">\u201cSubstantial numbers of firearms that are sold via the mail-order route in the United States are foreign imported firearms, either of the military surplus category or the category of inexpensive, small-caliber firearms, which have been termed as \u2018unsafe\u2019 and as \u2018Saturday night specials.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">\u201cOur law enforcement officials have testified that from 50 to 80 percent of the crime guns that are confiscated each year are foreign imports of either of the above categories of weapons.

Thus the import provisions of this title seem entirely justified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Additionally, during the hearings on the Act, a substantial amount of the testimony and evidence revolved around the Saturday Night Special and its role in the country\u2019s crime problem. This testimony was later summarized during the floor debates of a proposed amendment to the Act (118 Cong.Rec. 21, 27030 (1972) (statement of Sen. Bayh, Subcommittee Chairman)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">\u201cIn the course of these hearings, special attention was focused on Saturday night specials because these handguns present a particular problem for law enforcement and public safety by reason of their cheapness, low quality, ease of concealment, and ready availability. Having no legitimate sporting purpose, these weapons, also known as \u2018bellyguns\u2019 and \u2018manstoppers,\u2019 are the predominant firearm used in crime. The term[s], \u2018bellygun\u2019 and \u2018manstoppers,\u2019 are vividly descriptive of the real purpose of these weapons. The committee soon learned that the United States was being flooded with these criminal weapons, and that most of them were coming from foreign sources.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">After Title IV of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 was passed, but before its effective date, Congress reenacted the title as the Gun Control Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>1968.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The importation ban on handguns was not affected. In fact, H.R.Rep. No. 1577, 90th Cong., 2d sess., stated at p. 9, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1968, at p. 4415:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">\u201cIt has also been urged that the import restrictions of existing law, which are continued in the bill, should be relaxed. The [House Judiciary] committee does not agree. The main purpose of the import restrictions is to arrest the present flood of imports of surplus military weapons and low-priced foreign-made firearms generally, since these types of imported] weapons have caused major law enforcement problems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">For further evidence that the Gun Control Act of 1968 was designed to ban the importation of Saturday Night Specials because they comprise a distinct category of guns with little or no legitimate value, <em>see, e.g., </em>Hearings on S. 2507 Before the Subcomm. to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 92nd Cong., 1st sess.; and 118 Cong.Rec. 21, 27033 (1972) (statement of Sen. Bayh, Chairman of Subcommittee).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The Maryland gun control legislation, discussed earlier, reflects a similar policy. It permits legitimate uses of handguns akin to those allowed under the federal legislation. Besides recognizing the federally permitted use of handguns for law enforcement purposes, Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(c)(l), and sporting purposes, Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(c)(3), the Maryland statute also indicates that protection at one\u2019s place of business or real estate owned or leased by him, and the carrying of handguns by one having a permit, are legitimate handgun uses. \u00a7 36B(c)(2), (4) and \u00a7 36E(a). In addition to the specific regulations concerning handguns, the General Assembly also has established separate statutory prohibitions concerning the sale or transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>of pistols and revolvers. Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1984 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 441-448. These sections, like \u00a7\u00a7 36B-36G, show that only the legitimate use of handguns is consistent with State policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Saturday Night Specials are largely' unfit for any of the recognized legitimate uses sanctioned by the Maryland gun control legislation. They are too inaccurate, unreliable and poorly made for use by law enforcement personnel, sportsmen, homeowners or businessmen. <em>See supra </em>notes 9 and 10. The chief \u201cvalue\u201d a Saturday Night Special handgun has is in criminal activity, because of its easy concealability and low price. Obviously, the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime is not a \u201clegitimate\u201d use justified by State policy. To the contrary, the Legislature has expressly declared that the criminal use of a handgun is a separate crime that carries a mandatory sentence of not less than five years imprisonment. \u00a7 36B(d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Furthermore, the General Assembly has specifically banned the sale of pistols and revolvers to, <em>inter alia, </em>persons who have been convicted of a crime of violence. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 445.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Thus, the policy implications of the gun control laws enacted by both the United States Congress and the Maryland General Assembly reflect a governmental view that there is a handgun species, <em>i.e., </em>the so-called Saturday Night Special, which is considered to have little or no legitimate purpose in today\u2019s society.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Moreover, the manufacturer or marketer of a Saturday Night Special knows or ought to know that he is making or selling a product principally to be used in criminal activity. For example, a salesman for R.G. Industries, describing what he termed to be a \u201cspecial attribute\u201d of a Rohm handgun, was said to have told a putative handgun marketer, \u201c \u2018If your store is anywhere near a ghetto area, these ought to sell real well. This is most assuredly a ghetto gun.\u2019 \u201d The R.G. salesman allegedly went on to say about another R.G. handgun, \u201c \u2018This sells real well, but, between you and me, it\u2019s such a piece of crap I\u2019d be afraid to fire the thing.\u2019 \u201d Brill, <em>The Traffic (Legal and Illegal) In Guns, </em>Harper\u2019s, Sept. 1977, at 40.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">One commentator, in advocating the imposition of liability upon the manufacturers of Saturday Night Specials, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">\u201cIt has been suggested that Saturday Night Specials pose a great risk of criminal misuse particularly because they are easily concealable and relatively inexpensive. Most Saturday Night Specials are, in fact, used in crime. In addition, any countervailing social usefulness is negligible because the poor quality of their manufacture precludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>their use for most legitimate purposes. Other guns are safer and more accurate for legitimate uses, while not posing the same danger of criminal misuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Iveson, <em>Manufacturers\u2019 Liability to Victims of Handgun Crime: A Common Law Approach, </em>51 Fordham L.Rev. 771, 791-792 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We are not aware of any case in other jurisdictions which either distinguishes Saturday Night Specials from handguns in general when deciding a liability claim against a gun manufacturer or marketer for gunshot injuries caused by the criminal use of the product, or which expressly refuses to make such distinction. An analogy may be drawn, however, to the decision of the Supreme Court of Michigan in <em>Moning v. Alfano, </em>400 Mich. 425, 254 N.W.2d 759 (1977). In <em>Moning, </em>an eleven year old child was seriously injured by a projectile fired from a slingshot by a playmate. The court reversed a directed verdict for the slingshot\u2019s manufacturer, concluding that the manufacturer could be held liable for marketing the slingshot directly to children because a child\u2019s misuse was foreseeable. The court reasoned that marketing a dangerous product, knowing that it would be chiefly used by a class of purchasers likely to misuse the product, could be considered unreasonable. 400 Mich, at 446-449, 254 N.W.2d 759.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Similarly, the manufacturer or marketer of a Saturday Night Special knows or ought to know that the chief use of the product is for criminal activity. Such criminal use, and the virtual absence of legitimate uses for the product, are clearly foreseeable by the manufacturers and sellers of Saturday Night Specials. <em>Cf. Volkswagen of America v. Young, </em>272 Md. 201, 216-217, 321 A.2d 737 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Moreover, as between the manufacturer or marketer of a Saturday Night Special, who places among the public a product that will be used chiefly in criminal activity, and the innocent victim of such misuse, the former is certainly more at fault than the latter. <em>Cf. Phipps v. General Motors Corp., supra, </em>278 Md. at 352-353, 363 A.2d 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">For the above reasons, we conclude that it is entirely consistent with public policy to hold the manufacturers and marketers of Saturday Night Special handguns strictly liable to innocent persons who suffer gunshot injuries from the criminal use of their products. Furthermore, in light of the ever growing number of deaths and injuries due to such handguns being used in criminal activity, the imposition of such liability is warranted by today\u2019s circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">While the fact that a handgun is a Saturday Night Special may not bring its manufacturer or marketer within any of the previously existing theories of strict liability discussed in part II of this opinion, we have repeatedly pointed out that the common law adapts to fit the needs of society. Consequently, we shall recognize a separate, limited area of strict liability for the manufacturers, as well as all in the marketing chain, of Saturday Night Specials.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">There is no clear-cut, established definition of a Saturday Night Special, although there are various characteristics which are considered in placing a handgun into that category. Relevant factors include the gun\u2019s barrel length, concealability, cost, quality of materials, quality of manufacture, accuracy, reliability, whether it has been banned from import by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and other related characteristics. Additionally, the industry standards, and the understanding among law enforcement personnel, legislators and the public, at the time the weapon was manufactured and/or marketed by a particular defendant, must be considered. Because many of these factors are relative, in a tort suit a handgun should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>rarely, if ever, be deemed a Saturday Night Special as a matter of law. Instead, it is a finding to be made by the trier of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">On the other hand, before the question of liability may go to the trier of facts, a threshold question must be decided as a matter of law. Since both state and federal statutes reflect a policy that there are legitimate uses for handguns, the trial court must first find that the plaintiff has made a showing that the handgun in question possesses sufficient characteristics of a Saturday Night Special. Moreover, merely because a handgun is small and short barrelled is not itself sufficient for the issue to be submitted to the trier of facts. As stated earlier, the General Assembly of Maryland has recognized the need for certain persons to carry guns, for example, law enforcement personnel and persons with special permits. Non-uniformed law enforcement personnel and certain permit holders will of necessity be required to carry small, short barrelled handguns. A high-quality, small, short barrelled handgun, designed for such legitimate use, is not a Saturday Night Special, and the trier of facts should not be permitted to speculate otherwise. While the determination by the trial court that the plaintiff has passed the initial hurdle cannot be based on size and barrel length alone, these factors, coupled with evidence of low cost, poor quality of materials or workmanship, unreliability, or other identifying characteristics, may be sufficient for the trial court to allow the issue to go to the trier of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Finally, once the trier of facts determines that a handgun is a Saturday Night Special, then liability may be imposed against a manufacturer or anyone else in the marketing chain, including the retailer. Liability may only be .imposed, however, when the plaintiff or plaintiff\u2019s decedent suffers injury or death because he is shot with the Saturday Night Special. In addition, the shooting must be a criminal act. The shooting itself may be the sole criminal act, or it may occur in the course of another crime where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the person firing the Saturday Night Special is one of the perpetrators of the crime. Although neither contributory negligence nor assumption of the risk will be recognized as defenses, nevertheless the plaintiff must not be a participant in the criminal activity.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> If the foregoing elements are satisfied, then the defendant shall be liable for all resulting damages suffered by the gunshot victim, consistent with the established law concerning tort damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We shall now turn to the question of whether the Rohm Revolver Handgun, Model RG-38S, serial number 0152662, falls within the category of a Saturday Night Special. Under the principles set forth above, this issue does not present a question of law under the Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act; instead it is a matter for the United States District Court. We shall, however, offer a few comments on this question for whatever assistance they may provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">There is little information about the weapon set forth in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration which would indicate whether it allegedly falls within the category of a Saturday Night Special. This is understandable, however, as we had drawn no distinction between handguns generally and Saturday Night Specials when the declaration was filed. On the other hand, there is an abundance of material available elsewhere. For example, R.G. Industries, Rohm\u2019s American subsidiary, has been called the nation\u2019s major producer of Saturday Night Specials.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It was included on a list of domestic manufacturers and marketers of handguns that do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>not meet the federal standards for importation sent by the Department of the Treasury to the Senate subcommittee investigating Saturday Night Specials.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> During the Senate hearings, some Rohms were described as \u201cjunk guns,\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> as having no \u201clegitimate sporting purpose,\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and as guns that should not be \u201csold in the American market under any circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Further, the <em>Project Identification </em>study conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, <em>supra </em>note 9, classified seized handguns in three categories, the third category, Class III, being of the poorest quality and least expensive. That study stated that \u201call Rohms ... were considered to be Class III.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Additional information shows a recent suggested list price of an RG-38S as $35.00, if in good condition, or $55.00, if in excellent condition.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> No Rohm handgun in a two inch barrel may be imported into the United States.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> A Rohm RG-38 double action revolver, .38 special caliber with a three inch barrel, also cannot be imported into the United States,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> but a Model RG-38 Revolver (37 ounce weight) .38 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>special caliber, with three and six inch barrels, modified with target accessories and a serial number over 250,000,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> may be imported, as may some other long-barrelled, target modified .38 specials.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">If this case were here on appeal and writ of certiorari from a Maryland circuit court, we would remand the case for further proceedings in light of the principles of Maryland law adopted in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">One final matter warrants discussion, namely the effective date of the modification in Maryland common law tort principles which is set forth in Part III of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Ordinarily in a case such as this, which changes common law principles applicable to civil actions sounding in tort, we would apply the change to the case before us and prospectively to all such causes of action accruing after the date of the case before us. <em>Boblitz v. Boblitz, </em>296 Md. 242, 275, 462 A.2d 506, 622 (1983). The cause of action recognized in Part III of this opinion would normally accrue when the plaintiff suffered a gunshot injury from a Saturday Night Special in the course of criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">There may, however, be an element of unfairness in applying the common law change herein recognized to all causes of action accruing after this case. The gist of the wrongful act on the part of the manufacturers and marketers of Saturday Night Specials, underlying the cause of action, is the marketing of such guns to the public, knowing that they have little or no legitimate use and foreseeing that the product\u2019s chief use is for criminal activity. While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>manufacturers and marketers of handguns have or should have had such knowledge for a long time, nevertheless until now they have had little reason to anticipate that their actions might result in tort liability. As previously pointed out, no case to the best of our knowledge has heretofore dealt with the particular form of liability recognized in Part III of this opinion. Consequently, when a Saturday Night Special has been first marketed to a member of the public prior to the date of our mandate in this case, but the cause of action accrues after the date of the mandate, there may be some basis for the defendant manufacturers and marketers to complain of unfairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Therefore, the change in the common law set forth in Part III of this opinion will apply in the instant case. It will also apply to all other causes of action accruing after the date of our mandate in this case unless it is shown that the initial marketing of the Saturday Night Special to a member of the public, which will usually be the first sale of the gun by a retail gun dealer to a customer, occurred prior to the date of the mandate. In such event, the basis for liability recognized in Part III will not apply, even though the gunshot injury took place after our mandate.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">QUESTIONS OF LAW ANSWERED AS HEREIN SET FORTH.
