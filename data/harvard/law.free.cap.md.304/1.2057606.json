The child was named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Jerry Wayne Bridges, Jr.; the birth certificate stated that Jerry Wayne Bridges, Sr. was the child\u2019s father. On January 8, 1981, Jerry, Sr. acknowledged in writing that he was the child\u2019s father and eleven days later the Circuit Court for Allegany County issued a paternity decree to that effect. The decree granted legal custody of the child to Beverly and required Jerry, Sr. to provide for his son\u2019s support. Actual physical custody of the child over the past three years has been with Jerry, Sr. The child\u2019s custody is presently the subject of separate court proceedings between the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">On July 11, 1984, Jerry, Sr. filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Allegany County to adopt his son. Beverly did not consent to the adoption and moved to have the petition dismissed. The court (Sharer, J.) dismissed the petition on the ground that it was implicit that Maryland\u2019s adoption statute which permits \u201cany person\u201d to adopt another does not permit the adoption of one\u2019s own natural child. In so holding, the court defined \u201cadoption\u201d as an act by which the legal existence of the relationship of parent and child is established between persons not so related who are strangers in blood, citing <em>In re Lund\u2019s Estate, </em>26 Cal.2d 472, 159 P.2d 643 (1945); <em>Succession of Gambino, </em>225 La. 674, 73 So.2d 800 (1954); <em>Green v. Paul, </em>212 La. 337, 31 So.2d 819 (1947); <em>In re Jaren\u2019s Adoption, </em>223 Minn. 561, 27 N.W.2d 656 (1947); and <em>Colpitt v. Cheatham, </em>267 P.2d 1003 (Okla. 1954). Jerry, Sr. appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted certiorari prior to consideration of the appeal by the intermediate appellate court to decide the significant issue presented in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">As appellant, Jerry, Sr. contends that nothing in the law of this State precludes him from adopting his own child. He maintains that the adoption will accomplish the legitimation of his son and \u201cthe creation of a legal relationship that goes far beyond the scope of a paternity decree.\u201d Without citation of authority, he asserts that an adoptee\u2019s rights to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u201cinheritance, support and maintenance, social security, pension plans, health insurance, estate administration and possibly even to a draft deferment\u201d are greater than the rights of a child whose paternity has been acknowledged in a paternity proceeding. Appellant also suggests that the adopting party is entitled to greater rights to the adoptee\u2019s services and income, to inheritance, and to support and maintenance if the adoptive parent becomes destitute. Appellant also suggests that the natural father is denied paternal benefits and is placed in an inferior legal position to the natural mother in violation of Article 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, commonly known as the Equal Rights Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In support of the lower court\u2019s determination, Beverly argues that a parent may not adopt his or her natural child because adoption is the taking of a child, not related by blood, to be one\u2019s own child, with all the rights, privileges and duties of a child and heir. She maintains that the appellant\u2019s attempted adoption is without purpose since a person cannot acquire, judicially or otherwise, the right to parenthood which he already possesses. Beverly suggests that if appellant is permitted to adopt their child, she will be divested by operation of law of all her parental rights, duties and obligations, contrary to the State\u2019s public policy of not unnecessarily separating a child from a natural parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Adoption proceedings, unknown to the English common law, are solely of statutory origin in Maryland. <em>In the Matter of Malmstedt, </em>243 Md. 92, 94, 220 A.2d 147 (1966); <em>Walker v.

Section 5-311 provides that unless the natural parents\u2019 rights have been terminated by a judicial proceeding, an individual may not be adopted without the consent of both natural parents and the individual to be adopted, if at least ten years old. Section 5-312 permits issuance of a decree of adoption, notwithstanding a lack of consent by the child\u2019s natural parent, \u201cto a stepparent, relative, or other individual who has exercised physical care, custody, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>control of a child for at least 1 year, if by clear and convincing evidence\u201d the court finds that a number of specified criteria have been satisfied, including that \u201cit is in the best interest of the child to terminate the natural parent\u2019s rights as to the child.\u201d Underlying Maryland\u2019s adoption statutes is an express legislative finding in \u00a7 5-303(b) that, among other things, the child should be protected from \u201cunnecessary separation from .,. natural parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Under Code (1974), \u00a7 1-207 of the Estates and Trusts Article, an adopted child \u201cshall be treated as a natural child of his adopting parent or parents.\u201d The section further provides that upon adoption, \u201ca child no longer shall be considered a child of either natural parent,\u201d except that if the spouse of a natural parent adopts the child, \u201cthe child shall still be considered the child of that natural parent.\u201d Section l-208(a) of the Article provides that a child born out of wedlock is considered to be the child of his mother. Such a child is considered the child of the father under \u00a7 l-208(b) only if the father</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">\u201c(1) Has been judicially determined to be the father in an action brought under the statutes relating to paternity proceedings; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">(2) Has acknowledged himself, in writing, to be the father; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">(3) Has openly and notoriously recognized the child to be his child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">(4) Has subsequently married the mother and has acknowledged himself, orally or in writing, to be the father.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">That \u00a7 l-208(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article is a legitimating statute is clear from our cases. <em>Dawson v. Eversberg, </em>257 Md. 308, 262 A.2d 729 (1970), involved, as here, an adoption petition filed by a natural father of children born out of wedlock. The father had been adjudicated as such under a paternity decree. The trial court, believing that adoption of the children was necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>legitimize them, decreed the adoption, reserving to the mother in the decree all her parental rights. While we assumed, without deciding, that a natural father of an illegitimate child could adopt his own child, we held that that portion of the decree reserving the mother\u2019s parental rights was contrary to the adoption statute which terminated the legal relationship between the child and the mother. We expressed doubt that the trial court would have granted the decree had it known that it could not lawfully grant the adoption and, at the same time, preserve the mother\u2019s parental rights. In vacating the decree and remanding the case for further consideration, we observed that because of the harsh consequences of a decree of adoption, vis-a-vis parental rights, Maryland law provides that adoption should not be granted over parental objection unless that course is clearly warranted, bearing in mind the welfare and best interest of the child and all just claims of the objecting parent. 257 Md. at 313, 262 A.2d 729. In so disposing of the case, we said that if the only objective of the adoption was the legitimation of the children, what is now \u00a7 l-208(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article offered <em>\u201ca </em>less traumatic approach to the problem.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 262 A.2d 729. We suggested that certain benefits that would be achieved through the adoption process could more simply be accomplished through legitimation of the child under this section of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">In <em>Thomas v. Solis, </em>263 Md. 536, 283 A.2d 777 (1971), the acknowledged father of an illegitimate child, who wished to protect his visitation rights and to assure entitlement to notice of any attempted adoption of the child, sought a declaratory judgment that he was the child\u2019s natural father. Citing <em>Dawson, </em>we said that compliance with any of the four methods set forth in \u00a7 l-208(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article was sufficient to legitimatize a child. We indicated that a \u201cliberal interpretation\u201d of our legitimation statute was essential; that it was \u201cnot limited in its scope and application to matters of inheritance only\u201d but was legally sufficient \u201cto establish other rights, ... arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>from the relationship existing between parent and legitimate issue,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 542, 283 A.2d 777; and that the status sought by the father was afforded to him by compliance with the legitimation statute. To the same effect, <em>see Skeens v. Paterno, </em>60 Md.App. 48, 480 A.2d 820 (1984); <em>State v. Rawlings, </em>38 Md.App. 479, 381 A.2d 708 (1978); <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>18 Md.App. 353, 306 A.2d 564 (1973). Other cases have held that \u00a7 l-208(b), although contained in an inheritance statute, is not limited to matters of inheritance only but is more in the nature of a general legitimation statute. <em>See Davis By Lane v. Schweiker, </em>553 F.Supp. 158 (D.Md.1982); <em>Tyler v. Schweiker, </em>530 F.Supp. 1028 (D.Md.1981); <em>Allen v. Califano, </em>452 F.Supp. 205 (D.Md. 1978); <em>Massey v. Weinberger, </em>397 F.Supp. 817 (D.Md.1975). These cases found a child who had been legitimated under the provisions of the statute to be eligible for social security benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">A number of states have adopted the Uniform Adoption Act, 9 U.L.A. 20 (1971), which, in \u00a7 3, expressly permits an adoption by \u201cthe unmarried father or mother of the individual to be adopted.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the <em>Malmstedt </em>case, <em>supra, </em>243 Md. at 94, 220 A.2d 147, we pointed out that \u201cMaryland has not granted specific rights to fathers of illegitimate children in regard to adoption.\u201d Some jurisdictions interpreting their adoption statutes have concluded that, absent a statutory definition of \u201cadoption,\u201d the process was not intended to encompass the adoption of one\u2019s own legitimate child but rather only the assumption of a parental relationship to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>ward the child of another.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Marshall v. Marshall, </em>196 Cal. 761, 239 P. 36 (1925); <em>In re Adoption of Graham, </em>63 Ohio Misc. 22, 409 N.E.2d 1067 (1980); <em>Leake v. Grissom, </em>614 P.2d 1107 (Okla.1980); <em>Gilbertson v. Gilbertson, </em>498 P.2d 1381 (Okla.1972); <em>Baltosser Adoption, </em>63 Pa.D. &amp; C. 498 (1948). These cases express concern that if one natural parent is permitted to adopt a child, with or without the consent of the other parent, the latter\u2019s parental rights would be severed with possible adverse consequences to the child. They also indicated that there would be no need for adoption by a natural parent of a legitimate child since no benefits, rights, obligations or duties would be imposed or conferred which did not already exist as a result of the natural relationship. Other jurisdictions, interpreting their adoption statutes, have permitted a natural father to adopt his illegitimate child with the consent of the mother. These cases indicate that notwithstanding statutory provisions that adoption severs the other parent\u2019s parental rights, the child should not be deprived of such parental relationship in order to be legitimated through the adoption process. Consequently, the cases hold that because there was no legislative intent to sever the mother\u2019s rights and responsibilities in such circumstances, the statutory \u201cstepparent\u201d exception would be applied so that the mother\u2019s parental rights would be preserved. <em>See In re Jessica W., 122 </em>N.H. 1052, 453 A.2d 1297 (1982); <em>Matter of Adoption of a Child by A.R., </em>152 N.J.Super. 541, 378 A.2d 87 (1977); <em>Matter of A.J.J., </em>108 Misc.2d 657, 438 N.Y.S.2d 444 (1981). Still other jurisdictions with statutes similar to our own have concluded that there is no legal impediment in the words of the statute to prohibit a natural parent from adopting his or her illegitimate child. <em>Petition of Curran, </em>314 Mass. 91, 49 N.E.2d 432 (1943); <em>Murphy v. Portrum, </em>95 Tenn. 605, 32 S.W. 633 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>(1895); <em>In re Anonymous Adoption, </em>177 Misc. 683, 31 N.Y.S.2d 595 (1941); <em>Couch v. Couch, </em>35 Tenn.App. 464, 248 S.W.2d 327 (1951). These eases indicate that the legitimation of a child under a statute did not necessarily afford the child the same rights as would accrue from adoption. <em>Cf. Bedinger v. Graybill\u2019s Executor and Trustee, </em>302 S.W.2d 594 (Ky.1957) (statute authorizing adoption of \u201cany person\u201d by \u201cany adult person\u201d construed without restriction or qualification to permit husband to adopt his wife in order to qualify her for inheritance as his heir at law); <em>In re Adoption of Berston, </em>296 Minn. 24, 206 N.W.2d 28 (1973) (statute permitting adoption of \u201cany person\u201d construed to permit adoption of an adult woman by her natural son in order to qualify her for inheritance as his heir).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In determining whether Maryland\u2019s adoption statutes permit a natural father to adopt his own child born out of wedlock, we seek to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intention, the primary source for which is found in the language of the statute itself. <em>In re Stephen K., </em>289 Md. 294, 424 A.2d 153 (1981); <em>Koyce v. State Central Collection Unit, </em>289 Md. 134, 422 A.2d 1017 (1980). Of course, when construing one provision of a statute, which is part of a statutory scheme, the legislative intention must be gathered from the entire statute, rather than from only one part. <em>North Charles Gen. Hosp. v. Empl. S. Adm., </em>286 Md. 115, 405 A.2d 751 (1979); <em>Height v. State, </em>225 Md. 251, 170 A.2d 212 (1961). In other words, where statutes relate to the same subject matter, and are not inconsistent with each other, they should be construed together and harmonized where consistent with their general object and scope. <em>Management Personnel Serv. v. Sandefur, </em>300 Md. 332, 478 A.2d 310 (1984); <em>Haskell v. Carey, </em>294 Md. 550, 451 A.2d 658 (1982); <em>Winter v. Director, </em>217 Md. 391, 143 A.2d 81 (1958). Another rule of construction is that where the language of a statute is clear, courts may not insert or omit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>words to make the statute express an intention not evident in its original form. <em>Board of Educ., Garrett Co. v. Lendo, </em>295 Md. 55, 453 A.2d 1185 (1982); <em>Smelser v. Criterion Ins. Co., </em>293 Md. 384, 444 A.2d 1024 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The cornerstone of the Maryland Adoption statute, \u00a7\u00a7 5-307(a) and 5-309(a), defining who may be adopted and who may adopt, expresses in broadly worded terms, without qualification or restriction concerning blood relationships, that \u201c[a]ny individual ... may be adopted\u201d by \u201c[a]ny adult.\u201d In earlier cases construing qualifications for adoption under the statute, we held in <em>Ex Parte Libertini, </em>244 Md. 542, 224 A.2d 443 (1966) that precursors of these statutory provisions permitted the adoption of an adult by an unmarried adult. The fact that the adult adoption was for purposes of inheritance or may not have served a \u201cuseful purpose\u201d was considered irrelevant in light of the statute\u2019s broad command. Similarly, in <em>Ex Parte Frantum, </em>214 Md. 100, 133 A.2d 408 (1957), a petition to adopt a one-year-old child by foster parents was opposed due to the advanced age of the petitioning couple. We found no merit to the challenge based on age alone. We said that the adoption statute fixed only the minimum age for adoptive parents and did not impose a maximum age limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Professor John S. Strahorn, in his well-regarded article on \u201cAdoption in Maryland,\u201d 7 Md.L.Rev. 275 (1943), analyzed the then existing adoption statute which, in its most fundamental provisions, does not materially differ from our present statute. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">\u201cThe Maryland statute ... recognizes that petitions may be filed by an individual severally, be he or she married, widowed, divorced, or single____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">\u201c... [I]n the case of several adoptions there are no limitations on who may adopt. The Maryland statute contains no such rule as is found in the statutes of some other states, requiring the adopter to be older than the adoptee by a stated number of years. In fact, as our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>statute reads, one might adopt a person older than himself, even one of his own direct ancestors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">He also observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">\u201cthere may be occasional motive, under Maryland law, for one formally to adopt his own illegitimate child for the purpose of indirectly accomplishing the sequelae of legitimation. One reason for this may be in order to keep secret the fact of original illegitimate relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276-77.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">In view of the broad, unqualified wording of Maryland\u2019s adoption statute, and the existing uncertainty as to whether, under Maryland\u2019s legitimation statute, a legitimated child is placed in precisely the same legal posture as an adopted child, we are unable to conclude that the Legislature intended to prohibit adoption in all circumstances by a natural parent of a child born out of wedlock.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We thus do not agree with those cases from other jurisdictions which flatly hold that the adoption process does not contemplate the creation of such a relationship between a child born out of wedlock and its natural parent. We can conceive of instances where such an adoption may have beneficial social consequences beyond those available under the legitimation statute, <em>i.e., </em>the natural father of a child born to his married paramour desires to adopt the child upon the wife\u2019s divorce from her husband and later marriage to the child\u2019s father. In such circumstances, the \u201cstepparent\u201d exception to the termination of parental rights, set forth in \u00a7 1-207 of the Estates and Trusts Article would operate to preserve all the mother\u2019s parental rights. There may be instances where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>the natural mother of an illegitimate child has abandoned the child and the natural father desires to adopt the child, rather than seek its legitimation under the legitimation statute and thereby expose the child\u2019s original illegitimacy. Or the natural mother of an illegitimate child may die, or become incompetent, and for like reasons the natural father would wish to adopt the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">In the present case, the appellant, having had custody of the child for at least one year, would be eligible under \u00a7 5-312 to adopt without the mother\u2019s consent. Under our decision in <em>Dawson v. Eversberg, supra, </em>an adoption by a natural parent, if permitted, would result under \u00a7 5-308(b) in the other parent being relieved of all parental duties and obligations to the adoptee, as well as divestiture of all parental rights. In view of these drastic consequences, and of the legislative policy to not unnecessarily separate children from natural parents, \u00a7 5-312 requires \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d where a parent does not consent to the adoption, that it is in the best interests and welfare of the child to terminate the natural parent\u2019s rights as to the child. Other factors taken into account under \u00a7 5-312 are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">\u201c(2) the child has been out of the custody of the natural parent for at least 3 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">(3) the child has developed significant feelings toward and emotional ties with the petitioner; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">(4) the natural parent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">(i) has not maintained meaningful contact with the child during the time the petitioner has had custody despite the opportunity to do so;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">(ii) has repeatedly failed to contribute to the physical care and support of the child although financially able to do so; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">(iii) has been convicted of child abuse of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">(c) <em>Considerations. </em>\u2014 In determining whether it is in the best interest of the child to terminate a natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>parent\u2019s rights as to the child under this section, the court shall request:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">(1) an investigation by an appropriate agency; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">(2) a report of the investigation that includes summaries of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">(i) the child\u2019s feelings toward and emotional ties with the child\u2019s natural parents, the child\u2019s siblings, the petitioner, and any other individual who may significantly affect the child\u2019s best interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">(ii) the child\u2019s adjustment to home, school, and community; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">(iii) if the natural parent is absent, an evaluation of the petitioner\u2019s attempts to locate the absent natural parent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">Manifestly, the statutory criteria are intended to be difficult to satisfy. As we said in <em>Dawson, supra, </em>257 Md. at 313, 262 A.2d 729, the adoption must be \u201cclearly warranted.\u201d Or, as we stated in <em>Walker v. Gardner, </em>221 Md. 280, 284, 157 A.2d 273 (1960), adoption \u201cshall not be granted over parental objection unless that course clearly is justified.\u201d To the same effect, <em>see Lippy v. Breidenstein, </em>249 Md. 415, 240 A.2d 251 (1968); <em>Beltran v. Heim, </em>248 Md. 397, 236 A.2d 723 (1968); <em>In the Matter of Malmstedt, </em>243 Md. 92, 220 A.2d 147 (1966); <em>Ex Parte Frantum, </em>214 Md. 100, 133 A.2d 408 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">We thus conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing the petition. On remand, it must consider the petition on its merits, taking into account all statutory requirements in assessing among other things, whether it is in the best interests of Jerry, Jr. to grant the adoption and thus terminate all of his parental ties to his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO CIRCUIT COURT FOR ALLEGANY COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN CONFORMITY WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO ABIDE THE FINAL RESULT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-15\">.

The trial court in the present case relied upon this principle in dismissing the adoption petition; however, cases cited as authority to support the proposition were not interpreting the reach of adoption statutes in those jurisdictions.

We note that \u00a7 5-1002 of the Family Law Article, dealing with paternity proceedings, sets forth a declaration of legislative policy stating that the purpose of the paternity statute is to secure for children born out of wedlock \"as nearly as practicable, the same rights to support, care, and education as children born in wedlock; [and] to impose on the mothers and fathers of children born out of wedlock the basic obligations and responsibilities of parenthood.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
