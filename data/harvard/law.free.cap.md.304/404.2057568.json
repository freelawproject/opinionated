For the purposes of this paragraph, a slot machine is an antique slot machine if the defendant shows by a preponderance of the evidence that it was manufactured prior to 1941. Whenever this defense is offered, no slot machine seized from any defendant shall be destroyed or otherwise altered until after a final court determination including review upon appeal, if any, that the defense is not applicable. If the defense is applicable, the slot machine shall be returned pursuant to provisions of law providing for the return of property.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The State seized the devices in question on December 30, 1980 from the commercial warehouse premises of Willow Enterprises, Inc. Willow\u2019s president, Louis Wilner, was convicted of unlawfully possessing slot machines in violation of \u00a7 264B. He did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">On October 13, 1981, the State initiated an <em>in rem </em>proceeding in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County for forfeiture of the seized devices. At trial, the State introduced a number of devices, which it claimed were representative of all of the devices that had been seized. The circuit court (Wray, J.) in a memorandum opinion found that certain of the devices, <em>e.g., </em>the Sircoma Draw 80 Poker machines equipped with a \u201cknock-off\u201d switch or meter, were illegal slot machines because they were \u201cpresently adapted to register rewards obtained by chance and to facilitate undetectable human payoffs of items with value.\u201d The court also found that other devices<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cwith payoffs other than free plays\u201d were illegal slot machines subject to forfeiture. Another device found by the trial court to be an illegal slot machine was a so-called Delta Red, White and Blue machine \u201cwith the knockoff switch and other devices with provisions to facilitate house payments.\u201d Moreover, the court declared a number of console machines to be illegal slot machines.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It found, however, that a Delta machine \u201cwithout a knockoff switch,\u201d as well as all similar free-play devices, was not a slot machine under the statutory definition. The court held that an inoperable Bally slot machine (a conventional \u201cone-arm bandit\u201d), as well as all like inoperable devices and parts adaptable for slot machine usage, was not a slot machine within the contemplation of the statute. It also held that a number of partially dismantled devices met the definition of a slot machine and were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>subject to forfeiture. Finally, the court concluded that a number of other devices manufactured prior to 1941, and not operated for gambling purposes while in the owner\u2019s possession, were not subject to forfeiture because such devices were \u201cantique\u201d slot machines exempt under \u00a7 264B(V).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">The State appealed. It claimed that the trial court erred in not finding the inoperable devices and the free-play devices without knock-off switches or meters to be illegal slot machines and in ordering the return of the \u201cantique\u201d slot machines. Willow cross-appealed. It contended, among other things, that the trial court misconstrued \u00a7 264B in not exempting all free-play devices from the statutory definition of a slot machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The Court of Special Appeals decided the cross-appeals in <em>State v. 158 Gaming Devices, </em>59 Md.App. 44, 474 A.2d 545 (1984). It first noted that the seized devices were of various makes, models and designs, describing them as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akl\">\u201c[M]ost of the seized devices incorporated \u2018free play\u2019 or \u2018game credit\u2019 features that rewarded the successful player with \u2018free\u2019 replays, which were registered on a three or four digit meter attached to the machine. The player was able to use the free plays by activating a \u2018play\u2019 button on the machine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">\u201cMany of the alleged gaming devices were adapted with a \u2018knock-off switch\u2019 and a \u2018knock-off meter.\u2019 The switch and meter enabled the machine owner to remove game credits from the machine while maintaining a tabulation of the total free plays actually won. A number of the seized devices had not yet been fitted with the knockoff switches or meters, but unattached meters were found at Willow\u2019s premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">\u201cForty-eight of the devices seized were Delta \u2018Red, White and Blue\u2019 machines that issue stamps printed with randomly selected numbers. If the numbers on the stamps issued by the machine correspond with numbers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>on a chart that was placed on top of the machine, the player wins replays, coupons or merchandise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\">\u201cThe remaining devices were a variety of \u2018one-arm bandits\u2019 which are activated by a player\u2019s depositing a coin in a slot and pulling a handle. The handle rotates reels which spin and then stop, revealing a combination of symbols, numbers, words or colors. If the combination of the reels corresponds with one of the predetermined winning combinations, the machine releases the \u2018payoff\u2019 into a coin tray located on the lower front of the machine. With the exception of the one-arm bandit devices, none of the gaming machines had the capability of directly paying off to the player. The other devices required a third party to redeem \u2018free games\u2019 for something of value that was more tangible.\u201d 59 Md.App. at 48-49, 474 A.2d 545 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In considering the State\u2019s right to institute forfeiture proceedings against the seized devices, the court concluded that property which is subject to forfeiture is characterized as either contraband per se or derivative contraband. The former, the court said, is property that is inherently illegal while derivative contraband is property that may be legal or illegal to possess, depending upon the circumstances. 59 Md.App. at 50, 474 A.2d 545. The court opined that the devices seized from Willow \u201cmay or may not have a lawful, useful purpose\u201d and were therefore not contraband per se. <em>Id. </em>It determined, however, that the devices would be forfeitable as derivative contraband under common law principles if the State showed by a preponderance of the evidence \u201cthat the owner or user of the seized items intended the property to be used illegally and that the items were procured, held or used for an unlawful purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53, 474 A.2d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">After reviewing the legislative history underlying the enactment of \u00a7 264B and our decision in <em>Clerk v. Chesapeake Beach Park, </em>251 Md. 657, 248 A.2d 479 (1968), the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u201c[T]he classification of a device as illegal under \u00a7 264B depends on its potential for valuation of aggregated free plays \u2018won\u2019 on a game of chance.\u201d 59 Md.App. at 57, 474 A.2d 545 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">It said that the existence of the so-called knock-off switch was not \u201cdeterminative of whether a device is classified as an illegal slot machine under \u00a7 264B.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Explaining, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">\u201cKnock-off switches are usable for purposes other than gambling. If, for instance, a player after accumulating a great number of \u2018free plays\u2019 becomes bored with the game, or for any other reason walks away from the machine, it is unreasonable to expect the merchant to allow other persons to utilize the accumulated \u2018free plays.\u2019 The owner should have some way of removing the \u2018free plays\u2019 from the machine, hence the knock-off switch. The knock-off meter, on the other hand, may be indicative that the machine is a gambling device. The knock-off meter is, in effect, an accounting of the \u2018free plays\u2019 and may disclose to the owner of the machine that the degree of difficulty in \u2018winning\u2019 is too great or too little.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">\u201cWhen a device contains an odds mechanism, a method of releasing free plays, and a knock-off meter, the potential for valuating aggregate free plays exists and the machine is illegal under \u00a7 264B.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57-58, 474 A.2d 545 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The Court of Special Appeals also determined that certain of the devices seized, having been manufactured prior to 1941, were antique slot machines exempt from seizure under \u00a7 264B(V); that a number of inoperable devices, which were merely adaptable, but not actually adapted for use as slot machines, were not within the statutory definition; but that partially dismantled devices meeting the statutory definition were illegal slot machines and, therefore, subject to forfeiture. The court remanded the case to the trial court for the entry of an order consistent with the principles set forth in its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>The State\u2019s petition for certiorari, which we granted, raised two questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">(1) Whether a gambling device that meets the statutory-definition of \u201cslot machine\u201d \u2014 and, as such, is subject to an unqualified statutory prohibition against its possession for any reason is contraband per se; and</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">(2) Whether a gambling device that operates on principles of consideration, chance, and reward as specified in the governing statutory prohibition nevertheless does not violate the statute absent the existence of certain additional mechanisms.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Willow did not file a cross-petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Placing reliance upon the legislative history of \u00a7 264B, the State contends that the mere possession of slot machines prohibited by the statute is illegal, whatever the circumstances of their use or intended use, and because such devices cannot be used for any legitimate purpose, they are subject to summary forfeiture as contraband per se. The State claims that a device, other than a true free-play pinball machine, is illegal under the Act if it (1) requires consideration such as money or a token to operate; (2) operates by reason of any element of chance; and (3) entitles the player to receive a reward, whether monetary or representative of or convertible into money, such as free plays. This is so, the State maintains, without regard to the device\u2019s mechanical, technological or stylistic design features. Accordingly, the State concludes that the Court of Special Appeals erroneously distinguished between legal gaming devices and illegal slot machines \u2014 not on the basis of whether the devices operated on the \u00a7 264B principles of consideration, chance and reward \u2014 but rather on the presence of various features, such as odds mechanisms, knockoff switches and meters, that are nowhere referred to in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The State says that the devices in question are activated either directly or indirectly by the insertion of coins or some other payment of consideration and operate exclusively on the principle of chance. As to the latter element, the State maintains that an individual\u2019s skill is totally irrelevant to the game\u2019s outcome, unlike some video arcade games such as pac-man and some pinball machines, where manipulation of levers, buttons or control sticks enables a skillful player to win free games.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The last element \u2014 the concept of a reward representative of or convertible into money \u2014 is also present, the State claims, because each of the seized devices offers some form of remuneration to the player, either by means of a coin chute, a redeemable token or game credits that can be used for further games or clandestinely converted into cash.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The State argues that, under Maryland case law, free games constitute a \u201cthing of value,\u201d representative of or convertible into money within the contemplation of \u00a7 264B. It contends that the legislature did not intend to restrict the reward element of \u00a7 264B only to devices that offer some tangible object of value; otherwise, the express exemption for free play pinball machines would not be necessary. That free plays have intrinsic value, according to the State, is evident from the fact that the proprietor is manifestly concerned with the number of free plays won since the player may continue to operate the device without paying\u2014 to the proprietor\u2019s obvious financial detriment. The State sees free plays as the functional equivalent of the \u201ccoin, token or other object\u201d otherwise necessary under \u00a7 264B to activate the machine or the mechanical payoff chute. As none of the seized devices were free play pinball machines, the State urges that the statutory exemption for such devices is plainly inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Willow acknowledges that the seized devices are coin activated and operate on the basis of chance. It says that the main issue is simply whether a free play itself is a thing of value within the ambit of \u00a7 264B. If it is, Willow concedes that the devices are illegal slot machines and subject to summary forfeiture as contraband per se. Willow contends, however, that a free play is not a thing of value under Maryland law and that consequently \u00a7 264B does not prohibit <em>any </em>free-play devices. The exemption in \u00a7 264B for free-play pinball machines, according to Willow, encompasses any and all free-play devices and not just pinball machines. Willow acknowledges, however, that devices which operate on the principles of consideration and chance and which reward a successful player with free plays may be illegal under \u00a7 264B if the devices possess features designed to promote and facilitate gambling, and free plays are redeemable for value. Willow thus appears to have accepted the intermediate appellate court\u2019s determination, from which it did not appeal, that devices equipped with odds mechanisms, knock-off switches and meters are illegal slot machines under \u00a7 264B.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In determining the intention of the legislature in enacting \u00a7 264B, the most frequently used document is the Report of the Slot Machine Study Committee appointed by Governor Tawes in 1962, sometimes referred to as the Emory Commission after its chairman, Richard W. Emory. The committee in a report to the Governor, dated January 12, 1963, noted that its study encompassed all gambling devices and machines which have been legalized by local law. It reviewed the history of pinball and other coin-operated devices in Maryland. It observed that the provisions of ch. 11 of the Acts of 1937 (Extraordinary Session) permitted the issuance of a statewide license for a \u201cpin ball machine or game played with balls and plungers ... or any other machine or device so constructed or devised to make the result of the operation depend in whole or in part upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>skill of the player____\u201d This law authorized \u201cplaying for a premium, trophy or prize, in merchandise only, for high score or skill in the operation thereof.\u201d According to the committee report, ch. 11 was a Depression era revenue raising measure. It was repealed by ch. 8 of the Acts of 1939. The report next pointed out that the legislature, at its 1939 session, refused to enact another statewide licensing law for \u201cpinball and other coin operated machines.\u201d It did, however, pass local laws for Anne Arundel, Charles, Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties. These measures, however, were vetoed by then Governor O\u2019Conor. In 1941, pinball and slot machine laws were passed in Anne Arundel and Garrett Counties but were again vetoed by the Governor. Public local laws legalizing slot machines were subsequently enacted for Anne Arundel County (ch. 321 of the Acts of 1943), Calvert County (ch. 13 of the Acts of 1948, Extraordinary Session), Charles County (ch. 678 of the Acts of 1949) and St. Mary\u2019s County (ch. 32 of the Acts of 1947, Extraordinary Session). In Calvert, Charles and St. Mary\u2019s Counties, the legalized devices consisted of any \u201cmechanical or electrical amusement devices which require the insertion of a coin or token for their operation and which offer an award ... based in whole or in part upon chance or [the operator\u2019s] skill.\u201d In Anne Arundel County, any \u201camusement device\u201d was legalized, as well as commercial bingo.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The public local law applicable to each of these Southern Maryland counties exempted the legalized devices from the State\u2019s gambling laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The committee noted that the Federal Gambling Devices Act of 1962 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1171-1177), amending the Johnson Act of 1951, enlarged the definition of gambling devices to include \u201cfree-play\u201d slot machines. The need for this legislation was set forth in a congressional report, quoted in the Emory Commission Report (p. 10), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">\u201c 'New gambling machines have been developed which are controlled by syndicated crime, but which are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>subject to the provisions of the Johnson Act because they are not coin-operated, do not pay off directly or indirectly, and do not have a drum or reel as in the conventional slot machine. Principally they are pinball machines which afford players an opportunity if certain combinations are achieved to register a great number of free games, in some instances up to 999 free games. These machines usually have a mechanism whereby the player can change the odds merely by inserting more money into the machine or increase the number of balls that can be played by inserting more money. These free games can be played off or they can be eliminated from the machine by pressing a button or lever. The number of accumulated free games eliminated from the machine are recorded by a meter and payment to the player for the number of free games canceled is made by the proprietor of the establishment where the gambling machine is located or by his agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">\u201c \u2018The committee bill broadens the definition of the term \u201cgambling device\u201d in the Johnson Act so as to include such pinball machines and any other mechanical devices which are designed and manufactured primarily for use in connection with gambling and which when operated may deliver as a result of the application of an element of chance any money or property, either directly or indirectly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">\u201c \u2018Pinball and other machines, intended for amusement only, which award a limited number of free plays that are not convertible to money or other things of value, are not covered by this legislation.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The committee report observed that the 1962 Federal Act \u201cmakes the possession of any machine which may be used as a gambling device illegal without requiring proof of cash pay-offs.\u201d Among several exceptions was one for a \u201cmarble machine (a so-called pinball machine) ... which is not designed and manufactured primarily for use in connection with gambling, and (A) which when operated does not deliver as a result of the application of an element of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>chance, any money or property or (B) by the operation of which a person may not become entitled to receive, as the result of the application of an element of chance, any money or property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">In its report, the Emory Commission noted a distinction between \u201cfree-play\u201d gambling devices and \u201cfree-play\u201d amusement devices, stating that the former required a $250 annual tax stamp while the latter required only a $10 annual tax stamp. According to the committee report, the difference between the two types of machines resided in their construction and operation. It said (at p. 11):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">\u201cIf the machine has an odds mechanism, provision for releasing free plays and a meter for recording free plays released, then it is a gambling device. If the machine does not have such gambling features, its use for gambling is not considered practicable even though it may award free games in a limited number.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In this regard, the committee report referred to federal tax regulations, describing a \u201cfree play\u201d gambling device required to have a $250 gambling tax stamp, as follows (p. 12):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">\u201c \u2018A machine which is operated by means of the insertion of a coin, token, or similar object and which, even though it does not dispense cash or tokens, has the features and characteristics of a gaming device whether or not evidence exists as to actual payoffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">\u201c 'A pinball machine equipped with a push button for releasing free plays and a meter for recording the plays so released, or equipped with provisions for multiple coin insertion for increasing the odds.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">In the course of its report, the committee noted that, in addition to the statutes in Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles and St. Mary\u2019s Counties, laws existed licensing \u201cfree-play\u201d pinball and console machines in Baltimore City and ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>other counties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These laws, the committee reported, made no distinction between the free-play machines classified by the federal government as gambling devices and amusement-type free-play machines. The committee report, referring to testimony before various congressional committees, concluded at p. 12 \u201cthat there are more slot machines including the \u2018free play\u2019 gambling devices licensed with the Federal government in Maryland than in any other State in the entire United States.\u201d The committee said (p. 12) that slot machines are not limited to four Southern Maryland counties. It cited statistics showing that in Baltimore City and Baltimore County alone, there were \u201cfree play\u201d gambling devices at 2,700 different locations in 1962, and that in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1962, there were 3,971 applications for federal gambling stamps in Maryland over and above 850 slot machine locations in the four Southern Maryland counties. But the committee said that it was unable to determine the extent to which, in Maryland, the devices classified as gambling devices under the federal law were used for gambling. It noted, however, that by enactment of the Federal Gambling Devices Act of 1962, the Congress established as national policy \u201cthe fact that these \u2018free play\u2019 slot machines are gambling devices and should be outlawed\u201d as they are used \u201cextensively for gambling on a far larger scale than legalized slot machines.\u201d Report, at 13-14. The committee concluded its report as follows (p. 14):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">\u201cAny abolition of slot machines requires repeal of the local laws applicable to Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles and St. Mary\u2019s Counties legalizing cash pay-off machines. It also requires repeal or amendment of the General Laws permitting the licensing of \u2018free play\u2019 slot machines classified by the Federal government as gambling devices, and enactment of a State law at least as strong as the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Gambling Devices Act of 1962 prohibiting any machine, \u2018free play\u2019 or otherwise, which may be used as a gambling device. Unless the problem is attacked on a state wide basis, the \u2018free play\u2019 gambling devices will invade Southern Maryland and the slot machine business will continue there, but the four Counties will have been deprived of the approximate $1,600,000 in annual revenues which they now enjoy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">\u201cFlorida and New York have laws that prohibit the possession of any machine or device which, by reason of any element of chance or of other outcome of such operation unpredictable by the operator, the user may receive or become entitled to receive anything of value or otherwise or may secure additional chances or rights to use the machine. It will be noted that this is a very broad definition which prohibits the possession of even a \u2018free play\u2019 machine which the Federal government in the Gambling Devices Act of 1962 and in the revenue laws classifies as an amusement device.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The committee declined to recommend \u201c[wjhether Maryland [should] adop[t] a law based upon Florida and New York law or upon Federal law____\u201d It was thus for the General Assembly to delineate the devices to be encompassed by any new legislation and it responded by the 1963 enactment of \u00a7 264B.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">The most authoritative interpretation of \u00a7 264B is found in <em>Clerk v. Chesapeake Beach Park, </em>251 Md. 657, 248 A.2d 479 (1968). That case involved a declaratory judgment action to determine whether an electrical console device and a partly mechanical and partly electrical pinball machine were illegal slot machines under \u00a7 264B. Both machines required the insertion of a coin for their operation and offered an award to the operator based in whole or in part, as to the console machine, on chance and, as to the pinball device, upon chance or skill. The award offered by each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>device was \u201c \u2018the registration upon the device of one or more free plays which may, in the option of the operator, be taken by replaying the machine or may be redeemed ... for merchandise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, 248 A.2d 479. A declaration that the devices were legal under the public local laws of Calvert County which licensed \u201camusement devices\u201d was also sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">We noted in <em>Chesapeake Beach </em>that our earlier decision in <em>Gaither v. Cate, </em>156 Md. 254, 144 A. 239 (1929) held \u201cin disagreement with various legislative and judicial holdings elsewhere to the contrary, that a machine <em>adapted for gambling </em>which ostensibly offered as a reward for playing it only additional free plays was a gambling device.\u201d <em>Id. </em>[251 Md.] at 664, 248 A.2d 479 (emphasis added). We also observed that the holding in <em>Gaither v. Cate </em>was influenced by the statutory provision in then Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 257 (now, Code, 1982 Repl.Vol., \u00a7 246 of Art. 27) requiring that courts construe the law \u201c \u2018relating to gambling and betting liberally, so as to prevent the mischiefs intended to be provided against.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">After reviewing the report of the Emory Commission, the Court in <em>Chesapeake Beach </em>turned to the uncodified provision of \u00a7 264B which, as earlier indicated, expressly exempted devices \u201ccommonly known or colloquially referred to, as \u2018pinball machine\u2019 \u201d from inclusion under the statutory definition of a slot machine, where such devices did not permit any reward \u201cbeyond an automatic replay of a game or games mechanically provided upon said machine.\u201d As to this, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">\u201c[T]he proper inference to be drawn from the inclusion of Section 2 in [ch. 617], legalizing <em>only </em>true free play pinball machines, is that the legislature believed the definition of a slot machine in [\u00a7 264B] was broad enough to include, or to be construed as including, all machines or devices conferring upon a winning player any award, including true free play machines, as gambling devices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>under <em>Gaither v. Cate, supra.\" Id. </em>at 666, 248 A.2d 479 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">We thereafter added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">\u201cAnother fair inference is that because the only deviation the legislature selected from the general definition was the true free play pinball machine, it regarded and intended to classify as slot machines any console and pinball machines that furnished gratification or reward to a winning player other than further free plays.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666, 248 A.2d 479.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">We concluded that \u00a7 264B</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">\u201crejected the total ban of the New York and Florida statutes including even free play machines, and adopted the theory of the Federal statutes which classify as gambling devices pinball machines which can pay off in other than additional free plays but classify as permitted amusement devices free play pinball machines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666, 248 A.2d 479.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">We also held in <em>Chesapeake Beach </em>that, to satisfy the actual legislative intention, the phrase in \u00a7 264B \u2014 \u201crepresentative of and convertible into money\u201d meant representative of <em>or </em>convertible into money. <em>Id. </em>at 667, 248 A.2d 479. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">\u201cIf the phrase defining the material reward of the winner is read as money, coin, token or other object \u2018representative of or convertible into money,\u2019 as we hold it should be, it is apparent that not only the tokens which fall to a winner in the cup of the one-arm bandit but the aggregate value of the free plays won on the console or pinball machine, whether evidenced by a receipt or not, are alike \u2018representative of\u2019 money in that <em>under the evidence </em>they can be used to purchase beverages, food or merchandise of a specified dollar value. [Section 264B] proscribes machines or devices through the operation of which this result can occur by chance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 668-69, 248 A.2d 479 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Finally, we said that \u00a7 264B repealed the local Calvert County law to the extent that it permitted the licensing, possession and operation of gambling machines and devices that come within the ban of the statewide Act. <em>Id. </em>at 669, 248 A.2d 479. As the free plays on both the console and pinball devices were redeemable for merchandise, we declared that they were in violation of \u00a7 264B.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Made explicitly clear in <em>Chesapeake Beach </em>was that the General Assembly in enacting \u00a7 264B did not adopt either the Florida or New York statutes which declared a device to be an illegal slot machine simply because, <em>inter alia, </em>the successful player was rewarded by \u201cadditional chances or rights to use such ... device.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The omission of any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>language from \u00a7 264B is of obvious significance. Equally significant is the use in \u00a7 264B of the phrase, \u201cany piece of money, coin, token or other object representative of [or] convertible into money\u201d rather than the broader phrase in the Florida and New York statutes, \u201cany piece of money, credit, allowance or other <em>thing of value, </em>or any check, slug, token or memorandum, whether of value or otherwise, which may be exchanged for any money, credit, allowance or thing of value.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 264B does not, in a similar context, contain the words \u201cthing of value\u201d which had frequently, although not invariably, been interpreted as encompassing a free play. <em>See </em>Annot., <em>Coin-operated pinball machine or similar device, played for amusement only or confining reward to privilege of free replays, as prohibited or permitted by antigambling laws, </em>89 A.L.R.2d 815 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Moreover, as we recognized in <em>Chesapeake Beach, </em>the General Assembly, in enacting \u00a7 264B, \u201cadopted the theory of the Federal statutes.\u201d 251 Md. at 666, 248 A.2d 479. We thereby expressly noted a distinction between devices constructed and designed for gambling which \u201cpay off in other than additional free plays\u201d and other devices, not adapted for gambling and used solely for amusement, which award free plays that are not redeemable for money or merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The verbiage used in \u00a7 264B must, of course, also be considered in light of the legislature\u2019s knowledge of the construction that the courts had previously given to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>State\u2019s gambling laws. <em>Gaither v. Cate, supra, </em>decided in 1929, involved a coin-operated slot machine which, upon activation by the insertion of a nickel and the pulling of a lever, simultaneously (a) dispensed a packet of mint wafers worth but a fraction of a nickel and (b) caused several cylinders containing various symbols to rotate and form various combinations, some of which entitled the successful player to receive tokens in varying amounts. Both the device and the tokens themselves specified that the game was for amusement only and that the tokens were not redeemable. The tokens could be used to replay the machine and also for insertion, albeit unlawfully, in pay telephones. In concluding that such machines were subject to seizure as illegal gambling devices, the court noted that in actuality the machines were \u201cmanufactured and designed for gambling purposes\u201d to increase sales of mint wafers \u201cby appealing to the gambling instinct, which is either active or latent in almost every individual.\u201d 156 Md. at 264-65, 144 A. 239. The attraction of the device, the Court said, was that the player, in addition to receiving mint wafers,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">\u201cis furnished a certain varying amount of amusement in observing the revolving of the cylinders and the formation of different combinations of symbols thereon, or that [tokens] will be redeemed at a certain figure, or that he desires to use them for the fraudulent purpose of placing them in coin slot boxes in substitution for money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, 144 A. 239.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The Court characterized the device as an illegal \u201cgame of chance, exciting the gambling instinct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, 144 A. 239. It said that the amusement thereby provided was \u201ca thing of value, for it is probably true that more money is spent each year by the citizens of this country for that purpose than for any other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, 144 A. 239. And, finally, the Court, said that the amount of amusement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>furnished varied as between players, depending entirely upon the element of chance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Of course, it has long violated Maryland\u2019s gambling laws to maintain a pinball machine which, in lieu of free games won, permits the payment of cash to the successful player. <em>See Hunter v. State, </em>193 Md. 596, 69 A.2d 505 (1949). In <em>Bell v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>195 Md. 21, 72 A.2d 746 (1950), we recognized that coin-operated mechanical or electrical devices, ostensibly for amusement, have been utilized as gambling devices where free games won by the successful player were \u201cpaid off\u201d in cash. <em>Brown v. State, </em>210 Md. 301, 123 A.2d 324 (1956) was a gambling prosecution that involved a pinball machine capable of awarding a successful player up to 200 free games. The device contained a switch by which to remove free plays won by a successful operator. At his option, the player would be paid in cash for the free games. We there said that the inducement to play the device, in part at least, was the chance of gaining a monetary reward. We noted the existence of cases from other jurisdictions holding that an award of free games \u201cis generally held to constitute a thing of value\u201d under gambling laws and we observed that \u201c[i]f a pinball machine is not a gambling device <em>per se, </em>it may become one when it is shown that it is in fact put to such use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307-08, 123 A.2d 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The three elements of gambling \u2014 consideration, chance and reward<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u2014 are thus clearly present in a device which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>for a price, and based upon chance, offers a monetary or merchandise reward to the successful player. And, as earlier indicated, the award of a free game, without more, has in a number of jurisdictions, under statutes of varying import, been construed to constitute a reward in determining whether particular devices violated a state\u2019s gambling laws. <em>See Sinclair v. Benton, </em>152 Fla. 138, 10 So.2d 917, 918 (1942) (\u201cprize or reward\u201d); <em>Heath Sales Co. v.

The New Jersey court in <em>Rosenkranz v. Vassallo, </em>193 N.J.Super. 319, 473 A.2d 991 (1984), involving video poker, blackjack and similar devices which awarded free games, concluded that these machines were gambling devices because of various gambling-type mechanisms attached to the devices. The Pennsylvania court, in consolidated cases reported as <em>Com. v. Two Electronic Poker Game Machines, </em>502 Pa. 186, 465 A.2d 973 (1983), found a machine to be a gambling device <em>per se, </em>citing the knock-off button, knock-off meter, holdover of scores in successive games, short playing time, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>dip switch to vary game credits. The court further held that another machine was not a gambling device <em>per se </em>where it contained neither a knock-off switch nor meter. In <em>Thole v. Westfall, </em>682 S.W.2d 33 (Mo.App.1984), the court held a free-play device that registered 9,999 games and had a knock-off button and meter to be a gambling device <em>per se </em>because, under those circumstances, the free plays constituted \u201csomething of value\u201d under the state gambling statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Other cases have reached different results under a variety of statutory provisions. In <em>People v. One Mechanical Device, </em>11 Ill.2d 151, 142 N.E.2d 98, 100 (1957), the court declared that a free play awarded by a device constituted \u201cneither money, the equivalent of money, nor a valuable thing\u201d within the contemplation of that state\u2019s gambling laws. <em>State v. One \u201cJack and Jill\u201d Pinball Machine, </em>224 S.W.2d 854 (Mo.App.1949) held that a free play was not \u201cproperty.\u201d This interpretation was codified under an amended statute that prohibited reward of \u201csomething of value,\u201d including replays, but excepted \u201can immediate right of replay not exchangeable for something of value.\u201d <em>Matter of: An Omega Brand: Double Up, Etc., </em>676 S.W.2d 292, 294 (Mo.App.1984). Other cases that have held that free plays are not sufficient rewards include <em>Tanner v. Sherman, </em>67 Cal.App.2d 586, 154 P.2d 906 (1945), citing <em>Gayer v. Whelan, </em>59 Cal.App.2d 255, 138 P.2d 763 (1943) (\u201cmerchandise, money, representative or articles of value, checks, or tokens redeemable in, or exchangeable for money or any other thing of value\u201d); <em>State v.

As we see it, the licensing provisions, as presently contained in the 1983 Replacement Volume of the Code and its 1985 Cumulative Supplement, are all presently in effect. <em>See </em>Code (1984 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-201 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article declaring that a code replacement volume, together with any pocket supplements, constitutes evidence of the existing law of Maryland.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>We think the licensing provisions for amusement devices must be read <em>in pari materia </em>with \u00a7 264B and that a true amusement device which awards only free plays is not within the prohibition of \u00a7 264B unless the device itself is adapted for gambling. Therefore, a free game awarded upon a device which is not adapted for gambling, <em>i.e., </em>a <em>true </em>free-play machine, is not an object representative of or convertible into money in the sense contemplated by \u00a7 264B. We thus find no merit in the State\u2019s contention that under \u00a7 264B a free play of itself, registered upon a device the operation of which involves the element of chance, is an object representative of or convertible into money because it is the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of the coin or token otherwise necessary to activate the machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">These conclusions are amply supported by \u00a7 264B\u2019s legislative history. By eschewing adoption of the Florida and New York statutory schemes, <em>see Chesapeake Beach, supra, </em>251 Md. at 666, 248 A.2d 479, the Maryland legislature intended that devices which were not adapted for gambling, but which awarded automatic replays and nothing else, were not within the statutory definition of a slot machine. In adopting the rationale of the federal statutes, the legislature manifestly intended that a free-play device, equipped with gambling features such as odds mechanisms, a meter for recording the number of free plays released, or other recognized indicia of a gambling device, was a machine adapted for gambling. Consequently, it intended that free games registered upon such a gambling device, without more, would constitute an object representative of or convertible into money and that all such devices were prohibited slot machines under \u00a7 264B.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">A prime focus of the Federal Gambling Devices Act of 1962 was upon pinball machines and the extent to which those devices were then being used for gambling purposes. Cognizant of this fact, the legislature by uncodified \u00a7 2 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u00a7 264B made special provision to insure that the device \u201ccommonly known or colloquially referred to, as \u2018pinball machine\u2019 \u201d would not be deemed a prohibited slot machine as long as it did not permit any reward to a successful player \u201cbeyond an automatic replay of a game or games mechanically provided upon said machine.\u201d While the exclusionary provision is directed only to true free-play pinball machines, and does not encompass all free-play devices, that alone does not mean that other free-play devices, not adapted for gambling, and which award only free games, are slot machines under the statutory definition.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Dicta in <em>Chesapeake Beach </em>focusing on the import and effect of uncodified \u00a7 2 upon the definition of a slot machine does not require a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Property that is inherently illegal to possess is contraband <em>per se </em>and subject to summary seizure without proceedings for forfeiture. <em>Director of Fin., Pr. Geo\u2019s Co. v. Cole, </em>296 Md. 607, 619, 465 A.2d 450 (1983). As slot machines are illegal to possess under \u00a7 264B, they are manifestly contraband <em>per se. See Soper v. Michal, </em>123 Md. 542, 91 A. 684 (1914); <em>Police Commr\u2019s v. Wagner, </em>93 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Md. 182, 183, 48 A. 455 (1901). The principle is applicable to such devices that are merely stored in a warehouse. <em>See, e.g., Stanley-Thompson Liquor Co. v. People, </em>63 Colo. 456, 168 P. 750 (1917); <em>Sterling Novelty Co. v. Commonwealth, </em>271 S.W.2d 366 (Ky.1954); <em>State v. Madere, </em>352 So.2d 666 (La.1977).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Indeed, Willow concedes that a free-play machine equipped with gambling features would be contraband <em>per se </em>if, as we have now determined, a free play recorded on such a gambling device is representative of or convertible into money.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The \u201cantique\u201d slot machines seized in this case appear to have been of the conventional \u201cone-arm\u201d bandit variety, with a coin chute to facilitate direct monetary payment. Clearly, these devices were contraband <em>per se </em>if not excepted from seizure under the provisions of \u00a7 264B(V) for devices manufactured prior to 1941, as held by the Court of Special Appeals. Section 264B(V) did not, however, become effective until July 1, 1981, six months after Willow\u2019s antique slot machines were seized by the police. Accordingly, at the time of their seizure, they were inherently illegal to possess, were contraband <em>per se </em>and thus subject to immediate seizure without further proceedings. That the State filed a forfeiture petition after the effective date of \u00a7 264B(V), although not required to do so, does not alter the fact that the State\u2019s interest in the devices vested immediately upon seizure. Moreover, under the provisions of Code (1981 Repl.Vol.), Article 1, \u00a7 3, the 1981 amendment of \u00a7 264B did not affect the legality of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>forfeiture in this case, which was completed as of December 30, 1980.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The Court of Special Appeals found certain of the devices to be inoperable and therefore not within the statutory definition of a slot machine. It relied upon its earlier holding in <em>Allen v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 459, 307 A.2d 493 (1973) that devices which are only adaptable, but not actually adapted for use as slot machines, are not within the prohibition of \u00a7 264B. The court pointedly indicated in <em>Allen </em>that if the legislature intended a broader definitional sweep so as to encompass inoperable devices, it could change the law to prohibit those devices which are merely adaptable for such use. In the present case, the intermediate appellate court noted that over ten years had elapsed since <em>Allen </em>was decided and the legislature has not altered the definition of a slot machine under \u00a7 264B to include inoperable devices. 59 Md.App. at 61, 474 A.2d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The devices in <em>Allen </em>consisted of an empty slot machine case, a reel mechanism for a slot machine, and a one-arm, console-type slot machine from which various parts necessary for it to operate had been removed. The court con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>eluded that the words in \u00a7 264B, \u201cis adapted\u201d for use, meant that the statute \u201ccovers only devices which <em>are </em>fit, or adjusted, for use as slot machines.\u201d 18 Md.App. at 465, 307 A.2d 493 (emphasis in original). While the inoperable devices in the present case were not as clearly described as in <em>Allen, </em>it does not appear that their inoperability was calculated or contrived as an expedient for avoiding the prohibition of \u00a7 264B against the possession of slot machines. In view of the legislature\u2019s silence in the years following the <em>Allen </em>decision, we conclude that the inoperable devices in this case were not subject to seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">We hold that all of the seized coin-activated, free-play devices in Willow\u2019s possession, which involved an element of chance and which were equipped with odds mechanisms, or a meter for recording the number of free plays released, or other established indicia of a gambling device, are illegal slot machines under \u00a7 264B and subject to forfeiture as contraband <em>per se. </em>On the other hand, those free-play devices in Willow\u2019s possession, not adapted for gambling, which award automatic replays only, and which contain nothing more than a knock-off switch, are not slot machines under the statutory definition. Other of Willow\u2019s devices in question which award a successful player, directly or indirectly with money or merchandise, including the so-called antique slot machines, are clearly forfeitable as contraband <em>per se </em>under the statute. Devices otherwise within the statutory definition, but which are inoperable, are not slot machines where, as in <em>Allen </em>and as here, there is no indication that the devices were rendered inoperable solely to avoid seizure for violation of \u00a7 264B.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">In distinguishing between the various devices involved in this case, we have given due regard to the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\u00a7 264 of Art. 27 which require that we construe statutes \u201crelating to gambling and betting liberally, so as to prevent the mischiefs intended to be provided against.\u201d <em>See Chesapeake Beach, supra, </em>251 Md. at 662, 248 A.2d 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND THE MATTER TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

The merchandise-dispensing device in <em>Gaither </em>seems to be of a kind contemplated by the legislature when, in \u00a7 264B, it expressly included within the definition of a slot machine any coin-operated gambling device which \"apart from any element of chance or unpredictable outcome of such operation, [may] also sell, deliver or present some merchandise or money or other tangible thing of value.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\">.

In several of these cases, the court declared that the gambling statutes, being criminal, required a strict construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\">. Under the rule of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>where general words in a statute of uncertain meaning follow the designation of particular things or classes of subjects, the general words will usually be construed to include only those things of the same class or general nature as those specifically antecedently mentioned. The rule is based on the supposition that if the legislature had intended the general words to be construed in an unrestricted sense, it would not have enumerated the specific things. <em>See State v. Sinclair &amp; Sinwellan Corp., </em>274 Md. 646, 658, 337 A.2d 703 (1975); <em>Smith v. Higinbothom, </em>187 Md. 115, 130, 48 A.2d 754, 761 (1946). Application of the rule is influenced by the remedial nature of the statute. <em>See Culotta v. Raimondi, </em>251 Md. 384, 387, 247 A.2d 519, 521 (1968). As Art. 27, \u00a7 246 requires that we give liberal interpretation to \u00a7 264B, we are of the view that the words \"other object\u201d in the statute are not restricted to tangible things, such as money, coin or a token, but may include the registration of a free game upon a gambling device.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b485-4\">. The rationale of this enactment appears clear from its uncodified preamble which recites that the police and other authorities in Wicomico County found it almost impossible to obtain evidence of \"payoffs\u201d for free games registered on pinball or console devices. As a consequence, it would appear that Wicomico County may only permit licensure of non-free-play pinball and console machines and other like non-free-play amusement devices.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b485-5\">. Also passed at the same 1963 legislative session at which \u00a7 264B was enacted was ch. 604 of the Acts of 1963, adding a new \u00a7 699B to the Public Local Laws of Prince George\u2019s County. That act made it unlawful to keep, maintain, possess, or operate any device or machine \u201cfor which payment of the federal tax specified in Sections 4461(A)(2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>and 4462(A)(2) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as amended is required.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b487-6\">.
