Pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1984 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 643B(c),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>he was sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment without possibility of parole.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>The Court of Special Appeals affirmed his conviction and sentence in <em>Blandon v. State, </em>60 Md.App. 582, 483 A.2d 1320 (1984). We granted Blandon\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to eliminate yet another alleged ambiguity .arising under Maryland\u2019s enhanced penalty statute for repeat offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether second degree rape constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined in Art. 27, \u00a7 643B(a). We hold that appellant\u2019s crime is within the purview of that statute. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Bland\u00f3n argues that \u00a7 643B(a) is ambiguous and that this ambiguity must be resolved in his favor. \u201cCrime of violence\u201d is defined in this section as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201c(a) <em>Crime of violence. </em>\u2014 As used in this section, the term \u2018crime of violence\u2019 means abduction; arson; burglary; daytime housebreaking under \u00a7 30(b) of this article; kidnapping; manslaughter, except involuntary manslaughter; mayhem and maiming under \u00a7\u00a7 384, 385, and 386 of this article; murder; rape; robbery; robbery with a deadly weapon; sexual offense in the first degree; sexual offense in the second degree; use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or other crime of violence; an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>attempt to commit any of the aforesaid offenses; assault with intent to murder; and assault with intent to rape.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARl\">Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1984 Cum.Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The alleged ambiguity arises because the legislature was degree specific as to which sexual offenses constitute \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d but did not specify or distinguish among degrees of rape in the same context. Appellant maintains that this doubt should be resolved by our finding that the term \u201crape\u201d as used in \u00a7 643B(a) encompasses only first degree rape. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">As we have stated time and again, in cases of ambiguity or doubt, a statute must be construed to effectuate the real and actual intention of the legislature. <em>See State v. Intercontinental, Ltd., </em>302 Md. 132, 137, 486 A.2d 174 (1985). Moreover, rules of statutory construction require us to avoid construing a statute in a way which would lead to absurd results. <em>Holy Cross Hosp. v. Maryland Empl. Sec., </em>288 Md. 685, 698-99, 421 A.2d 944 (1980); <em>Coerper v. Comptroller, </em>265 Md. 3, 6, 288 A.2d 187 (1972). In other words, we should reject a proposed statutory interpretation if its consequences are inconsistent with common sense. <em>State v. Intercontinental, Ltd., supra, </em>302 Md. at 137, 486 A.2d 174; <em>Bailey v. Woel, </em>302 Md. 38, 43, 485 A.2d 265 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">A comparison of Maryland\u2019s rape and sexual offense statutes reveals that an adoption of appellant\u2019s position would lead to precisely the absurd results we are compelled to avoid. Second degree rape is statutorily defined in Art. 27, \u00a7 463 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201c(a) <em>What constitutes. </em>\u2014 A person is guilty of rape in the second degree if the person engages in vaginal intercourse with another person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">(1) By force or threat of force against the will and without the consent of the other person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">(2) Who is mentally defective, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless, and the person performing the act knows or should reasonably know the other person is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>mentally defective, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">(3) Who is under 14 years of age and the person performing the act is at least four years older than the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">(b) <em>Penalty. </em>\u2014 Any person violating the provisions of this section is guilty of a felony and upon conviction is subject to imprisonment for a period of not more than 20 years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The elements of a second degree sexual offense are also set forth in article 27. Section 464A(a) defines this crime and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">\u201c(a) <em>What constitutes. </em>\u2014 A person is guilty of a sexual offense in the second degree if the person engages in a sexual act with another person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">(1) By force or threat of force against the will and without the consent of the other person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">(2) Who is mentally defective, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless, and the person performing the act knows or should reasonably know the other person is mentally defective, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-12\">(3) Under 14 years of age and the person performing the sexual act is four or more years older than the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-13\">(b) <em>Penalty. </em>\u2014 Any person violating the provisions of this section is guilty of a felony and upon conviction is subject to imprisonment for a period of not more than 20 years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-15\">As can be seen, the two crimes are virtually identical in their elements and potential penalties. The only distinction is that second degree rape requires an act of vaginal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>intercourse while the second degree sexual offense is based on the commission of a sexual act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">As the State correctly points out, an adoption of appellant\u2019s position would result in enhanced punishment being meted out to the defendant who by force or threat of force, against the will and without the consent of the victim engaged in a \u201csexual act\u201d but not to the defendant who culminates the same conduct with an act of vaginal intercourse. We can not presume the legislature intended such disparate results.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Nor can we reconcile such illogical results with what we have determined to be the legislative intent behind \u00a7 643B. In <em>Hawkins v. State </em>this Court stated, \u201cThe purpose of [\u00a7 643B] ... is to protect the public from assaults upon people and injury to property and to deter repeat offenders from perpetrating other criminal acts of violence.... \u201d 302 Md. 143, 148, 486 A.2d 179 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In our view, the conduct proscribed as a second degree sexual offense is no more violent or assaultive than that constituting second degree rape. Aside from the ultimate act, the behavior is the same; the standard penalty provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 463(b) and 464A(b) are identical. Clearly, the legislature would not treat these offenses equally for purposes of regular sentencing and later distinguish among them when imposing enhanced penalties. If a statute is part of a general statutory scheme or system, the various sections must be read together to ascertain the true inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>tion of the legislature. <em>Mazor v. State, Dep \u2019t of Correction, </em>279 Md. 355, 361, 369 A.2d 82 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Finally, though appellant would have us do so, we are unable to find any evidence of legislative intent contrary to our interpretation in the history of the enhanced penalty for repeat offenders provisions. As orginally enacted in 1975, section 643B defined a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as \u201cabduction; arson; kidnapping; manslaughter, except involuntary manslaughter; mayhem; rape; and robbery; or an attempt to commit any of these offenses.\u201d 1975 Md.Laws Ch. 253. As of 1975, rape had not yet been statutorily divided into degrees. Hence, \u201crape\u201d necessarily referred to common law rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">However, in 1976 the General Assembly codified rape and other sexual offenses. Rape was divided into two degrees, while four degrees of sexual offenses were delineated. Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 461 <em>et seq. </em>Contemporaneously, the legislature amended \u00a7 643B to include first and second degree sexual offenses as \u201ccrimes of violence.\u201d 1976 Md. Laws Ch. 611. Notably, third and fourth degree sexual offenses were not listed as \u201ccrimes of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">By limiting the degrees of sexual offenses which constitute \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d to first and second degree and placing no similar qualifications on rape, the legislature has clearly implied an intent that no such limitations be placed on rape for purposes of imposing mandatory sentences under \u00a7 643B. In keeping with this intent, we hold that rape in the second degree is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of sentencing under \u00a7 643B. As appellant was convicted of attempted second degree rape, his third \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d we affirm his sentence of 25 years imprisonment without possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-14\">. Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1984 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 643B(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-15\">\u201c(c) <em>Third conviction of crime of violence. </em>\u2014 Any person who (1) has been convicted on two separate occasions of a crime of violence where the convictions do not arise from a single incident, and (2) has served at least one term of confinement in a correctional institution as a result of a conviction of a crime of violence, shall be sentenced, on being convicted a third time of a crime of violence, to imprisonment for the term allowed by law, but, in any event, not less than 25 years. Neither the sentence nor any part of it may be suspended, and the person shall not be eligible for parole except in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 IB, \u00a7 11. A separate occasion shall be considered one in which the second or succeeding offense is committed after there has been a charging document filed for the preceding occasion.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\">.
