Vol.), Article 81, \u00a7\u00a7 221 and 302(a) by unlawfully and willfully filing fraudulent state income tax returns for 1979 and 1980.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was also found guilty of conspiring to violate the Maryland income tax laws. He was sentenced on September 14, 1983 to imprisonment for five years, the execution of all but one year being suspended. The Respondent was placed on five years supervised probation. We affirmed the judgments of conviction in <em>Osburn v. State, </em>301 Md. 250, 482 A.2d 905 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">On February 19, 1985, the Attorney Grievance Commission, acting through Bar Counsel, filed a Petition for Disciplinary Action against Osburn, setting forth the fact of the final judgments of conviction and contending that such misconduct violated Disciplinary Rule 1-102 which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">\u201cDR 1-102 Misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>(A) A lawyer shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\">(1) Violate a Disciplinary Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">(2) Circumvent a Disciplinary Rule through actions of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">(3) Engage in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">(4) Engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">(5) Engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">(6) Engage in any other conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">We referred the matter, pursuant to Maryland Rule BV9 b, to Judge Richard B. Latham of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. After conducting a hearing, Judge Latham noted that under Rule BV10 e 1 Respondent\u2019s convictions constituted \u201cconclusive proof of the Respondent\u2019s guilt of conspiracy to violate the Maryland Income Tax law, willfully giving false information on the Maryland State income tax return and making fraudulent Maryland State income tax returns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A61\">Bar Counsel has recommended disbarment as the appropriate sanction for the Respondent\u2019s misconduct. While taking no exception to Judge Latham\u2019s findings, Osburn maintains that the imposition of any disciplinary sanction should be deferred until the conclusion of post conviction proceedings which he plans to initiate sometime in the future on the ground that his trial counsel in the criminal case was incompetent. Osburn also suggests that newly discovered evidence exists which would tend to mitigate against the finding of guilt in the criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">We think a conviction under Art. 81, \u00a7 302(a) of making a fraudulent return with the intent to defeat the payment of taxes is a crime of moral turpitude. For the purpose of attorney discipline, the offense is equivalent to a conviction of the federal offense of filing a false and fraudulent federal income tax return in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201. In several cases, we have disbarred lawyers following final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>conviction of this federal crime. <em>Bar Ass\u2019n of Balto. City v. Siegel, </em>275 Md. 521, 340 A.2d 710 (1975); <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Callanan, </em>271 Md. 554, 318 A.2d 809 (1974); <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Agnew, </em>271 Md. 543, 318 A.2d 811 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">There are no extenuating or mitigating circumstances in this case to warrant a sanction less than disbarment and we therefore shall order the imposition of that sanction. In so concluding, we find no merit in Osburn\u2019s argument that we should defer imposing any sanction until he has completed his collateral attacks upon the convictions under Maryland\u2019s Post Conviction Procedure Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE BV15 c FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST ROBERT DUDLEY OSBURN, JR.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-11\">.
