Defendant plead a release, and thereafter noticed the cause for trial and put it on the calendar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-12\">Plaintiff then brought a second suit to set aside the release. To the complaint in this action defendant demurred and was sustained therein, but plaintiff was allowed to amend by payment of the costs- <em>{see S. G., ante, p. </em>337). Plaintiff paid the costs, amended his complaint, and then sought to discontinue the first suit. An order of discontinuance was granted conditioned on plaintiff\u2019s paying costs and $100 extra allowance. Plaintiff paid the costs and extra allowance, the latter under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>protest, and then discontinued. To so much of the order as granted an extra allowance plaintiff appealed. Motion made to dismiss the appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-5\">On appeal, <em>held, </em>that from the peculiar form of the order we think plaintiff could not avail himself of its benefits without complying with its conditions, but by so doing he waived his right to appeal. Had he wished to review the action of the court below, he should have refrained from availing himself of the conditional leave until he could bring the question before this court by appeal.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b362-6\">Motion to dismiss the appeal granted.</disposition>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Brady and Daniels, JJ., concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
