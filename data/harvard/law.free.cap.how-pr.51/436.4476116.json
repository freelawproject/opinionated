The motion of defendant is:</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-15\">First, To set aside the service of the summons and order; and</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-16\">Second, To set aside the summons and order.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>I. The service of the papers was irregular and void and should he set aside for the following reasons, to wit:</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-5\">It was done through the instrumentality of unlawful, unwarranted and improper means.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-6\">The service was made by the plaintiff herself, who is the daughter of the defendant in the action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-7\">To effect it the plaintiff entered the premises of the defendant (having watched an opportunity to find her alone), broke open the door of her house by means of force, or a key of which she was improperly in possession, and with violence threw the papers into the very face and eyes of her mother.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-8\">The plaintiff was guilty of trespass and a breach of the peace in effecting this service.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-9\">She asks the aid and sanction of this court and bases her application upon a lawless act of her own.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-10\">The practice in our courts of justice must be conducted as prescribed by the statute and rules without any resort to dishonest, disorderly or unlawful acts on the part of those engaged in it or in the service of its process.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-11\">Analogous to this case are:</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-12\"><em>Carpenter </em>agt. <em>Spooner </em>(2 <em>Sand., </em>717). <em>Held, \u201c </em>this court will not sanction any attempt to bring a party within its jurisdiction by means of fraud or misrepresentation.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-13\"><em>Goupil </em>agt. <em>Simonson </em>(3 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>474). <em>Held, </em>\u201cthe order (order of arrest) should be discharged on the ground that the defendant was enticed within the bailiwick of the sheriff by a trick, which invalidates the service.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-14\">14 <em>East, pages </em>79, 116,118; 3 <em>Black. Com., </em>228, <em>and oases cited. Held, \u201c </em>no man\u2019s house or castle can be violated with impunity. In all cases where the law is silent this extreme violence is illegal.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-15\">24 <em>Wend., </em>369; 4 <em>Hill, </em>437. <em>Held, \u201c </em>if the outer door is merely latched it will be a breaking merely to unlatch it and enter the house.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-16\"><em>The Albany Law Journal (vol. II, p. </em>303, <em>and cases cited). </em>\u201c In <em>arrests </em>outer doors cannot be broken as a rule.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>The Albany Law Journal (vol. III, p. </em>465, <em>and cases cited). </em>&lt;c The power to break doors, in criminal cases, is rarely to be exercised.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-5\">\u201c Those who come into a court of justice asking redress must disclose a transaction warranted by law\u201d <em>(Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, p. </em>707).</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-6\">No court will lend its aid to a party who founds his proceedings on an immoral or illegal act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-7\">\u201c If the proceedings be based on the transgression of law the court refuses its assistance, not for the sake of the defendant but because they will not lend their aid to such a plaintiff \u201d <em>(Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, </em>711).</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-8\">This service was improper; it was unwarranted; it was unlawful. It cannot receive the sanction of this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-9\">II. The plaintiff has not complied with the statutory rule, and no case is made out by the affidavit of Mr. Lewis which entitles the plaintiff to examine the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-10\">The rule, as now settled by the court of appeals, is this: That the provision of the Code <em>(sec. </em>391) was designed as a substitute for the bill of discovery under the old practice <em>(Court of Appeals, Glenny </em>agt. <em>Stedwell [unreported), N. Y. Daily Register, Feb. </em>18, 1876).</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-11\">Under the old practice we have the following:</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-12\">\u201c As a general rule a bill of discovery must state the matter in relation to which a discovery is sought, the interest of the. party, with the right to require the discovery \u201d <em>(McIntyre </em>agt. <em>Mancius, </em>16 <em>John., </em>596).</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-13\"><em>\u201c </em>Unless the bill states affirmatively that the discovery is really wanted by the party applying, and also shows that the discovery might be material, it is defective'\u201d <em>(Gelston </em>agt. <em>Hoyt, </em>15 <em>John. Ch., </em>547).</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-14\">\u201c If the affidavit does not set forth the matter or thing sought to be discovered, or show in what respect the discovery is essential to enable the plaintiff to prepare for trial, which was necessary where a suit in equity was brought for a discovery after issue joined, the discovery cannot be had <em>\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>(Wigram on Discovery, </em>209, <em>sec. </em>74; <em>Carr </em>agt. <em>The Great Western Ins. Co., </em>3 <em>Daly, </em>161).</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-5\">\u201c The case must he so far disclosed as to enable a court of equity to see and be satisfied that the ends of justice require the interposition of its powers \u201d (16 <em>John., </em>598).</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The practice of the court on applying for a discovery requires the party to swear that the discovery is necessary, to enable him to prepare for trial \u201d <em>(Moor </em>agt. <em>McIntosh, </em>18 <em>Wend., </em>529).</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The party desiring the examination of a witness * * * may apply on an affidavit which shall state,\u201d among other things, \u201c that the testimony of such witness is material and necessary for the party making such application \u201d <em>(Rev. Stats., vol. III, p. </em>673, <em>title III, article first; compare sec. </em>390 <em>and sec. </em>391, <em>Code). </em>This rule is in harmony with rule 21 of supreme court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-9\">\u201c If the officer to whom such application is made shall be satisfied that the circumstances of the case require the examination of such witness in order to attain justice between the parties he shall make the order,\u201d &amp;c. <em>(Rev. Stats., vol. III, p. </em>673, <em>sec. </em>3).</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-10\">The affidavit must disclose such a case as gives the judge power to act <em>(Daily Reg., p. </em>330, <em>Feb. </em>18, 1876).</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-11\">No cause whatever is shown on this application. The affidavit is, therefore, defective in this :</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-12\">It does not show that the proposed examination is necessary\u2014 that it is desired\u2014that it would enable the plaintiff in any way to attain justice, to prove her case on the trial. Nor can it be reasonably inferred from the affidavit how it is material, necessary or even desirable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-13\">These proceedings should not be allowed for the purpose of vexation <em>(N. Y. Daily Register, p. </em>329, <em>Glenney </em>agt. <em>Stedwell).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-14\">III. Suppose the application to be made under rule 21 of supreme court. Rule 21 of this court is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-15\">\u201c The application for an examination under section 391 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>the Code shall be upon affidavit disclosing the nature of the discovery sought to enable the party to prove his case, or defense, on the trial, and how the same is material in aid of the prosecution or defense.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-5\">The affidavit of Mr. Lewis, on which this application was made, is not in compliance with the rule of court (21) and the examination should not be allowed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-6\">1. There is no allegation in the affidavit that any discovery is necessary \u201c to enable the party to prove his case \u201d * * * \u201c on the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-9\">2. There is no allegation in the affidavit that any of the proofs sought by the plaintiff would at all enable the plaintiff \u201c to prove his case on the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-10\">III. There is no showing in the affidavit, and no attempt at showing, \u201chow the same is material in aid of the prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-11\">. IY. The affidavit shows the following and nothing more:</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-12\">That issue is joined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-13\">That the case is on the calendar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-14\">That the action is brought to compel a conveyance, to recover possession of real property and certain interests therein, and for an accounting and for other relief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-15\">That defendant is material for the trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-16\">That the object of this proposed examination is to ascertain what, if any, disposition defendant has made of trust funds, and to adduce other-facts material to the issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-17\">That defendant knows nearly all the facts put in issue as plaintiff\u2019s attorney is informed and believes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-18\">That defendant resides in Brooklyn and is about to depart from the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-19\">The facts set forth in the affidavit are insufficient and the order and summons should be vacated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-20\">The provision is statutory and should be strictly complied with.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b444-21\"><em>Lewis &amp; </em>Beecher, for plaintiff, opposed.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Barnard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Agc\">\u2014 The plaintiff was not justified in entering her mother\u2019s house by unlocking the door without her mother\u2019s permission to make the service in question. As against the service of civil process, the law throws around the defendant the safeguard of protection to herself and her family. I cannot accept the plaintiff\u2019s statement that she carried the key to defendant\u2019s house by her permission. There had been long subsisting bitter and protracted litigation between the parties. If the plaintiff did once have the key by defendant\u2019s consent the plaintiff well knew that the right to use it had been withdrawn by the changed relations of the parties, if not by actual words. This service must be set aside, with costs (1 <em>Howard Pr. Rpts., </em>199; <em>id., </em>253).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
