In a letter of the 10th of October, 1872, acknowledging the receipt of this telegram, the plaintiffs say to the defendant, \u201c we presume Messrs. H. IT. Burt &amp; Co. have informed you as to our custom in case of stringent money markets. After using our capital deposits and such loans as we obtain from banks and trust companies for the benefit of our customers, without extra charge, we charge to them, in proportion to their debit balances, such expenses as we may have to incur by reason of the stringency.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-8\">On the 18th of October, 1872, the plaintiffs bought, for the account of the defendant, $5,000 South Carolina bonds, and on the same day informed him of the purchase by letter, which contained the following clause: \u201cWe inclose herewith our usual customer\u2019s agreement for your signature, and return to us.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-9\">The following is such agreement:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-10\">Memorandum of Agreement made this day of October, 1872.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-11\"><em>Whereas, </em>I, John Norris, of Buffalo, N.

On the eighteenth of November the plaintiffs received from the defendant a letter enclosing a draft for $821.68, one-half of the balance due on the purchase of the $10,000 of the South Carolina bonds, and informing them that Mr. John Douglas, who was a customer of the plaintiffs, owned one-half of these bonds, and would remit the other half of the purchase-money, viz: $821.68, which he did. Since November 11, 1872, interest to the amount of $2.22 had accrued, and this was paid subsequent to the 18th day of November, 1872.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-6\">On the twentieth of November the defendant remitted to the plaintiffs $1,000, and in the letter accompanying the same used the following language : \u201c Inclosed please find draft for $1,000 which you will please place to my credit and allow me the same interest as you do Mr. John Douglas of this city.\u201d The plaintiffs acknowledged the receipt of the remittance of $1,000, by a letter dated the twenty-first of November, in which they say : \u201c Your account will bear interest on same terms as that of your friend Mr. Douglas, viz., six per cent if merely used for banking purposes and seven per cent if for dealing in stocks.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-7\">From this time to January 1st, 1873, the defendant bought and sold certain stocks through the plaintiffs, and on the 8th day of January, T873, they rendered an account to the defendant showing a debit balance of $5,862.99. Among the charges in this account was an item of $61.72. \u201c Your proportion expenses incurred by us during stringencies on stocks carried for your accountand in a day or two thereafter the defendant sent to the plaintiffs an acknowledgment in writing, of the correctness of this account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The dealing continued between the parties from January 1st, 1873, to July 1st, 1873, when, on the twelfth of that month, an account was rendered to defendant showing a debit balance of $33,798.97, and with the account was inclosed a request to sign a memorandum of the correctness of the account. During the months of February, March and April almost daily charges were made against the defendant for commissions, being his proportion of the commissions paid by the plaintiffs for borrowing money to carry the stocks of their customers during monetary stringency when money could not be procured at seven per cent. These charges were made at the end of the business of each day and the defendant was immediately informed in every instance of the charge having been made, in a letter in the following form :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-5\">\u201cWe charge your account for commissions paid by us in borrowing money on fifteenth instant, $1.36, being 1-50 per cent on your debit balance, $6,800.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-6\">The defendant received these notices by due course of mail, and never made any objection whatever to the same, or to the plaintiffs procuring the money for the purpose of carrying his stocks by paying commissions in addition to seven per cent interest. The defendant did not sign the admission of the correctness of the account sent to him July twelfth, but called on the plaintiffs at their banking-house in this city, in the month of August and made, as he alleges, some complaints about these charges for commissions. About the eighteenth of September, a monetary panic then prevailing in the city of New York, the plaintiffs telegraphed to Burt <em>&amp; </em>Co., requesting them to ask the defendant to send them more money as a margin, and on the same or the next day they received by telegraph an order from the defendant to sell 300 shares of New York Central, which they did on the nineteenth of September. On the twentieth of September the stock board closed. On the twenty-fourth of September, stocks having still further declined, the plaintiffs telegraphed to the defendant to remit $1,500, and on the same day the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>defendant answered them by telegraph that he could not raise the currency, and on the same day, stocks having declined still further, the plaintiffs sold in Broad street, that being the only place where stocks could then be sold, the Stock Exchange being closed, without any notice to the defendant, 200 shares of Lake Shore stock which they had been carrying for him. That upon being informed of the said sale the defendant denied the right of the plaintiffs to sell this stock. That after crediting the defendant with the proceeds of the sale of Lake Shore stock, he was indebted to the plaintiffs in the sum of $1,523.92 as security for which they held $6,000 in South Carolina bonds, which then had no market value, and the right to collect $1,200, on the fifteenth of October, the amount of dividends which had been declared upon the 300 shares of New York Central stock, previously sold by the plaintiffs for the account of the defendant. This $1,200 was collected on the twelfth of October, leaving $323.92 and interest dtie to the plaintiffs, as they claimed, as collateral for which they hold the $5,000, Carolina bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-5\">This action is brought to obtain a decree of this court directing the sale of said bonds, or so much thereof as may be necessary to pay said balance. The defendant claims that the sale of said Lake Shore stock was without his authority, and that the plaintiffs by the sale which they made converted the same to their own use, and also that they have no right to make the charges for commissions paid for borrowing money.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-6\"><em>John, E. </em>Burrill, for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-7\"><em>Mr. Sackett, </em>and <em>Mr. Morris </em>in person, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b451-8\">Van Brunt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0E\">\u2014There is no dispute about the facts of this case and the questions which I am called upon to decide are merely those of law. The first question which presents itself is as to the right of the plaintiffs to charge the commissions which they did in the account of the defendant for obtaining money.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>At the commencement of their dealings, in a letter of the 10th of October, 1872, the plaintiffs informed the defendant that their custom was in ease of a stringent money market to charge such commissions as they were required to pay in raising money, and in the case of the first account rendered, and which the defendant acknowledged to be correct, there was a charge for money paid out in this way, and it is to be noticed that the defendant was duly informed every day when any such charge was made against him, and he made no objection to the same until August at least, although they were made in February, March and April. It seems to me very clear that the defendant was in duty bound, if he intended to dispute these charges, to notify \"the plaintiffs at once as soon as he was made aware of the fact, and not let them make day by day these expenditures for his benefit, and not wait until he is called upon to pay to dispute them. If he did not desire them to raise money to carry his stocks at such high rates, he should have said so, and then the plaintiffs could have protected themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The defendant, in his points, urges that the plaintiffs were merely his agents to borrow the money, and that he owed the lenders of the money, and not the plaintiffs. This position is entirely untenable, because no rule is better established than that if an agent pays out money for his principal that he may sue and recover the sum so paid from the principal. Mr. Atkins swears that they actually paid these sums for commissions to obtain money to carry the defendant\u2019s stocks, and hence if done by his authority, and we must assume that it was so done, in\" view of the letter of October tenth and the daily notification of such expenditures without any objection being made by defendant, they have a clear right to claim their payment of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The next question is as to the sale of the Lake Shore stock. If the agreement of October eighteenth was still in force, there can be no question upon the subject, as it gives the plaintiffs the right to sell, whenever and wherever they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>please. The defendant claims that this agreement applies only to the purchase of bonds, which account was closed on or about the 18th of November, 1872, arid did not cover subsequent transactions. In discussing this question it will be necessary to consider, briefly, the circumstances under which the agreement of October eighteenth was signed. TJpon the receipt of the first order from the defendant the plaintiffs at once inclose to him this agreement for signature, saying: \u201cWe herewith inclose our usual customer\u2019s agreement for your signature,\u201d and he signs and returns the same to them. It has been settled by our court of appeals, that no custom among brokers can deprive parties of rights which the law gives them, but they have not decided that those rights may not be waived by agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">I think it perfectly clear that if the broker informs his customer of the terms upon which he will act for him as his broker, and in view of that notice the customer gives an order, he is bound by the terms on which the broker proposed to act for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">So in this case, if the plaintiffs had written to the defendant that the terms upon which they accepted orders from customers were as stated in the printed contract and he had then given an order, he would have been bound by its terms even though he had never signed it, or given any express assent to it. As well might a customer of a merchant say, after buying goods, that he had not promised to pay cash, because he said nothing when the merchant, before dealing with him, had told him he only sold for cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">It seems to me immaterial, therefore, whether the agreement, as signed, was intended to apply to any other transactions than the bonds or not; it was a notice to him of the terms upon which the plaintiffs would deal with him, and when he gave his orders he assented to its conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">But I do not think that there is any thing in this case to show that it was only intended to apply to the purchase of the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The .defendant became a customer of the plaintiffs for the first time when he gave the first order, he signs what the plaintiffs notify him is their \u201c usual customer\u2019s agreement,\u201d and he goes on dealing with them almost continuously thereafter. The mere fact that for one day or two the account was balanced does not alter the question, because the defendant still continued to be the plaintiffs\u2019 customer \u2014 there had never been a sufficiently long cessation of dealings for him to lose that relation. In fact there was no formal closing of the account, and the defendant never, by any act of his, showed that he intended to close his account. The mere payment of all the money which he owed upon the bonds did not show any such intention, because if he had intended so to do he would have taken up his bonds and not have allowed them to remain in plaintiffs\u2019 hands and be used at a margin for his future purchases. The fact that the stock was not sold at the Stock Exchange does not invalidate the sale, because the contract gives them the right to sell wherever they please; neither were the plaintiffs bound to sell as soon as margin was exhausted, as long as they acted in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The plaintiffs must have judgment, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
