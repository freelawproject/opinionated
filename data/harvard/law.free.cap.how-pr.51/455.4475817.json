In my opinion, the words claimed by plaintiffs as constituting the'trade mark ceased to have any character as such, and became descriptive of a kind of oil. However this may be, the plaintiffs have no property in them. The first owner of the trade mark, so called, was Pepper, and plaintiff Weston had no interest in it. Pepper became partner of defendant Ketcham, and the trade mark became distinctive of the manufacture of the firm. At any rate, it was Ketcham\u2019s property as much as Pepper\u2019s. Since that time, the evidence shows no acquisition of any right from Pepper or from Ketcham, by plaintiff Weston, to the trade mark. I leave out of view an important fact in the case, that if the trade mark were kept in existence as such, by its continuous use by the succession of the various firms, it belonged to any one partner as much as to another. I mean only to point out there has been no transfer of it to the exclusive use of plaintiff West or his present firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">The only thing which the plaintiffs can claim gave .them the exclusive right to the words composing the alleged trade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>mark, is the agreement of Mrs. Pepper with plain tiff Weston, that the latter, or any firm of which he might be a member, shall have, for five years, \u201c the exclusive use of the name of Capt. Simeon Pepper in the manufacture of signal oils, as a \u2018 trade mark,\u2019 to be designated Capt. S. Pepper\u2019s Signal Oil, or Pepper\u2019s Signal Oil, for the term of five years, and that at the end of the five years she would render and yield up to the plaintiff Weston \u2018the said trade mark,\u2019 as hereinbefore described, for his own use, benefit and behoof for ever.\u201d Mrs. Pepppr did not succeed to any business of her husband\u2019s which, continuing, a trade mark belonging to it might continue. Her husband left no such business, and there is no such thing as a trade mark in \u201c gross,\u201d to use that term by analogy. It must be \u201c appendant \u201d of some particular business in which it is actually used upon or in regard to specific articles. And she in no way disclosed by the evidence\u2014 and I do not see how any could possibly exist\u2014\u2022 became possessed of the right to transfer to any one the right to use her deceased husband\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">It came to this, that, as a matter of fact, the claim is, the defendant sells oil which is truly called \u201cPepper\u2019s Signal Oil,\u201d &amp;c. The evidence rather discloses that it is not that oil but an improvement upon it. Passing that by, the plaintiffs\u2019 further allegation is, that the defendant sells oil under the name of \u201c Pepper\u2019s Signal Oil,\u201d &amp;e., which, in fact, is not such. I do not think this gives the plaintiffs a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The complaint is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Defendant will engross the findings, &amp;e., made by me, and present them to me for signing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
