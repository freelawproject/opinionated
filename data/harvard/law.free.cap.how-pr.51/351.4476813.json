The city charter of 1873 fixed the salaries of said justices at $5,000 per year. Both acts being equally constitutional, the salaries fixed by the city charter must control.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-9\">The plaintiff sues to recover his salary as civil justice at the rate of $10,000 per annum. The defendant by answer claims that by the charter of 1873 the salary of civil justices was reduced to $5,000. The plaintiff demurs to this answer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-10\"><em>David J. </em>Dean, for defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-11\"><em>A.

The title of the first act is no more comprehensive than the other, the first being entitled \u201c an act to make provision for the local government,\u201d &amp;e., and the second <em>\u201c </em>an act to reorganize the local government,\u201d &amp;e. In fact the last title is most comprehensive, and would embrace all subjects relating to every question affecting the city treasury. I can see no reason why, in the city charter, the legislature may not fix and limit the amount of moneys to be paid out of the city treasury precisely the same as it does in the tax levy. In fact, I know of no subject which can be legislated upon in a city' tax levy which cannot be embraced within its charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Demurrer must be overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
