Brouillard, appeal a ruling of the Superior Court <em>{Morrill, </em>J.) denying a petition for declaratory judgment. The Brouillards sought to establish their right to underinsured motorist benefits from the defendant, Prudential Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company (Prudential). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">The trial court found the following facts. On March 1, 1989, Robert Brouillard was injured while riding as a passenger in an automobile operated by Philip Bourgoine. Mr. Brouillard collected $100,000 from Bourgoine\u2019s insurance carrier for his injuries. The Brouillards then sought underinsured motorist benefits from their own insurance carrier, Prudential. After Prudential denied any obligation to provide underinsured motorist coverage to the Brouillards, they filed the instant petition for declaratory judgment. The superior court denied the petition and the Brouillards appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">On appeal, the Brouillards argue: (1) that their policy permits \u201cstacking\u201d the insurance coverage on all four of their automobiles to determine the total limits of underinsured motorist benefits; (2) that even if the provisions of the policy prohibit \u201cstacking,\u201d they were not properly notified of the anti-stacking provisions as required by RSA 412:2-c (1991); (3) that the limits of coverage, if any, should be based on the \u201cper accident\u201d provision of the policy, rather than the \u201cper person\u201d provision; and (4) that Mrs. Brouillard has a separate claim for loss of spousal consortium with a separate $100,000 limit of underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>In the fall of 1982, when Prudential issued its policy to the Brouillards, a Prudential agent personally delivered a package of materials to their home, including an \u201cEasy Reading Family Auto Policy\u201d (Easy Reading Policy) and a 1980 New Hampshire Automobile Endorsement Booklet (Endorsement Booklet). It was Prudential\u2019s routine practice to place the materials in a clear plastic sleeve and fold them together. The Easy Reading Policy contained the primary insurance provisions. The 1980 Endorsement Booklet contained additions, revisions, and clarifications to the Easy Reading Policy, including an anti-stacking provision. The 1980 Endorsement Booklet, however, was not physically affixed to the Easy Reading Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\">\n<em>I. Intra-Policy Stacking</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The plaintiffs first argue that their policy should be interpreted to allow \u201cstacking\u201d of underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">Intra-policy stacking allows the insured to aggregate the limits of underinsured motorist coverage by multiplying the stated limit of liability by the number of vehicles covered under a policy. Although stacking of underinsured motorist coverage is generally allowed, insurance companies are free to limit their liability and prevent stacking through the use of clear and unambiguous policy language.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-6\"><em>U.S. Automobile Assoc. v. Wilkinson, </em>132 N.H. 439, 443, 569 A.2d 749, 751 (1989) (quotations, citations, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Like all contracts, \u201c[t]he interpretation of insurance policy language is ultimately an issue of law for this court to decide.\u201d <em>Whitcomb v. Peerless Ins. Co., </em>141 N.H. 149, 150, 679 A.2d 575, 576 (1996). \u201cIn construing insurance policy language which purports to limit liability or prevent stacking, we employ a strict construction standard which requires that ambiguities in insurance policies be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer.\u201d <em>Wilkinson, </em>132 N.H. at 443, 569 A.2d at 751; <em>see Trombly v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, </em>120 N.H. 764, 770-72, 423 A.2d 980, 984-85 (1980). \u201cWe will not, however, force an ambiguity simply to resolve it against an insurer.\u201d <em>Whitcomb, </em>141 N.H. at 151, 679 A.2d at 577. In determining whether an ambiguity exists, \u201cwe take the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy\u2019s words in context, and we construe the terms of the policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based on more than a casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150, 679 A.2d at 576-77 (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>The anti-stacking provision contained in Prudential\u2019s 1980 Endorsement Booklet is PAC 2219A which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-3\">STACKING OF UNINSURED MOTORISTS COVERAGE PROHIBITED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-4\">It is agreed that with respect to the Uninsured Motorists Coverage under <em>How We\u2019ll Settle A Claim (Part k), </em>the following is added:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">If you or any other person insured under this policy are in an accident while in a car covered by this policy, we won\u2019t pay more than the limit of the applicable coverages for that particular car (as shown on the Declarations Page). If you or other insured persons are in an accident while in a car that is not covered under this policy or while a pedestrian, we won\u2019t pay more than the limits of applicable coverages which you have on any one of your cars (as shown on the Declarations Page). In neither case can coverages on other cars be added to or stacked upon the coverage on the particular car involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The Brouillards argue that PAC 2219A is ambiguous, and therefore we should construe the provision in their favor and permit stacking. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The first and most obvious indication that the policy prohibits stacking is the title of the provision: \u201cSTACKING OF UNINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE PROHIBITED.\u201d The plain and ordinary meaning of these words prohibits stacking. <em>See Whitcomb, </em>141 N.H. at 150, 679 A.2d at 576. The Brouillards argue, however, that Bourgoine was an <em>underinsured </em>motorist, not an <em>uninsured </em>motorist. This interpretation of the provision overlooks its context within the rest of the policy. <em>See id. </em>at 150, 679 A.2d at 576-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">The 1980 Endorsement Booklet explicitly incorporates PAC 2219A into \u201cPart 4\u201d of the policy. Nowhere does Part 4 distinguish between uninsured and underinsured motorist benefits. Part 4 generally describes the rights of an insured who is injured by a driver who \u201cdoesn\u2019t have proper insurance.\u201d A driver who \u201cdoesn\u2019t have proper insurance\u201d is defined in the section as a driver with \u201cno liability insurance or . . . inadequate . . . liability insurance coverage.\u201d None of the thirty-five provisions of Part 4 make any distinction between uninsured motorist coverage and underinsured motorist coverage. Additionally, PAC 240 in the 1980 Endorsement Booklet, the provision which determines when Prudential provides <em>underinsured </em>motorist coverage, is titled \u201cSUPPLEMENTARY <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number><em>UNINSURED </em>MOTORIST INSURANCE.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The fact that underinsured motorist coverage is provided in a section titled uninsured motorist insurance further indicates that uninsured motorist benefits and underinsured motorist benefits are subject to the same limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\">There are additional reasons why PAC 2219A prohibits stacking of underinsured motorist coverage. PAC 2219A expressly states,'\u201c[i]f you or other insured persons are in an accident while in a car that is not covered under this policy ... we won\u2019t pay more than the limits of applicable coverages which you have on any one of your cars.\u201d Once again, the plain and ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201con any one of your cars\u201d demonstrates that an insured may not aggregate the coverages on all of the insured\u2019s cars under the policy. <em>See id. </em>at 150, 679 A.2d at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The Brouillards finally argue that PAC 2219A is void because it was not included on a Change Endorsement page provided to the Brouillards when they renewed their policy with Prudential. The Brouillards erroneously conclude that Prudential\u2019s failure to list PAC 2219A on the Change Endorsement page signifies that Prudential eliminated the provision from the policy. <em>See Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Raymond, </em>138 N.H. 17, 18-19, 634 A.2d 1015, 1016-17 (1993). The Change Endorsement page was issued to the Brouillards to document the new automobile that they added to the policy, not to change the provisions in the Endorsement Booklet. In fact, no endorsements were listed on the \u201cendorsements\u201d line of the change endorsement page. The Change Endorsement page unequivocally states that there were \u201cNO OTHER CHANGES TO POLICY PROVISIONS OR COVERAGES,\u201d and therefore, PAC 2219A, along with other basic coverages included in the endorsement booklet, remained in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">\n<em>II. RSA J/.12:2-c Notice Requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The Brouillards next argue that Prudential did not physically affix the 1980 Endorsement Booklet to the Easy Reading Policy as required by RSA 412:2-c, and therefore Prudential did not properly notify the Brouillards of the anti-stacking provision contained in the endorsement booklet. The trial court ruled, howevex\u2019, that RSA 412:2-c only applies to subsequent revisions to the original policy. We affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling on alternative grounds. <em>See In re Trailer and Plumbing Supplies, </em>133 N.H. 432, 438, 578 A.2d 343, 346 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">\u201cThis court ... is the final arbiter of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Pope v. Town of Hinsdale, </em>137 N.H. 233, 237, 624 A.2d 1360, 1362 (1993). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>\u201cIn determining intent, we draw inferences concerning a statute\u2019s meaning from its composition and structure. This court ascribes to statutory words and phrases their usual and common meaning, unless the statute itself suggests otherwise.\u201d <em>Stevens v. Town of Goshen, </em>141 N.H. 219, 221, 683 A.2d 814, 815 (1996) (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\">RSA 412:2-c states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-4\">In the event that a company or filing or rating organization eliminates or reduces coverages, conditions or definitions in its policies issued under this section other than at the request of a policyholder, the company must attach to the policy a printed notice in each such policy explaining clearly what coverages, conditions or definitions have been eliminated or reduced. If explanations of such reduced and eliminated coverages are not contained in the printed notice attached to its policies, then such coverages, conditions or definitions shall remain in full force and effect without such reductions or eliminations. The requirements of this section shall apply only to such policies renewed or endorsed with the same company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The Brouillards argue that the word \u201cattach\u201d should be construed to mean \u201cphysically affix.\u201d As the Endorsement Booklet containing the anti-stacking provision was not physically affixed to the Easy Reading Policy, they argue that the policy is \u201cin full force and effect without such reduction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The definition of \u201cattach\u201d is to \u201cmake fast or join (as by string or glue).\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 140 (unabridged ed. 1961). In this case, the superior court found that a Prudential agent delivered the Easy Reading Policy and the 1980 Endorsement Booklet to the Brouillards, folded together, in a clear plastic sleeve. While the definition of \u201cattach\u201d states, as an example, \u201cby string or glue,\u201d <em>id., </em>we do not believe that staples or glue are the only methods of joining or attaching documents. Consequently, we hold that folding documents together in a clear plastic sleeve properly joins them within the meaning of \u201cattach.\u201d RSA 412:2-c; <em>see Rozas v. La. Hospital Service, Inc., </em>413 So. 2d 364, 366 (La. Ct. App. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The Brouillards argue that there was insufficient evidence to prove that they received the 1980 Endorsement Booklet before Mr. Brouillard\u2019s accident. \u201cOur function in reviewing the trial court\u2019s findings is not to decide whether we would have found differently but to determine whether a reasonable person could find as did the trial judge.\u201d <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Custombilt, Inc., </em>128 N.H. 167, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>170, 512 A.2d 1098, 1100 (1986) (quotation omitted). After review of the record, we hold that sufficient evidence existed for a reasonable person to find that the Brouillards received the 1980 Endorsement Booklet in 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\">George Lavigne, a Senior Consultant in the Customer Service area for Prudential, testified that it was Prudential\u2019s' routine practice to assemble, fold, and deliver a three-item packet of materials to new insureds, including an Easy Reading Policy, a 1980 Endorsement Booklet, and a document entitled \u201cA Revision to your Automobile Endorsement Booklet.\u201d He testified that the documents typically were placed in a plastic sleeve envelope of approximately 4\" X 9\" dimensions. Mrs. Brouillard, on the other hand, testified that Prudential did not deliver a 1980 Endorsement Booklet when Prudential first issued the policy to the Brouillards in 1982.. She testified that a Prudential agent personally delivered a packet of materials to the Brouillards, but the 1980 Endorsement Booklet was not included. Mrs. Brouillard asserts that she obtained a copy of the 1980 Endorsement Booklet by calling a Prudential customer service number in 1989, after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">\u201cWhen there is conflicting testimony, we defer to the findings of the trier of fact unless no reasonable person could have come to the same conclusion.\u201d <em>Maville v. Peerless Ins. Co., </em>141 N.H. 317, 320, 686 A.2d 1165, 1167 (1996) (quotation omitted). A reasonable person could have concluded, as the trial court did, that the Brouillards received the 1980 Endorsement Booklet with the original policy package, based on Mr. Lavigne\u2019s. testimony. <em>See U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., Inc. v. Johnson Shoes, Inc., </em>123 N.H. 148, 153, 461 A.2d 85, 88 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The Brouillards also contend that they were not properly notified of a revised anti-stacking provision published in a 1982 edition of the New Hampshire Automobile Endorsement Booklet. We need not address the 1982 anti-stacking provision because the 1980 provision was sufficient to prohibit stacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">\n<em>III. \u201cPer Person\u201d/\u201cPer Accident\u201d Limits of Coverage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The Brouillards assert that the limits of coverage, if any, should be based on the $300,000 \u201cper accident\u201d provision, rather than the $100,000 \u201cper person\u201d provision. The provisions are defined thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">amount-per person</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-9\">The maximum amount we\u2019ll pay to an insured person under this part can be found on the Declarations Page under \u201cPROTECTION AGAINST UNINSURED MOTORISTS-EACH PERSON.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>-per accident</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">The maximum total amount we\u2019ll pay under this part for injuries in any one accident, regardless of how many people are involved, may be found on the Declarations Page under \u201cPROTECTION AGAINST UNINSURED MOTORISTS-EACH ACCIDENT.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The Declarations Page provides \u201cPROTECTION AGAINST UNINSURED MOTORISTS-EACH PERSON-$100,000 /EACH ACCIDENT-$300,000.\u201d Mr. Brouillard contends that the \u201cper person\u201d limit contradicts the \u201cper accident\u201d limit, and therefore, he should be entitled to the greater limit of $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Although Prudential may \u201climit its liability through clear and unambiguous policy language . . . , the policy language must be so clear as to create no ambiguity which might affect the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations.\u201d <em>A.B.C. Builders v. American Mut. Ins. Co., </em>139 N.H. 745, 748, 661 A.2d 1187, 1190 (1995) (quotations and citation omitted); <em>see Trombley, </em>120 N.H. at 770-72, 423 A.2d at 984-85. \u201cPer person\u201d/\u201cper accident\u201d provisions, or, double limit coverage provisions, are standard for the insurance industry. <em>See Andrews v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>124 N.H. 148, 152, 467 A.2d 254, 257 (1983). Generally, the lower \u201cper person\u201d limit is intended to modify the higher \u201cper accident\u201d limit. <em>See id. </em>The fact that an insurance policy contains both a \u201cper person\u201d and \u201cper accident\u201d provision is not, by itself, sufficient to interpret the \u201cper person\u201d provision as limiting the \u201cper accident\u201d provision, however. <em>Id. </em>at 153, 467 A.2d at 257. In <em>Andrews, </em>we held that, among other factors, the absence of \u201cany language which makes the \u2018per occurrence\u2019 limit subject to the \u2018per person\u2019 limit\u201d rendered the uninsured motorist provisions in that case ambiguous, demanding an interpretation to the benefit of the insured. <em>Id.; see Gelinas v. Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Liability Ins. Co., </em>131 N.H. 154, 170, 551 A.2d 962, 972 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">In this case, unlike <em>Andrews, </em>the provisions are not without language making the \u201cper accident\u201d limit subject to the \u201cper person\u201d limit. As the superior court noted, \u201cthe positioning of the two provisions, one following the other, under the single caption \u2018amounts\u2019 leads to the logical construction that the \u2018per person\u2019 limit modifies the \u2018per accident\u2019 limit.\u201d Furthermore, the \u201cper person\u201d provision provides that \u201c[t]he maximum amount we\u2019ll pay <em>to an insured person </em>under this part\u201d is $100,000. (Emphasis added.) The \u201cper accident\u201d provision provides that \u201c[t]he maximum <em>total </em>amount we\u2019ll pay under this part\u201d is $300,000. (Emphasis added.) The language \u201cto an insured person\u201d in the first provision and the word \u201ctotal\u201d in the second provision indicate coexistent limits that apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>depending on who is injured in an accident. The policy unambiguously provides that an insured individual is always limited to $100,000 regardless of how many individuals are injured in a single accident. <em>Andrews, </em>124 N.H. at 158, 467 A.2d at 257; <em>see A.B.C. Builders, </em>139 N.H. at 748, 661 A.2d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\">\n<em>IV. Loss of Consortium</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Mrs. Brouillard argues that her claim for loss of spousal consortium should be subject to a separate $100,000 limit of underinsured motorist coverage. The policy provides: \u201cWe\u2019ll pay persons insured under this part the amount they are legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury . . . .\u201d The Brouillards claim that Mrs. Brouillard is an \u201cinsured,\u201d and that loss of consortium is a \u201cdamage\u201d resulting from Mr. Brouillard\u2019s \u201cbodily injury.\u201d This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">In both <em>New Hampshire Insurance Co. v. Bisson, </em>122 N.H. 747, 748, 449 A.2d 1226, 1227 (1982), and <em>Bean v. Miller, </em>122 N.H. 681, 684, 448 A.2d 424, 426 (1982), we held that even though a spouse has a separate cause of action for loss of consortium under RSA 507:8-a (1983) (amended 1986), loss of consortium is not a separate \u201cbodily injury\u201d triggering an additional limit of insurance coverage. This court has never defined loss of consortium as \u201cbodily injury,\u201d <em>Bean, </em>122 N.H. at 684, 448 A.2d at 426 (1982); <em>Lumbermens\u2019 &amp;c. Co. v. Yeroyan, </em>90 N.H. 145, 146, 5 A.2d 726, 727 (1939), and we decline to do so now. Furthermore, loss of consortium is a consequential damage derivative of the original insured\u2019s injuries, <em>see N.H. Insurance Co., </em>122 N.H. at 748, 449 A.2d at 1227, and therefore it is limited by the original insured\u2019s coverage. Accordingly, we hold that Mrs. Brouillard is not entitled to a separate $100,000 limit for her loss of consortium action.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b752-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
