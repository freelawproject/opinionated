The jury acquitted the defendant of two charges and deadlocked on the remaining three. In this interlocutory appeal, the defendant challenges the Superior Court\u2019s <em>(Smith, </em>J.) denial of his motion to dismiss the remaining charges on double jeopardy and collateral estoppel grounds. We affirm and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">The victim alleged that the defendant in November 1993 assaulted her in a high school locker room by committing non-consensual digital penetration of her vagina and anus and by. oral penetration, all within minutes. The State indicted the defendant on five charges of aggravated felonious sexual assault: digital penetration of the victim\u2019s anus through physical force, <em>see </em>RSA 632-A:2, I(a) (1996); digital penetration of the victim\u2019s anus through surprise, <em>see </em>RSA 632-A:2, I(i) (1996); digital penetration of the victim\u2019s vagina <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>through physical force, <em>see </em>RSA 632-A:2, I(a); digital penetration of the victim\u2019s vagina through surprise, <em>see </em>RSA 632-A:2, I(i); and oral penetration through the application of physical force, <em>see </em>RSA 632-A:2, I(a). The jury acquitted the defendant on both of the indictments alleging penetration through surprise. The jury deadlocked on the three remaining indictments and the court declared a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The defendant now contends that prosecution of the three remaining indictments is barred under both the State and Federal Constitutions by principles of double jeopardy and collateral estoppel. We first address the defendant\u2019s State constitutional arguments, <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 232, 471 A.2d 347, 351 (1983), citing federal law only as an aid to our analysis, <em>State v. Lucius, </em>140 N.H. 60, 63, 663 A.2d 605, 609 (1995). Because under the Federal Constitution the \u201csame elements\u201d test for double jeopardy, <em>see Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932), and the standards for collateral estoppel, <em>see Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 443 (1970), provide the defendant no greater protections in this instance than the State Constitution, <em>see State v. Brooks, </em>137 N.H. 541, 543, 629 A.2d 1347, 1349 (1993) (double jeopardy); <em>State v. Cassady, </em>140 N.H. 46, 48, 662 A.2d 955, 957-58 (1995) (collateral estoppel), we need not undertake a separate analysis of the defendant\u2019s federal law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Part I, article 16 of the New Hampshire Constitution protects an accused against \u201cmultiple prosecutions and multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>State v. Fitzgerald, </em>137 N.H. 23, 25, 622 A.2d 1245, 1246 (1993). The defendant argues that notwithstanding the variants of aggravated felonious sexual assault listed under RSA 632-A:2, the statute actually sets forth only one offense and, this being so, the State can not retry him on the remaining indictments after a jury acquitted him on the charges alleging penetration through \u201csurprise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Under our constitution, \u201c[t]wo offenses will be considered the same unless each requires proof of an element that the other does not.\u201d <em>State v. Constant, </em>135 N.H. 254, 255, 605 A.2d 206, 207 (1992). By its plain language, each of the statutory variants of aggravated felonious sexual assault listed under RSA 632-A:2, I, requires proof of an element or elements the others do not. For example, the offenses of which the defendant was acquitted contain the element of surprise, an element not present in the indictments alleging the offense of penetration through the use of physical force. Each statutory variant accordingly represents a separate and distinct offense. <em>See State v. Fuentes, </em>888 P.2d 986, 989 (N.M. Ct. App. 1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>889 P.2d 203 (N.M. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>The defendant nonetheless argues that a second prosecution of the remaining indictments violates part I, article <em>16 </em>because \u201ca subsequent jury will hear-exactly the same evidence as the first jury.\u201d The essential inquiry on this point is \u201cwhether proof of the elements of the crimes <em>as charged </em>will in actuality require a difference in evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Bailey, </em>127 N.H. 811, 813, 508 A.2d 1066, 1068 (1986) (quotation omitted). \u201c[W]e review and compare the statutory elements of the charged offenses in light of the actual allegations contained in the indictments.\u201d <em>State v. MacLeod, </em>141 N.H. 427, 429, 685 A.2d 473, 476 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In this case, proof of the elements of the crimes as charged requires differing evidence. The \u201cforce\u201d indictments allege that the defendant committed the offenses of anal and vaginal penetration \u201cthrough the actual application of physical force, physical violence or superior physical strength\u201d when he \u201cwrap[ped] his arms around the victim and put his hand down the back of [her] pants,\u201d while the \u201csurprise\u201d indictments allege that he \u201cby the element of surprise . . . was able to cause sexual penetration with the victim before [she] had an adequate chance to flee or resist\u201d when he \u201cwrap[ped] his arms around the victim and put his hand down the back of [her] pants.\u201d As charged, each set of indictments obliges the State to prove a particular fact not necessary to the other \u2014 physical force in the former, surprise in the latter. The elemental evidence required to prove each of the \u201csurprise\u201d indictments, on which the jury acquitted the defendant, is thus different than that required to prove the \u201cforce\u201d and the oral penetration indictments, regardless of the evidence the State elected to produce in support of each charge. <em>See State v. Stratton, </em>132 N.H. 451, 454, 567 A.2d 986, 988 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">That a mistrial resulted from the jury\u2019s deadlock on the \u201cforce\u201d and oral penetration indictments does not alter our conclusion that the State may retry the defendant on those indictments. While an accused has the right to a trial completed by the jury first empaneled and sworn to hear his or her case, the trial court may declare a mistrial without imperiling retrial \u201cif there is a manifest necessity for the act.\u201d <em>State v. Paquin, </em>140 N.H. 525, 528, 668 A.2d 47, 49 (1995) (quotation omitted). It is well established that a genuinely deadlocked jury presents such a manifest necessity, <em>see Richardson v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 317, 324 (1984), and the defendant in this case does not offer persuasive arguments to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">We turn next to the defendant\u2019s collateral estoppel argument. The defendant contends that \u201call pleadings and the act\u00faa;! \u25a0 defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>presented to the jury consistently alleged fabrication on the part of the complainant,\u201d and this fact, taken together with the trial court\u2019s jury charge, estops the State from retrying the defendant \u201cfor acts alleged to have occurred in the locker room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\">Part I, article 16\u2019s protections against double jeopardy incorporate the doctrine of collateral estoppel. <em>See Cassady, </em>140 N.H. at 48, 662 A.2d at 958; <em>State v. Fielders, </em>124 N.H. 310, 312, 470 A.2d 897, 898 (1983). In the criminal context, collateral estoppel means that when an issue of ultimate fact has been determined by a valid and final judgment, such as an acquittal, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future prosecution. <em>See Cassady, </em>140 N.H. at 48, 662 A.2d at 958. The defendant has the burden of demonstrating that an acquittal necessarily resolved issues which the State, on retrial, would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Bailin, </em>977 F.2d 270, 280-81 (7th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The defendant has not carried his burden in this case. To be sure, the acquittals on the \u201csurprise\u201d indictments represent a final judgment with respect to the issue whether the defendant committed aggravated felonious sexual assault by the element of surprise. The acquittals reflect the jury\u2019s finding that the State failed to prove \u201csurprise\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt. They reveal nothing, however, about the disposition of an ultimate fact common to the remaining indictments: whether the defendant committed the charged acts by physical force. Consequently, principles of estoppel do not preclude the State from retrying the defendant on the remaining indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b527-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
