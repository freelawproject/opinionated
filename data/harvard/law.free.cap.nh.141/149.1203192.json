We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-18\">The plaintiff was injured when an automobile in which he was a passenger left the road and struck a tree. The car was owned by the Cheshire Financial Corporation (bank) and driven by Bud Spaulding, an off-duty bank employee. All parties agree that Spaulding was operating the motor vehicle without the bank\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-19\">Following the accident, the plaintiff sought uninsured motorist benefits under two automobile insurance policies \u2014 a family policy issued by Peerless to the plaintiff\u2019s parents, and a business policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>issued by defendant Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna) to the bank as the owner of the vehicle. Peerless concedes that the plaintiff \u201cmay qualify for coverage under its uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d Peerless contends, however, that Aetna is primarily liable for uninsured motorist benefits and that any recovery of such benefits must come first from Aetna\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Aetna disputes liability for uninsured motorist benefits on the ground that an exclusion in its uninsured motorist provisions applying to \u201c[a]nyone using a vehicle without a reasonable belief that the person is entitled to do so\u201d operates to exclude the plaintiff from coverage. Peerless argues that the exclusion does not apply to the plaintiff because he was merely \u201coccupying\u201d the vehicle as a passenger and not \u201cusing\u201d it.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Peerless observes that the uninsured motorist section of Aetna\u2019s policy contains both the word \u201coccupying\u201d and the word \u201cusing.\u201d From this Peerless infers that Aetna\u2019s policy draws a distinction between a broad class of \u201coccupiers\u201d and a narrower subclass of \u201cusers,\u201d which is the equivalent of \u201coperators.\u201d Because the plaintiff was merely occupying the vehicle at the time of the crash and not operating it, Peerless concludes that he was not \u201cusing\u201d it for purposes of the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">We cannot read Aetna\u2019s use of the word \u201cusing\u201d in its exclusion for non-permissive use so narrowly. The interpretation of insurance policy language is ultimately an issue of law for this court to decide. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v Cookinham, </em>135 N.H. 247, 249, 604 A.2d 563, 564 (1992). The uninsured motorist section of Aetna\u2019s policy does not define the term \u201cusing.\u201d In determining this word\u2019s meaning, \u201c[w]e take the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy\u2019s words in context, and we construe the terms of the policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based on more than a casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>High Country Assocs. v. N.H. Ins. Co., </em>139 N.H. 39, 41, 648 A.2d 474, 476 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\u201cOne may \u2018use\u2019 an automobile without personally operating it, as the term use is broader than operation.\u201d 6C J. &amp; J. appleman, Insurance Law and practice \u00a7 4354, at 63 (Buckley ed. 1979) (footnotes omitted). \u201c\u2018Use\u2019 is to be given its ordinary meaning. It denotes the employment of the automobile for some purpose of the user.\u201d 12 M. Rhodes, Couch on Insurance 2d \u00a7 45:321, at 661 (rev. ed. 1981) (footnotes omitted); <em>see also </em>Webster\u2019s Third new International dictionary 2523 (unabridged ed. 1961) (defining \u201cuse\u201d as \u201cto put into action or service,\u201d \u201cto carry out a purpose or action by means of,\u201d \u201cEMPLOY\u201d). By riding as a passenger in the vehicle, the plaintiff was employing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>car for the purpose of transportation. Accordingly, we hold that the plaintiff was \u201cusing\u201d the vehicle for purposes of the exclusion in the uninsured motorist provisions. <em>See Aetna Life and Cas. Co. v. Bulaong, </em>588 A.2d 138, 144-45 (Conn. 1991) (citing cases supporting \u201cthe proposition that passengers are users of a motor vehicle\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Peerless also argues that the word \u201cusing\u201d is ambiguous and invokes the rule that ambiguous provisions are construed against an insurer. <em>See Trombly v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, </em>120 N.H. 764, 771, 423 A.2d 980, 985 (1980). A term is ambiguous if the contracting parties could reasonably disagree about its meaning or application. <em>Smith v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>130 N.H. 117, 122, 536 A.2d 164, 166 (1987). We will not, however, force an ambiguity simply to resolve it against an insurer. <em>Akerley v. Hartford Ins. Group, </em>136 N.H. 433, 439, 616 A.2d 511, 514 (1992). Having already concluded that the word \u201cusing\u201d as employed in the exclusion in Aetna\u2019s uninsured motorist provisions plainly encompasses a passenger such as Mr. Whitcomb, we have no difficulty concluding that this word is not ambiguous. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 439, 616 A.2d at 515 (finding no ambiguity in word \u201cuse\u201d in uninsured motorist provision providing coverage for accidents arising out of use of uninsured vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Finally, Peerless argues that the exclusion does not apply because \u201c[n]o evidence was presented ... as to whether or not Edward Whitcomb knew that Mr. Spaulding was operating the vehicle without permission.\u201d The exclusion applies to any person \u201cusing a vehicle without a reasonable belief that the person is entitled to do so.\u201d The trial court found that Mr. Whitcomb lacked such a reasonable belief. We must uphold this finding of fact unless it is clearly erroneous or unsupported by the evidence. <em>See Society Hill at Merrimack Condo. Assoc. v. Town of Merrimack, </em>139 N.H. 253, 255, 651 A.2d 928, 930 (1994). The trial court found, and Peerless does not dispute, that the plaintiff and his friend Bud Spaulding went to the bank shortly after midnight on December 9, 1990, and that Spaulding, an employee of the bank, took the keys to the bank car from a drawer in his supervisor\u2019s desk, so that they could take the bank car to meet some friends in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. Given these facts, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff lacked a reasonable belief that he was entitled to use the car was clearly erroneous or unsupported by the evidence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-8\">BRODERICK, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
