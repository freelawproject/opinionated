She sought uninsured motorist coverage from the defendant, Nationwide Mutual Insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>anee Company, in a declaratory judgment action. The Superior Court <em>(Goode, </em>J.) dismissed her petition, ruling that the so-called \u201cfireman\u2019s rule\u201d barred her right of recovery against Lajoie. <em>See England v. Tasker, </em>129 N.H. 467, 471-72, 529 A.2d 938, 941 (1987). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">On March 20, 1991, at approximately 9:00 a.m., the plaintiff was patrolling a sector of Londonderry in her police cruiser. While waiting at a traffic light, she saw a car approach the intersection from another direction \u201cat a high rate of speed.\u201d The car, driven by Lajoie, \u201ccame to a screeching stop[,] . . . jumped forward again,\u201d and came to another stop. The plaintiff noticed a man in the front passenger seat leaning over Lajoie \u201cin a controlling manner\u201d; another man sat in the back. Lajoie made a right-hand turn, again \u201cat a high rate of speed,\u201d and pulled into a convenience store parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The plaintiff noted the car\u2019s license plate number as it drove by her. She proceeded to her original destination, a nearby bank, but radioed the police dispatcher for a registration check. She received a response soon after entering the bank parking lot: the license plate number did not match the car. Within moments, the plaintiff drove back to the convenience store \u201cto check out the car.\u201d She was concerned, she later testified, about \u201cthe safety of the female operator,\u201d as well as the erratic operation of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">When she arrived at the convenience store, a fuel tanker blocked her path through the parking lot. As she began to drive around it, she saw Lajoie\u2019s car coming toward her \u201cat a high rate of speed.\u201d Lajoie was sitting behind the wheel, but her head was turned toward the back of the car. The two cars collided before the plaintiff had time to react.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">A police accident investigator testified that the collision was caused by Lajoie\u2019s inattention, as well as her car\u2019s faulty brakes. Lajoie agreed and testified that the man in the back seat threw something at her and asked her a question just before the accident. Similarly, when asked why she stopped so quickly at the intersection where the plaintiff first saw her, she stated: \u201cWell, one thing, the brake didn\u2019t work right. But the main reason was the guy next to me was bugging the hell out of me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">After the accident, the plaintiff sought uninsured motorist coverage from the defendant. When the defendant denied her claim, the plaintiff filed this petition for declaratory judgment. The superior court found \u201cthat it was Ms. Lajoie\u2019s conduct in the first instance that created the circumstance and resultant hazard that required the officer\u2019s presence at the scene where the accident occurred.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Consequently, the court ruled, the fireman\u2019s rule barred the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover against Lajoie and, therefore, her claim for uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The plaintiff argues that the superior court erred in ruling her right of recovery barred by the fireman\u2019s rule. She also contends, however, that the relevant language in her insurance policy is ambiguous and that this ambiguity entitles her to uninsured motorist coverage regardless of the applicability of the fireman\u2019s rule. This latter argument, based on her reading of <em>Green Mountain Insurance Co. v. George, </em>138 N.H. 10, 634 A.2d 1011 (1993), does not appear in her notice of appeal, and she has not forwarded to this court any exhibits relating to this issue, such as the insurance contract. Moreover, the plaintiff has not moved to add this question to her notice of appeal. We therefore do not address it. Sup. Ct. R. 16(3)(b); <em>State v. Peterson, </em>135 N.H. 713, 714-15, 609 A.2d 749, 750-51 (1992). We focus instead solely on the applicability of the fireman\u2019s rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Both parties assert that the issue before us is a mixed question of law and fact. We concur and therefore review the superior court\u2019s ruling according to the standard set forth in <em>Great Lakes Aircraft Co. v. City of Claremont, </em>135 N.H. 270, 608 A.2d 840 (1992). We uphold the court\u2019s ruling unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 282, 608 A.2d at 848. \u201cIf, however, the court misapplies the law to its factual findings, we review the result on appeal independently under a plain error standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">In <em>England v. Tasker, </em>129 N.H. at 472, 529 A.2d at 941, we held that police officers and firefighters may not \u201ccomplain[] of negligence in the creation of the very occasion for their engagement.\u201d <em>See also Migdal v. Stamp, </em>132 N.H. 171, 175, 564 A.2d 826, 828 (1989); <em>cf. </em>RSA 507:8-h (Supp. 1995) (effective Jan. 1, 1994). We cited two public policy considerations in support of this holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">First, we agree that it is fundamentally unfair to ask the citizen to compensate a public safety officer, already engaged at taxpayer expense, a second time for injuries sustained while performing the very service which he is paid to undertake for the citizen\u2019s benefit. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">Further, fire[fighters] and police [officers] are likely to enter at unforeseeable times, upon unusual parts of the premises, and under circumstances of emergency, where care in preparation for their visit cannot reasonably be expected ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>England, </em>129 N.H. at 471, 529 A.2d at 940-41 (quotation omitted). We left unanswered whether a public safety officer could recover for \u201ca subsequent independent act of negligence directed toward the . . . officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472, 529 A.2d at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In <em>Gould v. George Brox, Inc., </em>137 N.H. 85, 89-91, 623 A.2d 1325, 1328-29 (1993), we explicitly answered this question in the affirmative, holding that a public safety officer may recover for such independent acts of negligence. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">Society expects its police, firefighters and related employees to respond to those situations which threaten life, safety, and property. In the ordinary course, such instances involve accidents, not the least of which involve automobiles. Many of these can be traced to either a lack of due care on someone\u2019s part or conduct by the segment of the citizenry who violate the provisions of the criminal law or other of society\u2019s rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">Common sense tells us that <em>it is the person whose conduct triggers the response who is immune from liability </em>under a narrow but enlightened application of the fireman\u2019s rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 89, 623 A.2d at 1328 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">The plaintiff argues that the superior court\u2019s decision must be reversed because it conflicts with our holding in <em>Gould. </em>In <em>Gould, </em>the plaintiff police officer was directing traffic at a highway construction site when a dump truck operator caused a telephone wire to fall to the ground. <em>Id. </em>at 87, 623 A.2d at 1326. The plaintiff then attempted to direct automobiles over the wire. <em>Id. </em>at 87, 623 A.2d at 1326-27. Some of the construction company\u2019s workers temporarily raised the wire, however, and a motorist ignored the plaintiff\u2019s signal to stop. <em>Id. </em>at 87, 623 A.2d at 1327. The motorist hit the wire, which hit the plaintiff, knocking him to the ground. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff sued the dump truck operator, the construction company, and the motorist. We concluded that the fireman\u2019s rule barred recovery against the dump truck operator, but not against the motorist and the construction company, who committed \u201csubsequent and independent acts\u201d of negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 90-91, 623 A.2d at 1328-29. The plaintiff here argues that Lajoie\u2019s negligence in colliding with her should also be characterized as a subsequent and independent act.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">The defendant, on the other hand, contends that the facts of this case more closely resemble those of <em>Akerley v. Hartford Insurance Group, </em>136 N.H. 433, 616 A.2d 511 (1992). In <em>Akerley, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>plaintiff deputy sheriff responded to a report that a suspect was firing a gun at people. <em>Id. </em>at 435, 616 A.2d at 512. The plaintiff cornered the suspect in his car and suffered injuries while struggling to remove and subdue him. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff sought uninsured motorist coverage from the defendant insurance companies, alleging that his injuries were caused by the suspect\u2019s negligence, recklessness, and intentional misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 435, 437, 616 A.2d at 512, 514. We held that the fireman\u2019s rule barred the plaintiff\u2019s recovery to the extent that his suit was based on a claim of negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 437, 616 A.2d at 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">A review of the record in this case supports the superior court\u2019s ruling. Just as the struggle between Officer Akerley and the shooting suspect was directly related to the suspect\u2019s initial act of firing his weapon, the collision between the plaintiff and Lajoie was directly related to the conduct the plaintiff first observed at the intersection. As we held in <em>England v. Tasker, </em>\u201cthe plaintiff was injured while responding in [her] professional capacity to the very type of situation for which [she] was paid and trained to cope.\u201d <em>England, </em>129 N.H. at 472, 529 A.2d at 941. Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s assertions in her brief, the collision in the convenience store parking lot was not a result of \u201chappenstance,\u201d \u201cfortuity,\u201d or \u201cchance,\u201d nor were Lajoie\u2019s actions in precipitating the crash \u201cseparate and distinct from the circumstances and facts that had earlier caught the Plaintiff\u2019s attention.\u201d Rather, this conduct was an inextricable part of the \u201cnegligence which create[d] the occasion for [her] employment.\u201d <em>Migdal, </em>132 N.H. at 175, 564 A.2d at 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">As the record makes clear, the meeting between Lajoie and the plaintiff was no mere coincidence. The reason the plaintiff was at the convenience store was \u201cto check out the car\u201d she had seen earlier, for it was Lajoie\u2019s behavior at the intersection which prompted the plaintiff to pursue further investigation. Accordingly, the plaintiff\u2019s presence at the convenience store was causally linked to Lajoie\u2019s conduct, and the negligent act was a part of the occasion which triggered the plaintiff\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The plaintiff was injured while responding to Lajoie\u2019s negligent behavior. Public safety officers may not \u201ccomplaint] of negligence in the creation of the very occasion for their engagement.\u201d <em>England, </em>129 N.H. at 472, 529 A.2d at 941. Because the plaintiff suffered her injuries \u201cwhile performing the very service which [she] is paid to undertake for the citizen\u2019s benefit,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 471, 529 A.2d at 940, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>hold that the superior court properly ruled her right of recovery against Lajoie barred by the fireman\u2019s rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b350-4\">HORTON, J., with whom BROCK, C.J., joined, dissented; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b350-5\">Horton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AErv\">dissenting: We confirmed the viability of the fireman\u2019s rule in this jurisdiction based on public policy considerations. <em>England v. Tasker, </em>129 N.H. 467, 529 A.2d 938 (1987); <em>see Akerley v. Hartford Ins. Group, </em>136 N.H. 433, 437, 616 A.2d 511, 513 (1992). As stated by the majority, the rule provides that public safety officers may not \u201ccomplain[] of negligence in the creation of the very occasion for their engagement.\u201d <em>England, </em>129 N.H. at 472, 529 A.2d at 941. In <em>Gould v. George Brox, Inc., </em>137 N.H. 85, 623 A.2d 1325 (1993), we called\u2019 for a \u201cnarrow but enlightened application of the fireman\u2019s rule,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 89, 623 A.2d at 1328, and recognized that every act of negligence damaging a public safety officer, while the officer wears his badge, is not covered by the fireman\u2019s rule, <em>id. </em>at 89-90, 623 A.2d at 1328. This requires us to determine whether the \u201cvery occasion\u201d for the engagement is involved in the negligent act. We recognized in <em>Gould </em>that there can be damaging acts of negligence in an \u201con duty\u201d situation that lack the required nexus to the call to duty, and thus are not subject to the fireman\u2019s rule. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The majority finds that nexus and holds that the convenience store accident arose from the very occasion that gave rise to the call. Two bases for this finding are evident in the majority opinion: the fact that the negligent actor and the perpetrator triggering the response are one and the same, and the conclusion that the negligent actor\u2019s actions-in the convenience store parking lot were an inextricable part of the \u201cnegligence\u201d which created the occasion for the officer\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">As to the former reason we did say in <em>Gould </em>that \u201c[c]ommon sense tells us that it is the person whose conduct triggers the response who is immune from liability under a narrow but enlightened application of the fireman\u2019s rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89, 623 A.2d at 1328. Although this would seem to eliminate from application of the rule those negligent actors at the duty scene who did not trigger the response, it does not mean that all negligent acts of the triggering party are necessarily the very occasion for the response. <em>Gould, </em>itself, points out that acts of a non-triggering party would not be covered by the rule and states, \u201cNor would [policemen] be barred from recovery if the individual responsible for their presence engaged in subsequent acts of negligence or misconduct once the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>officer was on the scene.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 623 A.2d at 1328 (quotation omitted). Thus, if the negligent act is the deed of the triggering party, but the negligent act is neither the very occasion for the response, nor directly connected thereto, then the rule does not come into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">As to the latter justification upon which the majority relies for application of the rule, the inextricable linking of the negligent act with the \u201cnegligence\u201d which created the occasion for employment, I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The proper analysis for determination of the rule\u2019s applicability, in this case, is to measure whether the negligent act is a true part of the very occasion triggering the response. Where the conduct at the intersection triggered the response, injury during immediate pursuit or contemporary arrest would be within the rule. When the police officer leaves the scene, conducts another errand at the bank, engages in off-site investigation, and returns, there must be some causal link between the accident and the response. I perceive no real difference between this accident and one with a third party in the bank parking lot. There is no real nexus between the accident and the very occasion triggering the response.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Nor would this analysis violate public policy. The accident is hardly the crisis or danger the policeman is paid to confront. It would not be unfair to compensate the policeman for the injuries sustained. We would not expect the negligent actor to be put off from seeking police assistance because of a threat of motor vehicle negligence liability. <em>See Akerley, </em>136 N.H. at 437, 616 A.2d at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">I would reverse the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the declaratory judgment petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b351-8\">BROCK, C.J., joins in the dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
