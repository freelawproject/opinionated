On appeal, the city argues that the PELRB erred: (1) in finding that the city committed an unfair labor practice because the city\u2019s reorganization of its work force is a protected managerial right; (2) in failing to identify a specific statutory unfair labor practice in its ruling; and (3) in ordering a remedy that exceeds the PELRB\u2019s authority and that \u201cis insufficiently clear to be implemented.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">The city and the union, the certified bargaining agent for all full-time custodians and janitors employed in the city\u2019s schools, <em>see </em>RSA 273-A:8 (1987), were parties to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) for the period July 1, 1991, to June 30, 1992. The expired CBA did not contain an enforceable \u201cevergreen clause,\u201d which would have provided for the automatic renewal or continuance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>of the CBA following its expiration and during negotiations for a new CBA. <em>See Appeal of Town of Rye, </em>140 N.H. 323, 324, 666 A.2d 948, 950 (1995). The parties\u2019 CBA generally provided for a five-day, eight-hour per day, workweek at wages exceeding nine dollars per hour. Further, the CBA contained a \u201cmanagement rights\u201d article that essentially reserved to the city all major decisions about staffing, direction, and control of the work force, \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise expressly and specifically provided\u201d in the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Following the expiration of the CBA, the city and the union began negotiations for a new agreement. While negotiations were in progress, the city informed the union that it planned a reorganization in which twenty-eight full-time custodians would be laid off and replaced with over thirty part-time custodians. The part-time custodians would work twenty hours per week for seven dollars per hour, receive no fringe benefits, and perform the same job duties as the laid-off custodians. The city\u2019s decision to reorganize was not the subject of negotiations with the union. The city, however, invited the laid-off custodians to apply for the new part-time positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">On March 24, 1995, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge against the city based on the city\u2019s reorganization plans. In its charge, the union stated that a pure lay-off would be neither a violation of the CBA nor an unfair labor practice. The union alleged, however, that the lay-off <em>in combination with </em>the hiring of part-time personnel constituted a violation of RSA 273-A:5, I(a), (b), (c), (f) and (g) (1987) and RSA 273-A:8, in that it amounted, <em>inter alia, </em>to a \u201cunilateral change in the conditions of employment\u201d and a violation of the CBA. The city responded to the charge with an answer and a motion to dismiss, both of which pointed to budgetary concerns and asserted that the reorganization fell within \u201cmanagerial policy within the exclusive prerogative of the public employer,\u201d RSA 273-A:1, XI (1987). The union\u2019s objection to the motion to dismiss disputed the city\u2019s \u201cmanagerial policy\u201d arguments and contended that the city violated the status quo under the expired CBA by unilaterally changing terms and conditions of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Following a hearing, the PELRB denied the city\u2019s motion to dismiss and determined that the city had committed an unfair labor practice. In denying the motion to dismiss, the PELRB reasoned: \u201cWhile it is true that management is free to reorganize, the methods used to implement the reorganization are of interest to this Board when they greatly change terms and conditions of employment and so give rise to charges of unfair labor practices as in the present case.\u201d In finding an unfair labor practice, the PELRB concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-8\">The [city] has informed the full-time custodians who are to be laid off that they may apply for one of the thirty-one new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>positions at lower wages and compensation. The offer is statutorily impermissible because it offers these new part-time employees unit work at a rate different from that which has been bargained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-3\">The PELRB ordered the city to compensate \u201c[t]he position of part-time custodian\u201d at the hourly wage rate for full-time custodians and to grant vacation, sick leave, and other benefits on a pro-rated basis. This appeal by the city followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">The city first argues that the PELRB\u2019s failure to identify a specific statutory unfair labor practice demonstrates the propriety of the city\u2019s actions and reveals that the PELRB merely found \u201cunfairness.\u201d <em>See Bouchard v. City of Rochester, </em>119 N.H. 799, 802, 409 A.2d 772, 774 (1979) (PELRB exceeded its authority by treating general unfairness as a statutory unfair labor practice). Although the PELRB\u2019s decision neither cites a specific subsection of RSA 273-A:5 nor provides an explanation of its legal analysis, <em>cf </em>RSA 273-A:6, IX (Supp. 1996) (orders and decisions of PELRB shall contain findings of fact and conclusions of law), we interpret the decision as a conclusion that the city violated its duty to bargain in good faith when, during a status quo period, it unilaterally reorganized its custodial services and thereby unilaterally changed the terms and conditions of employment. <em>See Appeal of Alton School Dist., </em>140 N.H. 303, 307-08, 666 A.2d 937, 940 (1995). This interpretation of the PELRB\u2019s decision finds ample support in the theories advanced by the union to the PELRB. For example, the union alleged that the city\u2019s reorganization constituted a unilateral change in the conditions of employment, and the union\u2019s charge alleged a violation of RSA 273-A:5, I(g) \u2014 a general provision making it an unfair labor practice for a public employer to fail to comply with RSA chapter 273-A, including the obligation to bargain imposed by RSA 273-A:3, I (1987). Furthermore, we construe the PELRB\u2019s reference to the \u201cstatutorily impermissible\u201d offer of part-time employment to laid-off custodians as a concrete <em>example </em>of the unfair labor practice, and not as the unfair labor practice itself. Indeed, a contrary interpretation on this last point would suggest that the city could have avoided a statutory violation simply by refusing to consider any employment applications from laid-off custodians; such a hiring policy would itself raise serious issues of unfair labor practices. <em>See </em>RSA 273-A:5, I(c); <em>see also Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board, </em>313 U.S. 177, 186-87 (1941) (unfair labor practice under analogous provision of the National Labor Relations Act to discriminate in hiring based on union affiliation).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>The primary question for our review, therefore, is whether the PELRB correctly determined that the city\u2019s reorganization of its work force constituted a unilateral change in violation of the status quo, rather than a protected managerial right under RSA 273-A:l, XI. \u201cWe defer to the PELRB\u2019s findings of fact, and, absent an erroneous ruling of law, we will not set aside the PELRB\u2019s decision unless the [city] demonstrates by a clear preponderance of the evidence that the order is unjust or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Appeal of Sullivan County, </em>141 N.H. 82, 83-84, 677 A.2d 682, 683 (1996). Even if our interpretation of the PELRB\u2019s rationale is incorrect and the PELRB instead based its decision on other mistaken grounds, we \u201cwill sustain the decision if there are valid alternative grounds to support it.\u201d <em>Quinlan v. City of Dover, </em>136 N.H. 226, 230, 614 A.2d 1057, 1059 (1992) (quotation omitted); <em>cf. Appeal of Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co., </em>124 N.H. 506, 508-09, 474 A.2d 983, 984 (1984) (incorrect legal standard used in administrative determination is not ground for reversal if the same result would obtain under the correct standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">In the absence of an enforceable \u201cevergreen clause,\u201d a CBA expires on the termination date set forth in the agreement. <em>Appeal of Alton School Dist. </em>140 N.H. at 307, 666 A.2d at 940. After expiration of the CBA and during negotiations for a successor agreement, the parties\u2019 \u201cobligations to one another are governed by the doctrine of maintaining the status quo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Maintenance of the status quo \u201cdemands that all terms and conditions of employment remain the same during collective bargaining after a CBA has expired.\u201d <em>Appeal of Milton School Dist. </em>137 N.H. 240, 247, 625 A.2d 1056, 1061 (1993). We have explained that the status quo doctrine derives from RSA 273-A:3, I, which imposes the obligation to negotiate in good faith over the terms of employment, and from RSA 273-A:5, I(e) (1987), which makes it an unfair labor practice for a public employer to refuse to negotiate in good faith. <em>Appeal of Alton School Dist. </em>140 N.H. at 307-08, 666 A.2d at 940. A public employer\u2019s unilateral change in a term or condition of employment (whether during negotiations for an initial CBA or during a status quo period following expiration of a CBA) is tantamount to \u201ca refusal to negotiate that term and destroys the level playing field necessary for productive and fair labor negotiations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308, 666 A.2d at 940; <em>see also Litton Financial Printing Div. v. NLRB, </em>501 U.S. 190, 198 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">As both our cases and federal cases under the National Labor Relations Act indicate, however, the status quo doctrine is limited by its rationale. Thus, an employer is prohibited from making unilat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>eral changes on <em>mandatory </em>subjects of collective bargaining, but not on <em>permissive </em>topics of collective bargaining. <em>See Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Comm., </em>67 F.3d 1054, 1059 (2d Cir. 1995). By definition, an employer must bargain over mandatory topics and may \u2014 but need not \u2014 bargain over permissive or \u201cpermissible\u201d topics. <em>See Appeal of City of Concord, </em>139 N.H. 277, 282, 651 A.2d 944, 948 (1994); <em>Appeal of State of N.H., </em>138 N.H. 716, 723, 647 A.2d 1302, 1307 (1994). Accordingly, a unilateral change in the former is an unlawful refusal to engage in required negotiation, <em>see Labor Board v. Katz, </em>369 U.S. 736, 747 (1962), but a unilateral change in the latter is generally a legitimate exercise of discretion, <em>see Appeal of Internat'l Assoc. of Firefighters, </em>123 N.H. 404, 408, 462 A.2d 98, 101 (1983). <em>See generally </em>H. Edwards et al., Labor Relations in the Public Sector 303 n.5, 405 (2d ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-3\">In this case, the parties agree that the city\u2019s reorganization of its custodial staff was a unilateral change following expiration of the CBA. The parties disagree, however, on whether the city had a duty to negotiate with the union concerning the reorganization. Their dispute centers on the \u201cmanagerial policy exception,\u201d which is contained within the statutory definition of \u201cterms and conditions of employment.\u201d RSA 273-A:l, XI provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-4\">\u201cTerms and conditions of employment\u201d means wages, hours and other conditions of employment other than managerial policy within the exclusive prerogative of the public employer, or confided exclusively to the public employer by statute or regulations adopted pursuant to statute. The phrase \u201cmanagerial policy within the exclusive prerogative of the public employer\u201d shall be construed to include but shall not be limited to the functions, programs and methods of the public employer, including the use of technology, the public employer\u2019s organizational structure, and the selection, direction and number of its personnel, so as to continue public control of governmental functions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The union essentially contends that the lay-off in combination with the hiring of part-time personnel does not fall within the managerial policy exception and therefore was a mandatory subject of bargaining. The city, in contrast, argues that its reorganization fits squarely within this exception and therefore was not a required topic of negotiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">We have articulated a three-step analysis for measuring a particular proposal or action against the managerial policy exception. \u201cFirst, to be negotiable, the subject matter of the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>contract provision must not be reserved to the exclusive managerial authority of the public employer by the constitution, or by statute or statutorily adopted regulation.\u201d <em>Appeal of State of N.H., </em>138 N.H. at 722, 647 A.2d at 1306. \u201cSecond, the proposal must primarily affect the terms and conditions of employment, rather than matters of broad managerial policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThird, if the proposal were incorporated into a negotiated agreement, neither the resulting contract provision nor the applicable grievance process may interfere with public control of governmental functions contrary, to the provisions of RSA 273-A:1, XI.\u201d <em>Id., </em>647 A.2d at 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">A proposal that fails to satisfy the first step is a <em>prohibited </em>subject of bargaining. <em>Id. </em>at 723, 647 A.2d at 1307. A proposal that satisfies step one, but that fails either step two or step three, is a <em>permissible </em>topic of negotiations. <em>Id.; see also Appeal of City of Concord, </em>139 N.H. at 282-83, 651 A.2d at 948. A proposal that satisfies all three steps is a <em>mandatory </em>subject of collective bargaining. <em>Appeal of State of N.H., </em>138 N.H. at 723, 647 A.2d at 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Applying the three-step inquiry to the facts of this case, we hold that the city\u2019s reorganization was a mandatory subject of collective bargaining. First, the parties cite no <em>independent </em>statute, or any constitutional provision or valid regulation, that reserves to the city the exclusive authority to lay-off full-time employees and' replace them with part-time employees. We reject the city\u2019s bootstrapping attempt to utilize the statutory managerial policy exception as the statute that determines the scope and applicability of the managerial policy exception. <em>See id. </em>at 721-23, 647 A.2d at 1306-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Second, the city\u2019s reorganization primarily affects the wages and hours of employees, rather than issues of broad managerial policy. We recognize that in many cases, like the present one, a proposal or action will touch on significant interests of <em>both </em>the public employer and the employees. In such instances, the second part of the inquiry cannot be resolved through simple labels offered by management, such as \u201crestructuring\u201d or \u201cpersonnel reorganization,\u201d or through conclusory descriptions urged by employees, such as \u201cinherently destructive\u201d conduct. Rather, \u201c[djetermining the primary effect of the proposal requires an evaluation of the strength and focus of the competing interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 722, 647 A.2d at 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Reduced to its essence, the reorganization in this case replaced certain employees who worked forty hours per week at over nine dollars per hour with a <em>greater </em>number of employees who work twenty hours per week at seven dollars per hour. Under the reorganization, the actual job duties remained the same. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>our historical approach to the managerial policy exception may have necessitated the clarification recently provided by <em>Appeal of State of New Hampshire, </em>138 N.H. at 720, 647 A.2d at 1305, our cases have consistently recognized proposals and actions that primarily affect wages or hours as mandatory subjects of bargaining. <em>See Appeal of Franklin Education Assoc., </em>136 N.H. 332, 335, 616 A.2d 919, 921 (1992); <em>Appeal of White Mts. Regional School Bd., </em>125 N.H. 790, 793, 485 A.2d 1042, 1046 (1984); <em>Appeal of Berlin Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>125 N.H. 779, 783-84, 485 A.2d 1038, 1041 (1984); <em>State Empl. Ass\u2019n v. Board of Trustees, </em>118 N.H. 466, 467-68, 388 A.2d 203, 204-05 (1978). For example, even though a school board\u2019s authority to decide whether to offer extracurricular programs or to determine the number of such programs implicates broad managerial policy, the wages and hours for staff involved in any extracurricular programs constitute mandatory subjects of bargaining. <em>See Appeal of Berlin Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>125 N.H. at 783-84, 485 A.2d at 1041-42; <em>see also Appeal of State of N.H., </em>138 N.H. at 722, 647 A.2d at 1306-07. Accordingly, a public employer\u2019s \u201cgreater\u201d power to create or eliminate a position or program does not necessarily include the \u201clesser\u201d power to unilaterally determine wages and hours for the position or program. <em>Cf. Appeal of Internat\u2019l Assoc. of Firefighters, </em>123 N.H. at 406-09, 462 A.2d at 100-01 (public employer that unilaterally reduced platoon sizes from six firefighters to five, but that otherwise maintained existing wage and benefit levels, committed no unfair labor practice); <em>Appeal of Keene State College </em>Educ. <em>Ass\u2019n, </em>120 N.H. 32, 37-38, 411 A.2d 156, 160-61 (1980) (public employer\u2019s elimination of certain faculty committees and chairmanships in its \u201cmanagement structure\u201d not an unfair labor practice, but employer still obligated to negotiate faculty wages and hours).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-3\">On the third prong of the test, we conclude that limiting the city\u2019s ability to reorganize in the specific manner utilized here would not interfere with public control of governmental functions. Preventing the city from unilaterally replacing full-time custodians with lower-paid part-time employees \u2014 to perform the <em>identical </em>job functions \u2014 does not present the type of problem we have identified in this context: hindering or impeding a public employer\u2019s authority to establish policy, standards, or criteria for disciplinary action. <em>See Appeal of State of N.H., </em>138 N.H. at 723-24, 647 A.2d at 1307-08; <em>see also Appeal of City of Concord, </em>139 N.H. at 282-83, 651 A.2d at 948. Finally, we note that an overly expansive view of the proposals or actions that \u201cinterfere with public control of governmental functions\u201d could embrace <em>any </em>term of employment, thereby eliminating the category of mandatory subjects and thwarting the collective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>bargaining process required by RSA chapter 273-A. <em>Cf. </em>Befort, <em>Public Sector Bargaining: Fiscal Crisis and Unilateral Change, </em>69 Minn. L. Rev. 1221, 1274 (1985) (criticizing the view that \u201cpublic sector bargaining is an aberration that need be tolerated only when convenient\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Because the.city\u2019s reorganization during the status quo period constituted a unilateral change on mandatory subjects of bargaining, the city committed an unfair labor practice. The city argues, however, that the expired CBA, and therefore the status quo itself, authorized the city\u2019s actions in that the \u201cmanagement rights\u201d article of the CBA granted authority for the reorganization. Even assuming the city\u2019s legal analysis of the status quo is correct, we disagree with its interpretation of the \u201cmanagement rights\u201d article. That article merely reserved to the city control over certain issues that were not specifically addressed in the CBA, and the CBA specifically provided for the wages and hours of the employees. Since the primary effect of the reorganization was a wholesale change in the bargained-for wages and hours of employees, the \u201cmanagement rights\u201d article of the CBA provides no refuge. <em>See Appeal of White Mts. Regional School Bd., </em>125 N.H. at 793-94, 485 A.2d at 1045-46. Accordingly, we affirm the PELRB\u2019s conclusion that the city\u2019s reorganization constituted an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">We address the city\u2019s remaining two arguments together. The city contends that the PELRB\u2019s remedy for the unfair labor practice impermissibly extends to persons beyond the PELRB\u2019s jurisdiction and defies implementation as a result of its vagueness. Although the PELRB\u2019s reasoning focused on those former full-time custodians that were hired as part-time custodians, the PELRB ordered the city to compensate \u201c[t]he position of part-time custodian\u201d at the hourly wage rates for full-time custodians and to provide other benefits on a pro rata basis. The city argues that the order fails to specify whether it applies <em>only </em>to those former full-time employees that are now part-time employees or, instead, to <em>all </em>current part-time custodians. If the latter, the city asserts that the PELRB\u2019s remedy erroneously grants CBA benefits to employees who are not appropriately classified as bargaining unit members. The union interprets the PELRB\u2019s remedy as extending only to the \u201cpart-time custodians who were former full-time custodians and bargaining unit members.\u201d Based on the union\u2019s interpretation, we find no error since the PELRB is authorized to \u201corder such . . . relief as [it] may deem necessary,\u201d RSA 273-A:6, VI (Supp. 1996), and the remedy here is compatible with the violation. We further reject the city\u2019s argument that the PELRB\u2019s remedy for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>violation of the status quo amounts to a \u201ccost item,\u201d <em>see </em>RSA 273-A:I, IV (1987), requiring approval by the local legislative body. <em>See Appeal of Alton School Dist., </em>140 N.H. at 311, 315, 666 A.2d at 942, 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-3\">Finally, we reiterate that parties to a CBA have the ability to avoid the consequences of the status quo. <em>See id. </em>at 316, 666 A.2d at 945. Furthermore, terms and conditions of employment imposed as a result of the status quo doctrine do not become fixed forever; they only last during the process of good faith collective bargaining whose protection and advancement is the rationale for the status quo doctrine. <em>See Appeal of Milton School Dist., </em>137 N.H. at 247, 625 A.2d at 1061.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b811-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
