He argues that the board erred by finding that the injury was not the result of a risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>created by his employment. He also argues that the board violated his right to due process under the New Hampshire and United States Constitutions by reversing its prior decision without a hearing and that the board acted outside its statutory authority by summarily reversing its prior decision. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The claimant injured his right knee on July 18, 1991, while playing first base for the Hampshire Chemical softball team. Hampshire Chemical is a division of W.R. Grace &amp; Company (W.R. Grace), the claimant\u2019s employer at the time of the injury; W.R. Grace and CNA Insurance Companies are the respondents in this case. The claimant received extensive medical care for his injury, including four surgeries. In October 1993, a department of labor hearing officer determined that the claimant\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment and that he was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. W.R. Grace appealed, and in May 1994 the board affirmed the decision of the hearing officer. In reaching its decision, the board applied the compensability test outlined in <em>Murphy v. Town of Atkinson, </em>128 N.H. 641, 645-46, 517 A.2d 1170, 1172-73 (1986). W.R. Grace moved for rehearing, relying on our holding in <em>Anheuser-Busch v. Pelletier, </em>138 N.H. 456, 458-59, 641 A.2d 1018, 1020-21 (1994), in which we clarified part of the <em>Murphy </em>test. In August 1994, without holding another hearing, the board reversed its determination of the claimant\u2019s compensability on the ground that the first prong of the <em>Murphy </em>test, as clarified by <em>Pelletier, </em>had not been met. The claimant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">We will not set aside the decision of the board absent an error of law or unless we are satisfied, by a clear preponderance of the evidence before us, that the board\u2019s decision is unjust or unreasonable. RSA 541:13 (1974); <em>see Appeal of Kehoe, </em>139 N.H. 24, 27, 648 A.2d 472, 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The claimant argues that in <em>Pelletier </em>we merely affirmed and clarified the <em>Murphy </em>compensability test, and, therefore, because there was no change in the law, the board erroneously reversed its earlier decision. In <em>Murphy, </em>we established a test \u201cfor determining whether peripheral or ancillary activities are within the scope of employment\u201d and thus within the scope of workers\u2019 compensation. <em>Murphy, </em>128 N.H. at 645, 517 A.2d at 1172. To succeed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">a claimant must prove (1) that the injury arose out of employment by demonstrating that it resulted from a risk created by the employment, and (2) that the injury arose in the course of employment by demonstrating that (A) it ocexirred within the boundaries of time and space created by the terms of employment, and (B) it occurred in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>performance of an activity related to employment, which may include a personal activity if reasonably expected and not forbidden, or an activity of mutual benefit to employer and employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 645-46, 517 A.2d at 1172-73 (citations omitted). <em>Murphy </em>involved a volunteer firefighter who was injured while playing softball at a Firefighter\u2019s Association picnic. We held, <em>inter alia, </em>that the firefighter\u2019s injury was not within a risk created by his employment as a firefighter because\u2019\u201c[a]t the time he was hurt, the plaintiff was not engaged in firefighting, was not on the employer\u2019s premises, was not subject to the employer\u2019s control, was not. expected by the employer to be engaging in the game and was not injured by or while using the employer\u2019s equipment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 646, 517 A.2d at 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In <em>Pelletier, we </em>restated the <em>Murphy </em>test and found that the claimant failed to prove the first prong of the test: \u201cthat his injury was a risk that arose from, or was created by, his employment with the company.\u201d <em>Pelletier, </em>138 N.H. at 458-59, 641 A.2d at 1020. <em>Pelletier </em>involved an employee who was injured during a company bowling league match. We found that at the time of his injury, the claimant was not on company property, was not engaged in any activities related to brewing beer, was not within his employer\u2019s control, was not required by his employer to be bowling, would have experienced no penalty for refusing to participate in the bowling league, and was not injured by or while using the company\u2019s equipment. <em>Id. </em>at 459, 641 A.2d at 1020. In reaching our decision, we noted that the facts in <em>Pelletier </em>were slightly different from those in <em>Murphy. Id. </em>In <em>Pelletier, </em>the company encouraged participation in sports by providing bulletin board space for sign-up lists, bowling schedules, and notices, and by making a $2000 donation to the bowling league. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, we held \u201cthat this encouragement and sponsorship, by itself, does not create a sufficient causal connection between the defendant\u2019s employment and his risk of injury while bowling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, 641 A.2d at 1020-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">In the case before us, we are again presented with the opportunity to interpret the first prong of the <em>Murphy </em>test. We note that the facts in this case present a greater departure from those in <em>Murphy </em>than did the faets in <em>Pelletier. </em>Here, W.R. Grace had extensive involvement in the activities of the company softball team. During the claimant\u2019s employment interview, softball and the company\u2019s team were discussed. A budget for team expenses was submitted each year to the W.R. Grace plant manager. W.R. Grace paid nearly all of the team\u2019s expenses, including league fees, New Hampshire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>and out-of-state tournament fees, uniforms, bats, gloves, weights, catcher\u2019s equipment and other items, air fare to and from tournaments throughout the United States, rental cars, hotel accommodations, meals and drinks after some games, advertisements in game programs, and season-end awards dinners and ceremonies. W.R. Grace incurred significant additional costs, including overtime pay for workers who filled in for members of the team absent because of commitments to the league schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In its prior decision, the board found that the \u201cpervasive involvement and support of the company for the softball team set participation in that activity apart from the nature of the softball game described in <em>Murphy.\" </em>The board also found that the team was part of the \u201ccultural climate\u201d of the company, that it \u201cstrengthened and boosted\u201d the morale of employees at the company, and that its activities were \u201creasonably expected\u201d and \u201ca [natural] incident of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In its later decision, from which this appeal arises, the board reversed itself, relying on our ruling in <em>Pelletier. </em>The board concluded that the first prong of the <em>Murphy </em>test, as clarified by <em>Pelletier, </em>had not been met. We disagree. The level of company encouragement and sponsorship highlighted by the board\u2019s initial ruling made injury at a company softball team game \u201ca risk created by the employment.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>128 N.H. at 645, 517 A.2d at 1172. At the time of his injury the claimant was using the company\u2019s equipment. More importantly, however, adjustments were made to the claimant\u2019s work schedule to accommodate softball practices and games, and the claimant\u2019s pay was never docked for being away from his job because of softball, even when practices or games occurred during his regular work schedule. These facts, coupled with the company\u2019s extensive involvement with the team and the company\u2019s practice of paying overtime wages to those employees who filled in for players unable to work because of the team\u2019s schedule, set this case apart from <em>Murphy </em>and <em>Pelletier. </em>Contrary to the board\u2019s interpretation of <em>Pelletier, </em>our holding in that case did not preclude the possibility of employer encouragement and sponsorship satisfying the first prong of <em>Murphy. Cf. </em>1A A. Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 22.24(c), (d), (f) (1995) (standing alone, the furnishing of financial support, athletic equipment, prizes, etc. by the employer ordinarily does not satisfy the burden of proof, but outright employer initiative such that the activity is part of an employment recreational program may be enough to find an adequate employment connection). That threshold of risk has been crossed here. As the board found in its initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>decision, the team was part of the \u201ccultural climate and almost institutionalized as an established part of company life for well over 15 years.\u201d Because we reverse on this ground, we need not consider the claimant\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b222-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
