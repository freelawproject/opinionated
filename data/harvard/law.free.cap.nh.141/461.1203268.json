Ct. R. 9, the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-19\">Whether the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act, 28 U.S.C.S. sec. 1738B, prohibits the Courts of the State of New Hampshire from modifying a foreign order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>which has been registered in this state pursuant to RSA 546:33 et seq.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-3\">We hold that it does and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The plaintiff, Kim Wilkie, and the defendant, Richard Silva, were divorced in Florida in 1992. The Florida court ordered the defendant to provide $450 monthly child support for his three children who were in the plaintiff\u2019s custody. In 1994, because the defendant was in arrears in his support payments, the Florida court ordered him to continue the $450 monthly payments and to pay an additional amount towards the arrearage.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Although the plaintiff and her three children continue to live in Florida, the defendant has moved to New Hampshire. When the defendant continued to default on his payments, the State of Florida sought help from the New Hampshire Division of Human Services (division) in enforcing the Florida orders. In response, the division registered the Florida decree with the superior court on September 7, 1995. <em>See </em>RSA 546:34 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">On September 18, 1995, the defendant filed a motion in the superior court to modify his child support obligation. The division objected, maintaining that the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act (Child Support Act), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738B (1994), precluded New Hampshire from modifying the Florida decree, even though it was registered in a New Hampshire court. This interlocutory transfer without ruling followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">In response to \u201cnationwide problems stemming from the varying laws of multiple jurisdictions involved in child support cases,\u201d Congress enacted the Child Support Act in 1994. <em>Paton v. Brill, </em>663 N.E.2d 421, 424 (Ohio Ct. App. 1995). The Child Support Act vests \u201ccontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction\u201d in the State issuing the original child support order unless either of two specific exceptions exist. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738B(d). In order for a court of any State other than the original issuing State to modify a child support order, the court must have jurisdiction, and either the issuing State must no longer be \u201cthe child\u2019s State or the residence of any contestant,\u201d or the parties must file written consent to another State assuming jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738B(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Here, the plaintiff and the children continue to live in Florida, and the plaintiff has not filed written consent to this State assuming jurisdiction in this matter. Accordingly, \u201ccontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction\u201d to modify the Florida decree lies with the Florida court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738B(d). If the defendant wishes to modify his child support obligation, he must do so \u201cin the state that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>originally issued the order. This will insure that the custodial parent is given notice of the proposed modification, as well as an opportunity to oppose the modification if . . . she wishes.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Lurie, </em>39 Cal. Rptr. 2d 835, 846 (Ct. App. 1995) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The defendant nevertheless contends that RSA chapter 546 (1974 &amp; Supp. 1995), the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA), mandates a different result. RSA 546:38, I (1974) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">Upon registration the registered foreign support order shall be treated in the same manner as a support order issued by a court of this state. It has the same effect and is subject to the same procedures, defenses, and proceedings for reopening, vacating, or staying as a support order of this state and may be enforced and satisfied in like manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">That this paragraph of URESA purports to grant New Hampshire jurisdiction to modify the Florida decree by virtue of its being registered in this State does not alter the clear mandate of the Child Support Act. \u201cUnder the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, the provisions of [the Child Support Act] are binding on all states and supersede any inconsistent provisions of state law, including any inconsistent provisions of uniform state laws such as URESA . . . .\u201d <em>Kelly v. Otte, </em>474 S.E.2d 131, 134 (N.C. Ct. App. 1996); <em>cf. Tebbetts v. Ford Motor Co., </em>140 N.H. 203, 205-06, 665 A.2d 345, 346-47 (1995) (noting the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution empowers Congress to preempt state law in certain circumstances), <em>cert. denied, </em>116 S. Ct. 773 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The Child Support Act allows modification of a child support order by another State only if the original issuing State loses continued, exclusive jurisdiction. Consequently, absent the applicability of one of the exceptions, it prohibits any modification by a court of this State of the Florida child support order, even though it has been registered under RSA 546:34.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b497-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
