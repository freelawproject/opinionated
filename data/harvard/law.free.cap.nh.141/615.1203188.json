The defendant moved for a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel; the Superior Court <em>{O\u2019Neill, </em>J.) denied the motion. The issue presented on appeal is whether the defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel under the State and Federal Constitutions was violated when the defendant\u2019s trial counsel inadvertently submitted a jury instruction to the trial court that expanded the grand jury indictment in such a way as to negate the defense presented by the defendant at trial. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">The following facts were developed at trial. On the evening of November 7, 1992, the defendant along with two friends, Brian Keefe and Jamie Jones, went to the home of Andrina Gonthier in Dover. They spent the evening socializing and consuming alcoholic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>beverages and illegal drugs. In the early hours of the next morning, the defendant, Keefe, and Jones were driving around Dover in Keefe\u2019s automobile. The defendant and his companions observed the victim, Albert Davis, age seventy-six, walking. The defendant told Keefe to stop the vehicle. The three men then exited the automobile and proceeded toward the victim. The defendant was the first person to reach the victim, and his actions caused the victim to fall to the ground. The victim was then assaulted. The victim suffered serious injuries, including fractures of his nose, cheekbone, and pelvis. During the assault, the defendant took the victim\u2019s wallet and later divided the money in the wallet among himself, Keefe, and Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The defendant was indicted for robbery in violation of RSA 636:1 (1996). According to RSA 636:1, III, robbery is a class B felony except in specific circumstances, when it is a class A felony. One of the circumstances in which robbery is a class A felony is if the defendant \u201c[ijnflicted or attempted to inflict death or serious injury on the person of another.\u201d RSA 636:1, III(c). In this case, the indictment charged the defendant with a class A felony, alleging that the defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">did in the course of committing a theft, knowingly use physical force on the person of another and inflicted serious injury on the person of another ... in that [the defendant] did, in the course of taking the wallet of Albert Davis . . . tackle said Albert Davis, throwing him to the ground and proceed to beat and kick said Albert Davis, causing injury to Albert Davis in the form of a fractured cheekbone, broken nose, and broken pelvis ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">At trial, the defendant did not contest the fact that he participated in the robbery. Rather, it was his defense that he had not caused the victim\u2019s serious injuries and, therefore, was guilty of class B robbery, not class A. The testimony at trial about who caused the victim\u2019s injuries was conflicting. The victim testified that, during the assault, he was held down by two people and kicked and punched by a third person. He was unable to identify the person responsible for the kicking and punching, however. Keefe and Jones also testified at trial. Both had reached plea agreements with the State before the defendant\u2019s trial. Keefe testified that the defendant pushed the victim down and punched him twice. Jones testified that he saw the defendant scuffling with the victim, but he did not see the defendant punch or kick the victim. The defendant testified in his own defense. He admitted that he had participated in the robbery, but denied that he had caused any of the victim\u2019s serious injuries. He said that he slipped as he approached the victim, knocking him down. He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>said that during the assault he \u201cswung at\u201d the victim, but only \u201cgrazed\u201d the victim\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Since the defendant admittedly caused the victim to fall to the ground and took his wallet, he essentially conceded the elements of class B robbery. During trial, the court questioned the defendant about his defense strategy in a hearing outside the presence of the jury. The court asked the defendant if he understood that, if his defense was successful, he could be convicted of a lesser-included offense which did not require proof of serious bodily injury. The defendant indicated that he understood this, and that he was knowingly and voluntarily waiving his right to have his counsel argue for complete innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">At the close of evidence and before submission of the case to the jury, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel submitted \u201cpattern\u201d jury instructions to the trial court. These included an instruction that the defendant could be found guilty of class A robbery if he \u201cinflicted or <em>attempted to inflict </em>serious injury on another person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The jury found the defendant guilty of class A robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Approximately three years after he was convicted, the defendant filed a motion for new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. He claimed that his trial counsel\u2019s performance in submitting the jury instruction and failing to object to it was deficient because the instruction expanded the indictment and allowed the jury to convict him if it found that the defendant \u201cattempted to\u201d inflict serious injury. At a hearing on this motion, defendant\u2019s trial counsel, who is not appellate counsel, testified that his submission of the instruction with the \u201cattempted to\u201d language was inadvertent, and admitted that, under the circumstances, the submission was an \u201cegregious\u201d error.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The superior court denied the motion for a new trial. Although it found that trial counsel failed to exhibit a reasonable degree of competence in submitting the instruction, it concluded that the defendant had not shown \u201cactual prejudice\u201d as a result of his trial counsel\u2019s error. The superior court stated that the defendant was required to \u201cestablish that there is a reasonable probability that the jury convicted him based on the \u2018attempt\u2019 instruction but would not have convicted him had the instructions not included same.\u201d After summarizing the evidence at trial, the court stated that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to have found that the defendant caused serious injury to the victim and, therefore, found that the defendant had failed to prove with a reasonable degree of probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">On appeal, the defendant contends that he was not required to prove \u201cactual prejudice\u201d in this case because his trial counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>error was inherently prejudicial. Alternatively, he argues that the superior court erred in finding that he did not prove \u201cactual prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is based on part I, article 15 of the State Constitution and the fifth, sixth, and fourteenth amendments of the Federal Constitution. The State Constitution is at least as protective as the Federal Constitution in this area. <em>See State v. Sanchez, </em>140 N.H. 162, 163, 663 A.2d 629, 630 (1995). For this reason, we address the defendant\u2019s claim under the State Constitution, see <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231, 471 A.2d 347, 350 (1983), using federal precedents only as an aid in our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Under part I, article 15 of the State Constitution, a criminal defendant is entitled to reasonably competent assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Matiyosus, </em>134 N.H. 686, 687, 597 A.2d 1068, 1069 (1991). To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and second, that counsel\u2019s performance resulted in actual prejudice to the outcome of the defendant\u2019s case. <em>Sanchez, </em>140 N.H. at 163, 663 A.2d at 630. With regard to the second element, the defendant must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had he received competent legal representation. <em>See id. </em>\u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>State v. Wisowaty, </em>137 N.H. 298, 302, 627 A.2d 572, 574 (1993) (quotation omitted); <em>see Lockhart v. Fretwell, </em>506 U.S. 364, 369 (1993) (\u201cUnder our decisions, a criminal defendant alleging prejudice must show that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">There are limited circumstances in which prejudice is presumed. When trial counsel\u2019s error prevents the \u201cmeaningful adversarial testing\u201d of the State\u2019s case, a defendant is not required to prove \u201cactual prejudice.\u201d <em>See State v. Anaya, </em>134 N.H. 346, 354, 592 A.2d 1142, 1147 (1991). Because we conclude that the defendant has established \u201cactual prejudice,\u201d we need not decide whether trial counsel\u2019s error was so serious that prejudice must be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">In determining whether the defendant has shown \u201cactual prejudice,\u201d we focus ultimately on the fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being challenged. <em>See Avery v. Cunningham, Warden, </em>131 N.H. 138, 149, 551 A.2d 952, 958-59 (1988); <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 695-96 (1984). The court hearing an ineffectiveness claim must consider the totality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>the evidence before the judge or jury. <em>See Avery, </em>131 N.H. at 149, 551 A.2d at 958-59. We believe that, in this case, the superior court failed to recognize the devastating and unfair effect that trial counsel\u2019s error had on the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">As the superior court recognized in its order, the indictment in this case required the State to prove that the defendant actually caused serious injury to the victim. The defendant was entitled to rely on the indictment in preparing his defense to the charge. <em>See State v. Elliott, </em>133 N.H. 759, 765, 585 A.2d 304, 307 (1990). Based on the indictment, the defendant presented the defense that he had not actually caused the victim\u2019s serious injuries and, therefore, could not be convicted of class A robbery. During his opening statement, defense counsel described the jury\u2019s task as follows: \u201cThe one question you must resolve in this particular case is whether or not Mr. Henderson in fact caused the broken cheekbone, the broken nose and the broken pelvis of Albert Davis.\u201d The defendant testified at trial in his own defense. He admitted that he participated in the robbery. With regard to the victim\u2019s injuries, the defendant said that he \u201cswung at\u201d the victim, but only \u201cgrazed\u201d his head. He denied causing any of the victim\u2019s serious injuries. As the superior court stated in its order: \u201cIt is reasonable to conclude that defendant\u2019s trial strategy would have been different had the indictment allowed him to be convicted for an attempt to cause serious bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">In this context, the jury instruction submitted by trial counsel had two important effects. First, it expanded the grand jury indictment to include an \u201cattempt to\u201d inflict serious injury. This was extremely prejudicial because it permitted the defendant to be convicted based on a theory not alleged in the indictment. We recently recognized the unfairness caused by such an error in <em>State v. Prevost, </em>141 N.H. 559, 689 A.2d 121 (1997). In <em>Prevost, </em>we ruled that a jury instruction that included an instruction on an alternative element of an offense which was not part of the indictment was grounds for automatic reversal. <em>Id. </em>at 560, 689 A.2d at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The second effect of the instruction was equally serious. When the defendant testified, his admission that he \u201cswung at\u201d the victim had no legal significance. The language of the jury instruction, which included language on attempt, rendered the defendant\u2019s trial testimony nothing less than an admission of guilt to class A robbery. While this case differs significantly from <em>State v. Anaya, </em>in which defense counsel urged the jury to convict the defendant of a lesser-included offense without the defendant\u2019s permission, <em>see Anaya, </em>134 N.H. at 353-54, 592 A.2d at 1146-47, it is similar in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>important way. Defense counsel essentially conceded that the defendant had committed a crime \u2014 in this case, class A robbery \u2014 without authority from the defendant. As we stated in <em>Anaya: </em>\u201c[T]he decision to admit such guilt should remain inviolably personal to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353, 592 A.2d at 1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Although the State does not contest the finding that trial counsel\u2019s performance was not reasonably competent, it contends that the defendant failed to prove \u201cactual prejudice.\u201d The State argues that the defendant was not prejudiced by the jury instruction because the question whether the defendant \u201cattempted to\u201d inflict serious injury was not an issue at trial. The State is correct that the defendant did not argue at trial that he did not attempt to inflict serious injury. Because the indictment did not include an allegation that the defendant attempted to inflict serious injury, it was not necessary for the defendant to present a defense to such an allegation. As discussed above, the defendant was entitled to rely upon allegations made in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The State also challenges the defendant\u2019s contention that he may have been convicted based on the \u201cattempted to\u201d language in the instruction. It argues that there was no evidentiary basis for the jury to conclude that the defendant \u201cattempted to\u201d inflict serious injury. We disagree. The defendant himself testified that he \u201cswung at\u201d the victim\u2019s head but only \u201cgrazed\u201d it. Although the superior court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, it appeared to recognize that the defendant may have been convicted based on the \u201cattempted to\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">We conclude that trial counsel\u2019s error in this case affected the fundamental fairness of the trial in such a way as to undermine our confidence in the reliability of the jury verdict. Accordingly, we find that the defendant met his burden of establishing \u201cactual prejudice.\u201d For this reason, we hold that the superior court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Because of our resolution of this issue, it is not necessary to address the defendant\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b654-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
