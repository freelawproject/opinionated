Townsend, for her slip-and-fall accident at an apartment complex operated by the defendant, Emile J. Legere d/b/a Beechbrook Apartments. On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the superior court erred in instructing the jury on comparative negligence because there was insufficient evidence to warrant the instruction. We agree and therefore set aside the portion of the special verdict finding comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-16\">On February 14,1993, the plaintiff, a sixty-eight-year-old resident of the defendant\u2019s apartment complex, slipped and fell on a sidewalk at the complex during a morning walk with her dog. As a result of the accident, the plaintiff suffered a fractured ankle and subsequently required hospitalization. Roughly one year later, the plaintiff commenced this negligence action, alleging that the defendant failed to maintain the sidewalk in a safe condition and to guard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>against the dangers associated with snow and ice. In a pretrial statement, <em>see </em>Super. Ct. R. 62, the defendant asserted that the accident resulted from the plaintiff\u2019s inability to control her dog and from her failure to exercise due care.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">At trial, the plaintiff presented evidence in support of her theory of negligence, including testimony from an expert witness that the defendant\u2019s inspection, maintenance, and treatment of the sidewalk fell below the acceptable standards for dealing with snow and ice. In an effort to prove the allegations of comparative fault at trial, the defendant relied on the following: (1) the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that a light dusting of snow covered and obscured the sidewalk on the morning of her accident; (2) the cross-examination of the plaintiff, which revealed that she weighed approximately 110 pounds and that her dog weighed roughly seventy-five pounds on the day of the accident; (3) testimony from the defendant\u2019s on-site employee that the plaintiff\u2019s dog, on other occasions, had tugged and pulled at the leash during walks with the plaintiff; and (4) a statement from the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness that slip-and-fall accidents on sidewalks can result from factors attributable to the pedestrian, rather than the sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Over the plaintiff\u2019s objection, the trial court instructed the jury on the issue of comparative negligence. In addition, the trial court directed the jury to complete a special verdict form, which required it to determine sequentially: (1) whether the defendant was legally at fault to any degree; (2) whether the plaintiff was legally at fault to any degree; (3) the percentage of fault attributable to each party; and (4) the full amount of the plaintiff\u2019s damages without regard to any findings concerning comparative fault. In its verdict, the jury determined that the plaintiff was forty percent at fault, that the defendant was sixty percent at fault, and that the plaintiff\u2019s damages amounted to $75,000. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to support a jury instruction on comparative negligence. Under our comparative fault statute, \u201c[t]he burden of proof as to the existence or amount of fault attributable to a party shall rest upon the party making such allegation.\u201d RSA 507:7-d (Supp. 1996). Although \u201cthe evidence and all reasonable inferences must be considered most favorably to the defendant\u201d in determining the propriety of a comparative negligence instruction, <em>Brown v. Montgomery Ward Co., </em>109 N.H. 377, 380, 254 A.2d 840, 842 (1969) (decided under contributory negligence), some tangible evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s comparative fault must be introduced before the question can be submitted to the jury. <em>See Brann v. Exeter Clinic, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>127 N.H. 155, 158-59, 498 A.2d 334, 336-37 (1985); <em>Roberts v. Lisbon, </em>84 N.H. 266, 270, 149 A. 508, 510 (1930) (decided under contributory negligence). Accordingly, \u201cif reasonable [persons] on the evidence in the case could only reach a conclusion on a particular issue by conjecture, chance, or doubtful and unsatisfactory speculation it is the duty of the trial court to withdraw the issue from the consideration of the jury.\u201d <em>Ackerman v. March, </em>116 N.H. 64, 66, 352 A.2d 717, 719 (1976); <em>see Brann, </em>127 N.H. at 159, 498 A.2d at 337. Guided by these principles, we analyze whether the facts urged by the defendant constitute evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Pointing to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that a light dusting of snow obscured the sidewalk, the defendant argues that the plaintiff had a duty to use reasonable care while stepping in areas of the sidewalk that were not visible as a result of the snow. The defendant further contends that the jury could infer that the plaintiff \u201cwas not walking as carefully as she should have been under the circumstances.\u201d Although we agree that the plaintiff had a duty to exercise due care, the fatal flaw in the defendant\u2019s argument is the absence of evidence indicating that the plaintiff <em>breached </em>that duty by, for example, \u201cnot walking as carefully as she should have been under the circumstances.\u201d <em>See Wright v. Dunn, </em>134 N.H. 669, 672, 596 A.2d 729, 731 (1991) (negligence requires proof of both duty and breach of that duty). On this point, we reject the defendant\u2019s suggestion that the jury\u2019s prerogative to disbelieve the plaintiff\u2019s testimony regarding her exercise of reasonable care could provide the defendant with evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to exercise such care. \u201cDisbelief in testimony concerning particular facts does not convert that testimony into affirmative proof of contrary facts.\u201d <em>Bissonnette v. Cormier, </em>100 N.H. 197, 199, 122 A.2d 257, 258 (1956) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The defendant also argues that evidence concerning the size and behavior of the plaintiff\u2019s dog was sufficient to warrant the jury instruction on comparative fault. Without some evidence linking the size of the dog to the plaintiff\u2019s accident, however, we find nothing in the mere weight differential to permit the instruction. The defendant further contends that testimony from its on-site employee regarding the dog\u2019s behavior on other occasions supplied an adequate basis for connecting the dog to the plaintiff\u2019s accident. We disagree. During a bench conference concerning the plaintiff\u2019s objection to that testimony, the defendant\u2019s attorney specifically disclaimed any representation that the dog\u2019s unruliness was \u201cconstant or invariable.\u201d On direct examination, the employee, acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>edging that he did not observe the plaintiff\u2019s accident, merely testified that the dog was difficult to control \u201cfrom time to time.\u201d The employee further explained that he only noticed these control problems when the dog encountered people or other animals. On cross-examination, the employee stated that he only knew of two or three occasions in which the dog was unruly and conceded that the dog never caused the plaintiff to fall or otherwise lose her balance. Even considering this testimony most favorably to the defendant, we hold that it was insufficient to support the jury instruction because it could not \u201creasonably and properly lead the jury ... to conclude that the allegation of negligence [was] sustained.\u201d <em>Brann, </em>127 N.H. at 158, 498 A.2d at 336 (quotation omitted); <em>cf. Lapierre v. Sawyer, </em>131 N.H. 609, 611, 557 A.2d 640, 641-42 (1989) (evidence of two or three previous instances of defendant\u2019s unsportsmanlike manner not probative of allegation that defendant\u2019s unsportsmanlike behavior caused plaintiff\u2019s injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Finally, the defendant claims that the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness supplied evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence. We find this argument unconvincing because the expert merely acknowledged, in response to questions concerning potential causes of sidewalk falls in general, that an accident could result from a failure attributable to the pedestrian. This unremarkable \u201cconcession\u201d regarding abstract possibilities could not provide the basis for a ruling against the plaintiff on the issue of comparative fault. <em>See Manor v. Gagnon, 92 </em>N.H. 435, 437-38, 32 A.2d 688, 691 (1943) (decided under contributory negligence).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">After considering the facts urged by the defendant both individually and collectively, we adh\u00e9re to \u00a1well-settled law in holding that the jury should not have been instructed on the issue of comparative negligence: \u201cIf the plaintiff was negligent, the defendant was bound to prove it. In the absence of evidence, the mere possibility, which exists in every case; that the plaintiff may have been guilty of negligence, cannot be made the basis of a ruling against [her].\u201d <em>Demers v. Becker, </em>91 N.H. 519, 520-21, 23 A.2d 375, 376 (1941) (decided under contributory negligence).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Because the special verdict form indicates that the jury\u2019s determination concerning the plaintiff\u2019s damages was independent of the findings regarding comparative fault, we conclude that the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages in the amount of $75,000. We remand to the superior court for entry of an appropriate judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">\n<em>Verdict set aside in part; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b630-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
