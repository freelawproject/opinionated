We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-19\">The trial court found the following facts. The plaintiff owns an eighty-one-acre parcel of land in Derry which it seeks to subdivide for residential development. \u25a0 In 1994, the plaintiff applied for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>preliminary subdivision approval to divide the parcel into twenty-three residential lots. After a public hearing, the planning board denied the application because it was premature, relying upon the town\u2019s subdivision regulations and RSA 674:36, 11(a) (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The plaintiff sought review of the planning board\u2019s decision in superior court under RSA 677:15 (1986) (amended 1991, 1995). After a hearing, the superior court concluded that the plaintiff had not met its burden of demonstrating \u201cby a balance of the probabilities,\u201d <em>Durant v. Town of Dunbarton, </em>121 N.H. 352, 357, 430 A.2d 140, 143-44 (1981) (quotation omitted) (applying prior law), that the planning board\u2019s decision was illegal or unreasonable, <em>see </em>RSA 677:15, I. The plaintiff appealed, arguing that the planning board\u2019s denial of its subdivision application was invalid under the \u201cscattered and premature\u201d language in the town\u2019s subdivision regulations and constituted illegal growth control.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">On appeal, we will not reverse the trial court\u2019s conclusion \u201cunless its decision is not supported by the evidence or is legally erroneous.\u201d <em>Zukis v. Town of Fitzwilliam, </em>135 N.H. 384, 387, 604 A.2d 956, 958 (1992) (quotations omitted). \u201cIf any of the board\u2019s reasons for denial support its decision, then the plaintiff\u2019s appeal must fail.\u201d <em>Durant, </em>121 N.H. at 354, 430 A.2d at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Like <em>Zukis, </em>135 N.H. at 387, 604 A.2d at 958, and <em>Garipay v. Town of Hanover, </em>116 N.H. 34, 35, 351 A.2d 64, 65 (1976), this case does not ask whether a town\u2019s growth control provisions are adequate. <em>See </em>RSA 674:22 (1986), :28 (1986 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 1995). Our inquiry, rather, is whether the planning board exceeded its subdivision control authority in denying the plaintiff\u2019s application. Planning boards are empowered under RSA 674:36, 11(a) to include in subdivision regulations provisions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">against such scattered or premature subdivision of land as would involve danger or injury to health, safety, or prosperity by reason of the lack of water supply, drainage, transportation, schools, fire protection, or other public services, or necessitate the excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">The town enacted subdivision regulations mirroring an earlier version of this provision, authorizing the board to deny a subdivision request based upon</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">such factors as scattered or premature subdivision of land as would involve danger or injury to health, safety, or prosperity by reason of lack of water supply, drainage, transportation, or other public services, or necessitate an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Derry Land Development Control regulations <em>V, </em>B(4) (1993); see RSA 36:21 (1970) (repealed 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Both <em>Zukis </em>and <em>Garipay </em>involved the adequacy of existing roads in a particular area to accommodate the increased traffic that a proposed subdivision development would cause. <em>See Zukis, </em>135 N.H. at 386, 604 A.2d at 957; <em>Garipay, </em>116 N.H. at 35, 351 A.2d at 65. The question was how an existing road, which in each case was inadequate to accommodate existing residential development in the area, could cause further development to be \u201cpremature.\u201d <em>See Zukis, </em>135 N.H. at 386, 604 A.2d at 957; <em>Garipay, </em>116 N.H. at 36, 351 A.2d at 65. We stated in this regard that the planning board\u2019s duty, when considering whether a proposed subdivision will create scattered or premature development, is to \u201cascertain what amount of development, in relation to what quantum of services available, will present the hazard described in the statute and regulations. At the point where such a hazard is created, further development becomes premature.\u201d <em>Garipay, </em>116 N.H. at 36, 351 A.2d at 65. The focus of the inquiry is upon the effect of the proposed development on the community, not the effect of further development in general on the community. <em>See </em>5 E. Ziegler, Rathkopf's the Law of Planning and Zoning \u00a7 64.02, at 64-16 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Comprehensive growth control planning assesses and balances the development concerns of the entire community, RSA 674:22, with less emphasis on the interests of any one particular landowner. 2 Ziegler, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 13.03[2], at 13-22 to 13-23. The application of subdivision regulations designed to prevent \u201cscattered\u201d or \u201cpremature\u201d development, on the other hand, focuses more directly on a particular development, including consideration of the highest and best use of a particular tract of land, the compatibility of a particular use with the remainder of the community, and the protection of the financial interests of the purchasers, subdividers, and the local government unit. 5 Ziegler, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 64.01[1].</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\u201cAny denial of subdivision approval will naturally have the secondary effect of limiting growth.\u201d <em>Zukis, </em>135 N.H. at 387, 604 A.2d at 958. The planning board \u201cmust consider current as well as anticipated realities\u201d when evaluating the \u201cmaturity\u201d of a particular subdivision request. <em>Patenaude v. Town of Meredith, </em>118 N.H. 616, 621, 392 A.2d 582, 585 (1978). We turn now to the \u201crealities\u201d that the planning board considered in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The capacity of the Derry schools to accommodate even the existing level of students was an important factor in both the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>court\u2019s and the planning board\u2019s decisions. The current version of RSA 674:36, 11(a) explicitly provides for consideration of the adequacy of school facilities in determining whether a subdivision is premature. The local ordinance provides for consideration of \u201cother public services,\u201d DERRY LAND DEVELOPMENT CONTROL REGULATIONS <em>Y, </em>B(4), which include school facilities. The trial court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-3\">although the current educational facilities and resources may be barely sufficient to meet the needs of the existing community, when an additional 23 (3 bedroom) home subdivision, as proposed by petitioner, will place at risk the school district\u2019s ability to provide adequate public education, thus endangering the well-being of its population, the statute and regulations authorize the Planning Board to find the proposal premature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">There was testimony at the planning board hearing and at the trial on this issue. Planning board member Frank Scott stated at the hearing that \u201cthe major problem\u201d at the time was \u201cthe school district.\u201d He further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">I think right now . . . this Board has to look at what the town has to get done. And I firmly believe we cannot afford to put one more child in that school, in the school district who isn\u2019t already living in this town. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">I\u2019d like to see us try to work with the developers. . . . There\u2019s basically not a whole lot wrong with that plan. . . . It\u2019s just simply we can\u2019t afford to handle services that go along with allowing it to get built right now. <em>And we \u2019re not saying don\u2019t ever do it. All we\u2019re saying is just don\u2019t do it now.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">(Emphasis added.) These are the classic considerations in favor of growth control regulation. <em>See </em>D. Hagman &amp; J. Juergensmeyer Urban Planning and Land Development Control Law \u00a7 7.2, at 192-93 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\"> \u201cRSA 674:36, 11(a) serves to ensure that the town, through its planning board, retains control over its expenditures on the development, improvement, and maintenance of town services to new subdivisions.\u201d <em>Stillwater Condo. Assoc. v. Town of Salem, </em>140 N.H. 505, <em>508, </em>668 A.2d 38, 41 (1995) (quotation and emphasis omitted). The provision does not serve to replace comprehensive growth control regulation. <em>See Zukis, </em>135 N.H. at 387, 604 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>958. The adequacy of school facilities is a legitimate concern of the town; the circumstances of the school facilities, however, do not constitute a \u201cdanger ... to health, safety, or prosperity by reason of the lack of . . . schools.\u201d RSA 674:36,11(a). Further testimony at the planning board meeting held on the plaintiff\u2019s application makes it clear that the town was aware of the need to proceed with formal growth control regulation, including the need to formulate a comprehensive plan. The planning board\u2019s action in denying the plaintiff\u2019s proposal on the grounds of \u201cprematurity\u201d plainly was taken to control growth, and it exceeded the board\u2019s statutory authority under RSA 674:36, 11(a). <em>See </em>Durant, 121 N.H. at 354, 430 A.2d at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b334-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
