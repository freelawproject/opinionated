Jensen, appeals from an order of the Superior Court <em>(Mohl, </em>J.) granting the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, St. Paul Property and Liability Company (St. Paul), denying uninsured motorist coverage under a policy owned by the decedent, Carl E. Jensen. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-14\">On May 14, 1993, the decedent was riding a lawnmower on private property when he was struck and killed by a motorcycle driven by Ralph Lingard. The plaintiff recovered the liability limits of $25,000 under Lingard\u2019s policy and instituted a declaratory judgment action against St. Paul, seeking underinsured motorist benefits under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>decedent\u2019s Antique Automobile Insurance Policy issued by St. Paul on the decedent\u2019s 1931 Ford Model A Roadster. The trial court, on cross motions for summary judgment, ruled that the St. Paul policy does not provide uninsured motorist coverage in the circumstances of the decedent\u2019s fatal accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\">The St. Paul policy outlines the extent of uninsured motorist coverage in a section entitled \u201cPart C \u2014 Uninsured Motorists Coverage.\u201d Pursuant'to Part C, St. Paul agreed to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-4\">pay damages which an \u201cinsured\u201d is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">1. Sustained by an \u201cinsured\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">2. Caused by an accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Part C defines an \u201cinsured\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-10\">1. Any person \u201coccupying\u201d \u201cyour covered auto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-11\">2. Any person for damages that person is entitled to recover because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d to which this coverage applies sustained by a person described in 1. above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">\u201cOccupying\u201d is defined in the policy\u2019s definitions section as \u201cin, upon, getting in, on, out or off\u201d; \u201cyour covered auto\u201d is defined as \u201c[a]ny \u2018antique vehicle,\u2019 \u2018classic vehicle\u2019 or \u2018special interest vehicle\u2019 shown in the Declarations.\u201d The Declarations describes the decedent\u2019s 1931 Ford Model A Roadster.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">The uninsured motorist coverage of the policy thus requires the decedent to have been occupying the Model A Roadster at the time of his accident in order to recover benefits. Similarly, the liability section of the policy ties coverage to the Model A: under the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d in \u201cPart A \u2014 Liability Coverage\u201d of the policy, coverage is provided \u201cfor the ownership, maintenance or use of \u2018your covered auto.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-14\">The plaintiff in her brief argues that the decedent is entitled to uninsured motorist\u2019coverage as a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under the policy and pursuant to the uninsured motorist statute, RSA 264:15, I (1993). At oral argument, the plaintiff conceded that the policy definition of \u201cinsured\u201d is clear and supports the defendant\u2019s position of no coverage. We therefore need only look to whether the statute requires coverage beyond what is described in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-15\">RSA 264:15, I, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-16\">No policy shall be issued under the provisions of RSA 264:14, with respect to a vehicle registered or principally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>garaged in this state unless coverage is provided therein or supplemental thereto at least in amounts or limits prescribed for bodily injury or death for a liability policy under this chapter, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or drivers of uninsured motor vehicles, and hit-and-run vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom. When an insured elects to purchase liability insurance in an amount greater than the minimum coverage required by RSA 259:61, his uninsured motorist coverage shall automatically be equal to the liability coverage elected. For the purposes of this paragraph umbrella or excess policies that provide excess limits to policies described in RSA 259:61, shall also provide uninsured motorist coverage equal to the limits of liability purchased, unless the named insured rejects such coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">This statute \u201crequires that uninsured motorist coverage be provided with the same monetary limits as are provided under a policy for general liability coverage.\u201d <em>Raudonis v. Ins. Co. of North America, </em>137 N.H. 57, 61, 623 A.2d 746, 749 (1993). It is intended to allow policy holders to protect themselves against injury from an uninsured motorist to the extent they protect themselves against liability. <em>U.S. Automobile Assoc. v. Wilkinson, </em>132 N.H. 439, 449, 569 A.2d 749, 754 (1989). The statute is silent as to who must be provided uninsured motorist coverage other than \u201cpersons insured.\u201d As we have explained, \u201c\u2018persons insured\u2019 refers to persons specified in the insurance policy.\u201d <em>Beliveau v. Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>120 N.H. 73, 76, 411 A.2d 1101, 1103 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The plaintiff essentially asks us to find that the statute mandates coverage for the named insured whenever and however he is injured by an uninsured motorist. No evidence exists that the legislature intended the statute to sweep so broadly. Nothing in the statute requires uninsured motorist coverage for persons not occupying the vehicle described in the policy when injured. Where the legislature has desired to require coverage for specific classes of individuals, it has done so explicitly, <em>Beliveau, </em>120 N.H. at 76, 411 A.2d at 1103; it has not seen fit to require that uninsured motorist coverage run to the person insured in any and all circumstances. Rather, the requirement that all automobile liability policies include uninsured motorist coverage assures that such coverage runs at a minimum to the vehicle insured. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cuninsured motorist coverage is vehicle related\u201d). We are unable to discern a legislative purpose to require more.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>We have stated that \u201c[t]he insurance company remains free to limit its liability through clear and unambiguous policy language.\u201d <em>Cacavas v. Maine Bonding &amp; Casualty Co., </em>128 N.H. 204, 208, 512 A.2d 423, 425 (1986) (quotation omitted). That is precisely what St. Paul did in the antique auto policy it issued to the decedent: it plainly limited uninsured motorist protection to persons occupying the insured vehicle. And such a limitation comports with the reasonable expectations of the policyholder, <em>see Allstate Ins. Co. v. Crouch, </em>140 N.H. 329, 333, 666 A.2d 964, 966 (1995), where \u201cantique vehicle\u201d is defined in the policy as one \u201cmaintained solely for use in exhibitions, club activities, parades or other functions of public interest; <em>it is not used primarily for the transportation of persons or goods.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The St. Paul\" policy was simply not intended by either party to insure the decedent\u2019s regular mode of transportation. We uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling denying coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b64-5\">BRODERICK, J., did not sit; BATCHELDER, J., retired, sat by special assignment under RSA' 490:3; HORTON, J., dissented; the others who sat concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b64-6\">Horton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZI\">dissenting: I would reverse the order of the trial court granting summary judgment to the defendant and hold that the policy in issue provides uninsured motorist coverage for the injuries sustained by the plaintiff\u2019s decedent. Although coverage is clearly excluded by the express terms of the subject policy, I would hold that coverage is mandated by the provisions of RSA 264:15, I (1993). In pertinent part, this statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">No policy shall be issued under the provisions of RSA 264:14, with respect to a vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state unless coverage is provided therein or supplemental thereto at least in amounts or limits prescribed for bodily injury or death for a liability policy under this chapter, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or drivers of uninsured motor vehicles, and hit and run vehicles ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">When a motor vehicle liability policy is issued on <em>a </em>vehicle registered or principally garaged in New Hampshire, it must contain uninsured motorist coverage at th'e liability limits covering all persons insured under the liability policy. This legislative mandate supersedes any restrictive or exclusionary language in the policy where such language is in conflict with the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>purpose. <em>See Peerless Ins. Co. v. Vigue, </em>115 N.H. 492, 494, 345 A.2d 399, 400 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\">It is uncontested that the subject policy is a motor vehicle liability policy issued on <em>a </em>vehicle registered and garaged in New Hampshire. Thus the statutory coverage inquiry is: was the plaintiff\u2019s decedent a \u201cperson insured thereunder,\u201d or is the statutory coverage in some way properly limited under the terms of the policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">It is fair to say that \u201cpersons insured thereunder\u201d refers to persons insured for liability under the policy, but the uninsured motorist coverage afforded is not otherwise related to the vehicle insured or to damages incurred in the presence of a liability risk insured against. It \u201cis not coverage for vehicles but for persons, even though it is contained in an insurance policy otherwise insuring an automobile.\u201d <em>Nygaard v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>221 N.W.2d 151, 157 (Minn. 1974) (superseded by Minn. Stat. \u00a7 65B.49, subd. 3a(7) (1994)) (quotation omitted). A \u201cperson insured thereunder\u201d need not be driving the insured vehicle or otherwise be related to the insured vehicle to be afforded statutory coverage under our law. All that is needed is that the injured party be \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">One may be insured for liability coverage under a motor vehicle liability policy in two ways: by status and by use. Status coverage is afforded by being the named insured identified in the declarations or by being the resident spouse or resident relative of a named insured. <em>See </em>1 A. Widiss, Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Insurance \u00a7 4.1, at 59 (2d ed. 1992); <em>cf. Beliveau v. Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>120 N.H. 73, 76, 411 A.2d 1101, 1103 (1980) (coverage is for persons specified in the insurance policy). Use coverage is related to the vehicle insured, and the risk insured against must arise from the use or occupancy of the insured vehicle. A status-insured should be afforded uninsured motorist coverage in all instances where the status-insured is \u201centitled to recover damages from owners or drivers of uninsured motor vehicles.\u201d RSA 264:15, I. A use-insured is entitled to uninsured motorist protection only when his or her injury is related to the use of the insured motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Can a status-insured have his 'or her status as insured for uninsured motorist coverage be limited by defining the liability risk to the use of the insured vehicle, thereby converting the status-insured\u2019s posture to a use-insured\u2019s posture? I think not. The scope of the liability coverage is always related to the use, by the status-insured, of a motor vehicle \u2014 in this case the insured vehicle. But this limitation is appropriate only in the context of the liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>coverage. The uninsured motorist coverage is also vehicle related, but not to a vehicle related to the insured; coverage is related to the foreign uninsured motor vehicle. The relationship is to the injury, not to the insured vehicle. Thus, the status-insured, as a pedestrian or a lawnmower operator on private property, should have uninsured motorist coverage to answer for damages inflicted by a motor vehicle without regard to whether the status-insured is \u201coccupying\u201d or \u201cusing\u201d the insured vehicle. I would hold that the express restrictions on coverage in the uninsured motorist section of the subject policy are superseded by statutory coverage. I would hold that, for a status defined insured, uninsured motorist coverage extends to all risks stated in the statute and may not be limited to coverage for injuries related to the insured motor vehicle. \u201cIf limited uninsured motorist coverage is to be permissible for antique or collector cars or any other special or limited use vehicles, the legislature must provide it.\u201d <em>St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Zastrow, </em>480 N.W.2d 8, 15 (Wis. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Nor would I find that the policy is properly limited in its uninsured motorist coverage. When the statute speaks of the \u201camounts or limits prescribed for bodily injury or death,\u201d I would interpret that as being monetary amounts and limits. <em>But see State Farm Auto. Ins. Co. v. Cabuzzi, </em>123 N.H. 451, 454, 462 A.2d 129, 130 (1983) (holding that amounts and limits clause in RSA 264:15, I, invokes territorial limitation permitted by statute). I would hold that the policy\u2019s risk limitations are not limitations appropriate under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The majority, in divining the intention of the legislature, states that \u201c[n]othing in the statute requires uninsured motorist coverage' for persons not occupying the vehicle described in the policy when injured\u201d and that the mandated coverage \u201cruns at a minimum to the vehicle insured.\u201d <em>Supra </em>p. 29. I submit that this language does not express the intent of the legislature and reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose of uninsured motorist coverage. RSA 264:15, I, requires coverage for \u201cdamages from owners or drivers of uninsured motor vehicles\u201d resulting in \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom.\u201d There is no legislative suggestion that the covered damages must arise while occupying the insured vehicle. Nor is such a limitation customarily imposed by liability insurers. <em>See </em>1 WIDISS, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 4.2, at 60-62. It would be unfortunate to see these insurers adopt the majority\u2019s invitation to so limit uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
