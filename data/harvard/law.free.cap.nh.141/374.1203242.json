Walsh. Arnica argues that the arbitrators were plainly mistaken in concluding that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries arose out of the use of a motor vehicle under the terms of his insurance policy. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">The essential facts are not in dispute. On December 3, 1991, the plaintiff drove to the Amoskeag Bank on South Main Street in Bedford to pick up his girlfriend, Natasha Fortune. When he arrived, the plaintiff saw Fortune and her estranged husband, John Durant, sitting in Durant\u2019s car. While Fortune and Durant talked, Durant repeatedly drove his car toward the plaintiff\u2019s car until the plaintiff moved away. When Fortune eventually stepped out of Durant\u2019s car, Durant got out, leaned over the windshield and aimed a gun at the plaintiff, apparently using the windshield to steady the weapon. As the plaintiff drove away, Durant fired several shots at the plaintiff, hitting him numerous times.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-15\">After Durant\u2019s automobile insurance carrier, Allstate Insurance Company denied coverage to the plaintiff, he filed a claim under his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>own </em>policy with Arnica. Arnica denied coverage based upon the uninsured motorist provisions in the plaintiff\u2019s policy, which provide that Arnica will pay damages when an insured can \u201crecover from the owner or operator of . . . [a]n uninsured motor vehicle . . . because of bodily injury sustained by an insured and caused by an accident; and . . . [t]he owner\u2019s or operator\u2019s liability for these damages [arises] out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the uninsured motor vehicle</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Pursuant to the terms of the plaintiff\u2019s policy, the coverage issue was submitted to arbitration. A majority of the arbitration panel found that coverage was required under the policy. Following this ruling, Arnica filed a petition to correct arbitration in the superior court, and the plaintiff filed a petition to confirm arbitration award. The superior court affirmed the panel\u2019s ruling, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Under RSA 542:8 (1974), the superior court has the authority to correct or modify an arbitrator\u2019s ruling upon a showing of \u201cplain mistake\u201d by the arbitrator. <em>See Masse v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>134 N.H. 523, 525, 593 A.2d 1164, 1165 (1991). \u201c[T]he words \u2018plain mistake\u2019 refer both to mistakes of fact and mistakes of law.\u201d <em>N.H. Ins. Co. v. Bell, </em>121 N.H. 127, 129, 427 A.2d 27, 28 (1981). An award may be set aside \u201con the ground that the arbitrators were mistaken in point of law\u201d if it is clear \u201cthat they would not have made such an award had they known what the law was.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">In this case, Arnica contends, among other things, that the arbitration panel was plainly mistaken in concluding that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries arose out of the use of an uninsured motor vehicle. \u201c[A]rising out of\u201d an automobile\u2019s use means \u201coriginating from, or growing out of, or flowing from the use.\u201d <em>Cannon v. Maine Bonding &amp; Cas. Co., </em>138 N.H. 365, 366, 639 A.2d 270, 271 (1994) (quotation omitted). The term \u201cuse\u201d refers to use of the automobile in its inherent nature as a vehicle. <em>See National Farmers Union Property &amp; Cas. Co. v. Gibbons, </em>338 F. Supp. 430, 434 (D.N.D. 1972). To warrant coverage, then, there must be more than a tenuous connection to the automobile; the operator must have been \u201cusing his vehicle or behaving as a motorist\u201d at the time the plaintiff was injured. <em>Akerley v. Hartford Ins. Group, </em>136 N.H. 433, 440, 616 A.2d 511, 515 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Durant\u2019s weapon was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, and we cannot say Durant was using his vehicle or behaving as a motorist when he shot at the plaintiff. Though Durant apparently \u201cused\u201d the vehicle to steady his gun on the windshield, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>this is not a normal use for which a vehicle is intended; consequently, any connection to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries is too tenuous to warrant coverage. <em>See id.; Norgaard v. Nodak Mutual Insurance Co., </em>201 N.W.2d 871, 874 (N.D. 1972). As one court has explained, \u201c[a]n assault by an armed assailant upon the driver of a car is not the type of conduct that is foreseeably identifiable with the <em>normal </em>use of a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Detroit Auto. Inter-Ins. Ex. v. Higginbotham, </em>290 N.W.2d 414, 419 (Mich. Ct. App. 1980). To the extent the arbitrators believed the law to be otherwise, they were plainly mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b410-6\">HORTON, J., did not sit;- the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
