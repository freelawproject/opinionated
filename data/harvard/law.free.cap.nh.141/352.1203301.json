We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">The following facts were adduced at trial. In November and December 1993, the defendant purchased Christmas trees from Paul Vrusho, to be sold at the defendant\u2019s business in Hooksett. At some point during January or on February 1, 1994, the defendant gave Vrusho a check dated February 1, 1994, in the amount of $2,500. The check was drawn on the Bank of New Hampshire, under the title, \u201cAstro Spectacular, Inc. (1985) Specialty Fireworks; Philip E. Fitanides, President.\u201d The following legend was typed on the back of the check: \u201cPlease call before depositing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Vrusho deposited the check into his own bank account on February 2, 1994. The check was returned unpaid by the Bank of New Hampshire for insufficient funds. After discussing the problem with the defendant, Vrusho deposited the check a second time; it was again returned for insufficient funds and was marked, \u201cDo not redeposit.\u201d Vrusho contacted the police after the defendant failed to respond to a letter demanding payment of the amount of the dishonored check. <em>See </em>RSA 638:4, III. The defendant\u2019s bank records indicate that the balance in this account did not exceed $2,000 in February or March 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">On appeal, the defendant argues: (1) that the check was postdated and therefore is not subject to the prohibitions contained in RSA 638:4; and (2) that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it should not consider whether the defendant ever intended to pay the amount owed when it considered his guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">RSA 638:4, I, provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of issuing a bad check if he issues or passes a check for the payment of money and payment is refused by the drawee.\u201d In addition, RSA 638:4, IV(b) requires the State to prove that the person issuing the check issued it \u201cknowing or believing that the check would not be paid by the drawee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">Relying heavily on a New Mexico case, the defendant first argues that a postdated check, as a matter of law, falls outside the ambit of RSA 638:4. <em>See State v. Downing, </em>488 P.2d 112, 113 (N.M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Ct. App. 1971) (holding New Mexico worthless check law inapplicable to postdated check). We reject this argument. The New Mexico statute construed in <em>Downing </em>expressly excepted postdated checks from its prohibitions, and is therefore unhelpful to our analysis in this case. <em>See </em>N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30-36-6(B) (Michie 1989) (worthless check law \u201cdoes not apply to . . . any post-dated check\u201d). \u201cA postdated check is nonetheless a check .... It is payable on demand on or at any time after the day of its date. Its effect is the same as if it had not been issued until that date.\u201d 11 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Bills and Notes </em>\u00a7 19, at 49 (1963); <em>see </em>RSA 382-A:3-104(a), (f) (1994) (defining \u201ccheck\u201d under Uniform Commercial Code); RSA 382-A:3-113(a) (1994) (allowing checks to be postdated under Uniform Commercial Code); <em>Morrison v. Shanwick Intern. Corp., </em>804 P.2d 768, 773 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1990). We hold that postdated checks are not exempt from the prohibition contained in RSA 638:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The defendant next argues that the trial court erred in its response to a question posed by the jury during its deliberations. Although imperfectly preserved in the record, the question seems essentially to have asked whether the jury could consider the defendant\u2019s intent <em>ever </em>to pay Vrusho the amount owed. The trial court responded in the negative. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u201cThe purpose of a trial court\u2019s jury instructions is to state and explain to the jury, in clear and intelligible language, the rules of law applicable to the case.\u201d <em>State v. Jackson, </em>141 N.H. 152, 153, 679 A.2d 572, 574 (1996) (quotation omitted). We review the trial court\u2019s answer to a jury inquiry in the context of the court\u2019s entire charge, <em>see State v. Seymour, </em>140 N.H. 736, 746, 673 A.2d 786, 794, <em>cert. denied, </em>117 S. Ct. 146 (1996), to determine whether the answer accurately conveys the law on the question and whether the charge as a whole fairly covered the issues and law in the case, <em>see Jackson, </em>141 N.H. at 153, 679 A.2d at 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\"> The elements of the crime of passing a bad check are (1) that the defendant issued or passed a check for payment; (2) that the defendant knew or believed that the drawee bank would not pay the check; and (3) payment was refused by the drawee bank. RSA 638:4, I, IY(b). The culpable mental state that the State is required to prove is that the defendant \u201cpassed the check knowing or believing that the check would not be paid by the drawee [bank].\u201d RSA 638:4, IV(b). The State need not prove that the defendant <em>never </em>intended to pay the amount owed. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the jury\u2019s question on this issue was properly answered in the negative. The court\u2019s response \u201cwas unambiguous, legally correct and, in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>the clarity and specificity of the jury\u2019s question, entirely appropriate.\u201d <em>Seymour, </em>140 N.H. at 746, 673 A.2d at 794 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b389-4\">THAYER, J., did not participate; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
