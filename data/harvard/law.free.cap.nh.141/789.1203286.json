We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-17\">In February 1992, the plaintiff, Lakeview Homeowners Association, initiated a negligence action against the defendant to recover the costs of correcting alleged defects in the construction of septic fields. John A. Graf, of the law firm McLane, Graf, Raulerson &amp; Middleton, entered an appearance for the defendant in April 1992. On July 29, 1993, the McLane firm informed the defendant by letter that it was \u201cwithdrawing from representation of [the defendant] in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>all litigated and general corporate matters.\u201d The McLane firm advised the defendant \u201cin the strongest terms to retain new counsel as soon as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\">Superior Court Rule 20 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-4\">Whenever the attorney of a party withdraws his appearance, and no other appearance is entered, the Clerk shall notify the party by mail of such withdrawal, and, unless he appears by himself or attorney by a date fixed by the Court, the action will be dismissed, non-suited, discontinued or defaulted, as the case may be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Pursuant to this rule, the clerk of the Grafton County Superior Court notifed the defendant by letter dated August 11, 1993, that the McLane firm had withdrawn as counsel, and that the defendant was required to secure new counsel on or before Friday, September 10, 1993, or suffer default. The court mailed this notice to the defendant at its post office box address.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The defendant filed no appearance following the McLane firm\u2019s withdrawal. In late September 1993, the defendant learned it had been defaulted. Carl L. Moulton, the defendant\u2019s president, called the court and was told of the August 11 letter. He subsequently wrote the clerk, asserting that he was \u201cneither aware nor notified of any deadline for naming new counsel,\u201d and that the defendant\u2019s \u201cactive mailing address\u201d was not, in fact, the post office box to which the court had sent the August 11 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">In October 1993, the defendant moved to strike the default and to enter a late appearance, arguing that the failure to appear was due to \u201caccident, mistake or misfortune\u201d and not neglect. <em>See </em>Preface Super. Ct. R. By affidavit, Mr. Moulton explained that after he learned the August 11 letter had been sent to the defendant\u2019s post office box, he searched his mother\u2019s house for the letter. His mother, Mary J. Moulton, was the defendant\u2019s former treasurer and had a key to the box; then nearly eighty years old, she was responsible for collecting mail delivered to the post office box and bringing it to the defendant\u2019s office \u201conce or twice a month.\u201d On all other occasions, Bruce Washburn, the defendant\u2019s controller, would collect mail delivered to the post office box.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Mr. Moulton stated he was aware that his mother\u2019s memory had been failing and that she \u201cdid not always deliver the mail to the office in a timely manner.\u201d He alleged, however, that he did not discover until after the default that his mother\u2019s memory problems stemmed from a neurological condition. Mrs. Moulton\u2019s physician filed an affidavit stating that the condition \u201cwould be a likely cause of the loss of any important documents which came into her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>possession.\u201d On October 23, 1993, Mr. Moulton found the August 11 letter at his mother\u2019s house, along with \u201ca number of other pieces of corporate correspondence . . . which [he was] not aware had been received.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-3\">In January 1994, after considering the affidavits and arguments by counsel, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The court ruled that \u201cbased upon the arguments . . . the failure to enter [an] appearance in a timely fashion was the result of neglect as opposed to any accident.\u201d As for Mrs. Moulton\u2019s failure to bring the August 11 letter to the defendant\u2019s office, the court suggested that in trusting her with this responsibility the defendant did so \u201cat [its] peril.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">The defendant now argues that the trial court erred in finding that the failure to appear was due to neglect. Under the superior court rules, the trial court has the authority to grant \u201c[r]elief from failure to comply with the provisions of any rule . . . on such terms as the Court may order, where, due to accident, mistake or misfortune and not through neglect, justice so requires.\u201d Preface Super. Ct. R.; <em>see Cote v. Cote, </em>123 N.H. 376, 377, 461 A.2d 566, 567 (1983). \u201cThe trial court\u2019s decision whether to strike an entry of default is within its discretion; we will not disturb such a ruling unless the court abused that discretion or erred as a matter of law.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>141 N.H. 522, 523, 687 A.2d 262, 263 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">\u201cAccident, mistake or misfortune\u201d has been defined as \u201csomething outside of one\u2019s control, or something which a reasonably prudent [person] would not be expected to guard against or provide for.\u201d <em>Morriss v. Towle Hill Associates, </em>138 N.H. 452, 454, 641 A.2d 1015, 1017 (1994) (quotation omitted). The words \u201cimport something that is outside the expectation or control of [a party] or [its] attorney.\u201d <em>Fome Associates v. Palmer, </em>122 N.H. 985, 986, 453 A.2d 1274, 1275 (1982). The question whether accident, mistake or misfortune occurred is for the trier of fact, and its finding will be conclusive unless it is unsupported by the evidence. <em>Morriss, </em>138 N.H. at 454, 641 A.2d at 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">In this case, the record supports the trial court\u2019s ruling that the defendant\u2019s failure to appear was due to neglect, rather than accident, mistake or misfortune. By his own admission, the defendant\u2019s president was aware that Mrs. Moulton\u2019s memory had been failing and that in the past she \u201cdid not always deliver the mail to the office in a timely manner.\u201d Ensuring prompt mail delivery was well within Mr. Moulton\u2019s sphere of control as president of Moulton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Construction, Inc. His awareness of his mother\u2019s limitations made the possibility that she could not complete this task one which a reasonably prudent person would guard against. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the trial court did not err in concluding that the defendant\u2019s failure to appear \u2014 and the resulting default \u2014 was due to \u201cits own neglect and the manner in which it chose to conduct its business.\u201d <em>D\u2019Agincourt v. Anderson Foreign Motors, Inc., </em>119 N.H. 476, 479, 402 A.2d 1340, 1342 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\">The defendant nonetheless argues that the trial court erred in finding neglect because the court clerk did not send the August 11 letter to the defendant\u2019s \u201caddress of record.\u201d Under Superior Court Rule 2, \u201c[w]henever notice to a party is required, notice to the last mail address on file shall be deemed notice to, and binding on, the party.\u201d In this instance, the defendant did not demonstrate which of its addresses was, in fact, the last mail address on file. For defendants, \u201cthe last mail address on file\u201d typically refers to the mail address on the appearance card, not the address on the plaintiff\u2019s writ. <em>See </em>Super. Ct. R. 2. The record in this case is silent as to the address on the appearance card. Moreover, while the post office box to which the court clerk sent the August 11 letter was not the address indicated on the plaintiff\u2019s writ, it is clear that the post office box was the address for the defendant used by the defendant\u2019s former counsel, the McLane firm, and that it was the address at which the defendant received \u201ccorporate correspondence,\u201d notwithstanding Mr. Moulton\u2019s claim that the post office box was used only for \u201cthird class mail and magazines.\u201d Consequently, we cannot say the trial court erred in finding neglect simply because the court clerk sent the August 11 letter to the defendant\u2019s post office box.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">The defendant also appeals the trial court\u2019s damages assessment. Following the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to strike, the trial court awarded the plaintiff $226,053.34 in damages plus interest and costs. This amount included $44,891.80 for damages incurred by the plaintiff for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of underground pipes and pumps serving the plaintiff\u2019s leach fields. The trial court acknowledged in its order on damages that the plaintiff\u2019s writ did not allege problems with the pumps and piping. The court noted, however, that the plaintiff included these damages in a July 1995 summary of claimed expenses, and that the defendant \u201cwas not surprised by these claims and was not prejudiced by their admission.\u201d-</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The defendant maintains that the plaintiff is not entitled to damages for the problems associated with the pipes and plumbing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>because it failed to allege these claimed expenses in its writ. Superior Court Rule 24 provides that \u201c[n]o plaintiff shall have leave to amend, unless in matters of form, after a default, until a notice upon the defendant, to show cause why the amendment should not be allowed, has been served.\u201d In this case, the plaintiff did not move to amend its writ following the defendant\u2019s default.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-3\">It has long been our practice that \u201c[i]n this jurisdiction, pleadings are treated liberally.\u201d <em>Berlinguette v. Stanton, </em>120 N.H. 760, 762, 423 A.2d 289, 290 (1980). We have accordingly held that a claim may be adequately pled by a writ read together with additional facts adduced at a hearing, when the defendant does not object, <em>see DiFruscia v. N.H. Dept. of Pub. Works &amp; Highways, </em>136 N.H. 202, 204, 612 A.2d 1326, 1328 (1992), and we have suggested that a lack of precision in pleadings may be cured by information obtained in pretrial discovery, <em>see Dunn &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Paragon Homes of New Eng., Inc., </em>110 N.H. 215, 218, 265 A.2d 5, 8 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">These principles are inapposite in this instance, however, as it was not until 1995, well after the defendant\u2019s default, that the plaintiff introduced facts supporting the expenses associated with the \u201cpumps and piping\u201d problems \u2014 problems to which the writ did not refer on its face. While the defendant may not have been surprised by the additional claimed expenses, it was entitled to notice of what was, in effect, an amendment to the original writ following the default, and to an opportunity \u201cto show cause why the amendment should not be allowed.\u201d Super. Ct. R. 24. The defendant having failed to receive this notice, the trial court erred in considering these claimed expenses in assessing damages. We accordingly vacate the trial court\u2019s order on damages and remand to allow the plaintiff an opportunity to seek leave to amend its writ with appropriate notice to the defendant pursuant to Superior Court Rule 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; vacated in part; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b827-6\">BROCK, C.J., dissented; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
