We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The following facts are not in dispute. In 1994, a Nashua police officer arrested Alan H. Rudman and charged him with aggravated driving while intoxicated. <em>See </em>RSA 265:82-a, I (1993). The city prosecutor later entered <em>nolle prosequi </em>on this charge, and Rudman pleaded guilty to a charge of speeding. In its report to the attorney general, <em>see </em>RSA 265:82-c, II (Supp. 1996), the city explained the reduction in charge in this way: \u201cReduced due to defendant observed to have no impairment on video, no breath test, no field sobriety tests within the Nashua Police Department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The plaintiff sought disclosure of three items in Rudman\u2019s police file under the Right-to-Know Law: a copy of the transcript of the arresting officer\u2019s deposition, the officer\u2019s narrative arrest report, and a videotape of Rudman taken during his arrest. In its petition, the plaintiff asserted that \u201cthe City has reduced and/or dismissed a seemingly disproportionate number of driving while intoxicated cases,\u201d and that the information sought was \u201cpublic information relating to the business and operation of both a law enforcement agency and a district court.\u201d The city refused access to the items, asserting that the records were exempt from the Right-to-Know Law because releasing the records \u201cwould constitute an unwarranted invasion of Mr. Rudman\u2019s privacy, which is a legitimate ground for not releasing it\u201d under the decision in <em>Lodge v. Knowlton, </em>118 N.H. 574, 576, 391 A.2d 893, 895 (1978). <em>See </em>RSA 91-A:5, IV (1990) (amended 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The trial court reviewed the evidence <em>in camera, </em>without a record or the presence of counsel. After a hearing at which no record was requested, the court found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">that the plaintiff\u2019s asserted reason for seeking disclosure, to investigate the seemingly disproportionate number of plea bargains or dismissals of DWI cases, is outweighed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Rudman\u2019s interest in privacy. The plaintiff\u2019s justification, in light of the fact that it only seeks the records for a <em>single </em>arrestee, is dubious at best, and therefore, the court concludes that disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of Rudman\u2019s privacy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The plaintiff appealed, arguing that the superior court erred in conducting its <em>in camera </em>inspection outside the presence of counsel and in concluding that disclosure of the information would constitute an unwarranted invasion of Rudman\u2019s privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Our Right-to-Know Law does not provide explicitly for treatment of requests for police investigative files, although it does provide that material shall be exempt from disclosure under the law if \u201cdisclosure would constitute [an] invasion of privacy.\u201d RSA 91-A:5, IV In <em>Lodge, </em>we adopted the six-prong test included in the federal Freedom of Information Act, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7) (1982) (amended 1986) (FOIA), to guide courts in evaluating requests for access to police investigative files. <em>Lodge, </em>118 N.H. at 577, 391 A.2d at 895. One exemption in the <em>Lodge </em>list is for \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would . . . constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576, 391 A.2d at 895 (quotation omitted). This language in <em>Lodge </em>offers no assistance beyond the language of the statutory exemption itself; accordingly, when an exemption is claimed on privacy grounds, we need only decide whether disclosure of the information \u201cwould constitute [an] invasion of privacy\u201d within the meaning of RSA 91-A:5, IV <em>See U.S. Dept. of Justice v. Reporters Committee, </em>489 U.S. 749, 771 (1989) (discussing when an invasion of privacy may be \u201cwarranted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u201cThe interpretation of a statute is to be decided ultimately by this court.\u201d <em>Petition of Walker, </em>138 N.H. 471, 474, 641 A.2d 1021, 1024 (1994). The ordinary rules of statutory construction apply to our review of the Right-to-Know Law, and we accordingly look to the plain meaning of the words used. <em>See Appeal of Astro Spectacular, </em>138 N.H. 298, 300, 639 A.2d 249, 250 (1994); <em>Union Leader Corp. v. Fenniman, </em>136 N.H. 624, 626, 620 A.2d 1039, 1040 (1993). To advance the purposes of the Right-to-Know Law, we construe provisions favoring disclosure broadly and exemptions narrowly. <em>See, e.g., Fenniman, </em>136 N.H. at 626, 620 A.2d at 1040; <em>Herron v. Northwood, </em>111 N.H. 324, 326, 282 A.2d 661, 663 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">When we review exemptions from the Right-to-Know Law, we balance the public interest in disclosure of the requested information against the government interest in nondisclosure, and in privacy exemption cases, the individual\u2019s privacy interest in nondis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>closure. <em>See, e.g., Chambers v. Gregg, </em>135 N.H. 478, 481, 606 A.2d 811, 813 (1992); <em>Mans v. Lebanon School Bd., </em>112 N.H. 160, 162, 290 A.2d 866, 867 (1972). When the exemption is claimed on the ground that disclosure would constitute an invasion of privacy, we examine the nature of the requested document or material and its relationship to the basic purpose of the Right-to-Know Law. In the absence of disputed facts, we review the trial court\u2019s balancing of the public\u2019s interest in disclosure and the interests in nondisclosure <em>de novo. See Chambers, </em>135 N.H. at 481, 606 A.2d at 813; <em>Mans, </em>112 N.H. at 162-63, 290 A.2d at 867; <em>cf. Detroit Free Press, Inc. v. Department of Justice, </em>73 F.3d 93, 95 (6th Cir. 1996) (explicitly providing for <em>de novo </em>review for summary judgment in FOIA case).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The legislature has provided the weight to be given one side of the balance, declaring the purpose of the Right-to-Know Law in this way: \u201cOpenness in the conduct of public business is essential to a democratic society. The purpose of this chapter is to ensure both the greatest possible public access to the actions, discussions and records of all public bodies, and their accountability to the people.\u201d RSA 91-A:1 (1990); <em>see Carter v. Nashua, </em>113 N.H. 407, 416, 308 A.2d 847, 853 (1973); <em>see also </em>N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 8. In other words, the purpose is to provide the utmost information to the public about what its \u201cgovernment is up to.\u201d <em>EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 105 </em>(1973) (Douglas, J., dissenting) (quotation omitted); <em>see Lodge, </em>118 N.H. at 577, 391 A.2d at 895. When a public entity seeks to avoid disclosure of material under the Right-to-Know Law, that entity bears a heavy burden to shift the balance toward nondisclosure. <em>See Petition of Keene Sentinel, </em>136 N.H. 121, 127, 612 A.2d 911, 914 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In its order, the trial court considered the plaintiff\u2019s motives in seeking the information. In Right-to-Know Law cases, the plaintiff\u2019s motives for seeking disclosure are irrelevant. <em>E.g., Mans, </em>112 N.H. at 162, 290 A.2d at 867; <em>see Reporters Committee, </em>489 U.S. at 771. This is because the Right-to-Know Law \u201cgive[s] any member of the public as much right to disclosure as one with a special interest in a particular document,\u201d <em>Reporters Committee, </em>489 U.S. at 771 (quotation and brackets omitted), and accordingly \u201c[t]he motivations of . . . any member of the public . . . are irrelevant to the question of access,\u201d <em>Petition of Keene Sentinel, </em>136 N.H. at 128, 612 A.2d at 915. We reject the approach taken by the trial court as inconsistent with the purposes of the Right-to-Know Law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">If the general public has a legitimate, albeit abstract, interest in the requested information such that disclosure is warranted, disclosure must be made despite the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>the party actually requesting and receiving the information may use it for less-than-lofty purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">Conversely, if disclosure of the requested information does not serve the purpose of informing the citizenry about the activities of their government, disclosure will not be warranted even though the public may nonetheless prefer, albeit for other reasons, that the information be released.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\"><em>Halloran v. Veterans Admin., </em>874 F.2d 315, 323 (5th Cir. 1989); <em>see Reporters Committee, </em>489 U.S. at 771. Although the particular motives of the requesting party are irrelevant to reaching the proper balance, we agree with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s observation in <em>Reporters Committee </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">[o]fficial information that sheds light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties falls squarely within th[e] purpose [of the FOIA]. That purpose, however, is not fostered by disclosure of information about private citizens that is accumulated in various governmental files but that reveals little or nothing about an agency\u2019s own conduct. In th[e <em>Reporters </em>Committee] case \u2014 and presumably in the typical case in which one private citizen is seeking information about another \u2014 the requester [did] not intend to discover anything about the conduct of the agency that has possession of the requested records. Indeed, response to [the <em>Reporters </em>Committee] request would not shed any light on the conduct of any Government agency or official.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-8\"><em>Reporters Committee, </em>489 U.S. at 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Having noted the public\u2019s strong interest in disclosure of information pertaining to its government\u2019s activities, we also note that there may be strong privacy interests at stake on the other side of the balance, particularly in law enforcement investigatory records:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">[individuals have a strong interest in not being associated unwarrantedly with alleged criminal activity. Protection of this privacy interest is a primary purpose of [the FOIA] exemption 7(C). The 7(C) exemption recognizes the stigma potentially associated with law enforcement investigations and affords broader privacy rights to suspects, witnesses, and investigators.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-11\"><em>Stern v. F.B.I., </em>737 F.2d 84, 91-92 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (quotation omitted); <em>see Halloran, </em>874 F.2d at 318 (stating that privacy exemptions to the FOIA recognize that nondisclosure of government information is, in some circumstances, in the public interest); <em>Senate </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>of Puerto Rico v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>823 F.2d 574, 588 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (noting that \u201cdisclosing the identity of targets of law-enforcement investigations can subject those identified to embarrassment and potentially more serious reputational harm\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The balance between the public\u2019s interest in disclosure and a private citizen\u2019s interest in privacy will never be easy to strike. \u201cSuccess lies in providing a workable formula which encompasses, balances, and protects all interests, yet places emphasis on the fullest responsible disclosure.\u201d <em>Halloran, </em>874 F.2d at 319 (quotation omitted). With the strong presumption in favor of disclosure, the formula must provide first for an inquiry into whether there is a privacy interest that <em>would be </em>invaded in the case of disclosure. RSA 91-A:5, IV; <em>see Reporters Committee, </em>489 U.S. at 762. \u201cIf there is not, the basic policy of the [Right-to-Know Law] mandates disclosure.\u201d <em>Johnson v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>739 F.2d 1514, 1518 (10th Cir. 1984) (quotation omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds by Hale v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>2 F.3d 1055 (10th Cir. 1993). Because the trial court considered the particular motives of the plaintiff, and because the trial court did not have the benefit of this opinion when considering the interests in the instant case, we vacate its decision and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The plaintiff also asserts that the trial court erred in conducting its review of the requested material <em>in camera </em>without the presence of counsel. We reject this argument. Although the procedure should be used cautiously and rarely, <em>see Pollard v. F.B.I., </em>705 F.2d 1151, 1153-54 (9th Cir. 1983), <em>ex parte in camera </em>review of records whose release may cause an invasion of privacy is plainly appropriate. <em>See Brown v. Minter, </em>254 S.E.2d 326, 327 (Ga.) (decided under state open records act), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 844 (1979); <em>cf. Dept. of Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 374 (1976) (concluding that FOIA provision for redaction of some material \u201cwas added explicitly to authorize <em>in camera </em>inspection\u201d); <em>State v. Gagne, </em>136 N.H. 101, 105, 612 A.2d 899, 901 (1992) <em>(in camera </em>review used as a step between partial disclosure and total nondisclosure of confidential records). For purposes of appellate review, however, a record must be taken of any hearings that are held, whether counsel for one or both parties are present. <em>Cf. State v. Brodowski, </em>135 N.H. 197, 201, 600 A.2d 925, 927 (1991) (trial court\u2019s duty to record <em>ex parte </em>discussion with jury venire).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b512-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
