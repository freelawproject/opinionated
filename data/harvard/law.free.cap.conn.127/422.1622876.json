The store was not again opened for business until 9 o\u2019clock on the morning of July 5, 1938. Half an hour later the plaintiff in walking over this floor as an invitee of the defendant, fell and was injured. These facts are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The only assignment of error pursued upon this appeal from the judgment entered on the verdict in favor of the defendant, relates to an instruction in the court\u2019s charge to the jury. After stating that the defendant had the right to place the dressing on the floor and that the oiling of it did not constitute negligence per se, the court continued, using in part words from our opinion in the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Union &amp; New Haven Trust Co., </em>121 Conn. 369, 371, 185 Atl. 81: \u201cAn owner of a store, in treating a floor may use wax or oil or other substance in the customary manner without incurring liability to one who slips and falls thereon, unless the owner is negligent in the materials, he uses or in the manner of applying them. The specific question that you must decide is not was the floor dry or wet; not was the floor clean or soiled; not whether the floor was or was not slippery. The specific question that you must ultimately decide is, has the plaintiff proved by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant was negligent in that it did not exercise reasonable care to have and keep its premises reasonably safe for such use by Mrs. Staneo as it might reasonably anticipate.\u201d The first sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>quoted from this instruction is a correct statement of the law definitive of the defendant\u2019s duty. The last sentence, predicated upon this statement and declaring that the specific question which the jury must ultimately decide was whether the plaintiff had proved that the defendant was negligent in failing to exercise reasonable care to have and keep its premises reasonably safe for such use by the plaintiff as it might reasonably anticipate, was also correct. The issue is therefore reduced to the narrow inquiry whether the court\u2019s instruction to the effect that the specific question the jury must decide was not whether the floor was dry or wet, clean or soiled, slippery or not slippery, constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The plaintiff claimed to have proved that in treating the floor on July 2d the defendant\u2019s employees poured the Myco-Sheen into a pail, applied it with a mop and then rubbed it with a dry mop and a yarn mop; that when she reached the part of this floor in question, her right foot slipped leaving a white line on it about one and one-half feet long, and she fell on her back; and that her fall was due to the fact that the floor was wet, slippery and had oil on it which showed on her shoes afterward. The defendant claimed to have proved that Myco-Sheen is a special preparation long and extensively used in the treatment of wooden floors in stores throughout the country; that it was applied to this floor and rubbed with a dry mop and then with a yarn mop as prescribed by the maker\u2019s instructions; that it drys thoroughly in from six to twelve hours; that after it had been applied to this floor there were no puddles or pools remaining; and that at the time and place of the plaintiff\u2019s fall the floor was dry and not slippery. The finding in its entirety makes clear that the crucial question of fact in the case for the jury\u2019s determination, was whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>or not at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s fall the floor was wet and slippery in consequence of the Myco-Sheen which had been applied to it, as presented by these conflicting claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Consequently this was the vital \u201cspecific question\u201d of fact for the jury to decide. It Is manifest, therefore, that the court\u2019s statement to the contrary, as worded and taken by itself, was erroneous. In determining whether this error was harmful to the plaintiff, however, the charge must be considered as a whole. <em>State </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>124 Conn. 554, 566, 1 Atl. (2d) 274; <em>Tappan </em>v. <em>Knox, </em>115 Conn. 508, 511, 162 Atl. 7. Error cannot be predicated upon a detached sentence isolated from the relevant context of the rest of the charge. <em>Kerin </em>v. <em>Baccei, </em>125 Conn. 335, 337, 5 Atl. (2d) 876. That the vital question was whether or not the floor was wet and slippery at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s fall, had been clearly brought out by the court\u2019s recital of the parties\u2019 claims pro and con concerning it, and by its further instruction to the effect that the plaintiff\u2019s version involving a violation of the defendant\u2019s duty of due care as defined by the court, must be established to afford a basis of liability. Had the court qualified its reference to the \u201cspecific question\u201d in the instruction complained of, by including the adjective \u201cultimate,\u201d it would have been unexceptionable. Whether the error was due to its failure so to do through inadvertance in making an intended statement of what was not the ultimate question in contradistinction to what was, which it correctly stated in the sentence that followed, or to other reason, need not be determined. Whatever the cause of the mistake, we are satisfied that the jury could not have been misled as to the essential issue for determination by the words complained of as used in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>the charge as a whole. We conclude that the erroneous instruction did hot constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
