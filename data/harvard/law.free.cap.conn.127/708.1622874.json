The commission in its answer admitted the facts as alleged concerning the citation of the plaintiff to appear before it and the request for continuance but denied that it made an order revoking the plaintiff\u2019s permit on the day of the hearing, and that it had acted improperly. To this answer was attached, as an exhibit, a transcript of the proceedings before the commission. From this transcript, which is not questioned, it appears that the order made by the commission as a result of the hearing on November 20th was that the right to use the permit was revoked \u201cpending a continued hearing on December 18th on a question of reopening,\u201d and the finding of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>court that the commission on that day revoked the permit must be modified to accord with the transcript, which as an exhibit annexed to the answer became a part of the defendant\u2019s pleading. <em>Morehouse </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp., </em>119 Conn. 416, 421, 177 Atl. 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The finding states that on January 15, 1940, the commission held a hearing on the question of reopening the plaintiff\u2019s case, at which the plaintiff and her husband appeared and testified, and that at the conclusion of the hearing the commission \u201callowed the revocation to remain in full force and effect.\u201d The transcript of the proceedings before the commission includes those at the later hearing on January 15, 1940, and it appears therein that the commission stated at the opening of the hearing that it was for the purpose of presenting additional evidence and that it was the understanding that the proceedings of November 20th would be a part of the hearing then beginning; and to this plaintiff\u2019s counsel agreed. At the second hearing, the plaintiff and her husband testified and he stated that beer had been served to certain persons before the permitted hour on the Sunday in question, but claimed that it was given to them as a favor instead of being sold. The statute forbids the sale or consumption or the presence in glasses or other receptacles suitable for the consumption, of liquor before noon on Sunday. It thus appears that the plaintiff\u2019s husband admitted a violation of the law, and no testimony contradicted this. Even if there were technical defects in the proceedings of the commission, it is obvious that if we found error and directed that the case be sent back to it for rehearing, the plaintiff\u2019s permit would be revoked just as it has now been. \u201cWe do not sit to try moot cases. Having now all the facts before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>us, we are not required to rule upon what would be the result of some of them if standing alone.\u201d <em>Mechanics Bank </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>74 Conn. 689, 691, 51 Atl. 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
