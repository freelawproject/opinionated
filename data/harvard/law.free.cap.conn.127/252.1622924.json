The facts are not in dispute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>and have been stipulated by the parties. By the supplemental agreement in each policy the defendant agreed to pay to the plaintiff as beneficiary double indemnity in case of accidental death of the insured, but the contract states: \u201cThis provision shall not cover death resulting directly or indirectly from self-destruction, while sane or insane; ... or from poisoning or asphyxiation. The Company shall have the right and opportunity to examine the body and make an autopsy unless prohibited by law.\u201d The insured was in good health and complied with all provisions of the policy. He died an accidental death caused by poisoning under these circumstances: About noon on May 16, 1938, he ate a meal of pork chops, gravy, string beans, potatoes, bread, butter and beer in a restaurant in New Haven. Almost immediately he became nauseated and vomited. Soon after he was taken violently ill and was removed in a state of collapse to a hospital, where he died at 8.40 p. m. the same day. An autopsy and chemical analysis of the contents of his stomach and intestines showed that death was due to poisoning by arsenic and barium salts in quantities more than sufficient to kill a human being. These chemicals are two active ingredients in a common rat poison known as \u201cRough on Rats.\u201d The taking of the poison was accidental and not for medicinal purposes, and the insured did not consume it consciously, or intentionally. The defendant paid upon each policy the $2500 life insurance specified apart from the double indemnity. The court gave judgment for the defendant. The sole question for determination is whether the defendant is absolved from the further payment of double indemnity by virtue of the provision above quoted contained in the supplemental agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The plaintiff contends that the words \u201cdeath resulting . . . from poisoning,\u201d definitive of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>exemption from liability are ambiguous, and that therefore the familiar rule that where there is room for two constructions, the words used should be interpreted most strongly against the insurer applies. <em>Rinaldi </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>118 Conn. 419, 423, 172 Atl. 777; <em>Morehouse </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp., </em>119 Conn. 416, 426, 177 Atl. 568. Upon the facts of the present case, however, the words quoted disclose no ambiguity warranting resort to this principle. The death of the insured was beyond question caused by poisoning within the common and ordinary meaning of that word. It was with this meaning that the word \u201cpoisoning\u201d in the exemption was used by the parties to this contract of insurance. <em>Price-Williams </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>101 Fed. (2d) 482, 484; <em>Equitable Life Assurance Society </em>v. <em>Hemenover, </em>100 Col. 231, 236, 67 Pac. (2d) 80, 82, 110 A. L. R. 1270, Note 1278; 2 A. L. R. 57, Note; <em>Hahn </em>v. <em>Home Life Ins. Co., </em>169 Tenn. 232, 84 S. W. (2d) 361; <em>Porto </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>120 Conn. 196, 200, 180 Atl. 289; <em>Aschenbrenner </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>292 U. S. 80, 85, 54 Sup. Ct. 590. Accordingly the express and positive policy exemption from liability for death \u201cfrom poisoning,\u201d bars the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery. <em>Urian </em>v. <em>Scranton Life Ins. Co., </em>310 Pa. St. 144, 165 Atl. 21; <em>United Fidelity Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Roach </em>(Tex. Civ. App.) 63 S. W. (2d) 723. Two of the cases relied upon by the plaintiff as authority to the contrary, are clearly distinguishable when under the above rule the words of exemption employed are accorded their common and ordinary meaning. In one of them, instead of a poisoning by arsenic consumed as here, the death was due to an overdose of medicine <em>(Equitable Life Assurance </em>case, supra), while in the other it resulted from the eating of tainted food <em>(Hahn </em>case, supra), and in both it was held that death was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>not due to poisoning within the common conception of the term or the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The plaintiff further contends that the exemption should be construed as inapplicable to bar recovery because the poison was not taken by the voluntary, conscious or intelligent act of the insured. In support of this contention she relies upon the case of <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>112 N. Y. 472, 20 N. E. 347, and a number of cases since decided reaching a like conclusion upon the reasoning and authority of that decision. That was an action upon an accident policy for the death of the insured caused by breathing, while asleep, the atmosphere of a room filled with illuminating gas. The terms of the policy exempted the defendant company from liability for \u201cdeath . . . caused ... by the taking of poison, ... or inhaling of gas.\u201d In holding the defendant liable the court said (p. 478): \u201cin expressing its intention not to be liable for death from \u2018inhaling of gas,\u2019 the company can only be understood to mean a voluntary and intelligent act by the insured, and not an involuntary and unconscious act. ... To inhale gas requires an act of volition on the person\u2019s part before the danger is incurred . . . if the exception is to cover all cases where death is caused by the presence of gas, there would be no reason for using the word \u2018inhale.\u2019 If the policy had said that it was not to extend to any death caused wholly or in part by gas, it would have expressed precisely wdiat the appellant [defendant] now says is meant by the present phrase, and there could have been no room for doubt or mistake.\u201d The exemption provision of the policy in all but one of the cases cited by the plaintiff to this point was like that held in the <em>Paul </em>case to involve the doing of some voluntary act by the insured. For example: In <em>Pickett </em>v. <em>Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>144 Pa. St. 79, 91, 22 Atl. 871, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the words are <em>\u201cinhalation </em>of gas\u201d; in <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>160 Ill. 642, 43 N. E. 765, \u201ctaking poison\u201d; in <em>Dezell </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., </em>176 Mo. 253, 285, 75 S. W. 1102, \u201cpoison or anything accidentally or otherwise taken, administered, absorbed or inhaled\u201d; and in <em>Lowenstein </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., </em>88 Fed. 474, 479, affirmed 97 Fed. 17, 19, and in <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>161 Ill. 632, 44 N. E. 283, wording included in that of the <em>Dezell </em>case. As is clear from the above quotation from the court\u2019s opinion in the <em>Paul </em>case it is the use in the exemption clause of the word \u201cinhale,\u201d construed as calling for voluntary and intelligent action by the insured, which is made the basis of its conclusion that words are to be read into the policy which render the defendant liable for death ensuing upon his involuntary and unconscious act in inhaling gas. It is equally clear, however, that had the word \u201cinhaling\u201d been omitted, so that the clause read \u201cdeath caused by gas,\u201d the court would have held it effective to excuse the defendant from liability. See <em>Lowenstein </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 476; <em>Early </em>v. <em>Standard Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>113 Mich. 58, 71 N. W. 500; <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Inter-State Business Men\u2019s Accident Asso., </em>177 Iowa 449, 159 N. W. 203, and 184 Iowa 1124, 169 N. W. 448, 2 A. L. R. 57. That is the situation presented in the case before us by the wording \u201cdeath resulting . . . from poisoning.\u201d The only case cited by the plaintiff with an exemption provision analogous to that in this case is <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ayers, </em>217 Ill. 390, 75 N. E. 506. The words there were \u201cdeath . . . resulting . . . from any gas or vapor.\u201d The court in rendering judgment for the plaintiff relied upon the <em>Paul </em>case and the cases following it, for authority, but disregarded the difference in wording of the exemption clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The statement of the court in concluding its opinion in Urian, v. <em>Scranton Life Ins. Co., </em>supra (p. 154), well states the rule which is in accord with the authorities and conclusive of the present case, in these words: \u201cIt is plain to us that where, as here, an accident policy, whose language is clear and unambiguous, states as an exception from liability that which is simply a cause, without any reference therein to a possible act or omission to act by the insured or any other person, which might be, as respects that cause, either intentional or unintentional, no recovery can be had in cases where the injury or death is due to that cause, unless there is, in the policy, some other provision requiring a different conclusion to be reached.\u201d No other policy provision in the case before us requires a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
