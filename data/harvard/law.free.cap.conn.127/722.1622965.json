The defendant demurred because neither the administrator, heirs or personal representatives of Francener were made parties. The demurrer was overruled and this action was assigned as error. Errors in the charge were also assigned but these are not before us since there is no finding in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The demurrer admitted facts well pleaded. <em>State\u2019s Attorney </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Branford, </em>59 Conn. 402, 411, 22 Atl. 336. It therefore admitted the allegation that the defendant was Francener\u2019s sole heir-at-law. This might have been so. General Statutes, \u00a7 5156. Title to intestate lands vests at once in the heirs \u201csubject only to such rights as might arise out of the need to come upon them to satisfy debts and expenses of administration, and distribution was not necessary to confer title.\u201d <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>August, </em>109 Conn. 452, 456, 146 Atl. 831; <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Morgillo, </em>127 Conn. 161, 168, 14 Atl. (2d) 724. Extraneous facts may exist which would disclose a deficiency of necessary parties but these could not be taken advantage of by demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
