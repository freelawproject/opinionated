It is then alleged, as a conclusion of law, that the plaintiff has exclusive rights until another company has secured overlapping franchise rights and complied with the statutory requirements. It seeks an injunction restraining the defendants from digging a well, laying water distribution pipes, or transacting any water business within the district covered by its franchise, and from furnishing water to or soliciting customers now served by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The defendants demurred upon the grounds that the franchise of the plaintiff confers no exclusive rights, that the damage claimed is damnum absque injuria and that the amended complaint does not show that any legal or equitable right of the plaintiff has been or is about to be invaded by the defendants. We are confronted with the same difficulties that beset the trial court, which pointed out that it does not appear from the complaint whether the defendants are supplying water individually or in some joint capacity, and particularly that the source of supply and the means of distribution are not alleged. It sustained the demurrer upon all grounds. We do not know, nor can we speculate as to what the defendants are doing. The complaint does not state facts upon the basis of which it can be determined whether any rights of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>tiff have been or are about to be invaded. The demurrer was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
