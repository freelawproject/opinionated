O\u2019Neill, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Defendant-appellant, Billy Joe Henton, appeals from the judgment and imposition of sentence rendered by the Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas upon a jury verdict finding appellant guilty on two counts of aggravated trafficking in drugs with a prior felony drug abuse conviction, in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1), a felony of the second degree. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">On May 13, 1995 and July 13, 1995, agents of the Ashtabula County Narcotics Task Force (\u201cACNTF\u201d), with the assistance of a confidential informant, conducted controlled drug buys in the area of West 32d Street in Ashtabula, Ohio. As a result of this operation, appellant, on August 15, 1995, was indicted on two counts of aggravated trafficking in drugs in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1). The level of the felony was enhanced from a third-degree felony to a second-degree felony, pursuant to R.C. 2925.03(C)(1)(a) and (c), because of specifications that appellant committed the offense within one thousand feet of the boundaries of a school and that he had previously been convicted of a felony drug abuse offense. On November 2,1995, appellant entered a plea of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">A jury trial commenced on February 21, 1996. Just prior to trial, the state of Ohio dismissed the specification for selling within one thousand feet of a school. Appellant attempted to stipulate to one prior drug trafficking charge and requested that the trial court prohibit the state from introducing any evidence of a second felony drug abuse offense because such evidence was of \u201cno probative value\u201d and highly prejudicial to appellant\u2019s defense. The state refused to accept appellant\u2019s stipulation and the trial court permitted appellee to introduce evidence of appellant\u2019s two prior drug trafficking convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">At trial, Bruce Coxson, working as a confidential informant for ACNTF, testified to his encounters with appellant on May 13, 1995 and July 13, 1995. As standard operating procedure for ACNTF, Coxson was equipped with a listening device which allowed ACNTF agents to tap\u00e9-record Coxson\u2019s transactions with suspected drug dealers. A tape recording of the two transactions between Coxson and appellant was introduced into evidence at appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">On May 13, 1995, Coxson drove to the area of West 32d Street and Superior in Ashtabula, Ohio. Appellant walked up to Coxson\u2019s v\u00e9hicle and said, \u2018What is happening, man?\u201d Coxson asked if appellant had \u201cthree for fifty,\u201d street talk, Coxson testified, for three rocks of crack cocaine for fifty dollars. Appellant responded that, while he did not have any crack on him, he could fulfill Coxson\u2019s request. Coxson gave appellant $50 with which to make the purchase. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>took Coxson\u2019s money, walked into a nearby bar and did not return. No drugs were sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Coxson\u2019s next encounter with appellant occurred on July 13, 1995, in the same area as the first transaction. Coxson indicated to appellant that \u201c[he] needfed] some\u201d and would take \u201cthree for fifty.\u201d Appellant responded \u201cokay.\u201d Coxson handed appellant $50 and appellant gave Coxson a plastic bag containing three objects. The tape recording of this meeting revealed that a third person, later identified as one Tyrone Hill, witnessed the transaction between Coxson and appellant and told Coxson that the items in the plastic bag contained peanuts. Hill further stated that Coxson should have purchased the \u201creal thing\u201d from him. Tests performed on the three items in the plastic bag found no evidence of a controlled substance. It appeared that appellant had, in fact, sold Coxson three peanuts.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Officers from ACNTF described the area where Coxson attempted to purchase drugs from appellant as an \u201copen-air drug market\u201d where a vehicle stopping alongside the curb will be approached by individuals attempting to sell drugs. One agent, Robert Nicholson, described these encounters as brief, with conversations kept as short as possible to reduce the risk that a conversation would be tape-recorded by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">To establish that appellant had previously been convicted of a felony drug abuse offense, the state introduced certified copies of two judgment entries, timestamped August 17, 1993 and May 13, 1994, which indicated that appellant had two prior convictions for aggravated trafficking in drugs. Appellant stipulated as to the authenticity of the judgment entries and further stipulated that he was the named defendant with respect to the May 13, 1994 conviction. The state presented no evidence that appellant was the named defendant as to the August 17,1993 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Appellant chose not to testify and did not present any evidence on his behalf. Following the close of evidence, the jury, on February 22, 1995, returned a verdict finding appellant guilty on both counts of aggravated trafficking in drugs and further finding that appellant had a prior conviction for a felony drug abuse offense. Appellant was sentenced to serve consecutive terms of incarceration of between three and fifteen years on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal and now advances three assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">\u201c1. The [trial] court erred in allowing the prosecutor to admit two previous convictions into evidence, rather than permitting only evidence of one conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>\u201c2. A mistrial was the appropriate remedy for the prosecutor\u2019s improper inference in closing argument that appellant\u2019s previous convictions predisposed him to drug trafficking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">\u201c3. Whether appellant was properly convicted under R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) of an \u2018offer to sell,\u2019 when he simply agreed to informant\u2019s \u2018offer to buy\u2019?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In the first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred by allowing evidence to be presented of appellant\u2019s two prior drug trafficking convictions. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Appellant was indicted on two counts of aggravated trafficking in drugs with a specification that appellant had previously been convicted of a felony drug abuse offense. The version of R.C. 2925.03 then in effect provided that \u201c[n]o person shall knowingly * * * [s]ell or offer to sell a controlled substance.\u201d R.C. 2925.03(C)(1)(c) provided that aggravated trafficking in drugs was a felony of the third degree unless the offender had previously been convicted of a felony drug abuse offense, in which case the charged offense was a felony of the second degree. Thus, a prior conviction for a felony drug abuse offense elevates the degree of the later offense and is an element of the subsequent offense which the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>State v. Henderson </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 171, 173, 12 O.O.3d 177, 178, 389 N.E.2d 494, 495; <em>State v. Dowdy </em>(June 14, 1996), Lake App. No. 95-L-140, unreported, 1996 WL 648833.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Appellant acknowledges that the state is required to prove the existence of <em>one </em>prior felony drug abuse offense conviction as an element of the offense charged. However, appellant asserts that evidence of a <em>second </em>felony drug abuse offense conviction was superfluous and highly prejudicial to his defense. Appellant now argues, as he did at trial, that evidence of his second drug trafficking conviction should have been excluded by the trial court because the probative value of such evidence was <em>\u201csubstantially </em>outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Evid.R. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Evidentiary rulings are within the broad discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Graham </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 350, 352, 12 O.O.3d 317, 318, 390 N.E.2d 805, 806-807. \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. <em>Steiner v. Custer </em>(1940), 137 Ohio St. 448 [19 O.O. 148], 31 N.E.2d 855; <em>Conner v. Conner </em>(1959), 170 Ohio St. 85 [9 O.O.2d 480], 162 N.E.2d 852; <em>Chester Township v. Geauga [Cty.] Budget Comm. </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 372 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>[2 O.O.3d 484], 358 N.E.2d 610.\u201d <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157-158, 16 O.O.3d 169, 173, 404 N.E.2d 144, 149. Accord <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 482-483, 450 N.E.2d 1140, 1141-1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The record reveals that the state introduced certified copies of two judgment entries, dated August 17, 1993 and May 13, 1994, which indicated that appellant had two prior convictions for aggravated trafficking in drugs. Appellant stipulated that he was the named defendant in the May 13, 1994 judgment entry offered by the state. The trial court ruled that the prejudicial effect caused by the evidence of appellant\u2019s second conviction did not outweigh the probative value of the evidence because proof of a prior conviction was \u201can essential element that the state has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt and the jury might, for some reason, find that one conviction was valid or was in effect and the other wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Were this a case where a defendant refused to concede that he had previously been convicted of a felony drug abuse offense, we would refuse to establish a rule that would require the state to elect a single prior offense from which to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, this necessary element of its case. The state was required to prove the existence of a prior felony drug abuse offense conviction in order to elevate the charged offense of aggravated drug trafficking to a second-degree felony under R.C. 2925.03(C)(1)(c). While the trial court noted the possible prejudicial effect that proof of appellant\u2019s two prior drug trafficking convictions could have in the eyes of the jury, the trial court refused to hamper the state in establishing an essential element of its case by limiting the prosecution to proof of just one such prior conviction. <em>State v. Marcum </em>(Dec. 23, 1996), Butler App. No. CA96-03-049, unreported, 1996 WL 732453; see, <em>e.g., State v. Adams </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 295, 297, 525 N.E.2d 1361, 1362-1363. As the trial court correctly noted, the jury might find that one conviction was not valid. However, compounding the problem of allowing the state to present evidence of appellant\u2019s two prior drug trafficking convictions is the offer by appellant to stipulate to the existence of one prior felony drug abuse offense conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">On March 13,1997, approximately one week before appellate arguments in this matter, appellant filed a notice of submission of supplemental authority. In support of his argument that the admission of two prior convictions was in error, appellant cited a recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Old Chief v. United States </em>(1997), 519 U.S. 172, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574. A spirited debate ensued at oral arguments on this matter as to the applicability of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Old Chief </em>to appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">In <em>Old Chief, </em>a decision the trial court did not have the benefit of at the time of its ruling, a defendant was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of Section 922(a)(1), Title 18, U.S. Code. The defendant did not seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>to preclude the jury from determining the prior-conviction element of the charged crime. Rather, the defendant, as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>offered to stipulate to the prior conviction so the jury would not be prejudiced by being informed that he had previously been convicted of an unrelated felony drug offense. The Assistant United States Attorney refused to join in the stipulation, arguing that he had a right to prove his case his own way. The District Court agreed stating, \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want to stipulate, he doesn\u2019t have to.\u201d At trial, the government introduced the judgment record of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction, and the jury found him guilty. 519 U.S. at---, 117 S.Ct. at 647-648, 136 L.Ed.2d at 584-585.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The United States Supreme Court considered the propriety of allowing evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction record for the sole purpose of allowing the prosecution to prove the prior felony element of the charged offense, even though the defendant offered to stipulate to a prior felony conviction. The principal issue to be decided, the court stated, was \u201cthe scope of a trial judge\u2019s discretion under [Federal] Rule [of Evidence] 403, which authorizes exclusion of relevant evidence when its \u2018probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u2019 \u201d 519 U.S. at-, 117 S.Ct. at 650, 136 L.Ed.2d at 587.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court held that because the defendant had offered to stipulate to the prior conviction, \u201cthe only reasonable conclusion was that the risk of unfair prejudice did substantially outweigh the discounted probative value of the record of conviction, and <em>it was an abuse of discretion to admit the record when an admission was available.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 519 U.S. at-, 117 S.Ct. at 655, 136 L.Ed.2d at 594-595.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">The case <em>sub judice </em>is nearly identical to <em>Old Chief. </em>While we recognize that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence has no mandatory authority over our interpretation of the Ohio Rules of Evidence, we are not prepared to state that Ohio Evid.R. 403, nearly identical to its federal counterpart, would allow the risk of a verdict tainted by improper considerations. Because appellant offered to stipulate to the existence of a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>felony drug abuse conviction, the trial court abused its discretion when it rejected the stipulation and allowed the prosecution to present evidence of appellant\u2019s two prior drug trafficking convictions <em>solely </em>to prove the element of an offense which requires proof of a prior felony drug abuse conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Additionally, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s error was harmless in this ease. The evidence against appellant was strong, but not so overwhelming for us to say that the outcome of the trial would not have been different but for the error. Appellant sold three peanuts to a confidential informant. The jury may not have believed that appellant offered to sell cocaine without the improper inferences associated from evidence that appellant had two prior convictions for the exact offense for which he now faces charges. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">In the second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred by failing to grant a mistrial because the prosecutor improperly commented on appellant\u2019s prior drug trafficking convictions. Specifically, appellant contends that the following statement made by the assistant prosecutor during closing argument constituted prosecutorial misconduct and warranted the granting of a mistrial:</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\u201c[Tjhere\u2019s evidence that the vehicle pulled up to the curb, because that\u2019s what you do if you want to buy drugs. You pull up to the curb. Who approaches the car? The defendant approaches the car in an area where drugs were sold because he was willing to sell cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\"><em>a </em>\u2021 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">\u201cNow, I ask you, number one, who is the person that is standing in the area on two Saturday nights around 9:30 in the evening? Who is the person that is standing in the area of West 32nd Street? The defendant. Who is the person that is standing in the open air drug trafficking market? The defendant. <em>Who is the person who has the two aggravated drug trafficking convictions? Right here. The defendant. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Appellant\u2019s attorney immediately objected to the assistant prosecutor\u2019s reference to appellant\u2019s prior drug trafficking convictions. The trial court sustained the objection and provided a curative instruction, telling the jury to disregard the last comment. Following the assistant prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, defense counsel requested a mistrial. The trial court, while acknowledging that the state\u2019s argument went too far, determined that the comment was not so prejudicial as to warrant a mistrial. The trial court noted that it immediately ordered the jury to disregard the comment and that the court\u2019s final instructions would clarify the manner in which the jury could use appellant\u2019s prior drug trafficking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>convictions. Appellant contends that the trial court erred by denying his request for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that \u201c[t]he test regarding prosecutorial misconduct in closing arguments is whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 318, 470 N.E.2d 883, 885. Accord <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165, 555 N.E.2d 293, 299-300. Similarly, this court has stated that a proper review of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">\u201cUnless the statement made by the prosecutor in argument to a jury is so misleading or untruthful that the defendant\u2019s rights are prejudiced, which deprives him of a fair and impartial trial, the claimed error cannot be considered prejudicial. In addition, in order to consider whether a prosecutor\u2019s statement in argument to a jury is prejudicial, one must consider the cumulative effect of the comments made to the jury.\u201d <em>State v. Daugert </em>(June 29, 1990), Lake App. No. 89-L-14-091, unreported, at 4-5, 1990 WL 94835, quoting <em>State v. Washington </em>(July 23, 1985), Franklin App. No. 84-AP-1079, unreported, 1985 WL 10085. Accord <em>State v. Said </em>(Mar. 26, 1993), Lake App. No. 92-L-018, unreported, at 11, 1993 WL 130097.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Furthermore, although the granting or denial of a motion for a mistrial rests within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion, when the motion alleges prosecutorial misconduct, we must determine whether the assistant prosecutor\u2019s comments deprived appellant of a fair trial. <em>State v. Saunders </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 355, 358, 648 N.E.2d 587, 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">After a review of the record, we agree with the trial court that the assistant prosecutor\u2019s reference to appellant\u2019s prior convictions was improper. Indeed, the statements made by the assistant prosecutor acted only to highlight the prejudice appellant faced, as discussed in appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, from the prosecution\u2019s refusal to accept appellant\u2019s offer to concede the fact that he has a prior felony drug conviction. However, based on the totality of the assistant prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, we reject appellant\u2019s argument that the isolated statement <em>in and of itself </em>deprived appellant of a fair and impartial trial. The trial court immediately sustained defense counsel\u2019s objection to the statement and instructed the jury to disregard the statement. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">In the third assignment of error, appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction under R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) because he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\u201coffer to sell\u201d drugs, but rather \u201csimply agreed\u201d to the confidential informant\u2019s \u201coffer to buy\u201d drugs. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">As previously noted, R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) states, \u201cNo person shall knowingly * * * [s]ell or offer to sell a controlled substance * * *.\u201d Recognizing that drug dealers do not conduct business in precise legal terms, the Second District Court of Appeals has defined the term \u201coffer to sell\u201d as it pertains to drug transactions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">\u201c[W]e conclude that, for purposes of R.C. 2925.03(A), the phrase, \u2018offer to sell a controlled substance,\u2019 simply means to declare one\u2019s readiness or willingness to sell a controlled substance or to present a controlled substance for acceptance or rejection. Furthermore, the issue of whether a defendant has knowingly made an offer to sell a controlled substance in any given case must be determined by examining the totality of the circumstances, including \u2018the dialogue and course of conduct of the accused.\u2019 <em>[State v.] Patterson </em>[(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 445,] 447 [23 O.O.3d 394, 395], 432 N.E.2d 802 [803-804].\u201d <em>State v. Burton </em>(Mar. 31, 1995), Greene App. No. 94-CA-13, unreported, 1995 WL 137054. Accord <em>State v. McKenzie </em>(Sept. 12, 1996), Jefferson App. No. 96-JE-2, unreported, 1996 WL 529520.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>sufficient evidence was presented at trial from which the jury could reasonably infer that appellant was offering to sell a controlled substance in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1). Appellant\u2019s conduct, greeting automobiles that pulled up to the curb of an \u201copen-air drug market\u201d together with statements that he could provide ACNTF\u2019s confidential informant with cocaine, conveyed appellant\u2019s willingness to enter into a drug transaction. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">As appellant\u2019s first assignment of error has merit, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b550-10\">Ford, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b550-11\">Nader, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-10\">.

When R.C. 2941.142 is applicable, once the accused requests such a hearing, the trial court must honor the request. <em>State v.

However, an accused does not have the right to a bifurcated hearing pursuant to R.C. 2941.142 when a prior conviction elevates the degree of the offense rather than solely increasing the penalty. <em>State v. Dowdy </em>(June 14, 1996), Lake App. No. 95-L-140, unreported, at 3, 1996 WL 648833.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Therefore, in the present case, had the prior conviction solely enhanced appellant\u2019s penalty, appellant would have had the opportunity to avoid presentation of the prior conviction to the jury by requesting a bifurcated proceeding as provided in R.C. 2941.142. Thus, under those circumstances, a defendant would have the ability to avoid the prejudice claimed here, and if the defendant did not pursue bifurcation, invited error could well obtain. If that were the case, I would vote to affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
