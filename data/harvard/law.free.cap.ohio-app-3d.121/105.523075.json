Jarvis, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Municipal Court finding him guilty on his no contest plea to assault in violation of Dublin Ordinance 537.03; defendant contends that the trial court erred in not dismissing his case for violation of his speedy trial rights under R.C. 2945.71(A). Because the defendant was not brought to trial within the time period allowed by R.C. 2945.71(A), we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">On July 19, 1993, Rhonda Price filed a complaint in the Franklin County Municipal Court. The complaint alleged that on July 17, 1993,' defendant assaulted her son, Timothy Price, by striking Timothy on the left side of his face, resulting in injury to Timothy\u2019s face and jaw. Defendant was served with summons on July 23, 1993. On August 16, 1993, defendant entered a not guilty plea and did not waive his speedy trial rights. On the same day, however, the prosecution requested that the assault charge under R.C. 2903.13(A) be dismissed for a possible future felony indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-15\">As the parties agree, on June 16, 1995, Rhonda Price refiled the assault charges under Dublin City Ordinance 537.03 in the Dublin Mayor\u2019s Court. Summons was served on defendant on June 26, 1995; the case was set for pretrial on July 12, 1995, and for trial on July 19, 1995. Defendant then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>requested a continuance and waived his speedy trial rights; the case ultimately was reset for trial on March 20,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">On the day of trial, defendant requested that the charges be dismissed for violation of his speedy trial rights prior to his waiver. Specifically, defendant contended that to determine his speedy trial rights, the mayor\u2019s court was required to couple the \u201ctwenty-seven\u201d days the charges were pending in the municipal court with the days the charges were pending in the mayor\u2019s court; defendant asserted that the sum of those days resulted in defendant\u2019s not being brought to trial within the thirty days required by R.C. 2945.71(A). Not persuaded by defendant\u2019s motion, the Dublin Mayor\u2019s Court, on March 20, 1996, found defendant guilty of the assault charge and sentenced him accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Defendant requested a trial <em>de novo </em>in the Franklin County Municipal Court; there, on May 23, 1996, defendant orally renewed the motion to dismiss he originally had made in the Dublin Mayor\u2019s Court, contending that his speedy trial rights had been violated. After allowing the state to respond to the issue, the trial court overruled the motion. Rather than proceed with trial, defendant entered a no contest plea to the charges, and the trial court sentenced him. Defendant appeals, assigning two errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\u201cI. The trial court erred by refusing to review the action of the mayor in the earlier proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\u201cII. The trial court erred by not granting appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Because defendant\u2019s two assignments of error are interrelated, we address them jointly. Together they assert that his conviction should be reversed and the charge dismissed because the Dublin Mayor\u2019s Court failed to bring him to trial within the time limits set forth in R.C. 2945.71(A). The issue underlying defendant\u2019s assigned errors is whether the days defendant\u2019s case was pending in the Franklin County Municipal Court in July and August 1993 must be combined with the time the refiled charges were pending in the Dublin Mayor\u2019s Court. R.C. 2945.71 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-10\">\u201c(A) A person against whom a charge is <em>pending in a court not of record, </em>or against whom a charge of minor misdemeanor is pending in a court of record, shall be brought to trial within thirty days after his arrest or the service of summons.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">While interpretation of R.C. 2945.71 in the context of this case is one of first impression, previous cases provide some guidance. Generally, the entry of <em>nolle prosequi </em>on a misdemeanor charge tolls the running of statutory speedy trial time until the service of summons on a second misdemeanor charge arising out of the same conduct. <em>Westlake v. Cougill </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 230, 10 O.O.3d 382, 383 N.E.2d 599. Similarly, the time period between <em>nolle prosequi </em>of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>felony charge and reindictment is excluded in computing speedy trial time. <em>State v. Spratz </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 61, 62, 12 O.O.3d 77, 388 N.E.2d 751, 752, fn. 2. However, in both instances \u201ccredit was given the accused for the period of time the charges based on the same conduct were pending prior to entry of the <em>nolle </em>prosequi.\u201d <em>State v. Bonarrigo </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 7, 10, 16 O.O.3d 4, 6, 402 N.E.2d 530, 534 (holding that where a \u201cprosecutor obtains a felony indictment, based upon the same conduct as was a previously <em>nolled, </em>lesser-included misdemeanor charge, the time within which the accused shall be brought to trial pursuant to R.C. 2945.71 <em>et seq. </em>consists of whatever residue remains from the 270 day period set forth in R.C. 2945.71[C] after deducting the speedy trial time expended prior to the <em>nolle </em>prosequi,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 11, 16 O.O.3d at 7, 402 N.E.2d at 534). Those cases suggest that to determine defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights under R.C. 2945.71(A), the time the assault charge against defendant was pending in the Franklin County Municipal Court prior to dismissal in August 1993 must be added to the time it was pending in the Dublin Mayor\u2019s Court prior to defendant\u2019s waiving his speedy trial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Despite the foregoing, the state urges that we seek guidance from <em>Brecksville v. Cook </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 53, 661 N.E.2d 706, which held that when a case is transferred to the municipal court from mayor\u2019s court pursuant to R.C. 1905.032, the period of delay necessary to the removal is the time from arrest or summons to the date the mayor\u2019s court certifies the case to the municipal court; under <em>Brecksville, </em>that period of delay is not included in calculating speedy trial rights in the municipal court following transfer. The state suggests that the converse of <em>Brecksville </em>is true: the time a case is pending in municipal court should not be counted in calculating speedy trial rights in the mayor\u2019s court under R.C. 2945.71(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The state\u2019s reliance on <em>Brecksville </em>is misplaced. <em>Brecksville </em>was premised on a defendant\u2019s transfer under R.C. 1905.032 being in the nature of a removal under R.C. 2945.72(F), which extends the time for bringing an accused to trial under Ohio\u2019s statutory speedy trial rights. Here, the need to refile charges in the Dublin Mayor\u2019s Court was not because of any action, or even inaction of defendant, but because the state dismissed the original charges filed in the Franklin County Municipal Court in 1993 and Price decided to refile the same charges but in mayor\u2019s court rather than the municipal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Instead, <em>State v. Engert </em>(July 31, 1980), Franklin App. No. 80AP-56, unreported, is instructive. In <em>Enger\u00ed </em>the court found that the days that charges were pending in a mayor\u2019s court prior to the prosecution\u2019s dismissing them were to be counted in calculating speedy trial time on charges refiled in the municipal court, \u201cas the case was not transferred to Franklin County Municipal Court, but voluntarily dismissed and refiled by the State. See <em>State v. Bonarrigo </em>[62 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>St.2d 7, 16 O.O.3d 4, 402 N.E.2d 530].\u201d If, as the state suggests, we apply the converse to this case, then the days the charge was pending against defendant in municipal court in 1993 must be counted in calculating defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights under R.C. 2945.71(A) in mayor\u2019s court, as the state points to no provision of R.C. 2945.72 which is implicated so as to extend the time for bringing defendant to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">In the final analysis, repugnant and regrettable as the alleged facts are, they do not dictate the result in this case. Rather, regardless of the facts, the statutory speedy trial provisions control. R.C. 2945.71(A) required that defendant be tried within thirty days in the Dublin Mayor\u2019s Court. Under the rationale of <em>Westlake </em>and <em>Engert, </em>the days the same charge, premised on the same facts, was pending in the Franklin County Municipal Court must be included in calculating defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights in the mayor\u2019s court. While the parties disagree about the exact number of days the case was pending in the municipal court before it was dismissed, the record suggests a minimum of twenty-four days. Because the charges in the mayor\u2019s court were pending for more than six days before defendant waived his speedy trial rights, the Dublin Mayor\u2019s Court should have granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss under R.C. 2945.71(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">For the foregoing reasons, defendant\u2019s two assignments of error are sustained to the extent indicated, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the charge against defendant for failure to comply with R.C. 2945.71(A) in the mayor\u2019s court. See <em>Newark v. O\u2019Brien </em>(Feb. 1, 1993), Licking App. No. 92-CA-77, unreported, 1993 WL 35592.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-8\">Bowman, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b149-9\">Tyack, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b149-10\">Tyack, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AEH\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">I respectfully disagree with the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">R.C. 2945.71 requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-13\">\u201c(A) A person against whom a charge is pending in a court not of record, or against whom a charge of minor misdemeanor is pending in a court of record, shall be brought to trial within thirty days after his arrest or the service of summons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>\u201c(B) A person against whom a charge of misdemeanor, other than a. minor misdemeanor, is pending in a court or record, shall be brought to trial:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">\u201c(1) Within forty-five days after his arrest or the service of summons, if the offense charged is a misdemeanor of the third or fourth degree, or other misdemeanor for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for not more than sixty days[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The statute does not address the situation presented when a charge is pending for a while in a court of record and later pending in a court not of record, such as a mayor\u2019s court. The statute also fails to address the situation where a charge is pending in a court not of record and then is pending in a court of record. The statute, instead, places restrictions on the time a case may be pending within each of the two types of courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">I see absolutely no reason to extend the time restrictions set forth in R.C. 2945.71 beyond what the legislature contemplated, as demonstrated by the actual wording of the statute. I believe that we should respect the words and intentions of the legislature when its advises us in R.C. 2901.04:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">\u201c(A) Sections of the Revised Code defining offenses or penalties shall be strictly construed against the state, and liberally construed in favor of the accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">\u201c(B) Rules of criminal procedure and sections of the Revised Code providing for criminal procedure shall be construed so as to effect the fair, impartial, speedy, and sure administration of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">R.C. 2945.71 does not define an offense or penalty. Therefore, it shall be construed \u201cso as to effect the fair, impartial, speedy, and sure administration of justice.\u201d The majority opinion \u201cconstrues\u201d R.C. 2945.71 beyond the words of the statute in such a way that the speedy processing of cases is encouraged, but fairness, sureness, and justice are lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">A reference to the facts underlying this case proves my point. Jarvis was golfing at Muirfield County Club when a ten-year-old boy yelled \u201cfore,\u201d which distracted Jarvis during his putting. A few minutes later, Jarvis approached the ten-year-old and a friend, slapped the boy and asked him, \u201cHow would you like it if I cut off your head and * * * down your throat?\u201d Jarvis then returned to his golf game. The child was traumatized both physically and emotionally. Dismissing the criminal charge based upon these facts dispenses with fairness, sureness, and justice. The dismissal does not dispense any of the three.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">For similar reasons, I believe that our earlier case of <em>State v. Engert </em>(July 31, 1980), Franklin App. No. 80AP-56, unreported, was wrongly decided. The panel in <em>Engert </em>made the same mistake which a majority of this panel makes, namely, adding together the days charges were pending in two different types of court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Again, R.C. 2945.71 places limits only on the amount of time a charge is pending within a given type of court \u2014 court of record or court not of record. R.C. 2945.71 does not address the situation presented as the result of the overlapping jurisdiction of mayor\u2019s courts and courts of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The result reached by the majority opinion is incorrect for other reasons. The record before us is silent as to what information was presented to the presiding official in Dublin Mayor\u2019s Court. We know that before Jarvis was found guilty of assault in Dublin Mayor\u2019s Court, his counsel filed a written motion seeking dismissal. We do not know what, if any, evidence was presented to the Dublin Mayor\u2019s Court to demonstrate the alleged speedy trial problem. We, therefore, are not in a position to say that the Dublin Mayor\u2019s Court erred, especially since what record we have indicates that counsel for Jarvis promised to \u201cwaive time and continue case\u201d less than thirty days after the case was filed in Dublin Mayor\u2019s Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Further, no evidence was presented to the judge of the Franklin County Municipal Court who handled this case after the conviction in Mayor\u2019s Court. The parties argued theories, but did not develop the record necessary for an appellate court to overturn the trial court rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">For all the above reasons, I believe that the majority opinion is incorrect in its reversal of the conviction here. I, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
