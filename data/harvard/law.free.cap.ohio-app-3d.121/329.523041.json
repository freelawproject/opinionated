Wise, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">This appeal is from the Licking County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, regarding the estate of Mary C. Burton, who died on February 26, 1994, in Covington, Louisiana. Appellee Judith Epler had moved the decedent to Louisiana on December 3, 1993, less than three months prior to her death. Appellee filed a probate proceeding in St. Tammany Parish, in Covington, Louisiana, on July 20, 1994. She did not serve notice. Appellee filed a \u201cDetailed Descriptive List of Property\u201d with the probate court, in which she indicated the decedent had only $7,348.25 worth of personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">Appellant Douglas Sayer (\u201cSayer\u201d), the decedent\u2019s grandson, objected to the estate being administered in Louisiana. On April 2, 1996, the probate court conducted a hearing and determined that it did not have jurisdiction over this matter because the decedent had been domiciled in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">Sayer opened an estate on behalf of the decedent in Licking County in 1994. Sayer also filed a complaint on December 15, 1994 against appellees Judith and Don Juan Epler, claiming that they had unlawfully transferred and are now concealing real estate located in Licking County. Sayer amended this complaint on March 15, 1995. The amended complaint contains two counts: the first count styled \u201cConcealment Action\u201d and the second count styled \u201cDeclaratory Judgment Action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Sayer argues that pursuant to the decedent\u2019s last will and testament, her assets were to be distributed to appellee Judith Epler and her three surviving sons, Sayer, Michael Sayer and Quentin Sayer. However, following the decedent\u2019s death, appellee informed her sons that their grandmother had no assets when she died and that they would receive nothing. Appellee stated that the decedent had given her the house and real estate located in Pataskala, Licking County, as a gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Appellant contends that six months prior to his grandmother\u2019s death, she owned a home worth $130,000, free and clear, $72,000 worth of American Electric Power stock, and other assets yet to be discovered. Prior to her death, appellee Judith Epler had a power of attorney over the decedent, from 1988 until 1990, when it was revoked by the decedent. Appellee Judith Epler again obtained another power of attorney over the decedent in May 1991, which remained in effect until the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Appellees sought to have Sayer\u2019s complaint in Licking County dismissed. On June 3, 1996, in case No. 94-803, the trial court filed an order and entry finding that the decedent had been domiciled in Licking County and that the probate court had subject matter jurisdiction to probate her estate. On July 11,1996, the probate court filed a document entitled \u201cOrder,\u201d which granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss Sayer\u2019s complaint. Sayer appeals the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint and sets forth the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">\u201cI. The probate court erred by dismissing Count Two of the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s first amended complaint based upon lack of subject matter jurisdiction of the probate court as said ruling is contrary to law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">\u201cII. The probate court erred when it mischaracterized Count Two of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s amended complaint as strictly a claim for money damages resulting from fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">\u201cIII. The probate court has mischaracterized Count Two of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s complaint when it held that this cause of action does not relate to property titled in the decedent\u2019s name at the time of the decedent\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">\u201cIV. The probate court erred when it held that a declaratory judgment .would merely be advisory and not end the controversy if it determined that a deed was invalid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-11\">. \u201cV. The probate court erred when it determined that because resolution of the controversy depends on the determination of facts this case is not within the spirit of Declaratory Judgment Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-12\">\u201cVI. The probate court erred by mischaracterizing plaintiff-appellant\u2019s Count One as strictly a \u00a7 2109.50 cause of action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>\u201cVII. The probate court erred when it dismissed Count One due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">\u201cVIII. The probate court erred when it miseharacterized and strictly limited Count One as a fraud/damages case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Sayer argues, in his first assignment of error, that the probate court erred when it dismissed his amended complaint based upon lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. We agree, based upon statutes and case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">R.C. 2101.24 defines the jurisdiction of the probate court and provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">\u201c(A)(1) Except as.otherwise provided by law, the probate court has exclusive jurisdiction:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\"><em>\u00ab </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">\u201c(c) To direct and control the conduct and settle the accounts of executors and administrators and order the distribution of estates;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-12\"><em>(( </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-13\">\u201c\u00a9 To direct and control the conduct of fiduciaries and settle their accounts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">Further, R.C. 2101.24(C) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-15\">\u201cThe probate court has plenary power at law and in equity to dispose fully of any matter that is properly before the court, unless the power is expressly otherwise limited or denied by a section of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-16\">Based upon the above statutes, we find that the probate court has subject-matter jurisdiction. This conclusion is supported by the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Morrison\u2019s Estate </em>(1953), 159 Ohio St. 285, 50 O.O. 291, 112 N.E.2d 13, syllabus, wherein the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-17\">\u201cBy the Constitution and statutory enactments, the Probate Court is invested with the power and jurisdiction to adjudicate a matter relating to the title to and status of personal property, where, during the administration of a decedent\u2019s estate in such court, decedent\u2019s widow files her petition asking for a declaration that certain personal property is an asset of the estate and must be administered as such, as against the claim that such property was effectually disposed of by the decedent during his lifetime through a written declaration of trust.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-18\">Count Two of Sayer\u2019s amended complaint asks the trial court for a declaratory judgment to determine whether certain assets, now owned by appellee, should be included in the estate. We find that the probate court has subject-matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>jurisdiction over declaratory judgments. R.C. 2101.24(A)(l)(k) specifically permits a probate court to render declaratory judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">R.C. 2721.05, the statute addressing declaratory judgments, also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">\u201cAny person interested as or through an executor, administrator, trustee, guardian, or other fiduciary, creditor, devisee, legatee, heir, next of kin, or cestui que trust, in the administration of a trust, or of the estate of a decedent, an infant, lunatic, or insolvent, may have a declaration of rights or legal relations in respect thereto in any of the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\"><em>U </em>* <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201c(C) To determine any question arising in the administration of the estate or trust, including questions of construction of wills and other writings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">These statutes, taken together, allow one responsible for the administration of an estate or personally interested in the administration of an estate to bring a declaratory judgment action in the probate court to have written instruments potentially affecting the rights and property which are the subject of an estate considered. <em>Corron v. Corron </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 75, 78, 531 N.E.2d 708, 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">The court in <em>Corron </em>also explained that in determining whether a declaratory judgment action may be brought in the probate court to determine the validity of <em>inter vivos </em>transfers, the underlying question is whether the property transferred is related to the administration of an estate. <em>Id. </em>at 79, 531 N.E.2d at 712. Since the property at issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>would revert to the estate if the transfers are found to be invalid, the validity of the transfers is related to the administration of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">As to Sayer\u2019s first claim in his complaint, styled \u201cConcealment Action,\u201d we find the trial court also has subject-matter jurisdiction to address this matter. R.C. 2101.24(A)(l)ffi permits the probate court \u201c[t]o direct and control the conduct of fiduciaries and settle their accounts.\u201d We hold that as a fiduciary of the decedent, due to the power of attorney appellee had over the decedent, she can be ordered by the probate court to account for the decedent\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">Thus, the probate court has subject matter jurisdiction over Sayer\u2019s claims contained in his amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">Sayer\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b373-15\">Sayer contends in his second assignment of error that the trial court erred when it characterized Count Two of his amended complaint as strictly a claim for money damages resulting from fraud. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Count Two of Sayer\u2019s complaint does not merely set forth a claim for fraud and money damages. Count Two seeks, in addition to damages for fraud, a declaration that the real estate located at 5447 Watkins Road is a part of the decedent\u2019s estate, that appellee has already taken more than her one-quarter interest in the decedent\u2019s property, and that appellee not be permitted to share in the assets of the decedent\u2019s estate according to the will, and appointment of a receiver to collect rent, and order appellees to account for all activities conducted under the general power of attorney from 1982 until present.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Fraud is merely one theory contained in the complaint. Pursuant to Civ.R. 8(E)(2), which permits notice pleading, Sayer\u2019s other possible theories and remedies remain, even though the probate court cannot address the fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">This conclusion is consistent with <em>Spitzer v. Jackson </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 313, 644 N.E.2d 1122, wherein the court noted in Headnote 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">\u201cProbate court had jurisdiction over action by decedent\u2019s estate to recover assets allegedly wrongfully withheld from estate by executrix under statute providing for special proceedings to determine whether an asset belongs in the estate of the decedent; although Probate Court does not have jurisdiction over fraud cases, estate\u2019s action was for return of wrongfully held assets, not for damages for fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313, 313, 644 N.E.2d at 1122, 1122.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Therefore, we find that all of the theories of relief contained in Sayer\u2019s second claim for relief, except those for fraud and money damages, are properly before the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Sayer\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Sayer maintains, in his third assignment of error, that the probate court mischaracterized Count Two of his complaint when it held that this cause of action does not relate to property titled in the decedent\u2019s name at the time of the decedent\u2019s death. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">As noted in Sayer\u2019s first assignment of error, the cause of action does relate to the property of the estate if the probate court determines that the transfers of real and personal property were invalid since the property would revert to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">Sayer\u2019s third assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b374-15\">Sayer contends, in the fourth assignment of error, that the probate court erred when it held that a declaratory judgment would be merely advisory and not end the controversy if it determined that a deed was invalid. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>As explained in Sayer\u2019s first and third assignments of error, an order by the trial court that appellee return the assets to the estate would end the controversy in question as would a ruling that the assets are not part of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Sayer\u2019s fourth assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In his fifth assignment of error, Sayer contends that the probate court erred when it determined that because resolution of the controversy depends on the determination of facts this case is not within the \u2022 spirit of the Declaratory Judgment Act. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">As noted in Sayer\u2019s first and third assignments of error, a declaratory judgment may be brought in the probate court to determine the validity of <em>inter vivos </em>transfers where the property transferred would revert to the estate if the transfers are invalidated. <em>State ex rel. Lipinski v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, Probate Div. </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 19, 22, 655 N.E.2d 1303, 1306-1307; <em>Corron, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 79, 531 N.E.2d at 712. The fact that the trial court may have to determine certain facts does not take it outside the Declaratory Judgment Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Sayer\u2019s fifth assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">Sayer contends, in his sixth assignment of error, that the probate court erred when it mischaracterized Count One as strictly a cause of action pursuant to R.C. 2109.50. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">We find that this is not the only claim set forth by Sayer in his first cause of action. As in Sayer\u2019s second assignment of error, we find Civ.R. 8(E)(2) applicable. Sayer further alleged that appellee had a power of attorney over the decedent and at one time was her fiduciary. Therefore, the probate court has authority, pursuant to R.C. 2101.24(A)(1)\u00ae, to require an accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">Sayer\u2019s sixth assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">In his seventh assignment of error, Sayer maintains that the probate court erred when it dismissed Count One due to lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. We agree for the reasons stated in our discussion of the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-16\">Sayer\u2019s seventh assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In his final assignment of error, Sayer contends that the probate court erred when it mischaracterized and strictly limited Count One as a fraud/damages case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">As discussed in our analysis of the second assignment of error, the complaint does not merely set forth a claim for fraud/damages. The claim also contains other allegations that the trial court may consider pursuant to Civ.R.8(E)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Sayer\u2019s eighth assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, Licking County, Ohio, is hereby reversed and the cause is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b376-10\">William B.
