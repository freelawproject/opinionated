We affirm for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">On January 7, 1994, William Alvin Sallach, a passenger on United Express Flight 6291, was killed when the plane crashed in Franklin County. He had been traveling within the course and scope of his employment with Xerox Corporation, a self-insured employer under Ohio workers\u2019 compensation law. Xerox paid appellee Carol Ann Sallach, decedent\u2019s wife, $964 in workers\u2019 compensation benefits every two weeks, and Xerox is obligated to continue such payment until she remarries or dies. As of January 29, 1996, Xerox had paid her $52,056 in workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">Sallach, as administrator of her husband\u2019s estate, brought this wrongful death and survivorship action against United Airlines, Inc., Atlantic Coast Airlines, Inc., d.b.a. United Express, and others. Xerox intervened as a plaintiff, asserting a right to subrogation under former R.C. 4123.93.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sallach then settled with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>defendants, releasing them from any farther liability. Neither the settlement agreement nor any other evidence indicates that the parties allocated any fraction of the settlement amount to any particular claim or claimant. One-third of the settlement amount went to Sallach\u2019s attorneys, and about three percent went to pay litigation costs. Sallaeh agreed to disburse an undisclosed amount of the balance to the other wrongful death statutory beneficiaries, the sister and aunt of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">After a trial to a magistrate on Xerox\u2019s subrogation claim, the magistrate\u2019s decision was to grant judgment to Sallaeh. The trial court overruled all objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision and made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law: (1) former R.C. 4123.93, contained in Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107, was effective October 20, 1993, prior to the accident; (2) it is unknown what portion of the settlement amount was allocated to decedent\u2019s lost wages; (3) applying former R.C. 4123.93 to this wrongful death case would violate the public policy behind the wrongful death statute \u2014 compensating the wrongful death statutory beneficiaries; and (4) in any event, former R.C. 4123.93 is not applicable in wrongful death actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Appellant Xerox asserts one assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in overruling Xerox Corporation\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision and holding that Xerox Corporation is not entitled to exercise its subrogation rights under R.C. \u00a7 4123.93.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Appellee and cross-appellant Sallaeh asserts two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">\u201c1. The trial court committed reversible error in permitting intervening plaintiff-appellant Xerox Corporation to intervene in this action and in overruling plaintiff-appellee/eross-appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint of intervening plaintiff Xerox Corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\">\u201c2. The trial court erred in applying R.C. 4123.93 to this action when the statute is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to the facts of this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">The question of the effective date of former R.C. 4123.93, a question arising from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State ex rel. Ohio AFL-CIO v. Voinovich </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 225, 234-237, 631 N.E.2d 582, 589-592, clarified, 69 Ohio St.3d 1208, 632 N.E.2d 907, need not be addressed because we hold that the statute is inapplicable to this case even assuming that it was effective October 20, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">Former R.C. 4123.93 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-13\">\u201c(B) * * * [A] self-insuring employer, for the amount of compensation and benefits paid <em>to or on behalf of his employee </em>for an injury or occupational disease that is compensable under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Revised Code, less the amount of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and court costs actually incurred by the employee in the action, [is] subrogated to all of the rights <em>of that employee </em>against a third-party tortfeasor involving that compensable injury or disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\"><em>u </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u201c(D) The right of subrogation which inures to the benefit of the * * * self-insuring employer under division (B) of this section is automatic and applies only if <em>the employee </em>is a party to an action involving the third-party tortfeasor.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">For two reasons, we conclude that the subrogation rights created by former R.C. 4123.93 did not include a right of subrogation for payments made for wrongful death or survivorship claims. First, the statute limited subrogation to the rights of \u201cthat employee\u201d against a third-party tortfeasor. Because a wrongful death claim is a claim belonging to the wrongful death statutory beneficiaries and not the decedent, the employer cannot be a subrogee as to a wrongful death claim. Second, the statute applies \u201conly if the employee is a party to an action involving the third-party tortfeasor.\u201d Because a decedent cannot be a party to an action, the employer cannot be a subrogee as to either a wrongful death or a survivorship claim. Although a survivorship claim is based on the rights of the decedent, the decedent is not a party to the action. We will not broadly interpret the word \u201cemployee\u201d in former R.C. 4123.93(D) to include the decedent\u2019s estate. R.C. 4123.01(A) defines \u201cemployee\u201d as used in R.C. Chapter 4123 as meaning the worker individually, not the worker\u2019s estate. In <em>State ex rel. Nicholson v. Copperweld Steel Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 193, 196-197, 672 N.E.2d 657, 660-661, the Supreme Court noted that the right to death benefits under R.C. 4123.59 and the right of a deceased worker\u2019s dependents to compensation the worker should have received before death are rights belonging to the survivors and are independent of any rights the decedent worker had. Because this distinction is recognized within the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, we do not interpret \u201cemployee\u201d in former R.C. 4123.93(D) to include either the worker\u2019s estate or survivors.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">For these reasons, Xerox\u2019s assignment of error is overruled, and both of Sallaeh\u2019s assignments of error are therefore rendered moot. The judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b132-10\">Reilly, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b132-11\">Deshler, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Archer E.

By Am.Sub.H.B. No. 278, effective September 29, 1995, former R.C. 4123.93 was repealed and a substantially different subrogation statute was enacted as R.C. 4123.93 and 4123.931.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b133-4\">Deshler, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AZL\">concurring separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">While I concur with the greater part of the majority\u2019s decision and in the judgment generally, I write separately in order to more fully explain my view of this case, which I feel presents a number of significant issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Initially I would note that the trial court\u2019s decision in this matter mischaracterizes the action as one by the employer against <em>the proceeds </em>of the settlement agreed to by the decedent\u2019s widow in her claims against United Airlines. The action is in fact one brought by Xerox, as subrogee, against United Airlines, with the decedent\u2019s widow defending only in her capacity as assignee of United Airlines\u2019 defenses, pursuant to the terms of the settlement reached between the decedent\u2019s widow and the airline. This mischaracterization caused the trial court to digress into an inapposite examination of the public policy rationale underlying Ohio\u2019s wrongful death statute, rather than an examination of the statute truly at issue in this case, that granting an employer the right of subrogation for workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid. This of itself does not vitiate the trial court\u2019s decision because there are other grounds for affirmance in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">I fully agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that former R.C. 4123.93 simply does not provide a right of subrogation for an employer in a wrongful death action brought by an employee\u2019s statutory beneficiaries against a third-party tortfeasor. A wrongful death action does not meet the prerequisites for subrogation under former R.C. 4123.93, that is, that subrogation is coextensive to the rights of the employee against the tortfeasor, and that the employee must be a party to the action involving the tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">A wrongful death action brought pursuant to R.C. 2125.01 <em>et seq. </em>is a civil remedy, in derogation of common law, to compensate statutory beneficiaries for the wrongful death of the decedent. Ohio\u2019s statutory wrongful death action is not intended to compensate the decedent\u2019s estate for his own personal injury, pain, and suffering, and damages awarded in the action therefore do not flow to the estate, but are to be distributed directly to the beneficiaries. <em>Tennant v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1991), 81 Ohio App.3d 20, 610 N.E.2d 437. The statutory wrongful death action is for the exclusive benefit of the surviving spouse, children, and other statutorily designated beneficiaries of the decedent, rather than a right of the decedent; under the workers\u2019 compensation subrogation law as it read at the time applicable to this case, the employer\u2019s right to subrogation did not extend to a wrongful death action against the tortfeasor, because that wrongful death action was not a right possessed by the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>I do not agree, however, with the majority\u2019s holding that former R.C. 4123.93 is not applicable in wrongful death <em>and survivorship claims </em>because the deceased employee is not a party to any action. The survivorship action presents a different legal posture from the wrongful death action. I do not believe that the same rationale can be applied to exclude a right of subrogation in survivorship actions, nor that the same result would necessarily obtain. I concur in the majority\u2019s affirmance of the trial court decision, however, even with this caveat, because I believe that appellant has effectively waived the question of whether a subrogation right exists in a survivorship action through a failure to argue this distinction in connection with this appeal. The complaint filed by the decedent\u2019s widow included both a wrongful death and survivorship claim. The trial court decision in this matter, while finding no right of subrogation on the part of the employer, discusses only the wrongful death claim without reference to the survivorship action. Appellant has made no argument regarding this aspect of the trial court\u2019s decision and does not assign specific error relating to this issue. The matter being entirely unbriefed by either party in this respect, I agree with the majority that a holding on the issue of the existence of subrogation to a survivorship action would be inappropriate either in the affirmative or negative and thus a reversal of the trial court on this basis even less appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Accordingly, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s decision, but avoid any pronouncement as to whether a right of subrogation under former R.C. 4123.93 exists for an employer on the basis of the deceased employee\u2019s survivorship action against the tortfeasor. Furthermore, I am unable to agree with the majority\u2019s application of <em>State ex rel. Nicholson v. Copperweld Steel Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 193, 672 N.E.2d 657, to this matter. The majority appears to find that a right of subrogation does not exist because the workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid in this case were paid to the workers\u2019 widow, and thus the amounts paid by the employer were not paid \u201cto or on behalf of the employee\u201d under former R.C. 4123.93(B). I believe that amounts paid to the employee\u2019s family as survivorship benefits should in fact qualify as \u201cbenefits paid to or on behalf of the employee.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
