Rita Sroka assigns the following four errors for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">\u201cI. The trial court abused its discretion by failing to make a finding of domestic violence based upon the unrebutted testimony and evidence before it together with the admissions of violence by defendant-appellee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-7\">\u201cII. The trial court\u2019s judgment denying plaintiffs petition of domestic violence was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-8\">\u201cHI. The trial court\u2019s refusal to comply with plaintiff-appellant\u2019s timely Civil Rule 52 request for findings of fact and conclusions of law constitutes prejudicial error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\">\u2018TV. The trial court\u2019s refusal to make a finding of domestic violence and issue a temporary protection order violates public policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">Having reviewed the record and arguments of the parties, we reverse the trial court. The apposite facts follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">The trial court without opinion or reasoning denied Rita Sroka\u2019s petition for protection from domestic violence after hearing testimony from both Rita Sroka and her ex-husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">During his testimony, Michael Sroka admitted twice that he assaulted Rita Sroka. He identified his behavior as follows: \u201cI popped.\u201d He then said, \u201cI don\u2019t remember the details of the chair. I remember knocking her over. I remember being over her * * At the end of the testimony and after denying Rita Sroka\u2019s petition, the trial court said, \u201c[T]ry to control yourself * * *.\u201d Michael Sroka responded, \u201cSir, believe me, I will * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">Rita Sroka testified that her ex-husband came into the house, dropped his gym bag, and came at her with both hands. He choked her and knocked her from her chair onto the floor. His body was on top of her as he choked her. Both of her daughters witnessed the assault. She testified that her head, neck, and arms were injured, and as a result she had difficulty moving.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">Michael Sroka admitted that he did not release his choke hold on her until he started to think about God. Rita Sroka testified that he had been \u201ccontinually violent\u201d and had exhibited \u201cabusive behavior\u201d towards her for about a year since the divorce, which was in 1991. She also said that he idealized O.J. Simpson. After the Simpson murder, he would leave messages on her phone machine referring to O.J. Simpson as his \u201cmain man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Finally, she testified that she was afraid of her ex-husband and needed protection from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">In her first assignment of error, Rita Sroka argues that the trial court erred in denying the petition. She argues that the testimony presented at the hearing warranted a finding of domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">R.C. 3113.31(A) contains the following definition of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\">\u201cthe occurrence of <em>one or more of the following acts </em>against a family or household member:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">\u201c(a) <em>Attempting to cause or recklessly causing bodily injury;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-9\">\u201c(b) Placing another person by the threat of force in fear of imminent serious physical harm or committing [menacing by stalking or aggravated trespass];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-10\">\u201c(c) Committing any act with respect to a child that would result in the child being an abused child * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">Under R.C. 3113.31(A)(3)(a)(i), a \u201cfamily or household member\u201d includes a former spouse. Rita Sroka testified that her ex-husband, Michael Sroka, choked her and pushed her to the floor, injuring her head and arm. Michael Sroka admitted to grabbing Rita Sroka by the neck and pushing her down to the floor. This evidence alone is sufficient to show an attempt by Michael Sroka to injure Rita Sroka. Michael Sroka argues that Rita Sroka was not injured. However, under the statute, an attempt to cause bodily injury can also constitute domestic violence. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court incorrectly denied Rita Sroka\u2019s petition. Rita Sroka\u2019s first assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">In her second assignment of error, Rita Sroka argues that the trial court\u2019s denial of her petition was against the manifest weight of the evidence. We are mindful of our responsibility to give deference to the trial court\u2019s factual findings. See <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578. However, our review of the record does not reveal any basis for denying the petition. Absent any competent, credible evidence in support of the trial court\u2019s decision, and in light of the evidence presented in support of the petition, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence. See <em>First Fed. Sav. Bank v. WSB Investments </em>(1990), 67 Ohio App.3d 277, 586 N.E.2d 1159. Rita Sroka\u2019s second assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-13\">Having concluded that Rita Sroka\u2019s first and second errors are well taken, we conclude that the remaining errors are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-14\">We reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b771-6\">Karpinski and Abood, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b771-7\">Charles D.
