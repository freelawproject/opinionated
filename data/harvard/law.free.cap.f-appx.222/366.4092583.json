Martin brought a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit against Defendant-Appellant Klent Tipton, alleging that he violated Martin\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. Tipton files this interlocutory appeal challenging the district court\u2019s partial denial of his motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds. As we do not have jurisdiction over this appeal, we dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-16\">On April 3, 2005, at 5:19 p.m., Tipton, a Texas State Trooper, pulled over Martin because he was driving 66 mph in a 65 mph zone. After briefly questioning Martin, Tipton requested that a K-9 officer be brought to the scene. The K-9 officer arrived approximately 30 minutes later with a trained dog. After the dog made a positive alert on an odor from Martin\u2019s vehicle, Tipton searched the car. Although Tipton testified he found a leafy-green substance that he believed to be marijuana residue in the trunk of the car, he did not remove this substance, and Martin disputes that this substance was marijuana. Approximately one hour and forty-five minutes elapsed from the initial stop until Tipton informed Martin he was free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-17\">Martin filed this action, alleging that the initial stop, the prolonged detention, and the search of his vehicle, during which Martin contends his car was \u201ctrashed,\u201d deprived him of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Tipton filed a motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds. The district court granted the motion with respect to the initial stop but denied it with respect to the post-stop detention and the search. Tipton timely filed this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-18\">A district court\u2019s order denying qualified immunity is immediately appealable to the extent that it turns on an issue of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, \u201ca defendant, entitled to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>voke a qualified immunity defense, may not appeal a district court\u2019s summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the defendant only argues that, contrary to the district court\u2019s determination, there is insufficient evidence in the record to support the plaintiffs version of the facts, the appellate courts must dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have appellate jurisdiction only to determine whether Tipton is entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law when all facts are viewed in the light most favorable to Martin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">To determine whether an official is entitled to qualified immunity, the court asks (1) whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of a constitutional right and (2) whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable in light of the clearly established law at the time of the incident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Tipton\u2019s appeal, in essence, challenges the district court\u2019s determination that \u201cthe pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although Tipton asserts that \u201c[tjhere are no materially disputed facts in this case,\u201d this contention ignores the district court\u2019s analysis of the facts in the summary judgment record. Tipton, for example, casts Martin as evasive and unresponsive, contending that this was part of Tipton\u2019s basis for the post-stop detention. In contrast, the district court concluded, <em>based on its viewing of the videotape of the stop, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap0\">Martin appears calm and collected. He does not become angry or raise his voice, and he answers questions succinctly. He identifies where he is coming from and where he is going. Martin discusses his previous employment and appears to try to answer the Officer\u2019s questions truthfully. While Martin was not overly cooperative or extremely forthcoming in his answers, his answers and demeanor as seen in the videotape of the incident do not, by themselves, or in conjunction with a messy car, establish, for summary judgment purposes, that a reasonable officer would have had suspicion of criminal activity sufficient to justify a detention of over 30 minutes while waiting for a drug dog.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">The district court further concluded that the questions raised by the videotape were not answered by the summary judgment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">Tipton would have us evaluate the district court\u2019s conclusion that a jury could reject Tipton\u2019s evaluation of Martin\u2019s answers and demeanor based on Martin\u2019s demeanor in the videotape. As \u201cwe cannot challenge the district court\u2019s assessments regarding the sufficiency of the evidence\u201d on interlocutory appeal,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we do not have jurisdiction over this one. Tipton\u2019s interlocutory appeal of the district court\u2019s partial denial of qualified immunity is therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
