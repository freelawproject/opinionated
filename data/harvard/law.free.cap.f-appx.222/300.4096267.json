Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. We find there has been no undue delay in the district court. Accordingly, although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and grant Graham\u2019s motion to amend his petition, we deny the mandamus petition. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
