The district court sentenced Moore to 154 months\u2019 imprisonment. We find no error and affirm Moore\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the Government breached the terms of the plea agreement by failing to recommend a two-level reduction under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1(a) (2005), as well as move for an additional one-level reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1(b). Moore, however, \u201cadmits\u201d in his pro se supplemental brief that the Government did not breach the plea agreement. Instead, Moore contends that the district court erred in its application of \u00a7 3E1.1(a). The Government elected not to file a responsive brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">Initially, Moore\u2019s counsel contends that the Government breached the plea agreement by refusing to recommend and move for a reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1. However, because the Government\u2019s recommendation and motion were conditioned upon Moore\u2019s compliance with the conditions of pre-sentence release, and Moore acknowledges in his pro se supplemental brief that he did not comply, we conclude that the Government did not breach the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-15\">Moore contends that the district court erred in its application of \u00a7 3E1.1(a) by considering unrelated, post-indictment misconduct in making its determination as to whether a reduction was warranted. When reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Because post-indictment misconduct may be considered in determining whether a defendant qualifies for an acceptance of responsibility reduction, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Underwood, </em>970 F.2d 1336, 1339 (4th Cir.1992) (per curiam) (determining post-indictment drug use was sufficient to support decision not to reduce offense level under \u00a7 3E1.1), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>conclude the district court did not err in its application of \u00a7 3E1.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Moore\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
