Robinson asserts on appeal that he should have been allowed to sue Officer Clipse in his individual capacity and that the district court erred by dismissing his action. Robinson also contends that the court improperly resolved a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>factual dispute in finding that Clipse was entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court made an improper credibility finding in determining that Clipse was entitled to qualified immunity. In support of his claim that Clipse used excessive force in violation of Robinson\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, Robinson submitted affidavits from two witnesses and also submitted a copy of the transcript of his state court trial at which Clipse testified about the events surrounding Robinson\u2019s arrest. The district court concluded that the affidavits did not refute Clipse\u2019s state court trial testimony. However, in his complaint sworn under penalty of perjury, Robinson contradicted the version of events to which Clipse testified in the state court trial. <em>See Vathekan v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>154 F.3d 173, 179-80 (4th Cir.1998) (reversing summary judgment where disputed facts existed as to events surrounding use of force); <em>Rainey v. Conerly, </em>973 F.2d 321, 324 (4th Cir.1992) (finding that district court properly denied defendant\u2019s immunity-based summary judgment motion because \u201ca determination of what actually happened is absolutely necessary to decide whether [defendant] could reasonably have believed that his actions were lawful\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the portions of the district court\u2019s orders in which the court found that Clipse was entitled to qualified immunity and remand for further proceedings in the district court. We affirm the remainder of the district court\u2019s orders, grant Robinson\u2019s motions to add Clipse as a party <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and to amend and supplement his informal brief, and deny his motion to appoint counsel. We also deny Robinson\u2019s motion for oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-6\"> We note that, in footnote one of its order denying the motion for reconsideration, the district court explicitly denied Robinson\u2019s motion to amend his complaint to add a claim against Clipse in his individual capacity. However, the district court effectively made Clipse a party by concluding that he was entitled to qualified immunity-a defense that is available only to a person sued in his individual capacity. <em>See Ridpath v. Bd. of Governors, </em>447 F.3d 292, 306 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
