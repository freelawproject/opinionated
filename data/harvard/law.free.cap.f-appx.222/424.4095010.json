They contend that the assistance they received from counsel was so ineffective that it impinged on their due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">As Petitioners raise a constitutional issue, we have jurisdiction to consider their petition. <em>See Mai v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 162, 164 (5th Cir.2006). Petitioners\u2019 ineffective assistance claims, however, relate to their hope of obtaining discretionary relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i). They thus have not alleged the deprivation of an interest vested with due process protections. <em>See Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, 349 </em>F.3d 213, 219 (5th Cir.2003). Their petition for review of the BIA\u2019s final removal order is therefore denied. To the extent that the petition is construed as seeking review from the BIA\u2019s denial of Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen on grounds of ineffective assistance and due process, it is likewise denied. By failing to challenge the BIA\u2019s decision that they are not entitled to asylum or withholding of removal, Petitioners have abandoned any challenge in that regard. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
