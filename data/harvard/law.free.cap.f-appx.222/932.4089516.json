Bailey sued the School Board for violations of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 (\u201cTitle IX\u201d) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 that she alleges occurred when she was a student and was sexually harassed by a teacher at Apopka High.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-16\">Having considered the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal, we find no reversible error. In order to resist summary judgment on either of her claims against the School Board, Bailey must present some evidence that, while she was a student at Apopka High, a School Board official knew of the teacher\u2019s misconduct with Bailey or similar misconduct with other students and was deliberately indifferent to that misconduct. <em>Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>524 U.S. 274, 277, 118 S.Ct. 1989, 1993, 141 L.Ed.2d 277 (1998); <em>Sauls v. Pierce County Sch. Dist., </em>399 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2005). The district court correctly found that Bailey did not present evidence sufficient to raise genuine issues of material fact as to these elements of her claims. (R.3-59 at 17-24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b961-17\">We do not address whether the district court erred in striking the affidavit of Laqueta Mendez Simpkins because, even considering that affidavit, we find that it does not change the result in this case. And, we find no abuse of discretion in the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>trict court\u2019s decision to strike portions of Bailey\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-13\">. The Appellant's brief recites that summary judgment was granted to \"Defendants-Appellees,\u201d (Blue Br. at 9), and seeks reversal of that order. (Blue Br. at 42.) In reality, however, Appellant voluntarily dismissed all defendants other than the School Board that remained in the case after some claims were remanded to the state court. (R.1-36.) The School Board is the only party that moved for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
