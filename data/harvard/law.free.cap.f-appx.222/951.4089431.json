Dairyland brought this action for a declaratory judgment on the issue of whether it properly cancelled Crews\u2019s automobile liability insurance policy for non-payment of the premium. If the cancellation was proper, Dairyland has no obligation to provide coverage, and no duty to defend an action, for damages arising from a car accident involving Nancy Bland\u2019s minor son. These damages are the subject of an underlying action in state court. On appeal, Crews argues the district court improvidently granted summary judgment based on Florida\u2019s Uninsured Motorist Statute. <em>See </em>\u00a7 627.727, Fla. Stat.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-21\">We review the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo. See Madray v. Publix Supermarkets, Inc., </em>208 F.3d 1290, 1296 (11th Cir.2000). A motion for summary judgment should be granted \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In our review, we \u201cmust view all the evidence and all factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\u201d <em>Stewart v. Happy Herman\u2019s Cheshire Bridge, Inc., </em>117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir.1997), and \u201cresolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-movant.\u201d <em>United of Omaha Life Ins. v. Sun Life Ins. Co., </em>894 F.2d 1555, 1558 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-22\">In a succinct and well-reasoned opinion, the district court entered summary judgment based on the unambiguous terms of Crews\u2019s insurance policy, including the provision for Uninsured Motorist coverage and the requirement for timely payments of premiums, and in accordance with Florida law. In its order, the district court addressed virtually every argument raised in this appeal. After our own review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments, we discern no reversible error in the district court\u2019s disposition of this case and affirm its judgment in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
