The district court determined that the suit was frivolous and dismissed it. Xuan appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>the dismissal of his suit. He argues that his suit is not barred by res judicata and that his claims are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Xuan\u2019s claims are legally and factually frivolous. <em>See Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 32-33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. <em>See Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
