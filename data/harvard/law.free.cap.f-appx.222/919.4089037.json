On appeal, Suarez, a native and a citizen of Venezuela, argues primarily about the merits of the BIA\u2019s February 17, 2006, decision affirming the IJ\u2019s original denial of asylum and withholding of removal. In his brief, he only refers to the BIA\u2019s July 10, 2006 decision denying his motion for reconsideration in a conclusory manner. However, because his petition for review was timely only as to the denial of the motion to reconsider, we have jurisdiction only as to that order, and not as to the earlier decision on the merits. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition in part and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">\n<em>A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">We are \u201cobligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). While we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, a petition for review must be filed within thirty days of the date of the final order of removal. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1). We have held that \u201c[sjince the statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 it is not subject to equitable tolling. Furthermore, the filing deadline is not suspended or tolled by the fact that [the petitioner] filed a [timely] motion to reopen the removal proceedings ... after issuance of the final order of removal.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>see also Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 395, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1544, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (holding that a motion to reconsider filed with the BIA does not suspend the finality of the underlying BIA order and does not toll the review period, construing the former 90-day period for filing a petition for review, INA \u00a7 106(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">In order to timely challenge the BIA\u2019s decision as to his underlying asylum and withholding of removal claims in its February 17, 2006 order affirming the IJ\u2019s opinion and dismissing his appeal, Suarez should have filed a petition for review on or before March 20, 2006. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). However, Suarez filed a timely petition of review only with regard to the BIA\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration, and as a result, our jurisdiction is limited solely to reviewing whether the BIA prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>erly denied the motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to consider Suarez\u2019s underlying asylum and withholding of removal claims and dismiss any portion of the petition for review addressing these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">\n<em>B. Motion for Reconsideration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion, similar to the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). Judicial review is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) (per curiam) (addressing a motion to reopen) (citation omitted). The BIA\u2019s decision to deny a motion for reconsideration should be upheld \u201cunless it was made without a rational explanation, inexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on an impermissible basis.\u201d <em>Ven v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 357, 360 (1st Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Motions to reconsider are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, \u201cwhere, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25,116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (addressing a motion to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">Under the regulations, a motion for reconsideration must specify \u201cthe errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision.\u201d 8 C. F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). \u201cA motion to reconsider asserts that at the time of the Board\u2019s previous decision an error was made.\u201d <em>Matter of Cerna, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991). When the BIA reconsiders one of its prior decisions, it takes itself \u201cback in time and considers] the case as though a decision in the case on the record ... had never been entered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cReconsideration is not an appropriate forum for rehashing previously rejected arguments or arguing matters that could have been heard during the pendency of the previous motion.\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 247, 249 (7th Cir.2004); <em>Strato v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 651, 655 (8th Cir.2004). \u201cThe repetition of previous arguments is not sufficient to prevail\u201d on a motion for reconsideration. <em>Ahmed, </em>388 F.3d at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">Suarez has arguably abandoned any challenge to the denial of his motion for reconsideration because he advances no arguments in his brief regarding the motion. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003). However, even if he has not abandoned his claim, it still fails. Because Suarez failed to specify the errors of fact or law in the prior BIA decision and simply repeated his prior arguments that the BIA had already considered and rejected, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition to the extent it addresses the merits of Suarez\u2019s underlying asylum and withholding of removal claims and deny it with regard to his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
