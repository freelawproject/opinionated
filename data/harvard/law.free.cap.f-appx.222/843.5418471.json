Both parties agree the adversary proceeding was a non-core proceeding. The bankruptcy court heard the adversary proceeding and issued a memorandum decision granting summary judgment to Appellees. The district court affirmed in a short opinion, stating \u201c[ajfter a de novo review of the record, this court fully agrees with the careful and thoughtful decision of the bankruptcy court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-9\">A bankruptcy judge has jurisdiction to hear a non-core adversary proceeding and enter a report and recommendation. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(c)(1). For a bankruptcy judge to enter the final order in a non-core adversary proceeding, however, the parties must consent and the district court must refer the case to the bankruptcy court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(c)(2). In this case, the parties did not consent to the district judge referring the case to the bankruptcy judge for final determination, and the district judge made no such referral. Thus, the bankruptcy court should have entered a report and recommendation recommending the district court grant summary judgment in favor of Ap-pellees rather than an order granting summary judgment to Appellees. Because the district court reviewed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order de novo as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(c)(1), however, we treat the bankruptcy court\u2019s memorandum decision as a report and recommendation, and the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court as the final order adopting the bankruptcy court\u2019s report and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-11\">As to the substance of the claim, we agree with the district court that the Appellants failed to state a claim under the Alabama Legal Services Liability Act. Thus, we affirm for the reasons stated in the bankruptcy judge\u2019s well-reasoned memorandum decision (construed as a report and recommendation) of July 21, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
