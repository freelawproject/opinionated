McCool, appeal the district court\u2019s order entering final judgment in favor of defendants in this products liability action. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AQG\">A. Accident</p>\n<p id=\"b876-20\">Donald L. McCool and his son were riding in a pickup truck when McCool lost control of the vehicle, it crossed into the median and rolled over, killing McCool and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>injuring his son. McCool\u2019s widow and son (\u201cplaintiffs\u201d) filed this lawsuit in Florida state court, alleging that the fatal accident was caused by one of the pickup\u2019s Firestone steel belted radial tires when the tread and outer steel belt suddenly separated from the main body of the tire. Plaintiffs asserted claims against defendants for negligent and defective design and manufacture and failure to warn.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">B. Discovery and MDL Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Defendants removed the action to the Southern District of Florida based on diversity jurisdiction. The action was then transferred to the Southern District of Indiana for consolidated multi-district litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d). While in MDL, plaintiffs retained William Nonnamaker, a tire failure analyst, as their expert regarding the alleged defect in the tire.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Nonnamaker produced a Rule 26 expert report, prepared August 28, 2002, in which Nonnamaker opined, after inspecting the tire, that it had failed because defendants failed \u201cto design in an adequate safety margin and/or to maintain tight enough tolerances in the manufacture of the tire----\u201d The report explained that \u201cbuilt in weakness between the two steel belts along both edges caused separations to develop\u201d as the tire aged and that this condition \u201ccombined with the centrifugal force of the rotation of the tire caused the tread and outer steel belt to come completely off of the balance of the tires.\u201d The report concluded that the tread separation \u201ccreated a vehicle handling control problem....\u201d The report also contained a series of observations from Nonnamaker\u2019s visual inspection of the tire, including measurements and notations about the tire\u2019s condition. However, the report did not explain how these notations supported Nonnamaker\u2019s conclusion that the tire\u2019s design had failed to include an adequate safety margin. Nor did the report identify any scientific studies, industry testing or peer-reviewed articles to support Nonnamaker\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">On September 25, 2003, defendants deposed Nonnamaker. During the deposition, Nonnamaker stated that an adequate safety margin would have been to include \u201cnylon overlays\u201d or \u201cnylon cap plies\u201d and that defendants\u2019 failure to include nylon cap plies in McCool\u2019s steel belted radial tire caused the tire to fail. The only support for Nonnamaker\u2019s opinion cited during his deposition was the fact that other tire experts held the same opinion. Nonnamaker admitted that he had no experience in the design of steel belted radial tires or of nylon cap plies in such tires, had never tested nylon cap plies in tires, had not published his theory about the protective effect of nylon cap plies in steel belted radial tires and was not aware of any other peer-reviewed publications regarding such a theory. Although Nonnamaker mentioned that he had seen test data that indicated that nylon cap plies improved the performance of tires, he did not bring that test data to his deposition or list the data in his Rule 26 report. Nonnamaker also indicated that he had not reviewed any documentation of a comparison between tires with and without nylon cap plies that showed that nylon cap plies reduced tread belt separation and that he could not identify any tests of steel belted radial passenger tires that showed that nylon cap plies prevent tread belt separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">Defendants moved for summary judgment. The MDL court granted summary judgment on all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims except the defective design claim. With regard to this claim, the MDL court noted that Nonnamaker\u2019s testimony regarding the tire\u2019s lack of a nylon cap ply was \u201cbarely\u201d sufficient evidence to support a jury finding of defective design, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>As for the plaintiffs\u2019 \u25a0 design defect claim, however, Mr. Nonnamaker testified that the subject tire was defective because it did not have a nylon cap ply and that \u201cnylon cap plies would have meant that the tire would not have failed when it did. It would have given additional service life.\u201d While Mr. Nonnamaker provides little, if any scientific basis for this conclusion, that is, nonetheless, his expert testimony, and, in the event it survives Firestone\u2019s inevitable <em>Daubert </em>challenge, it would be sufficient evidence, albeit barely, from which a jury reasonably could conclude that the tire was defective and that the defect caused the tire failure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The MDL court remanded the action to the Southern District of Florida for further proceedings on the remaining design defect claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">C. <em>Daubert </em>Motion and Response</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">The district court set trial for the two-week trial calendar beginning February 6, 2006. On October 20, 2005, defendants filed a <em>Daubert </em>motion, seeking to exclude Nonnamaker\u2019s expert testimony because Nonnamaker was not qualified to testify on the alleged design defect and Nonnamaker\u2019s expert opinion was unreliable. On November 4, 2005, one day before plaintiffs\u2019 response to the <em>Daubert </em>motion was due, plaintiffs sought an extension of time. The district court granted plaintiffs\u2019 request and directed plaintiffs to file their response within thirty days, that is, by December 8, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">On December 5, 2005, plaintiffs sought an additional extension through December 14, 2005. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion noted that defendants did not oppose an extension through December 12. By December 8, the district court had not ruled on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an extension of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Nonetheless, plaintiffs did not file their response to the <em>Daubert </em>motion on the court-ordered due date of December 8. Instead, plaintiffs attempted to file their response on December 12. Although the clerk\u2019s office accepted plaintiffs\u2019 <em>Daubert </em>response and stamped it filed, the docket clerk crossed out the word \u201cfiled\u201d and wrote the word \u201cRec\u2019d\u201d in its place and did not enter the <em>Daubert </em>response on the docket. Also on December 12, plaintiffs filed a motion for a Rule 104(a) hearing on defendants\u2019 <em>Daubert </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">On that same day, the district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an extension of time and ordered plaintiffs to show cause for failing to comply with the court-ordered deadline of December 8. Plaintiffs responded that they had moved for an extension of time and had met the extended deadline agreed to by opposing counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">After conducting a show cause hearing, the district court entered an order in which it explained that the parties could not amend court-ordered filing deadlines and concluded that plaintiffs had not filed their <em>Daubert </em>response by the court-ordered deadline of December 8. The district court also found that plaintiffs\u2019 <em>Daubert </em>response had never been filed, as reflected on the docket, and stated that it would not consider unfiled pleadings. The district court noted that plaintiffs\u2019 <em>Daubert </em>response had been received by the clerk\u2019s office on December 12, after the court-ordered deadline. Thus, the district court concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 <em>Daubert </em>response would have been untimely even if it had been filed. The district court ordered plaintiffs to retrieve all copies of the unfiled <em>Daubert </em>response from the clerk\u2019s office. It also set a Rule 104 hearing on defendants\u2019 <em>Daubert </em>motion for January 17, 2005 and denied as moot plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a Rule 104 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>D. Rule 104 Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">At the Rule 104 hearing, plaintiffs called Nonnamaker to testify. While Nonnamaker was answering questions about his work experience in the 1950s, he paused long enough that the district court noted it on the record, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-6\">Q. In order to address the judge\u2019s concern, Mr. Nonnamaker, would you be more specific as to the periods of time that you worked at Firestone from '51 to '56, if you could detail each position that you had and what you did in each position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-7\">A. At 1951 to 1956, initially I was involved with the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-8\">(Pause.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-9\">Q. I\u2019m sorry, did you say something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-10\">A. No, I\u2019m sorry, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-11\">THE COURT: The record should reflect that there\u2019s a long pause. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-12\">MR. CABEZAS: I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening either, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-13\">BY MR. CABEZAS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-14\">Q. Are you okay, Mr. Nonnamaker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-15\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-16\">Q. Do you understand my question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-17\">A. Ido.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-18\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel then repeated his question, and Nonnamaker answered it. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel posed another question about Nonnamaker\u2019s employment in the 1950s. While answering, Nonnamaker again paused, prompting counsel to request a brief recess. The district court granted the request, noting for the record that \u201cafter questions are responded to in part, there\u2019s a long pause.\u201d After a seven minute recess, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated that plaintiffs were ready to proceed, and Nonnamaker continued testifying until lunch without further incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-21\">Nonnamaker testified that he had performed over 3,000 failure analyses of tires. Nonnamaker stated that a \u201cfailure analysis\u201d of a tire involved conducting a \u201cvisual and tactile examination\u201d of the tire under bright lights and then recording all the significant conditions and markings that would indicate the reason for a failure. Nonnamaker also testified that a steel belted radial tire experiences tread belt separation because of \u201cthe absence of a nylon overlay to assist in protecting against the sharp edges of the steel belt\u201d and opined that the absence of a nylon overlay or nylon cap plies was a defect in the design of McCool\u2019s steel belted radial tire.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In forming this opinion, Nonnamaker testified that he relied upon his experience in examining tires and \u201cthe tests that have been conducted by various companies that support that a nylon overlay improves the tire life.\u201d However, the tests to which Nonnamaker referred were not introduced into the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-22\">During the hearing, defendants objected to Nonnamaker\u2019s references to the tests, arguing that they had not been disclosed in his Rule 26 report or produced during his deposition. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel explained that the tests to which Nonnamaker referred had been given to Nonnamaker in other litigation, were no longer in his possession, and were the subject of confidentiality orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-23\">After a lunch recess, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel informed the district court that, after speaking with Nonnamaker, both he and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>Nonnamaker had concerns about Nonnamaker\u2019s memory and his competency to testify, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-4\">MR. CABEZAS: He has shared with me that he stopped taking new cases since June of last year, since June of 2005, and between then and now, this is the first time that he has testified in open court and he\u2019s concerned that, you know, the stress related to that may have brought even more to light his concerns with his slowing down mentally, his ability to recall things, and I\u2019m concerned with the competency of his testimony. So I would \u2014 if you want me to elicit that information from him directly, I will, but that\u2019s essentially what he shared with me, and I\u2019m concerned about our \u2014 my client\u2019s rights going forward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-5\">THE COURT: Well, Mr. Nonnamaker, you have heard the attorney summarize your feelings or thoughts. Do you concur with the statement he just made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-6\">THE WITNESS: I certainly do and I apologize.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-7\">THE COURT: No, you don\u2019t have to apologize. All sorts of things happen in the course of human events and so I don\u2019t want you to feel sorry. I appreciate you bringing it to the Court\u2019s attention. In essence, are you concerned about your ability to be able to recall and give fair and accurate testimony about the events that you have previously testified about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-8\">THE WITNESS: Right. I found that it was a great surprise to me this morning when it occurred and I have no explanation except that I was just having problems recalling, which tended to smooth out some, but I\u2019m still concerned, and concerned for the people that are involved, for my client that I\u2019m working for, but primarily for the people that he represents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asked for a continuance to permit Nonnamaker to seek medical attention to determine if his ability to testify was impaired. The district court concluded that the hearing should continue because Nonnamaker had indicated that the memory problem had \u201csmoothed out\u201d as he continued testifying, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-10\">THE COURT: Well, I think we should continue with the testimony because as he stated, things appeared to smooth out, as you said, as he went along. Let\u2019s just finish the testimony and then Mr. Nonnamaker can consult with any medical authorities that he desires and then we can decide where we are at that time. We only have, as you stated, about 30 more minutes of testimony and so there\u2019s no need in suspending testimony at this time, frankly, based upon what I have observed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-11\">Have you had any difficulty prior to today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-12\">THE WITNESS: Nothing like this. It was so minor. It was one of the reasons for, in June, going ahead and deciding to not take any new cases, but I had no problems like this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-13\">THE COURT: Well, you paused a bit early on, but as you continued testifying, I didn\u2019t notice any hesitation. Were you experiencing something later on in your testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-14\">THE WITNESS: No, it came around but I was very concerned about the initial problem and what was occurring there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-15\">THE COURT: After the initial pauses that I made reference to on the record, did you experience difficulty after that point in time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-16\">THE WITNESS: No, it \u2014 everything tended to smooth out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>THE COURT: Okay. All right. Well, let\u2019s continue today and then he can consult with his physicians.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Nonnamaker then corrected one piece of his morning testimony that he said was inaccurate and finished testifying.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">During redirect, the district court allowed Nonnamaker as part of a proffer to describe the tests he had relied upon in forming his expert opinion. In so doing, Nonnamaker read directly from an affidavit he had prepared and which had been attached to plaintiffs\u2019 unfiled <em>Daubert </em>response, listing various tire industry testing, internal memoranda addressing such testing and deposition testimony of tire industry officials in other litigation discussing such testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">After Nonnamaker\u2019s testimony concluded, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel renewed his motion for a continuance based on Nonnamaker\u2019s inability to recall certain events. The district court denied the motion, stating \u201cfrankly, I didn\u2019t note any problem with the issue that you\u2019re raising. There may be other problems, but I\u2019m not sure that the methodology, which is the true measure of this proceeding, suffers at all, based on prior depositions, et cetera.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">After hearing argument from the parties, the district court took defendants\u2019 <em>Daubert </em>motion under advisement. In response to an inquiry from plaintiffs\u2019 counsel regarding the <em>Daubert </em>response plaintiffs had attempted to file, the district court indicated that it had held the Rule 104 hearing because plaintiffs had not filed a <em>Daubert </em>response, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-9\">MR. CABEZAS:....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-11\">And speaking of that, to the extent that [the district court grants defendants\u2019 <em>Daubert </em>motion], and in order to preserve the record, I would like some guidance from the Court with respect to the <em>Daubert </em>response that Your Honor did not allow me to file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-12\">THE COURT: <em>Daubert </em>response?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-13\">MR. CABEZAS: I had prepared a <em>Daubert </em>response, I don\u2019t know if Your Honor recalls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-14\">THE COURT: That\u2019s why we had the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-15\">MR. CABEZAS: I\u2019m sorry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-16\">THE COURT: This is why we had the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-17\">MR. CABEZAS: I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-18\">THE COURT: So that you could introduce everything that you wanted to introduce on the subject. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been here all day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-19\">E. <em>Daubert </em>Ruling and Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b881-20\">Following the hearing, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for leave to substitute their expert witness and to continue the trial. Plaintiffs argued that, based on his memory lapses during the Rule 104 hearing, Nonnamaker was not competent to testify. On February 1, 2006, the district court denied the emergency motion, noting that the case had been pending for nearly four years and was two weeks away from trial and that plaintiffs had an adequate opportunity to develop Nonnamaker\u2019s testimony and provide support for his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-21\">On the same day, the district court granted defendants\u2019 <em>Daubert </em>motion. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>district court found that Nonnamaker was not qualified as an expert on the subject matter of nylon cap ply tires. In addition, the district court concluded that the methodology Nonnamaker used to reach his conclusions was not sufficiently reliable under the <em>Daubert </em>factors and that Nonnamaker\u2019s testimony would not assist the jury. The district court also noted, \u201cMr. Nonnamaker claims that he has seen test results that indicate support for his opinion, but these test results have not been produced or offered into evidence in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Defendants renewed their motion for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiffs could not prove their defective design claim without an expert witness. Plaintiffs filed a motion for a continuance pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) and requested time to find a substitute expert because Nonnamaker was incompetent to testify. The district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 56(f) motion and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. In so doing, the district court stated that plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 56(f) motion was a \u201cconspicuous attempt to move for reconsideration of the Court\u2019s February 1, 2006 Order denying Plaintiffs\u2019 Emergency Motion for Continuance of Trial.\u201d The district court concluded that replacing an expert that already has been excluded on <em>Daubert </em>grounds was not a valid basis for granting a Rule 56(f) continuance. The district court clarified that it had not excluded Nonnamaker because of any memory deficiencies he exhibited during the hearing, but because he was not qualified as an expert and his opinion was not reliable, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-5\">Contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, this Court excluded Mr. Nonnamaker\u2019s opinion testimony because, <em>inter alia: </em>1) he lacks the training, education, or experience to offer testimony on the nylon cap ply issue; 2) he has never been involved in the design or manufacture of any steel-belted radial tire; 3) the methodology by which Mr. Nonnamaker reached his conclusions is not sufficiently reliable as determined by the sort of inquiry mandated by <em>Daubert; </em>and 4) Mr. Nonnamaker\u2019s theory concerning the nylon cap ply defect has not been tested, and has not been subject to peer review and publication. Mr. Nonnamaker was not excluded due to some \u201cmental\u201d incompetence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">The district court concluded that plaintiffs should not be permitted to shore up their case by finding a second expert before the district court ruled on defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">F. Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">On February 24, 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment based on Nonnamaker\u2019s incompetency. Affidavits attached to the motion indicated that Nonnamaker recently had been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia. Plaintiffs also argued that the district court erred when it refused to allow them to file their untimely <em>Daubert </em>response.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">On March 30, 2006, the district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion to alter or amend the judgment. The district court again rejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument that it had based its <em>Daubert </em>ruling on Nonnamaker\u2019s incompetent testimony and noted that plaintiffs had ignored Nonnamaker\u2019s deficiencies apparent in his expert witness report and deposition testimony and the lack of other evidentiary support for Nonnamaker\u2019s expert opinion. The district court again clarified the basis for its <em>Daubert </em>ruling, citing each of the reasons for its decision to exclude Nonnamaker, none of which implicated Nonnamaker\u2019s newly discovered mental condition. The district court also emphasized that it had not relied solely upon Nonnamaker\u2019s hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>testimony in reaching its decision, but also had considered the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude and Nonnamaker\u2019s prior deposition testimony, which was given when Nonnamaker\u2019s competence was not at issue. The district court concluded that \u201c[b]ecause [Nonnamaker] was excluded on <em>Daubert </em>grounds based on Defendant\u2019s motion and [Nonnamaker\u2019s] prior deposition testimony, he would not have been permitted to testify at trial. As such, his present or future mental condition is immaterial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">With regard to the unfiled <em>Daubert </em>response, the district court reiterated that the written response was not considered because it was untimely. However, the district court explained, plaintiffs had been given an opportunity to present their response at the Rule 104 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Plaintiffs filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AcS\">A. Requests for Continuance</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the district court abused its discretion when it denied their requests for a continuance and to substitute their expert witness, who was incompetent. The \u201cdenial of a continuance is within the broad discretion of the district court and will not be overturned unless arbitrary or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Quiet Tech. DC-8, Inc. v. Hurel-Dubois UK Ltd., </em>326 F.3d 1333, 1351 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks omitted). We consider the following four factors in reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a request for a continuance: \u201c(1) the moving party\u2019s diligence in its efforts to ready its case prior to the date set for hearing; (2) the likelihood that the need for a continuance would have been remedied had the continuance been granted; (3) the extent to which granting the continuance would have inconvenienced the court and the opposing party; and (4) the extent to which the moving party might have suffered harm as a result of the district court\u2019s denial.\u201d <em>Rink v. Cheminova, Inc., </em>400 F.3d 1286, 1296 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 419, 163 L.Ed.2d 320 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">Here, factors one, three and four weigh heavily in favor of the defendants and show that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs\u2019 request for a continuance either before or after the <em>Daubert </em>ruling. The first factor \u2014 the moving party\u2019s diligence in preparing for the hearing \u2014 appears at first blush to militate in favor of plaintiffs. As plaintiffs emphasize, they appeared at the Rule 104 hearing with Nonnamaker, ready to proceed. At the time, plaintiffs were unaware of Nonnamaker\u2019s memory problems, and they requested a continuance as soon as the memory problems became apparent during the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">However, as the district court explained, plaintiffs\u2019 lack of diligence was not in failing to appear at the hearing, but in failing to prepare adequately for the <em>Daubert </em>challenge by producing evidence indicating Nonnamaker\u2019s expert opinion was reliable. It is undisputed that plaintiffs failed to produce such supporting evidence as part of Nonnamaker\u2019s Rule 26 report or in response to the subpoena duces tecum attached to the notice of Nonnamaker\u2019s deposition. Nor did plaintiffs attempt to introduce such evidence at the Rule 104 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">Indeed, the only support plaintiffs provided for Nonnamaker\u2019s expert opinion was Nonnamaker\u2019s own testimony that other expert witnesses shared his opinion and that he either was aware of or had reviewed in the past test data or internal memoranda from tire companies discussing test data that he contended supported his views. However, none of the test data <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>or internal memoranda were produced during discovery or submitted to the district court during the hearing. The absence of any documentary evidence, such as peer-reviewed articles or scientific studies or testing, is a particularly glaring omission given that Nonnamaker conducted no studies or testing of his own and had never published his nylon cap ply theory for peer review. In essence, although plaintiffs appeared at the Rule 104 hearing, their entire defense to defendants\u2019 <em>Daubert </em>challenge rested on Nonnamaker\u2019s seemingly conclusory opinion. This is not the sort of diligent preparation one would expect for a <em>Daubert </em>challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">As for the third factor, granting plaintiffs\u2019 request for a continuance would have greatly inconvenienced both the district court and the defendants. At the time of the Rule 104 hearing, the case had been pending for four years. Defendants had deposed Nonnamaker and prepared a <em>Daubert </em>challenge based on Nonnamaker\u2019s deposition and his Rule 26 report. Discovery had closed, and trial was set to begin on February 6, just three weeks later. Granting plaintiffs\u2019 request would have postponed not only a ruling on the <em>Daubert </em>motion, but also the trial. Plaintiffs ultimately sought to designate a substitute expert based on Nonnamaker\u2019s diagnoses. As plaintiffs admit, Defendants would have had to invest more time and effort to determine the reliability of this newly designated expert, reviewing a second Rule 26 report, deposing the new expert, and perhaps having to file and defend a second <em>Daubert </em>motion. Thus, trial would have been postponed for a significant period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The fourth factor also weighs in defendants\u2019 favor because plaintiffs were not seriously prejudiced by the district court\u2019s denial. Despite plaintiffs\u2019 insistence that Nonnamaker was incompetent during the Rule 104 hearing and could not properly present the foundation for his opinion, plaintiffs do not identify any material defects in Nonnamaker\u2019s Rule 104 hearing testimony resulting from his memory loss. Plaintiffs\u2019 only example is Nonnamaker\u2019s testimony covering points raised in his affidavit stricken as part of the untimely <em>Daubert </em>response. Plaintiffs contend that Nonnamaker could not remember the details of the issues addressed in his affidavit, which included descriptions of the various testing and internal memoranda Nonnamaker claimed to have reviewed in the past. However, as plaintiffs concede, the district court permitted Nonnamaker to read directly from his stricken affidavit during the hearing and Nonnamaker was asked follow-up questions by both the district court and plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">The problem with plaintiffs\u2019 <em>Daubert </em>evidence is not that Nonnamaker had trouble at the hearing recalling the testing and internal memoranda he relied upon in formulating his expert opinion. Rather, the problem for plaintiffs is that they failed to produce the testing and internal memoranda for the district court to evaluate as part of its <em>Daubert </em>analysis. Plaintiffs in effect asked the district court to take Nonnamaker\u2019s word that the testing was both scientifically sound and supported his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">The district court excluded Nonnamaker\u2019s testimony on the merits, on grounds unconnected to his memory problems during the Rule 104 hearing, and plaintiffs do not challenge the merits of the district court\u2019s <em>Daubert </em>ruling on appeal. In short, plaintiffs\u2019 case came undone long before the Rule 104 hearing, when plaintiffs chose not to support Nonnamaker\u2019s opinion with evidence indicating that it was reliable under the <em>Daubert </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">We recognize that the second factor\u2014 plaintiffs\u2019 diligence \u2014 appears to weigh in favor of plaintiffs because a continuance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>the Rule 104 hearing would have given plaintiffs time to determine the cause of Nonnamaker\u2019s memory problems. However, a continuance would not have given plaintiffs time to address the reliability concerns identified by defendants in their <em>Daubert </em>motion and focused on by the district court in its <em>Daubert </em>ruling. These concerns were not related to Nonnamaker\u2019s memory lapses during the hearing, but instead related to the lack of any scientific support for Nonnamaker\u2019s opinion, such as studies, testing or peer-reviewed articles. Any shoring up of Nonnamaker\u2019s expert opinion with scientific studies, testing data, et cetera, should have been done in the Rule 26 report or during Nonnamaker\u2019s deposition. At a minimum, plaintiffs should have attempted to introduce such evidence during the Rule 104 hearing. They did not. Thus, even if the second factor weighed in favor of plaintiffs prior to the district court\u2019s <em>Daubert </em>ruling, it did not after Nonnamaker was excluded on the merits. Under all the circumstances of this case, we cannot say the district court\u2019s denial of a continuance was arbitrary or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\"><em>B. Daubert </em>Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in granting defendants\u2019 <em>Daubert </em>motion. However, plaintiffs do not challenge the merits of the district court\u2019s <em>Daubert </em>ruling. Instead, plaintiffs contend that the district court should not have ruled on the <em>Daubert </em>motion because, due to Nonnamaker\u2019s alleged incompetence during the hearing, plaintiffs were unable to defend their position and the district court \u201cdid not have competent evidence from Plaintiffs to balance against Firestone\u2019s position.\u201d This argument is merely a reformulation of plaintiffs\u2019 argument that they should have been given a continuance and is rejected for the reasons already discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">C. Unfiled <em>Daubert </em>Response</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">Plaintiffs contend that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to permit them to file their untimely <em>Daubert </em>response. According to plaintiffs, their failure to file the <em>Daubert </em>response on the court-ordered deadline was excusable neglect under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 6(b) and 60(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although these rules give a district court the discretion to accept an untimely filing when excusable neglect is shown, they do not <em>require </em>a district court to do so. Therefore, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that plaintiffs\u2019 reason for missing the filing deadline constituted excusable neglect, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in refusing to permit plaintiffs to file their untimely <em>Daubert </em>response. <em>See Lujan v. Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n, </em>497 U.S. 871, 896 &amp; n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 3192 <em>&amp; </em>n. 5, 111 L.Ed.2d 695 (1990) (explaining that Rule 6(b) confers discretion on the district court to ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>cept untimely filings, but does not compel the district court to receive them).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-19\">. Nonnamaker also explained that a nylon overlay or nylon ply is made up of individual nylon cords that run around the tire over the top of the steel belts and under the tread. According to Nonnamaker, the nylon overlay provides a transition between the stiff steel and the flexible rubber at the edge of the steel belts, by \"absorbing the transmission from the stiffness of the steel to the rubber in which it's encased.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b881-10\">.

After lunch, Nonnamaker testified that he had seen the videotape in connection with another case and had recalled this fact during cross-examination. The district court asked Nonnamaker whether he recalled mis-speaking at any other time during his testimony and Nonnamaker responded that he did not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\">.
