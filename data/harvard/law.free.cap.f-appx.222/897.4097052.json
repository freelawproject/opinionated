Reversible error exists; we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for the district court to dismiss Riley\u2019s case without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-23\">Riley filed a complaint against Fairbanks in district court alleging violations of federal law \u2014 under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692 (\u201cFDCPA\u201d), the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 (\u201cRES-PA\u201d), and the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 (\u201cTILA\u201d) \u2014 and raising many state law claims, including breach of conduct, intentional misrepresentation, negligence, and unjust enrichment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Riley asserted, among other things, that the district court had federal question jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>over her federal law claims, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and supplemental jurisdiction over her state law claims, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">A magistrate judge ordered Riley to file an amended complaint with factual allegations on Fairbanks\u2019s allegedly unlawful acts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In her first amended complaint, Riley raised only four claims \u2014 breach of contract, fraud and suppression, negligence, and unjust enrichment \u2014 all of which arise under state law. Although Riley continued to assert that the district court could exercise federal question jurisdiction over her federal law claims and supplemental jurisdiction over her state law claims, her first amended complaint raised no claim arising under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">The magistrate ordered that Riley amend her first amended complaint to plead her fraud claim with the particularity required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). And the magistrate again ordered that Riley\u2019s second amended complaint could not incorporate by reference allegations raised in her initial or first amended complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Riley then filed a second amended complaint, in which she alleged the same four state law claims raised in her first amended complaint. Although Riley listed some federal statutes in the complaint\u2019s preamble and again asserted that the district court had federal question jurisdiction over her FDCPA, RESPA, and TILA claims, her second amended complaint did not contain such claims or other claims \u201carising under the Constitution, laws, or treatises of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Fairbanks filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">The magistrate issued a report and recommendation on Fairbanks\u2019s motion for summary judgment, explaining that Riley raised only state law claims in her second amended complaint. But the magistrate concluded that, because Riley originally brought both federal and state law claims against Fairbanks, the district court retained supplemental jurisdiction over her state law claims. The magistrate recommended that summary judgment be granted to Fairbanks; and the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">On appeal, the parties address only whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Fairbanks. Before we can consider these arguments, however, we must first address whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction in this case. <em>See Rolling Greens MHP, L.P. v. Comcast SCH Holdings L.L.C., </em>374 F.3d 1020, 1021 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that we will examine the subject matter jurisdiction of district courts in cases that we review). Although we liberally construe the pleadings drafted by <em>pro se </em>litigants, such as Riley, <em>see Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998), we still require them to \u201cconform to procedural rules.\u201d <em>Loren v. Sasser, </em>309 F.3d 1296, 1304 (11th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">\u201cAn amended pleading supersedes the former pleading; the original pleading is abandoned by the amendment, and is no longer a part of the pleader\u2019s averments against his adversary.\u201d <em>Dresdner Bank AG v. M/V Olympia Voyager, </em>463 F.3d 1210, 1215 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation omitted); <em>see also Fritz v. Standard Sec. Life Ins. Co., </em>676 F.2d 1356, 1358 (11th Cir.1982) (\u201cUnder the Federal Rules, an amended complaint supersedes the original complaint.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a), a district court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims \u201cthat are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy....\u201d But \u201cwhen the federal-law claims have dropped out of the lawsuit in its early stages and only state-law claims remain, the federal court should decline the exercise of jurisdiction by dismissing the case without prejudice.\u201d <em>Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, </em>484 U.S. 343, 108 S.Ct. 614, 619, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988); <em>see Scarfo v. Ginsberg, </em>175 F.3d 957, 962 (11th Cir.1999) (explaining that \u201conce the district court determines that subject matter jurisdiction over a plaintiffs federal claims does not exist, courts must dismiss a plaintiffs state law claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Here, Riley\u2019s second amended complaint did not include the federal law claims raised in her initial complaint. In fact, during her deposition in this case, Riley testified that her second amended complaint only raised four claims against Fairbanks \u2014 for breach of contract, fraud and suppression, negligence, and unjust enrichment. Although we are mindful of the liberal construction we apply to <em>pro se </em>pleadings, we believe that Riley abandoned her federal law claims at an early stage of this case because her second amended complaint \u2014 which superseded her previous complaints \u2014 raised only state law claims. For this reason, the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction in this <em>case</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and could not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Riley\u2019s state law claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Cohill, </em>108 S.Ct. at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>Therefore, because we conclude that the district court did not have federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 over the claims raised in Riley\u2019s second amended complaint, the supplemental jurisdiction provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 did not apply here. We vacate the judgment below and remand for the district court to dismiss this case without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Crotwell v. Hockman-Lewis Ltd., </em>734 F.2d 767, 769 (11th Cir.1984) (explaining that district court\u2019s dismissal of case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction should be without prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-15\">. In her complaint, Riley clearly separated the section of her \"federal claims\u201d from her asserted \"state claims.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b926-8\">. In her order, the magistrate specified that \"Plaintiff may not incorporate any allegations of her initial complaint by reference \u2014 the amended complaint must include all of [Plaintiff\u2019s] claims for relief and all of the facts she contends support those claims.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b927-5\">. We note that, in the statement of jurisdiction contained in its brief, Fairbanks asserts that the district court properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 because the parties are diverse and the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional minimum. But the district court did not rely on diversity jurisdiction in this case; instead, as we have discussed, the district court explained that it was exercising supplemental jurisdiction over Riley\u2019s state law claims because her initial complaint had included federal law claims. Riley \u2014 who had the burden to establish subject matter jurisdiction \u2014 never asserted diversity jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a) (providing, among other things, that complaint must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court\u2019s jurisdiction depends\u201d); <em>Sweet Pea Marine, Ltd. </em>v. <em>APJ Marine, Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1242, 1247 (11th Cir.2005) (\"The burden for establishing federal subject matter jurisdiction rests with the party bringing the claim.\u201d). Diversity jurisdiction \u2014 and, in particular, the required amount in controversy\u2014 is not evident from the face of Riley's complaint. <em>See Federated Mut. Ins. Co. v. McKinnon Motors, LLC, </em>329 F.3d 805, 807 (11th Cir.2003) (\"[T]o invoke a federal court's diversity jurisdiction, a plaintiff must claim, among other things, that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.... A plaintiff satisfies the amount in controversy requirement by claiming a sufficient sum in good faith.\u201d). The parties cannot create subject matter jurisdiction by agreement, <em>see Eagerton v. Valuations, Inc., </em>698 F.2d 1115, 1118 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201d[I]t is well established that subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived or conferred on a court by consent of the parties.\u201d); and we conclude that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over Riley\u2019s case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b927-8\">. The Seventh Circuit reached this conclusion in a similar case. In <em>Wellness Community National v. Wellness House, </em>70 F.3d 46 (7th Cir. 1995), the plaintiff filed a complaint alleging both federal and state law claims on a contract dispute. <em>Id. </em>at 48. Plaintiff's initial complaint asserted that both federal question and diversity jurisdiction existed. <em>Id. </em>But plaintiff's amended complaint dropped all federal law claims and asserted only diversity jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>The district court indicated that, even if it did not have diversity jurisdiction over the case, the court still could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff\u2019s state law claims. <em>Id. </em>at 50. But the Seventh Circuit vacated the district court\u2019s judgment, explaining that, because plaintiff abandoned its federal law claims before trial, the district court erred in determining that it could rely on supplemental jurisdiction to consider plaintiff's state law claims. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
