He contends that pursuant to <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005), sentences, including those imposed upon revocation of supervised release, are reviewed under the reasonableness standard. Further, he argues that the sentence imposed was unreasonable because it substantially exceeded the recommended range and the district court failed to articulate fact specific reasons for imposing the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-23\">The Government has moved for dismissal of the appeal or for summary affirmance on the ground that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider Thomas\u2019s appeal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4). Because Thomas cannot prevail on the merits of his appeal, we pretermit consideration of the jurisdictional issue. <em>See United States v. Weathersby, </em>958 F.2d 65, 66 (5th Cir.1992). The Government\u2019s motion for dismissal of the appeal or for summary affirmance is therefore denied. The Government\u2019s alternative request for an extension of time to file an appellate brief is also denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-24\">This court need not decide the appropriate standard of review for a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release in the wake of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because Thomas has not shown that his sentence was either unreasonable or plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1083, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006). Thomas was subject to a five-year statutory maximum sentence upon revocation of his supervised release on Counts One and Two, and a two-year statutory maximum sentence on Count Four. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(a)(2), 3559(a)(1) and (3), 3583(e)(3); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii), 846. The Sentencing Guidelines recommended a prison term of between 7 and 13 months based on Thomas\u2019s Grade C violations and his criminal history category of V. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). Therefore, the consecutive nine-month terms of imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>ment on each count followed by concurrent 24-month terms of supervised release on Counts One and Two were within the recommended range and neither unreasonable nor plainly unreasonable. <em>See Hinson, </em>429 F.3d at 120; <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 925-29 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR DISMISSAL OR SUMMARY AFFIRMANCE DENIED; ALTERNATIVE REQUEST FOR EXTENSION OF TIME DENIED AS UNNECESSARY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
