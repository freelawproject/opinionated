(\u201cForex\u201d), of an order issued by the district court affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision not to avoid as preferences certain payments made to Forex\u2019s creditors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Forex, which operated a business for its customers to purchase and trade foreign currency pursuant to a customer account agreement, filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on 8 January 1999.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the fall of 1998, less than 90 days before Forex filed for bankruptcy, various customers requested- \u2014 and received \u2014 a return of deposits given to Forex. These customers included Olita Cherese Hardin, Justin S. Sallusto, Ronald C. George, E. Michael Thomas, and Mary Hardin (the \u201cHardin defendants\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mari-ka Tolz, the bankruptcy trustee for Forex (the \u201cTrustee\u201d), filed complaints against the Hardin defendants under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(b) to avoid preferential transfers made to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">The case proceeded to trial in the bankruptcy court in September 2004. After a bench trial, the bankruptcy court rejected the argument raised by the Hardin defendants that the stockbroker defense of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 546(e) applied to prevent the Trustee from avoiding the transfers in this case. But the bankruptcy court did find that the Trustee could not avoid payments made to the Hardin defendants as preferences because the payments were made in the ordinary course of business pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(c)(2) (the \u201cordinary-course-of-business-defense\u201d). In reaching this decision, the bankruptcy court determined that Forex had not operated a Ponzi scheme, noting in particular that Forex did not offer a guaranteed high rate of return to investors and that the record lacked evidence that funds from later investors were used to pay earlier investors. The bankruptcy court also explained that, at an earlier hearing, the Trustee conceded that Forex did not operate a Ponzi scheme.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-12\">The Trustee appealed to the district court, arguing that the bankruptcy court had erred in finding that Forex had not operated a Ponzi or Ponzi-type scheme and that the ordinary-course-of-business-defense applied. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court on all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-13\">On appeal, the Trustee argues that the ordinary-course-of-business-defense does not apply to the transactions that Forex conducted with the Hardin defendants. Because we are the \u201csecond court of review of a bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment,\u201d we examine independently the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual and legal determinations; and we use the same standards of review as the district court. <em>In re Issac Leaseco, Inc., </em>389 F.3d 1205, 1209 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-14\">\u201cA determination of ordinary business terms under section [547(c)(2) ] is a question of fact subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. A conclusion by the district court that the factual findings of the bankruptcy court are not clearly erroneous is normally entitled to some persuasive weight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and citation omitted). And \u201c[cjlear error is a highly deferential standard of review.\u201d <em>Holton v. City of Thomasville Sch. </em>Dist., 425 F.3d 1325, 1350 (11th Cir.2005). A \u201cfinding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number><em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cThis standard plainly does not entitle a reviewing court to reverse the finding of the trier of fact simply because it is convinced that it would have decided the case differently.\u201d <em>Holton, </em>425 F.3d at 1351 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">Under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(b), a trustee may avoid preferential transfers made \u201cto or for the benefit of a creditor\u201d by the debtor on or within 90 days before the debtor filed his bankruptcy petition. But a trustee may not avoid some transfers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-6\">(A) in payment of a debt incurred by the debtor in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debt- or and the transferee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-7\">(B) made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the transferee; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-8\">(C) made according to ordinary business terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(c)(2) (1999).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The purpose of the ordinary-course-of-business defense is \u201cto leave undisturbed normal financial relations.\u201d <em>In re Craig Oil Co., </em>785 F.2d 1563, 1566 (11th Cir.1986) (internal quotation omitted). The defense \u201cshould protect those payments which do not result from unusual debt collection or payment practices.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-10\">A creditor who asserts the ordinary-course-of-business defense has the burden of showing each of the three elements of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(c)(2). \u201cAlthough the first two elements of the defense pertain to the conduct of the parties toward one another, the third element involves a broader inquiry.\u201d <em>Issac Leaseco, </em>389 F.3d at 1210. Therefore, about the third element, \u201c[a] creditor must show that the disputed transaction was made both in the course of regular dealings between the parties and in accordance with the standards of the relevant industry.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-13\">In this case, the Trustee argues that the Hardin defendants did not produce evidence in support of the first two elements of the ordinary-course-of-business defense because the defendants were investors with Forex instead of creditors who received money from Forex in payment of a debt. But, as the district court explained, the Trustee only can seek to avoid a preferential transfer made \u201cto or for the benefit of a creditor.\u201d <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(b)(1). And the Trustee does not point us&amp;emdash;in our review of the bankruptcy\u2019s court factual findings for clear error&amp;emdash;to evidence that supports the claim that the payments made by Forex to the Hardin defendants were not in regular dealings between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-14\">The Trustee also contends that the Hardin defendants failed to produce evidence that Forex\u2019s payments to them conformed with industry standards, which is required to satisfy the third element of the ordinary-course-of-business defense. The record contains deposition testimony of N.R. Karve, who gave $10,000 to Forex to buy foreign currency. After conducting only a few trades, Karve requested&amp;emdash;and received&amp;emdash;the balance of funds invested with Forex. Therefore, the record contains evidence that returning invested funds to its customers was part of the ordinary course of Forex\u2019s business. The Trustee has not persuaded us that the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding'&amp;emdash;that Forex\u2019s transactions with the Hardin defendants satisfied the requirements of the ordinary-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>course-of-business defense&amp;emdash;was clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AYF\">The Trustee next contends that Forex operated a Ponzi or \u201cPonzi-type\u201d scheme and that, as a result, the transfers made from Forex to the Hardin defendants could not have been made in the ordinary-course-of-business. We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual determination that Forex did not operate a Ponzi scheme for clear error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See In re Club Associates, </em>951 F.2d 1223, 1228 (11th Cir.1992) (\u201cFactual findings by the bankruptcy court are reviewed under the limited and deferential clearly erroneous standard.\u201d). \u201c[A] Ponzi scheme is a phony investment plan in which monies paid by later investors are used to pay artificially high returns to the initial investors, with the goal of attracting more investors.\u201d <em>United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1317 n. 6 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also Cunningham v. Brown, </em>265 U.S. 1, 44 S.Ct. 424, 68 L.Ed. 873 (1924) (providing origin for \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AvUs\">The Trustee cites the affidavit of Bruce Prestin, an accountant who reviewed Forex\u2019s books and records for the Trustee before the 2004 bankruptcy court trial. In his affidavit, Prestin stated, among other things, that money received by Forex from the Hardin defendants was co-mingled. The Trustee also relies on the trial testimony of Mark Singer, who worked for Forex and testified that Forex was underfunded. In addition, the Trustee cites Karve\u2019s testimony that a Forex representative told him that he would receive large profits on his investments with the company. But, as the district court noted, it is not clear that these statements to Karve were anything more than marketing puffery. Even though the record indicates that Forex may not have operated a well-run business, the record contains account statements showing that trades in foreign currency were made on Karve\u2019s account; and when Karve asked Forex for the balance of the funds in his account, he received that payment. Based on the record before us, we cannot say that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in determining that Forex did not operate a Ponzi or Ponzi-type scheme.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ANf\">Therefore, we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in determining that the ordinary-course-of-business defense applied in this case; and we affirm the denial of the Trustee\u2019s complaints to avoid preferential transfers made to the Hardin defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoo\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1099-15\">. We note that <em>Tolz v. Gawlick, </em>No. 06-10771, 222 Fed.Appx. 806, 2007 WL 30096 (11th Cir.2007) another appeal by the trustee in this case, is pending before us. In <em>Gawlick, </em>as in the present appeal, Forex\u2019s trustee appeals the district court\u2019s decision affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion that transfers made by Forex were not avoidable as preferences. The instant case was not consolidated with the <em>Gawlick </em>case by the district court; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>and these cases have not been consolidated on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">. Forex\u2019s bankruptcy case was converted to Chapter 7 on 1 March 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1100-9\">. The Trustee brought a complaint to recover preferential transfers against each creditor individually; but the bankruptcy court consolidated the cases of the Hardin defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1100-16\">.At that hearing, the Trustee instead argued that Forex operated a scheme with \"some similar characteristics [of a Ponzi scheme,] but it\u2019s not exactly a Ponzi scheme, like you'd read out of Black\u2019s Law [Dictionary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1101-11\">. Like the bankruptcy court and district court, we apply the version of section 547 in effect when Forex filed its bankruptcy petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AoCE\">.The Trustee asserts that the district court improperly relied on Roderick Hudnell\u2019s affidavit, which was submitted as part of the <em>Gawlick </em>case, in determining that Forex\u2019s transactions with the Hardin defendants occurred in the ordinary-course-of-business. Although the Trustee included Hudnell\u2019s affidavit and a transcript of his deposition testimony in the designation of items to be included in the record on appeal in the case of Ronald George, one of the Hardin defendants, we conclude that, even without consideration of the Hudnell affidavit, the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in deciding that the ordi-naty-course-of-business defense applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"ALb\">. We note that the Trustee does not argue that the district court applied the wrong standard in reviewing for clear error the bankruptcy court\u2019s determination that Forex did not operate a Ponzi scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"Aso\">. As a result, we need not decide whether a debtor who operates a Ponzi scheme can make transfers in the ordinary-course-of-business under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
