Solis was also charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by an illegal alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Solis challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Solis\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Solis contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that Almendarez-Torres remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Solis properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Solis also argues that the Government breached the terms of the plea agreement by failing to move to dismiss the firearm charge at his sentencing hearing. The Government concedes that it agreed to dismiss the firearm charge and joins Solis in seeking remand. However, the written judgment entered by the district court indicated that the \u201cCount(s) remaining is dismissed on the motion of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Where, as here, there was no objection to the breach of a plea agreement, the issue is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>328 F.3d 787, 790 (5th Cir.2003). \u201c \u2018The law is well settled that if there were any conflict between the oral pronouncement of judgment and the written judgment itself, the terms of the oral pronouncement would control,\u2019 \u201d but this court will allow a written judgment to clarify \u201can ambiguous oral sentence.\u201d <em>Schurmann v. United States, </em>658 F.2d 389, 391 (5th Cir.1981) (quoting <em>Scott v. United States, </em>434 F.2d 11, 20 (5th Cir.1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">Like the oral judgment at issue in <em>Schurmann, </em>the oral judgment of the district court in this case is silent on the point at issue and is therefore ambiguous. <em>See id. </em>at 389-90. The added detail provided by the written judgment clearly demonstrates that the district court intended that the firearm charge be \u201cdismissed on the motion of the United States,\u201d especially in light of the other evidence in the record that the Government promised to dismiss the firearm charge, as it now concedes. <em>See Schurmann, </em>658 F.2d at 390-91. Because the firearm count against Solis has already been dismissed by the district court, there was no plain error, <em>see Brown, </em>328 F.3d at 790, and remand is not necessary. <em>Schurmann, </em>658 F.2d at 390-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
