We review the Board\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2006). A motion for reconsideration asserts that the Board made an error in its earlier decision, <em>Turri v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 1306, 1311 n. 4 (10th Cir.1993), and requires the movant to specify the error of fact or law in the prior Board decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1) (2006); <em>Matter of Cerna, </em>20 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991) (noting that a motion to reconsider questions a decision for alleged errors in appraising the facts and the law). The burden is on the movant to establish that reconsideration is warranted. <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 110, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). \u201cTo be within a mile of being granted, a motion for reconsideration has to give the tribunal to which it is addressed a reason for changing its mind.\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 247, 249 (7th Cir.2004). Motions that simply repeat contentions that have already been rejected are insufficient to convince the Board to reconsider a previous decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">We find the Board did not abuse its discretion in finding that Newman\u2019s conviction for unlawful conversion of merchandise was a crime of moral turpitude. We further find the Board did not abuse its discretion in finding that the immigration judge specified the charges for which he was ordered removed. In addition, the immigration judge\u2019s failure to rule on other charges of removability was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
