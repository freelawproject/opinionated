The district court dismissed Davis\u2019s petition because it found that the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 did not apply, and therefore, Davis could not seek relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">On appeal, Davis argues that the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 applies, and he should be allowed to file a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Davis argues that he is actually innocent of being a leader or organizer, and, therefore, should not have received an enhanced sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a). More specifically, Davis argues that there was no evidence introduced in the district court to show his exercise of authority, degree of control, influence, or leadership. Davis does not argue that he is actually innocent of the substantive offense for which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. See Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). However, under limited circumstances, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255. That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-13\">[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-14\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Accordingly, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The burden of coming forward with evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy rests with the movant. <em>Dukes v. United States, </em>189 Fed.Appx. 850, 851 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-15\">When a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>and receive permission from this Court before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255. We have held that such restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244-45 (11th Cir.1999). Consequently, a petitioner who has filed a previous \u00a7 2255 motion which the court denied may not circumvent the AEDPA\u2019s successive-motion rule simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Id. </em>We have established that the savings clause only applies when (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the petitioner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense;\u201d and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244. In order for a prisoner to avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy under <em>Wofford, </em>all three criteria must be satisfied. <em>See id. </em>at 1244-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">A petitioner may not argue the merits of his claim until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that the savings clause applies to his claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3. If a petitioner successfully reaches the merits of his claim, the proper inquiry is whether the petitioner can overcome a procedural default for not raising the claim earlier by showing actual innocence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not err by dismissing Davis\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. Davis is precluded from seeking relief under \u00a7 2241 because \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d does not apply. Davis has not even attempted to comply with the first prong of the three-part <em>Wofford </em>test because he has not made any argument that his claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. Thus, we need not address the remaining prongs. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1245 (holding that \u201cthe only sentencing claims that may conceivably be covered by the savings clause are those based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision overturning circuit precedent\u201d). However, it is worth noting that Davis is challenging the length of his sentence due to the district court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a), which does not satisfy the second prong of the <em>Wofford </em>test because a sentencing enhancement has no connection to a conviction for a non-existent sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">Because Davis has not established the applicability of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, we do not need to consider the merits of his actual innocence claim. Davis\u2019s actual innocence claim is not relevant because he did not show that the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3 (stating that \u201c[o]nce the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies to open the portal to a \u00a7 2241 proceedings the proper inquiry in that \u00a7 2241 proceedings will be whether the petitioner can establish actual innocence of the crime for which he has been convicted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">Because Davis has not satisfied the three-part <em>Wofford </em>test, \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause does not apply, and, thus, Davis cannot seek relief under \u00a7 2241. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
