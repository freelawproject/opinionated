On appeal, the government argues that the district court improperly considered factors unrelated to Davis\u2019s substantial assistance in granting a downward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). Specifically, it contends that the district court imposed Davis\u2019s sentence after considering the sentences that it had imposed on his codefendants, without discussing his cooperation or considering the \u00a7 5K1.1 factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">We review the extent of a downward departure for an abuse of discretion, and the district court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 5K1.1 <em>de novo. United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1288 (11th Cir.2006). However, we review the government\u2019s \u201carguments raised for the first time on appeal for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Clark, </em>274 F.3d 1325, 1326 (11th Cir.2001). Plain error exists only where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-12\">(1) there is an error in the district court\u2019s determination; (2) the error is plain or obvious; (3) the error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">Pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1, sentencing courts are permitted to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines if the government has filed a motion indicating \u201cthat the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. In ruling on a government motion for departure based upon substantial assistance, district courts must consider the following factors, set forth in \u00a7 5K1.1: (1) \u201cthe court\u2019s evaluation of the significance and usefulness of the defendant\u2019s assistance, taking into consideration the government\u2019s evaluation of the assistance rendered;\u201d (2) \u201cthe truthfulness, completeness, and reliability of any information or testimony provided by the defendant\u201d; (3) \u201cthe nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s assistance;\u201d (4) \u201cany injury suffered, or any danger or risk of injury to the defendant or his family resulting from his assistance;\u201d and (5) \u201cthe timeliness of the defendant\u2019s assistance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1(a); <em>see United States v. Martin, 455 </em>F.3d 1227, 1235 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">\u201c[District courts are prohibited from considering sentencing factors unrelated to the nature and extent of a defendant\u2019s assistance in making \u00a7 5K1.1 departures.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>455 F.3d at 1236. Although sentencing courts may consider factors beyond those included in the \u00a7 5K1.1 list, they may do so \u201conly if they are related to the assistance rendered.\u201d <em>Crisp, </em>454 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>at 1289. \u201cBecause a substantial assistance departure is to be about assistance and nothing else, the sentencing court may not permissibly consider the sentencing factors announced in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when exercising its discretion in deciding whether and how much to depart under \u00a7 5K1.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted). Rather, a sentencing court first should decide the nature and extent of an assistance departure by considering the \u00a7 5K1.1 factors. <em>United States v. McVay, </em>447 F.3d 1348, 1356-57 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">In evaluating substantial assistance, the court should make a \u201cdetermination that is individualized to the defendant based on the relevant factors and more specific than a simple statement that the reduction is based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1354. Where the court fails to discern the defendant\u2019s assistance, including the extent thereof, and further fails to explain why it has rejected the government\u2019s recommended sentence, we have found that resentencing is necessary. <em>Id. </em>at 1356. Moreover, when we vacate and remand for resentencing based on the district court\u2019s improper consideration of factors unrelated to substantial assistance under \u00a7 5K1.1, and the court\u2019s failure to explain its reasoning underlying the departure, we need not address the permissible extent of the downward departure, nor the overall reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">As an initial matter, while the district court acknowledged an objection for the government on the basis of reasonableness at the sentencing hearing, the government did not object specifically to the sentence on the basis of the downward departure. As a result, we will review the district court\u2019s decision for plain error. <em>See Clark, </em>274 F.3d at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Because Davis had at least two prior drug-related felonies, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) instructed that he receive a life sentence. Thus, the only way that the district court could reduce his sentence would be if the government made a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (\u201cUpon motion of the Government, the court shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as a minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Here, however, the district court essentially relied on the conduct of coconspirators, and the sentences that they had received, in determining Davis\u2019s sentence. This is a proper consideration suited for a reasonableness analysis under \u00a7 3553(a) but not for a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). While the court recited the \u00a7 5K1.1 factors, and asserted that it had considered them in determining Davis\u2019s sentence, it did so after it already had announced his sentence of 78 months\u2019 imprisonment. Moreover, the court gave no meaningful explanation of how it had evaluated Davis\u2019s substantial assistance on an individualized basis, nor how its reasoning had differed from the government\u2019s. Rather, the record clearly indicates that the court was simply fashioning a sentence comparable to that of Davis\u2019s co-conspirators, which was an impermissible consideration under \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>See Crisp, </em>454 F.3d at 1289. Because Davis\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence was life imprisonment, and the government moved for a downward departure recommending instead 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, the district court\u2019s improper consideration of \u00a7 3553(a) factors as a basis for granting a downward departure, and imposing a sentence of 78 months\u2019 imprisonment, constitutes plain error. <em>See Clark, </em>274 F.3d at 1329. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>Based on these impermissible considerations alone, we vacate and remand for resentencing. <em>See Crisp, </em>454 F.3d at 1289; <em>McVay, </em>447 F.3d at 1356.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-16\">.
