Magnotti, a Florida prisoner serving a 25-year sentence for robbery, appeals <em>pro se </em>the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), governs this appeal because Magnotti filed his \u00a7 2254 petition after the effective date of the AEDPA. The district court granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) as to the following two issues: (1) whether sufficient evidence supported Magnotti\u2019s conviction; and (2) whether Magnotti received ineffective assistance of his trial counsel. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">Magnotti filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition in the district court alleging that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction and that he received ineffective assistance of his trial counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With regard to his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, Magnotti asserted that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request jury instructions on the lesser included offenses of theft and attempted robbery, and for requesting instructions on the lesser included offense of robbery by sudden snatching, where the evidence supporting the robbery charge was not overwhelming. The state opposed Magnotti\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition and attached relevant portions of the state court record, which set forth the following procedural and factual history.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-13\">At Magnotti\u2019s trial, Sally Wood testified as the state\u2019s first witness. Wood testified that, on July 13, 2001, she had been working as a bank teller for approximately one and one half months. As part of her training for her bank teller job, she was instructed that, if the bank was robbed, she should do exactly what the robber asked and, after the robbery was over, she should write down all the details and not talk to anyone. At approximately 3:30 on a busy Friday afternoon at the bank, Wood called the next customer in line to her window. Magnotti walked up to Wood\u2019s window and said, \u201c[t]his is a hold-up, I want your hundreds, fifties and twenties, now.\u201d Magnotti did not display a weapon. Wood began to put money up on her counter and she felt \u201c[ejxtremely upset, nervous, afraid.\u201d Wood stated that, because there was a very thick wall between fier<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>self and Magnotti, she knew that he could not get to her, but that she \u201cwas deathly afraid.\u201d Wood then gave Magnotti the money and he left the bank. Wood next went to the back room of the bank and wrote down her description of Magnotti.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">On cross-examination, Wood testified that she did not think any person could get to her through the glass that separated her from the customers and that Magnotti did not yell or make any threats. She further stated that she \u201cwas not in fear of death, but [she] was deathly scared, the mere fact of somebody coming up and demanding money.\u201d Wood stated that she knew she could not be hurt because of the wall between her and Magnotti. On redirect, Wood testified that she did not see a weapon, but that she had no idea whether Magnotti had a weapon or not. She further stated that she was scared to death and she was in fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Magnotti elected not to testify in his own defense, nor did he provide any defense witnesses. Magnotti moved for judgment of acquittal, arguing that the evidence did not support the charge of robbery. The district court denied the motion. Magnotti\u2019s counsel then requested that the court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of robbery by sudden snatching, but declined to request instructions on any other lesser included offenses. The trial court next gave the jury charge, instructing the jury that, if it found that the state had not proved the elements of robbery beyond a reasonable doubt, that it would have to decide if the state proved the elements of the lesser included offense of robbery by sudden snatching. The jury found Magnotti guilty of robbery as charged in the information. Thereafter, the trial court sentenced Magnotti to 25 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Magnotti appealed his conviction and sentence to the Fourth District Court of Appeal of Florida, arguing that the trial court had erred in denying his motions for acquittal and a new trial on the grounds that the evidence presented at trial did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Wood would have been in fear of great bodily injury or death, as was required by the robbery statute. The state appellate court affirmed Magnotti\u2019s conviction and sentence. In so doing, the state court cited Florida\u2019s robbery statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.13(1). The court found that the \u201cfear\u201d contemplated by the robbery statute would be established \u201cif the circumstances attendant to the robbery were such as to ordinarily induce fear in the mind of a reasonable person,\u201d regardless of the actual state of mind of the victim. The court then concluded that, in Magnotti\u2019s case, the victim testified that she was afraid and, moreover, the circumstances were such that the jury could conclude that the victim would have had fear of death or great bodily harm because: (1) Magnotti\u2019s use of the phrase \u201chold-up\u201d connoted a forcible robbery; (2) an ordinary person in Wood\u2019s place would have feared that Magnotti had a weapon that he would have used to get the money; and (3) the glass between Magnotti and Wood would not have sufficed to remove the fear of an ordinary person in Wood\u2019s position. The court thereafter denied Magnotti\u2019s motion for rehearing and mandate issued on May 23, 2003. On September 5, 2003, the Florida Supreme Court declined to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">Magnotti then petitioned for post-conviction relief pursuant to Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.850, arguing, among other things, that his trial counsel was ineffective for requesting the jury instruction on robbery by sudden snatching and for failing to request jury instructions on the lesser included offense of petit theft. The state responded that Magnotti had not demonstrated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>suffered prejudice, as required under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), because the evidence overwhelmingly established that Magnotti committed robbery and, further, that there was no reasonable probability that the jury would have convicted him of a lesser offense. The state court denied Magnotti\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion for the reasons indicated in the state\u2019s response. Magnotti appealed the denial of his Rule 3.850 motion to the state appellate court, and the court denied the motion without opinion. After the state appellate court denied Magnotti\u2019s motions for certification and rehearing, mandate issued on March 10, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Based upon the above-detailed record, the district court denied Magnotti\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. Magnotti moved for a COA, which the district court granted on these two issues only: (1) whether there was sufficient evidence to support Magnotti\u2019s robbery conviction; and (2) whether Magnotti\u2019s counsel was ineffective for failing to request jury instructions on lesser included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition <em>de novo, </em>while the court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>See Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). Mixed questions of law and fact, including ineffective assistance of counsel claims, are reviewed <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">As amended by the AEDPA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) forbids federal courts from granting habeas relief on claims that were previously adjudicated in state court, unless the adjudication was (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the United States Supreme Court,\u201d or (2) \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). A state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law if either \u201c(1) the state court applied a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth by Supreme Court case law, or (2) when faced -with materially indistinguishable facts, the state court arrived at a result different from that reached in a Supreme Court case.\u201d <em>Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1241 (11th Cir.2001). An \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law may occur if the state court \u201cidentifies the correct legal rule from Supreme Court case law but unreasonably applies that rule to the facts of the petitioner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn unreasonable application may also occur if a state court unreasonably extends, or unreasonably declines to extend, a legal principle from Supreme Court case law to a new context.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Moreover, a state court\u2019s factual findings are presumed correct, and the petitioner can rebut them only by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). As such, for a state court\u2019s adjudication to result in an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented, \u201c[n]ot only must the factual determination have been unreasonable, but the state court\u2019s factual findings must be shown unreasonable by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Callahan v. Campbell, </em>427 F.3d 897, 926 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 427, 166 L.Ed.2d 269 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">Magnotti argues on appeal that, pursuant to the Florida robbery statute and case law cited by the state appellate court, the state had to prove that Wood had fear of death or great bodily harm from his actions. Magnotti maintains that a finding that a reasonable person would have been objectively afraid is unsupported by the evidence because: (1) Wood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>testified that she was not in fear of death or bodily harm; (2) there was a secure barrier between Wood and Magnotti; (3) the bank\u2019s procedures required Wood not to resist Magnotti\u2019s demands; (4) Magnotti did not have a weapon; and (5) Magnotti did not make any threats or loud, sudden movements. He further argues that even a subjective fear of death or bodily injury was not present in his case in light of Wood\u2019s testimony. He also asserts that the state court\u2019s reliance on certain state precedent was contrary to established Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">In <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>the Supreme Court held that, when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, the \u201ccritical inquiry\u201d is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2788-89, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court noted that it is the duty of the trier of fact \u201cto resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts,\u201d and a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment as to whether it believes the evidence to be sufficient to sustain a conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">In Florida, the offense of robbery is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-6\">the taking of money or other property which may be the subject of larceny from the person or custody of another, with intent to either permanently or temporarily deprive the person or the owner of the money or other property, when in the course of the taking there is the use of force, violence, assault, or putting in fear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.13(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">Here, to the extent that Magnotti argues that the sufficiency-of-the-evidenee standard used by the state appellate court was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, his argument is without merit. It is noteworthy that the state court did not cite <em>Jackson </em>in reviewing Magnotti\u2019s sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge. Nonetheless, Magnotti does not point out any part of the state court\u2019s decision that was contrary to <em>Jackson, </em>and the record establishes that the state court considered the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, cited the relevant state law, and did not re-weigh the evidence. <em>See Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 318-19, 99 S.Ct. at 2788-89; <em>see also Early v. Packer, </em>537 U.S. 3, 8, 123 S.Ct. 362, 365, 154 L.Ed.2d 263 (2002) (holding that a state court does not have to cite to Supreme Court \u201ceases-indeed, [\u00a7 2254(d) ] does not even require <em>awareness </em>of [its] cases, so long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the state-court decision contradicts them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">As to the question of whether there was sufficient evidence to support the \u201cputting in fear\u201d element of Magnotti\u2019s robbery conviction, the state court determined that its precedent required a showing that the robbery would have \u201cordinarily induced fear in the mind of a reasonable person.\u201d <em>See State v. Baldwin, </em>709 So.2d 636, 637 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1998). According to <em>Baldwin, </em>the state does not have to prove that the defendant\u2019s conduct was itself threatening or forceful, but only that \u201cthe conduct would induce fear in the mind of a reasonable person notwithstanding that the conduct is not expressly threatening.\u201d <em>Baldwin, </em>709 So.2d at 637-38. Magnotti does not contend that the <em>Baldwin </em>standard is not the proper standard for determining whether he put Wood in fear during the incident. Rather, he argues that the evidence established that Wood had no fear. The evidence presented at trial dem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>onstrated that Magnotti walked into a bank, stated that it was a \u201chold-up,\u201d and demanded money. Moreover, Wood testified that she was \u201cdeathly afraid\u201d during the robbery as she placed the money on the counter. Such evidence was sufficient to establish that Magnotti\u2019s conduct would have induced fear in the mind of a reasonable person, notwithstanding Magnotti\u2019s argument that his conduct was not expressly threatening. <em>See Baldwin, </em>709 So.2d at 637-38. Thus, the state court\u2019s analysis was not contrary to, and did not involve an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Magnotti\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as to his insufficiency-of-the-evidence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">B. Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Magnotti argues that his counsel was deficient in requesting a jury instruction on the offense of robbery by sudden snatching because that offense was not actually a lesser included offense to robbery and, further, was not supported by the evidence from his trial. He further argues that, in light of the facts of his case, his counsel should have requested jury instructions on simple theft, grand theft, and attempted robbery. Magnotti contends that his counsel\u2019s decision to not request instructions on other offenses was not entitled to deference because, as the district court noted, it was an inexplicable decision. He also asserts that he suffered prejudice as a result of his counsel\u2019s decisions because the evidence left the jury with nothing to debate as to his guilt on the robbery charge and, because his counsel did not request instructions on lesser included offenses, the jury had no alternative offense for which to convict him. Magnotti lastly argues that the state court and district court erred in denying his request for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of his counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">The Sixth Amendment provides that a criminal defendant shall have the right to \u201cthe assistance of counsel for his defense.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. When a convicted defendant claims that his counsel\u2019s assistance was ineffective, the defendant must show that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. \u201cFor performance to be deficient, it must be established that, in light of all the circumstances, counsel\u2019s performance was outside the wide range of professional competence.\u201d <em>Putman, </em>268 F.3d at 1243. Reviewing courts must be highly deferential in reviewing a counsel\u2019s performance, and must utilize the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s performance was reasonable. <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1314 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201c[B]e-cause counsel\u2019s conduct is presumed reasonable, for a petitioner to show that the conduct was unreasonable, a petitioner must establish that no competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315. Under the prejudice prong, the defendant must show \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">In Magnotti\u2019s case, the state court decision was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. First, while the state court decision denying Magnotti\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim did not directly cite <em>Strickland, </em>the court nonetheless denied the claim for the reasons indicated in the state\u2019s response to Magnotti\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion, which explicitly relied upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number><em>Strickland. </em>Thus, the state court correctly identified <em>Strickland </em>as the controlling law and properly applied it to Magnotti\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. <em>See Robinson v. Moore, </em>300 F.3d 1320, 1343 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that, \u201c[i]t is well established that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Strickland </em>is the controlling legal authority to be applied to ineffective assistance of counsel claims\u201d) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Moreover, the state court did not unreasonably apply the law from <em>Strickland </em>to the facts of Magnotti\u2019s case. Here, the state court and the district court determined that Magnotti failed to establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his counsel\u2019s decisions. As discussed in issue one above, the evidence presented at Magnotti\u2019s trial was sufficient to sustain a conviction for robbery. As such, even assuming without deciding that Magnotti\u2019s counsel was deficient in failing to request jury instructions on other lesser included offenses, that deficiency does not suggest that there was a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different because the jury had sufficient evidence to find Magnotti guilty of the greater offense of robbery. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 693-94, 104 S.Ct. at 2068 (explaining that a reviewing court should presume that the jury acted according to law). Therefore, Magnotti\u2019s argument, that the jury would have convicted him of a lesser offense had it been given the instructions on such an offense, is not conclusive where the jury properly convicted him of robbery based upon the evidence presented at trial. Furthermore, the jury would have performed its duties in violation of the law had it convicted Magnotti of a lesser offense in the face of sufficient evidence for the greater offense. <em>See id. </em>(holding that \u201c[a] defendant has no entitlement to the luck of a lawless decisionmaker, even if a lawless decision cannot be reviewed. The assessment of prejudice should proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision. It should not depend on the idiosyncracies of the particular decision-maker, such as unusual propensities toward harshness or leniency\u201d). Similarly, Magnotti\u2019s counsel\u2019s request for instructions on the lesser offense of robbery by sudden snatching did not prejudice Magnotti because the jury found Magnotti guilty of robbery based upon sufficient evidence in the record. Accordingly, the district court properly denied Magnotti\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as to his ineffeetive-assistance-of-counsel claim because he failed to show that he suffered prejudice as a result of his counsel\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">Magnotti has not met his burden under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). In light of the foregoing, the district court\u2019s denial of Magnotti\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition is</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-11\">. Magnotti raised two separate claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel: (1) counsel failed to request jury instructions on lesser included offenses; and (2) counsel failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s improper arguments. The district court granted a COA only as to Magnotti\u2019s argument that his counsel was ineffective for failing to request jury instructions on lesser included offenses. Accordingly, Magnotti's remaining claim of ineffective assistance is not presently before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
