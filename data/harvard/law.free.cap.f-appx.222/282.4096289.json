Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Barnes was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to commit bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (2000) (Count One), aiding and abetting armed bank robbery, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (d) (2000) (Count Two), and aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000) (Count Three).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">On remand, the district court went below the advisory guidelines range and imposed concurrent sentences of 36 months on Counts One and Two. The court reimposed a consecutive 84-month sentence on Count Three. On appeal, Barnes does not challenge the sentences on Counts One and Two but contends that the consecutive 84-month sentence for aiding and abetting brandishing of a weapon on Count Three violated the Sixth Amendment. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Barnes\u2019 argument that <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), was \u201cimplicitly overruled\u201d by <em>Booker </em>is without merit. While the Supreme Court may revisit its decision in <em>Harris </em>after <em>Booker, </em>until it does so, <em>Harris </em>remains law. <em>See Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., </em>490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989) (\u201cIf a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Barnes next argues that the district court applied the wrong standard of proof in determining that he aided and abetted brandishing a firearm. As Barnes argues, proof that a defendant aided and abetted a violation of \u00a7 924(c) requires proof that the defendant knew to a practical certainty, or had actual knowledge, that the principal would use a gun. <em>See United States v. Spinney, </em>65 F.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir.1995). We conclude the district court applied this standard on resentencing and there was sufficient evidence to prove Barnes had actual knowledge a firearm would be brandished during the armed bank robbery. We therefore find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Barnes\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
