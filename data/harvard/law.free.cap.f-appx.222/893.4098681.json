On appeal, Torres contends that the IJ erred in denying his request for CAT relief after finding that the Colombian government did not acquiesce in his torture.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>Torres argues that where \u201ca government knows that a private group is torturing people and is unable or unwilling to protect the victims, the government has \u2018acquiesced\u2019 in that torture.\u201d Torres concedes that he is not entitled to relief under Eleventh Circuit precedent. However, he requests that we adopt the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186 (9th Cir.2003), and find that CAT petitioners must only prove that public officials are aware of the torture and fail to intervene to prevent the torture. <em>Id. </em>1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">When the BIA does not render its own opinion, but instead adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>D-Muhumed v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). We review <em>de novo </em>legal determinations, and we review factual determinations under the substantial evidence test, affirming the decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817-18. \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">To qualify for CAT relief, the applicant must establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). \u201cTorture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.18(a)(2). To constitute torture, the actor must specifically intend to cause severe mental or physical pain; an act causing unanticipated or unintended pain is not torture. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.18(a)(5). Additionally, the torture must be inflicted by a government official or at the instigation or with the acquiescence of a government official or someone acting in an official capacity. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">CAT relief carries a higher legal standard than asylum, and that standard is very difficult to meet. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1303 (11th Cir.2001) (noting that the \u201cmore likely than not\u201d CAT standard is harder to meet than the \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u201d standard applicable to asylum claims). Evidence of past torture is relevant in determining whether the applicant is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to face future torture if removed. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(3)(i). We have held that beating an applicant with fists, sticks and belts did not rise to the level of torture. <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2004). We have also determined that a pattern of threatening phone calls is insufficient to establish torture. <em>Sanchez v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 436, 438 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">Initially we note that, on appeal, Torres makes no argument about the IJ\u2019s finding that he failed to prove that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured upon returning to Colombia. Issues not argued on appeal are abandoned. <em>Huang v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>429 F.3d 1002, 1007 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Therefore, Torres has abandoned this issue, and the BIA\u2019s denial of his CAT claim can be affirmed on this basis. Nevertheless, we also find that the IJ\u2019s decision to deny Torres\u2019 CAT claim was clearly supported by substantial evidence because he failed to establish either \u201ctorture\u201d or \u201cacquiescence\u201d by the Colombian government.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">First, the IJ properly determined that Torres failed to prove that he was tortured or would be tortured, within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>CAT meaning of the term, if removed to Colombia. Torres testified that he was hit and insulted by members of the FARC, was briefly kidnapped, and had received threatening phone calls. However, none of this amounted to torture under the applicable regulations, which require \u201can extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment.\u201d <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1), (2). Additionally, Torres testified that he was not harmed by the FARC when he was in Colombia from March 2001 through August 2001, and, although his parents and brother have remained in Colombia, they have not been harmed in any way by the FARC. Because Torres did not present evidence that he had previously been tortured by the FARC, and because neither he nor any family members was physically harmed after the kidnapping incident, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Torres failed to prove that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Second, the IJ\u2019s determination that Torres failed to prove that the Colombian government acquiesced in the actions of the FARC is supported by substantial evidence. For the CAT to apply, torture must occur \u201cwith the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d <em>Id </em>\u00a7 208.18(a)(1). This requires \u201cthat the public official, prior to the activity constituting torture, have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.18(a)(7). We have affirmed the BIA\u2019s holding that a government does not \u201cacquiesce\u201d to torture where the government \u201cactively, albeit not entirely successfully, combats\u201d the illegal activities. <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted). In determining whether a government is combating the actions of a private actor- and not acquiescing-the IJ may \u201crely heavily\u201d on any reports prepared by the United States Department of State that are admitted into evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Torres admits that he never told the Colombian authorities about the kidnapping, and we find no evidence in the record indicating that public officials were otherwise aware of the FARC\u2019s actions with regard to Torres. Furthermore, the IJ pointed out that the United States Department of State issued a report, which was admitted into evidence, describing the efforts of the Colombian government to combat the FARC\u2019s illegal activities. Specifically, the report indicated that the government has an elite anti-kidnapping unit. The IJ properly relied on this report to show that the Colombian government is actively trying to combat the FARC\u2019s illegal actions, including kidnapping. Consequently, the IJ did not err in finding that the Colombian government had not acquiesced to the FARC\u2019s actions. For these reasons Torres\u2019 petition is denied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW ARE DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-13\">. Beltre Maria Magdalena, Leonardo Torres and Laura Torres are the wife, son and daughter respectively of Jorge Torres.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b922-25\">. We only consider Torres' CAT claim as he withdrew his asylum application and has abandoned his withholding of removal claim by failing to raise it on appeal here. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number><em>Huang v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>429 F.3d <em>1002, 1007 </em>n. 2 <em>(11th Cir.2005).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b924-5\">. We need not reach the question of whether we are foreclosed by existing circuit precedent from following the Ninth Circuit's holding in <em>Zheng, </em>332 F.3d 1186, because the record in this case clearly indicates that the Colombian government is not willfully blind to the illegal activities of the FARC. Instead, the Colombian government is actively expending time and resources to curb illegal FARC activities. <em>See Reyes-Sanchez, </em>369 F.3d at 1242 n. 6 (declining to adopt the holding in Zheng where it was not necessary to resolve the issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
