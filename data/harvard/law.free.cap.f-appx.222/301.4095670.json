We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-24\">As found by the district court, Poston\u2019s complaint raises challenges to his underlying criminal conviction. Because Poston has made no showing that his conviction has been reversed, expunged, declared invalid by a state court, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, we find that his claims are not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 or under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) (2000). <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); <em>Stephenson v. Reno, </em>28 F.3d 26, 26-27 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.1994) (per curiam) (applying holding in <em>Heck </em>to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 claim). To the extent that Poston\u2019s claims against the federal defendants could be construed as arising under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), we find that these claims are also barred by the rationale set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Heck. See Stephenson, </em>28 F.3d at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-25\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-26\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
