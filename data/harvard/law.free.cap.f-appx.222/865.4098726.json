After review, we dismiss in part and deny in part Candra\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">A. Candra\u2019s Application and Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">On September 24, 2000, Candra, a native and citizen of Indonesia, entered the United States as a non-immigrant visitor for pleasure with authorization to remain until March 23, 2001. Candra stayed in the United States past the authorized six-month period. On April 30, 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) served Candra with a notice to appear, charging him with removability for overstaying his visa, pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), (a)(1)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), (a)(1)(C)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-15\">On March 10, 2004, Candra filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), alleging persecution in Indonesia based on his race, ethnic Chinese, and religion, Buddhist. According to Candra\u2019s asylum application and hearing testimony, Candra experienced three incidents of alleged persecution while in Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-16\">First, in 1995, while attending a Catholic high school, Candra was involved in a fight between Chinese students from his school and students from a Muslim school. As Candra turned to run and get help from a teacher, he was hit from behind with a brick and knocked unconscious. He also was hit with a stick on the chest and arm. Candra was treated at the hospital for bruises. He reported the incident to the police, but received no indication that an investigation took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-17\">The second incident occurred in 1997. Candra was riding a bus that stopped in front of a Muslim school and picked up some passengers. One of these passengers held a knife to Candra\u2019s stomach and demanded money. As he did so, the robber stated to the other passengers, \u201cThis is the student from the Chinese school, let\u2019s rob him.\u201d Candra gave the man his money and got off the bus. He did not report this incident to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-18\">The third incident occurred in 1998 while Candra was attending college. During a large anti-corruption demonstration, attended mostly by Chinese students but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>also by some indigenous Indonesian students, the police began to beat many of the Chinese students, including Candra, with their batons. Candra was injured on his right forearm, but did not seek treatment. He also did not report this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Candra also testified that he had left Indonesia because Muslims, with the help of the Indonesian government, \u201csuppress\u201d ethnic Chinese. Candra noted that, when he turned seventeen, he was required to get identification and change his Chinese name, Xin Pox Yong, to an Indonesian name. Candra\u2019s family, including his mother, father and older brother, continue to live in Indonesia, but live in fear because of the unstable situation there.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Candra decided to come to the United States because he had relatives who live here. He arrived in September 2000 with his mother. However, his mother returned to Indonesia to assist one of his siblings with her wedding. Candra\u2019s mother has since called to tell him she does not feel safe in Indonesia and would like to come to the United States. His parents mostly stay at home and send maids to get food at the market. However, his brother works and consequently leaves the house frequently. Candra decided to apply for asylum because he felt that conditions in Indonesia had not become better and he feared that if he returned his life would be threatened and he would be attacked again.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">B. Articles</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Candra submitted several news and other articles about the conditions ethnic Chinese face in Indonesia. These articles revealed, among other things, that ethnic Chinese, while a small percentage of the population, have enjoyed economic prosperity in Indonesia. Beginning in the 1950s, the Indonesian government implemented certain laws and economic policies that discriminated against the Chinese, such as prohibiting them from joining the military or civil service or from owning a business beyond the local level and also banning the use of Chinese characters and Chinese language publications and closing Chinese schools and temples. Anti-Chinese sentiments came to a head in May 1998, during the authoritarian rule of President Suharto, when riots broke out targeting ethnic Chinese. During these riots, over a thousand people were killed, including ethnic Chinese, and many Chinese-owned shops and houses were destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">The riots led to the resignation of President Suharto. His successor, President Habibe, issued decrees in 1998 and 1999 ordering government officials to treat all Indonesians the same and banning discrimination based on ethnicity. In 2000, the government repealed laws banning the use of Chinese characters, Chinese language publications and the celebration of the Chinese New Year. Nonetheless, many discriminatory laws remain on the books in Indonesia and ethnic Chinese still face discrimination, often from corrupt government officials who require them to pay bribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">In October 2004, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his running mate Jusuf Kalla were elected in Indonesia\u2019s first direct presidential election. Jusuf Kalla, who had worked in President Suharto\u2019s government, worried many ethnic Chinese when he stated during the election that he was considering lowering interest rates on business loans for indigenous Indonesians. This statement sparked concerns that Kalla planned to re-implement old economic policies that had favored indigenous Indonesians. In an October 2004 interview, Kalla was asked whether his proposed lending policy would be discriminatory to ethnic Chinese Indonesians, and responded, \u201cWould you [Indonesian Chi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>nese] choose to be discriminated against or you prefer to be burned out and hunted down?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">C. 2004 Country Report</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Candra also submitted the United States Department of State\u2019s 2004 Country Report on Human Rights Practices. According to the Country Report, the Indonesian government officially promotes racial and ethnic tolerance. In addition, the Country Report states that \u201c[i]nstances of discrimination and harassment of ethnic Chinese Indonesians declined compared with previous years.\u201d Although former-President Megawati had called on immigration officials to stop requiring ethnic Chinese Indonesians to show citizenship papers, many ethnic Chinese citizens still reported being asked to do so. Finally, the Country Report noted that \u201cmore than 60 articles of law, regulation, or decree were in effect that discriminated against ethnic Chinese citizens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">D. IJ\u2019s Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">The IJ denied Candra relief and granted him voluntary departure. Specifically, the IJ denied Candra\u2019s asylum application because it was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">With regard to Candra\u2019s claim for withholding of removal, the IJ made no adverse credibility findings, but found that Candra had failed to produce any evidence to support his religious persecution claim. As to Candra\u2019s ethnic persecution claim, the IJ concluded that Candra had failed to show either that the three incidents he had cited rose to the level of persecution or that they had a sufficient nexus to his ethnicity. The IJ also concluded that Candra did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution and that the record did not support the finding that Chinese Indonesians faced a threat was so systematic or pervasive as to amount to a pattern or practice of persecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">Candra appealed to the BIA, which adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Candra filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AEX\">A. Asylum Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b896-14\">On appeal, Candra seeks to challenge the dismissal of his asylum application as time-barred. However, we lack appellate jurisdiction to review this claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201cPursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), the Attorney General\u2019s decision regarding whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances, such that the time limit should be waived, is not renewable by any court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-15\">Candra argues that the IJ\u2019s legal error as to the timeliness of his asylum application constitutes a due process violation over which we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to the Real ID Act. Under the Real ID Act, the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of the INA are not to be construed \u201cas precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law....\u201d INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Candra\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>in which we concluded that \u201c[t]he timeliness of an asy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>lum application is not a constitutional claim or question of law covered by the Real ID Act\u2019s changes.\u201d 427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">B. Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Candra next contends that the IJ and BIA erred in concluding that he had not established eligibility for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An alien seeking withholding of removal must show that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). In other words, the alien has the burden of proof to show he \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d would be persecuted on account of one of the five protected grounds if returned to the country in question. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir. 2003). To establish eligibility, the alien must show either that he suffered past persecution or that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1), (2); <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">1. <em>Past Persecution</em></p>\n<p id=\"AT7\">Candra argues that he established past persecution by showing that he was physically assaulted by Muslim high school students in 1995, robbed at knife point while riding a bus in 1997, and beaten by police during a 1998 demonstration because of his Chinese ethnicity. However, these incidents do not compel the conclusion that Candra experienced past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">First, there is no clear indication that any of the incidents was motivated by Candra\u2019s Chinese heritage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The first incident involved a schoolyard fight between students from different schools. The record does not disclose why or how the fight started. The second incident involved a robbery, which suggests an economic motive. Although the robber commented on Candra\u2019s ethnicity, this statement could have meant only that Candra was a worthwhile target given that the ethnic Chinese in Indonesia are widely perceived as more affluent. The comment certainly does not compel the conclusion that the robber was motivated by Candra\u2019s ethnicity. The third incident involved a large, anti-corruption demonstration attended by both ethnic Chinese and indigenous Indonesian students at which the police were trying to control the crowd. In short, the motive for each of these incidents is ambiguous at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">Furthermore, in each incident, Candra was either uninjured or received only minor injuries. Each incident was one of a kind and occurred at least one year apart. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>We cannot say that these three isolated incidents, occurring over the course of several years and involving no more than minor injuries, constitute the kind of mistreatment that would compel a conclusion of persecution. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">2. <em>Well-founded Fear of Future Persecution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Candra also argues that he established a well-founded fear of future persecution. To establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, the alien must show that his fear is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1289 (11th Cir. 2001). Ordinarily, the alien must present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of [a statutory factor].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1287 (quotation marks omitted). However, an alien may also sustain his burden of proof without showing that he would be singled out for persecution if the alien establishes (1) a pattern or practice in his home country of persecution of a group of similarly situated persons on account of one of the statutorily protected factors and (2) his inclusion in and identification with the group. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2)(i)-(ii).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">The record here does not compel the conclusion that Candra more likely than not will be singled out for persecution if he returns to Indonesia. As already noted, the three incidents relied upon by Candra appear to be isolated acts of random violence. Furthermore, Candra waited two years from the date of the 1998 incident before leaving Indonesia in September 2000. Candra\u2019s mother, father, and older brother continue to live in Indonesia, and the record does not contain any evidence that they have suffered harm in that country. Further, his mother voluntarily returned to Indonesia to assist one of her other children with an upcoming wedding.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">Candra argues that he need not show that he likely would be singled out for future persecution because he has shown a pattern or practice of persecution against the ethnic Chinese in Indonesia. Taken as a whole, the articles and the 2004 Country report that Candra submitted indicate that, while the ethnic Chinese still endure prejudice and discrimination in Indonesia, the conditions in the country have improved significantly since the 1998 riots. Indeed, the 2004 Country Report states that instances of discrimination and racially motivated harassment against ethnic Chinese Indonesians have declined over previous years. Neither the articles nor the Country Report recount incidents of violence against ethnic Chinese Indonesians in 2004. The fact that Candra\u2019s family has lived unharmed in Indonesia for several years also undermines his claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>there is a pattern and practice of persecuting similarly situated individuals in Indonesia. We cannot say that this record compels a finding of a pattern or practice of persecution of the ethnic Chinese in Indonesia. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s finding that Candra was not eligible for withholding of removal under the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">For these reasons, Candra\u2019s petition for review is dismissed as to his asylum claim and denied as to his claim for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-9\">. The IJ also denied Candra CAT relief because he failed to show that the Indonesian government had any interest in him individually as a target for torture. Candra did not challenge the denial of CAT relief before the BIA and does not challenge it on petition for review to this Court. Therefore, we do not address further Candra\u2019s CAT claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b896-17\">. We review our subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de inovo. Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b897-8\">. Where, as here, the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review both the BIA and the IJ\u2019s rulings. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To the extent the BIA's and the IJ\u2019s decision is based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). We review a factual determination that an alien is statutorily ineligible for withholding of removal under the substantial evidence test. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84. Under the substantial evidence test, \"we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza </em>v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). The fact that evidence in the record may support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings does not warrant reversal. <em>Adefemi v.
