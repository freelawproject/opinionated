Hussain also petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen his removal proceedings because he was eligible for adjustment of status based on his wife\u2019s 1-140 visa petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we deny Hussain\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-15\">Here, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision because the BIA did not adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. We review the denial of Hussain\u2019s motion for a continuance for abuse of discretion. <em>Zafar v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1358 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-16\">Before the BIA, Hussain argued that his removal proceedings should be continued because he was the derivative beneficiary of his wife\u2019s application for a labor certification, which was filed before 30 April 2001, and he therefore was a grandfathered alien who was eligible to apply for adjustment of status.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But on appeal, Hussain concedes that he is not eligible to apply for adjustment of status based on his wife\u2019s labor certification application because his wife was substituted as a beneficiary of the application <em>after </em>30 April 2001. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10(3) (\u201cAn alien who was substituted for the previous beneficiary of the application for the labor certification after April 30, 2001, will not be considered to be a grandfathered alien.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-17\">Still Hussain argues \u2014 for the first time in his reply brief \u2014 that he is eligible to apply for adjustment of status because he filed his own labor certification applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>tion before 30 April 2001. Hussain contends that his application remains pending; and he attached documentation to his reply brief to support this claim. Because we \u201ccannot consider evidence that was not previously brought before the [BIA],\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1282, and we do not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief, <em>see United States v. Britt, </em>437 F.3d 1103, 1104 (11th Cir.2006), we do not address Hussain\u2019s new claim that he is eligible for adjustment of status based on his own pending labor certification.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">We turn to Hussain\u2019s appeal of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen his case, which we review for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Lonyem v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1340 (11th Cir.2003). Hussain attached to his motion to reopen a copy of his wife\u2019s approved 1-140 petition for a visa, which he asserted supported his claim that he was eligible for adjustment of status. The BIA concluded that Hussain failed to demonstrate his present eligibility for adjustment of status. As we have discussed, Hussain has conceded that he cannot rely on his wife\u2019s labor certification to support his claim of being a grandfathered alien; and the administrative record does not provide other evidence that Hussain is the beneficiary of an approved labor certification. Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Hussain\u2019s motion to reopen because, regardless of the approval of his wife\u2019s 1-140 petition, Hussain has not demonstrated that he qualified as a grandfathered alien, which is necessary for him to meet the requirements for adjustment of status.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">Hussain next argues that the BIA denied him due process in ordering him removed from the United States when his adjustment-of-status proceedings were still pending. He also contends that the IJ and the BIA violated his right to equal protection because he was placed in removal proceedings after he registered with the government\u2019s National Security Entry-Exit Registration System. In addition, Hussain asserts that his equal protection rights were violated because, in jurisdictions outside of Atlanta (Hussain\u2019s hearing took place in Atlanta), \u201c[ijmmigration [jjudges administratively close proceedings routinely where the beneficiary has a pending 245(i) labor certifications, however in Atlanta they did not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>In <em>Zafar v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1367 (11th Cir.2006), and <em>Haswanee v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>471 F.3d 1212, 1218-19 (11th Cir.2006), we considered \u2014 and rejected \u2014 each of the precise constitutional claims raised here. Hussain\u2019s due process and equal protection claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">In sum, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Hussain\u2019s motions for a continuance and to reopen his removal proceedings; and we deny Hussain\u2019s motion to remand his case to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-12\">. Hussain titled this motion as a \"motion to remand.\u201d But Hussain attempted to introduce new evidence with this motion; so we will refer to Hussain\u2019s motion as a motion to reopen his removal proceedings. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1301 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201c[I]f a motion to remand seeks to introduce evidence that has not previously been presented, it is generally treated as a motion to reopen....\u201d). Also, we note that Hussain does not seek review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his later \"motion to reopen and remand,\u201d in which Hussain asserted that he filed an 1-485 application for adjustment of status and paid the required fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-19\">. An alien \u2014 who otherwise would be ineligible for adjustment of status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c) \u2014 can be considered a grandfathered alien who may apply to adjust his status to permanent resident if he is the beneficiary of an application for labor certification that was properly filed by 30 April 2001 and was \u201capprovable when filed.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(1); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.10(a)(1)(i)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b890-5\">. Hussain may be able to present this new evidence to the BIA through a motion to reopen his removal proceedings. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (\u201cA motion to reopen proceedings shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b890-6\">. Apart from his petition for review, Hussain also has filed a motion requesting that we remand his case to the BIA in the light of our decision in <em>Merchant v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>461 F.3d 1375 (11th Cir.2006). We deny this motion. In <em>Merchant, </em>we determined that, where (1) a petitioner had filed his labor certification application on or before 30 April 2001, (2) his application had been approved, and (3) the petitioner filed a Form 1-140 petition for visa and a Form 1-485 application for adjustment of status, the petitioner was eligible for an adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i). 461 F.3d at 1377-79. Unlike the situation in <em>Merchant, </em>Hussain \u2014 significantly \u2014 has not pointed to evidence in the administrative record that shows he is a grandfathered alien with an approved labor certification. For the same reason, we note that Hussain's case is not controlled by our recent decision in <em>Haswanee v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>471 F.3d 1212, 1218 (11th Cir.2006), where we explained that it was an abuse of discretion to deny petitioner\u2019s motion for a continuance when \u201che had an approved labor certification and an immediately available visa number, and had a pending visa petition.\u201d Based on the record before us, Hussain's case is distinguishable from <em>Merchant </em>and <em>Haswanee.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
