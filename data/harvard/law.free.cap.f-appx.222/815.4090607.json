In the first case, brought on January 13, 2004, Ivey claims (1) that he was harassed continuously by his supervisors and eventually terminated from his employment, all on the basis of his sex (male) and race (white), in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1), 2000e-3(a), 2000e-16(a), or, alternatively, (2) that his employment was terminated in retaliation for his whistle-blowing activity, i.e., his complaints about such discriminatory harassment, in violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(WBA). In the second case, brought on January 30, 2004, Ivey claims that Secretary\u2019s action infringed his rights under the First and Fifth Amendments to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>the Constitution. In the third case, brought on February 9, 2004, Ivey claims once again that he was discriminated against because of his sex and race, in violation of Title VII.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The Secretary denied Ivey\u2019s allegations and interposed several affirmative defenses. At the close of discovery, the Secretary moved for summary judgment. The motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who issued a report on June 13, 2005, recommending that the district court grant the motion. On September 26, 2006, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, with some amplification, as the order of the court, and granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Ivey now appeals that judgment. We find no merit in his appeal, and therefore affirm. In doing so, we address the issues Ivey raises that are worthy of any comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Ivey contends that the magistrate judge abused his discretion when he denied his motion to compel discovery and to extend the discovery period. Ivey failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s ruling as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(a). Under that rule, a party has ten days to file objections (with the district court) to a magistrate judge\u2019s ruling on nondispositive motions, such as the motion at issue. <em>Maynard v. Bd. of Regents of the Div. of Univ. of Fla. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>342 F.3d 1281, 1286 (11th Cir.2003). Failure timely to object constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal the order. <em>Maynard, </em>342 F.3d at 1286. We realize that Ivey filed motions to stay the magistrate judge\u2019s order, but motions to stay are not objections. In sum, he has waived his right to appeal the discovery ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Ivey contends that the district court erred in granting the Secretary summary judgment. He did not object to the part of the magistrate judge\u2019s report which contains a recital of the salient facts. Thus, as in the case of the discovery order, Ivey waived his right to challenge such recital here. With this point in mind, we address Ivey\u2019s substantive claims \u2014 those the court summarily rejected. We begin with his Title VII claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Stated generally, under Title VII, all personnel decisions made concerning federal employees should be made free from discrimination based on \u201crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(a). To establish a <em>prima </em>facie case of improper termination based on circumstantial evidence, a plaintiff must generally show that: (1) he was a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the job; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) he was replaced by someone outside the protected class or was treated less favorably than a similarly situated individual outside his protected class. <em>Maynard, </em>342 F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">\u201cIn determining whether the employees are similarly situated for purposes of establishing a prima facie case, it is necessary to consider whether the employees are involved in or accused of the same or similar conduct and are disciplined in different ways.\u201d <em>Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir.1999) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe most important factors in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>the disciplinary context are the nature of the offenses committed and the nature of the punishments imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201c[T]he quantity and quality of the comparator\u2019s misconduct [must] be nearly identical to prevent courts from second-guessing employers\u2019 reasonable decisions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Once a <em>prima facie </em>case is established, the employer has the burden to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employment decision. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). After an employer articulates a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, the plaintiff, to survive a motion for summary judgment, must show that the proffered reason was pretext for discrimination. <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 255-56, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1095, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">A plaintiff may show pretext by either directly persuading the court that a discriminatory reason motivated the employer, or by indirectly showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence. <em>Id. </em>at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095. The relevant inquiry on the issue of pretext is whether the employer\u2019s proferred reason was a cover-up for a discriminatory action. <em>Rojas v. Florida, </em>285 F.3d 1339, 1342 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Here, Ivey\u2019s claim for racial and sexual discrimination falls because he failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. Assuming Ivey met the first three prongs of a <em>prima facie </em>case, he did not show that, after he was terminated, a racial minority or a female replaced him, meaning he did not meet the fourth prong of a <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>See Maynard, </em>342 F.3d at 1289. In addition, even if we were to assume that Ivey established a <em>prima facie </em>case, he failed to present any evidence indicating that the Secretary\u2019s legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating his employment \u2014 poor performance \u2014 was pretextual. <em>See Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 255-56, 101 S.Ct. at 1095. Therefore, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on his Title VII racial and sexual discrimination claims. We turn then to his claim of retaliatory discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Ivey contends that the district court incorrectly construed his retaliation claim as a claim under the WPA. As discussed below, we hold that Ivey\u2019s claim fails under either the WPA or the retaliation provisions of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">The WPA provides protection to federal employees against agency reprisal for whistleblowing activities, such as disclosing illegal conduct, gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, or acts presenting substantial dangers to health and safety. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8). Under the WPA, a federal employee must first complain to the Office of Special Counsel (\u201cOSC\u201d), which is required to investigate the complaint. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1214. If the OSC finds a violation, it reports its findings to the Merit System Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d); if it finds no violation, the employee himself may bring an action before the MSPB. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1214(a)(3), 1221(a). MSPB decisions are appealable only to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, except for claims also alleging prohibited discrimination. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1) and (b)(2). Jurisdiction over \u201cmixed cases,\u201d those also involving adverse employment action or discrimination, lies with the district court if the action appealed is a removal, a suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in grade, a reduction in pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">Under Title VTI, it is unlawful \u201cfor an employer to discriminate against any of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>employees ... because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by [Title VII], or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under [Title VII].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he participated in statutorily protected activity; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the participation in the protected activity and the adverse employment decision. <em>Brown v. Snow, </em>440 F.3d 1259, 1266 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cTo recover for retaliation, the plaintiff need not prove the underlying claim of discrimination ... so long as [he] had a reasonable good faith belief that the discrimination existed.\u201d <em>Gupta v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </em>212 F.3d 571, 586 (11th Cir.2000) (quotation omitted). \u201cTo establish a causal connection, a plaintiff must show that the decision-makers were aware of the protected conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590 (quotation and alterations omitted). The <em>McDonnell Douglas-Burdine </em>burden-shifting analysis applies to retaliation claims. <em>Johnson v. Booker T. Washington Broad. Serv. Inc., </em>234 F.3d 501, 511 n. 10 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">To the extent Ivey\u2019s claim was an appeal of the MSPB\u2019s decision under the WPA, the district court properly granted summary judgment on the claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The MSPB had not issued an appealable decision at the time Ivey filed his lawsuits, and there is no evidence that Ivey\u2019s case was \u201cmixed.\u201d <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7703(b)(1) and (b)(2), 7512. Therefore, the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1) and (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">To the extent Ivey\u2019s claim did not fall under the WPA but fell instead under a Title VII retaliation provision, his claim fails. Ivey has not established a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation. He did participate in protected activity when he filed a complaint about alleged discrimination and harassment. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). He also suffered an adverse employment action in that he was terminated. <em>See Davis, 245 F.3d </em>at 1239. However, Ivey did not show that his termination was related to his participation in protected activity because he presented no evidence in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. In fact, the Secretary presented evidence that the supervisors responsible for terminating Ivey were not aware of his whistleblowing activities until after he was fired. Summary judgment on this claim was therefore appropriate. We now address Ivey\u2019s claim of sexual/raeial harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">To prove a <em>prima facie </em>case of sexual or racial harassment, the plaintiff must show: \u201c(1) he belongs to a protected group; (2) he was subject to unwelcome sexual [or racial] harassment; (3) the harassment complained of was based on sex [or race]; and (4) his reaction to the unwelcome behavior affected tangible aspects of his compensation, or terms, conditions or privileges of employment.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>440 F.3d at 1265 (quotation and alterations omitted). \u201cTo satisfy the fourth requirement, [the plaintiff] must show that he suffered a tangible employment action, which is a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing significant change in benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">\u201cAlthough Title VII\u2019s prohibition of sex discrimination clearly includes sexual harassment, Title VII is not a federal \u2018civ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>ility code.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 1238, 1245 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cSexual harassment constitutes sex discrimination only when the harassment alters the terms or conditions of employment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Ivey\u2019s harassment claim fails because Ivey did not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case. He failed to present evidence showing that any harassment he allegedly experienced was related to his race or sex. In short, he did not satisfy the third prong of a <em>prima facie </em>case of harassment. See <em>Brown, </em>440 F.3d at 1265. In addition, he failed to establish the fourth prong of a <em>prima facie </em>case- \u2014 that his reaction to the alleged incidents of harassment caused a change in his employment. <em>Brown, </em>440 F.3d at 1265. We now address Ivey\u2019s First and Fifth Amendment claims, which the district court denied on the ground of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">\u201cThe United States cannot be sued except as it consents to be sued.\u201d <em>Powers v. United States, </em>996 F.2d 1121, 1124 (11th Cir.1993). Its immunity from suit extends to its agencies. <em>Asociacion de Empleados del Area Canalera v. Panama Canal Comm\u2019n, </em>453 F.3d 1309, 1315 (11th Cir. 2006). To be effective, waivers of the government\u2019s sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory language and cannot be implied. <em>Rhodes v. United States, </em>760 F.2d 1180, 1184 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) is a comprehensive scheme for reviewing personnel actions taken against federal employees. <em>United States v. Fausto, </em>484 U.S. 439, 455, 108 S.Ct. 668, 677, 98 L.Ed.2d 830 (1988). Constitutional claims by federal employees are ordinarily preempted by the Act and must be addressed through the administrative procedures the CSRA establishes. <em>See Bush v. Lucas, </em>462 U.S. 367, 388-90, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 2416-17, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983); <em>Lee v. Hughes, </em>145 F.3d 1272, 1276-77 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">The Supreme Court has held that a federal employee cannot maintain a <em>Bivens </em>action<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against his supervisor for violations of his First Amendment rights, because such a claim is governed by CSRA procedural and substantive administrative provisions, which establish effective remedies for constitutional violations by the government. <em>Bush, </em>462 U.S. at 368, 385-86, 388-90, 103 S.Ct. at 2406, 2415, 2417; <em>see also Wells v. Federal Aviation Admin., </em>755 F.2d 804, 809-10 (11th Cir.1985) (applying same analysis in the context of a Fifth Amendment due process challenge). In <em>Bivens, </em>the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff could bring a cause of action against federal officials in their individual capacities for a violation of</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that Ivey could not sue the Secretary under the First and Fifth Amendments because he failed to show that the government had waived its sovereign immunity to be sued. The court correctly granted summary judgment on these claims because the Constitution does not waive sovereign immunity in a suit for damages. <em>Garcia v. United States, </em>666 F.2d 960, 966 (5th Cir., Unit B.1982). Because Ivey did not bring these claims under a specific statute, there was no waiver of sovereign immunity, and the district court properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>In conclusion, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. We dismiss the appeal to the extent that it challenges the court\u2019s denial of Ivey\u2019s motion to compel discovery and to extend the time for discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-10\">. The district court consolidated the three cases. Ivey challenges the ruling in this appeal. We reject his challenge as frivolous. We also reject without discussion, because it lacks merit, Ivey's argument that the court abused its discretion in denying his motion to amend his complaints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\">. As the district court stated in its September 26, 2005 opinion and order granting summary judgment, Ivey was terminated because he \"received extremely poor work evaluations in 2001.\u201d He thereafter \"filed charges of discrimination through the IRS and Department of Treasury, as well as an appeal under the [WPA] through the Merit Systems Protection Board. On January 22, 2004, the Board found that [Ivey] was not entitled to any relief. [He] appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit which affirmed the Board's decision.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\">. <em>Bivens v.
