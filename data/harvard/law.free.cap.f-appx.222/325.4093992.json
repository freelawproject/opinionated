As we explain below, we vacate the sentence and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Thornton was convicted of one count of illegal firearm possession and one count of illegal body armor possession, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 931, respectively. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), a person convicted of \u00a7 922(g) who has three prior convictions \u201cfor a violent felony ... committed on occasions different from one another\u201d is subject to a 15-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. For purposes of \u00a7 924(e), a \u201cviolent felony\u201d is any crime punishable by more than one year of imprisonment that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d or \u201cis burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Thornton\u2019s presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) indicates that he has prior felony convictions for statutory burglary and maiming (which occurred in 1973), and for aggravated sexual battery, attempted rape, and statutory rape (which occurred in 1986). Because of these convictions, the PSR recommended that Thornton receive the \u00a7 924(e) 15-year mandatory minimum. Thornton objected to this recommendation, arguing that he only has two, rather than three, qualifying \u201cviolent felony\u201d convictions because his statutory burglary and maiming convictions count as one conviction, his aggravated sexual battery and attempted rape convictions count as one conviction, and his conviction for statutory rape is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d and therefore does not count at all. The district court overruled Thornton\u2019s objection, holding that the statutory rape conviction is a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d Alternatively, the district court held that even if the statutory rape conviction is not a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d Thornton still has three qualifying \u201cviolent felony\u201d convictions because the aggravated sexual battery and attempted rape convictions count separately <em>(ie., </em>they were \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another\u201d). Thornton challenges both of these holdings on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">Thornton\u2019s sentence can stand only if we conclude that (1) his statutory rape conviction is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d or (2) his aggravated sexual battery and attempted rape convictions were \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another.\u201d Either alternative would suffice to give him three qualifying \u201cviolent felony\u201d convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">While not conceding that the aggravated sexual battery and attempted rape convictions arose from a single criminal episode, the government does concede that the record does not contain sufficient information from approved judicial sources from which the district court could have determined that the convictions were committed on different occasions. <em>Brief of Appellee, </em>at 19. Accordingly, the government argues that if we conclude that Thornton\u2019s statutory rape conviction is not a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d then we should remand this case for further proceedings in order to allow the district court to determine whether the aggravated sexual battery and attempted rape convictions were committed on different occasions. <em>Id. </em>at 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">In light of this concession, we can uphold Thornton\u2019s sentence at this stage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the proceedings only if we conclude that his statutory rape conviction constitutes a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d Without expressing an opinion on the merits of that issue, we have decided that the prudent course under the circumstances is to remand this case for further sentencing proceedings in order to allow the district court to explore further and explain whether the aggravated sexual battery and attempted rape convictions each qualify as a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d <em>See Anderson v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 211, 218, 94 S.Ct. 2258, 41 L.Ed.2d 20 (1974) (\u2018We think it inadvisable ... to reach out ... to pass on important questions of statutory construction when simpler, and more settled, grounds are available for deciding the case at hand\u201d). Further, in order to provide a more complete record on the statutory rape issue, the district court should also consider and address whether most violations of Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-63, which is the statute under which Thornton was convicted, present a serious potential risk of physical injury to another person. <em>See United States v. Sacko, </em>178 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1999) (remanding to the district court for evidentiary hearing on issue of whether sexual penetration of 14r-year-old girl by an adult involves conduct presenting a serious risk of physical injury). On both of these issues, the district court should permit the parties, if appropriate, to present evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Based on the foregoing, we vacate the sentence and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
