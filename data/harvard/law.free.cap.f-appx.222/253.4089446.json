Specifically, Chase seeks to have the Amended Judgment entered November 3, 2000, corrected to include his convictions for aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (2000) relative to Counts 4 and 68.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> As the district court recognized, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>all four substantive drug charges, <em>i.e. </em>the two possession charges and the two aiding and abetting charges, are incorporated in Chase\u2019s Amended Judgment, by virtue of their inclusion in Counts 4 and 68. However, Chase is correct that the Amended Judgment does not directly reference his conviction of \u00a7 2 relative to either Count 4 or 68. Therefore, we vacate the district court\u2019s denial of Chase\u2019s Rule 36 motion, and direct that the district court correct the Amended Judgment pursuant to Rule 36. This correction, of course, will have no effect on Chase\u2019s term of imprisonment or term of supervised release, nor will it restart the limitations period for filing a post-conviction challenge under the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. We deny Chase\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b281-24\"> Chase's original Judgment Order reflected the \u00a7 2 convictions in Counts 4 and 68, but the Amended Judgment omitted direct reference to the aiding and abetting convictions in the \u201cTitle &amp; Section\u201d and \"Nature of Offense\u201d sections of the Amended Judgment Order. Specifically, the prior Judgment Order, in pertinent part, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-25\">Title &amp; Section Nature of Offense Date Offense Concluded Count Numbers</p>\n<p id=\"b281-27\">21:841(a)(l), Distribution of cocaine, 1/8/93 4</p>\n<p id=\"b281-28\">(b)(1)(C); 18:2 aid and abet 8/30/94 68</p>\n<p id=\"b281-30\">In contrast, the November 3, 2000 Amended Judgment Order, in pertinent part, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-31\">ADDITIONAL COUNTS OF CONVICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b281-33\">Title &amp; Section Nature of Offense Date Offense Concluded Count Numbers 21: U.S.C. 841(a)(1) Possess with intent to distribute cocaine base 1/8/93 4</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>21 </em>U.S.C. 841(a)(1) Possess with intent to distribute cocaine powder 8/30/94 68</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
