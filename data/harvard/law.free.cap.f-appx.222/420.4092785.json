Hardin argues that the district court improperly relied on information he provided in his proffer interview to justify an upward departure. The district court specifically found that the probation officer did not rely on Hardin\u2019s proffer-related information to recommend an upward departure. Based on the probation officer\u2019s assertions that the information obtained from Hardin\u2019s co-defendants was independently obtained, the district court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Gibson, </em>48 F.3d 876, 879 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-23\">Hardin states that the upward departure was unreasonably severe, but he does not brief the unreasonability of the upward departure in his argument. He also argues that his sentence was not in keeping with the actual conduct surrounding the commission of his offense. Hardin\u2019s actual offense conduct was addressed in the calculation of his base offense level. The upward departure was based on his other uncharged criminal conduct which the district court concluded was not represented in his criminal history score. Hardin has not made any arguments suggesting that the district court abused its discretion in either its decision to depart or the extent of departure. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b448-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
