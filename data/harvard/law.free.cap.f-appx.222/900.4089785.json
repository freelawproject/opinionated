Vazquez-Casares argues that the district court clearly erred in imposing a two-level leadership-role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c). Vazquez-Casares contends that the district clearly erred in finding a government witness\u2019s testimony supporting the enhancement as credible,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that moreover, with or without this witness, the evidence was insufficient to support the enhancement. Vazquez-Casares also argues that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence because it failed to consider properly the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">Section 3Bl.l(c) of the Sentencing Guidelines allows the district court to increase a defendant\u2019s base offense level by two levels if he was \u201can organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c). In this case, the district court did not clearly err by imposing the Section 3B1.1(c) enhancement, because the evidence supports that Vazquez-Casares asserted control and influence over a co-conspirator and recruited and arranged for the co-conspirator to deliver drugs for him. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1355 (11th Cir. 2005) (discussing standard of review and factors a district court may consider in imposing this enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">We also conclude that the district court imposed a reasonable sentence. The court specifically considered Vazquez-Casares\u2019s argument for a sentence below his applicable guideline range based on his personal history and the nature of the offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Furthermore, the court considered the available sentences and consulted the Guidelines, which it noted were advisory. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(3) and (4). The court sentenced Vazquez-Casares within the applicable guideline range, which carries an expectation of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Although the court did not discuss all the factors listed in Section 3553(a), sentencing courts are not required to specifically mention each factor. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, because the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and VazquezCasares\u2019s arguments, we conclude that his sentence was reasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-9\">. Because Vazquez-Casares has not presented sufficient evidence to overcome the great deference we afford the credibility determinations by the trier-of-fact, we do not find that the district court erred in concluding that the government witness's testimony was credible. <em>See United States v. McPhee, </em>336 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b929-17\">. Vazquez-Casares also argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights when it sentenced him based on a quantity of drugs that was greater than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>amount found by the jury. However, there was no constitutional error in the district court\u2019s use of extra-verdict enhancements because it applied the guidelines as advisory. <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323-24(11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
