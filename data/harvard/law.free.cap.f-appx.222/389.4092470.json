Casey was sentenced to 27 months of imprisonment and to a three-year term of supervised release. Casey challenges the district court\u2019s loss determination. Specifically, he contends that the loss determination should have been based on the \u201cactual\u201d loss to the lending institutions instead of the \u201cintended\u201d loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-24\">The amount of loss is a factual finding reviewed for clear error; the method by which losses are determined is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Deavours, </em>219 F.3d 400, 402 (5th Cir.2000). Due to his fraudulent actions, Casey helped customers obtain loans that they would not otherwise have qualified. Casey had no control over repaying the loans if the customers defaulted. Consequently, due to his fraudulent actions, Casey put the lending institutions at risk for the full line of credit extended to the consumers. Thus, the district court did not err in assessing Casey\u2019s offense level based on the intended loss, rather than the actual loss, figure of the full line of credit extended by the lending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>institutions to the consumers. <em>See United States v. Morrow, </em>177 F.3d 272, 301 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Tedder, </em>81 F.3d 549, 551 (5th Cir.1996). Thus, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
