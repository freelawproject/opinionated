Cuero-Estacio argues on appeal that (1) the district court erred in refusing to grant him a minor role reduction, and (2) his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-21\">We review the district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 938 (11th Cir. 1999) <em>(en banc). </em>The district court has \u201cconsiderable discretion in making this fact-intensive determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277-78 (11th Cir.2002). The defendant bears the burden of proving his minor role by the preponderance of the evidence. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>In determining a defendant\u2019s role, the district court must first \u201cmeasure the defendant\u2019s role against [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 934. \u201cIn other words, the district court must assess whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. We have not established a <em>per se </em>rule as to whether a drug courier is or is not entitled to a minor role reduction but have said that \u201cwhen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43. Furthermore, in the drug cornier context, \u201cthe amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct\u201d and, in some cases, could be dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Although analysis under the first principle may be dispositive in the court\u2019s determination of the defendant\u2019s role, the district court may also measure the defendant\u2019s culpability in comparison to that of other participants in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 944. When measuring a defendant\u2019s conduct against other participants\u2019 conduct, a district court may consider only those participants who are identifiable by the evidence and who were involved in the relevant conduct for which the defendant was convicted. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of [his] role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor or minimal participants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he district court must determine that the defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">Here, the record demonstrates that Cuero-Estacio\u2019s relevant conduct was identical to his actual conduct, a large amount of cocaine (almost 3,000 kilograms) was involved, and, except for the captain, nothing in the record indicated that Cuero-Estacio was less culpable than other crew members on the vessel. Thus, he was not less culpable than the other participants in the conspiracy and the district court\u2019s denial of a role reduction was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Cuero-Estacio next argues that his sentence was unreasonable because (1) he will not be able to take care of his family, (2) his likelihood of recidivism is low, (3) a sentence below guideline range would have been sufficient, and (4) the sentence creates unwarranted sentencing disparities.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">When reviewing a sentence imposed by the district court, we must first ensure that the district court correctly calculated the guideline range. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir. 2005). Then, we review the sentence for reasonableness in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1246. We review only the final sentence, rather than individual decisions made during the sentencing process. <em>Id. </em>at 1245. \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Furthermore, although a sentence within the guideline range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, the sentence\u2019s relation to the statutory maximum may indicate reasonableness. <em>See Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246 (comparing the sentence imposed to the statutory maximum in determining its reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>A sentencing court is charged with imposing a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to reflect the seriousness of the offense, afford deterrence, protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with educational or vocational training, medical care or other treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Furthermore, under \u00a7 3553(a), a court should consider, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, (3) the kinds of sentences available, (4) the sentencing guidelines, and (5) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among similar defendants. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court does not need to explicitly consider every factor from \u00a7 3553(a) on the record; some indication in the record that the court adequately and properly considered appropriate factors in conjunction with the sentence will be sufficient. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Because the record demonstrates that the district court accurately calculated the sentencing guidelines range, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and sentenced Cuero-Estacio well below the statutory maximum and within the guideline range, we conclude that Cuero-Estacio\u2019s sentences were reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm Cuero-Estacio\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-13\">.
