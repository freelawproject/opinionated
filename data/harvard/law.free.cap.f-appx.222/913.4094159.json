Although appellant\u2019s complaint invoked the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (diversity of citizenship), it contained a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; hence, the complaint invoked the court\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (federal question) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (civil rights), as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-27\">On March 28, 2005, in an order addressing several motions, the district court dismissed appellant\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim because appellant had failed to perfect service of process on the only defendant against whom the claim had been lodged, appellee Tina O\u2019Neal. The court also dismissed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>claims against appellees Jones and Harrison on the same ground, failure to perfect service of process. Hence, what remained in the case thereafter were appellant\u2019s \u00a7 1332 diversity claims \u2014 malpractice claims against Grady Hospital and Dr. John Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">On November 28, 2005, Grady Hospital moved the court for summary judgment on behalf of itself and Dr. Doe (who had yet to be served with process). The court granted the motion in a comprehensive order (which addressed several pending motions) on March 2, 2006 on the ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, specifically diversity jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332. The court found diversity jurisdiction lacking because (1) appellant conceded that he was a Georgia citizen, and (2) since the remaining defendants, Grady Hospital and Dr. Doe, were also Georgia citizens, \u00a7 1332 diversity requirement could not be satisfied. The court acknowledged that, in theory, it could have maintained jurisdiction under the supplemental jurisdiction statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367, but concluded that because the malpractice claims did not \u201cstem from the same common nucleus of operative fact\u201d as the \u00a7 1983 claim against O\u2019Neal, retention of those claims under \u00a7 1367 was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">The district court\u2019s March 2 order is the focus of this appeal. Appellant challenges the court\u2019s resolution of the jurisdictional issues and complains of other rulings the court made \u2014 in the March 2 and earlier orders. We are satisfied that the court lacked diversity jurisdiction and that it did not abuse its discretion in declining to entertain the claims against Grady Hospital and Dr. Doe under its supplemental \u00a7 1367 jurisdiction. The court\u2019s judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-7\">. Our decision \u2014 that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction \u2014 renders moot the remaining issues appellant raises in his brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
