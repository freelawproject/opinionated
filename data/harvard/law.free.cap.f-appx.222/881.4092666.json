The former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) issued Johnson a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) by regular mail to Johnson\u2019s last known address, charging that he was subject to removal under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), as an immigrant who remained in the United States for a time longer than permitted. Johnson failed to appear before the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) as ordered, and the IJ ordered Johnson, in absentia, removed to Jamaica. Johnson argues on appeal that an in <em>absentia </em>order of removal is inappropriate where the record reflects, as in this case, that he did not receive the NTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006). The BIA\u2019s discretion is quite broad in this particular area. <em>Gbaya v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>342 F.3d 1219, 1220 (11th Cir.2003). The review \u201cis limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Ali, </em>443 F.3d at 808 (internal quotation omitted). Motions to reopen are disfavored in removal proceedings. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To the extent the alien claims that the BIA\u2019s actions deprived him of due process, we review the constitutional challenges <em>de novo. Ali </em>443 F.3d at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">An in <em>absentia </em>order may be rescinded upon (1) \u201ca motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances,\u201d or (2) \u201ca motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of this title or the alien demonstrates that the alien was in Federal or State custody and the failure to appear was through no fault of the alien.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). A motion to reopen \u201cshall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">\u201cDue process is satisfied so long as the method of notice is conducted in a manner \u2018reasonably calculated\u2019 to ensure that notice reaches the alien.\u201d <em>Dominguez v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>284 F.3d 1258, 1259 (11th Cir.2002). Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1), \u201cwritten notice ... shall be given in person to an alien (or, if personal service is not practicable, through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>service by mail to the alien or to the alien\u2019s counsel of record, if any)____\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1). The written notice must contain, among other things, a statement requiring the alien to provide a home address and telephone number to the Attorney General, the time and place at which the proceedings will be held, and the consequences of failing to appear. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229(a)(1)(F)(i)-(iii), (G)(i)-(ii). \u201cService by mail ... shall be sufficient if there is proof of attempted delivery to the last address provided by the alien.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(c). We have held that an alien\u2019s due process rights are not violated if the notice is mailed to the \u201clast address provided by the alien.\u201d <em>Dominguez, </em>284 F.3d at 1259-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">At the time of Johnson\u2019s hearing, an alien had an affirmative duty to provide INS with written notification of a change in address within ten days of the change. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(a). \u201cFailing to provide the INS with a change of address will preclude the alien from claiming that the INS did not provide him or her with notice of a hearing.\u201d <em>Dominguez, </em>284 F.3d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">A removable alien who has been provided sufficient written notice of the proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 1229(a)(1) or (2), and who does not attend a proceeding under this section, shall be ordered removed in <em>absentia. </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A). Written notice \u201cshall be considered sufficient for purposes of this subparagraph if provided at the most recent address provided under section 1229(a)(1)(F) of this title.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe statute clearly provides that notice to the alien at the most recent address provided by the alien is sufficient notice, and that there can be an <em>in absentia </em>removal after such notice.\u201d <em>Dominguez, </em>284 F.3d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Johnson relies on <em>In re G-Y-R-, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 181 (BIA 2001), to support his argument that the notice sent by the INS was insufficient. In that case, the BIA held that notice sent to an address provided by an alien six years prior to the date of the NTA did not satisfy the statutory notice requirements and reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-11\">If the alien actually receive[d] or can be charged with receiving [the NTA], then the address used by the Service qualifies as a section [1229(a)(1)(F) ] address, and <em>in absentia </em>proceedings are thereafter authorized. If, however, we know that the alien did not receive the [NTA] and the notice of hearing it contains, then the alien cannot be on notice of either removal proceedings or the address obligations particular to removal proceedings. In that instance, the address used by the Service cannot qualify as a section [1229(a)(1)(F) ] address, and the entry of an <em>in absentia </em>order is precluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_fe\"><em>In re G-Y-R-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 189-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">In this case, however, there was no violation of Johnson\u2019s due process rights. The NTA was mailed to Johnson\u2019s last known address provided to the INS. Because this statutorily authorized method of service was \u201creasonably calculated\u201d to ensure proper notice, and because Johnson failed to appear at the scheduled hearing, the IJ was authorized to proceed <em>in absentia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Johnson\u2019s motion to reopen. Although the notice was returned as undeliverable, Johnson does not dispute that notice of the removal hearing was sent to his last known address provided to the INS. Further, Johnson had an affirmative obligation to update his address with the INS within ten days of any change. Because the NTA was mailed to Johnson\u2019s last known address and because Johnson failed to provide the INS with a change of address, he is precluded from claiming that the INS did not provide him with notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>a hearing. Therefore, Johnson cannot demonstrate that the he did not receive notice in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of \u00a7 1229(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\"><em>In re G-Y-R </em>is distinguishable in that the last known address provided to the INS there was six years old, whereas the last known address Johnson provided to the INS was in much more recent correspondence. In any event, <em>Dominguez, </em>a post-In <em>re G-Y-R </em>case, is controlling in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny Johnson\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">DENIED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-16\">. Contrary to Johnson\u2019s argument, we conclude that <em>Dominguez </em>is not distinguishable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b912-27\">. Johnson's request for oral argument is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
