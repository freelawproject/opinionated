As fully explained by the court in its Memorandum Opinion and Order of May 5, 2006, Boggan\u2019s claims failed to present any basis for possible recovery, as they are among the larger class of employment discrimination claims that are barred by the so-called minister-clergy exception, which is firmly rooted in the Free Exercise clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The district court rejected both of Boggan\u2019s alternative arguments, viz., that (1) our holdings in <em>Combs v. Central Texas Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church, </em>173 F.3d 343 (5th Cir.1999) and <em>Starkman v. Evans, </em>198 F.3d 173 (5th Cir.1999), which continued to approbate this exception, are not good law and should be rejected by this court, and (2) alternatively, his claim remains cognizable because elimination of race discrimination, as compelling government interest, should be addressed under the two-part test of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\u201cRFRA\u201d), by application of Title VII and \u00a7 1981, <em>if </em>\u2014 as Boggan contends \u2014 the Supreme Court\u2019s declaration of the RFRA\u2019s unconstitutionality in <em>City of Boerne v. Flores, </em>521 U.S. 507, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 138 L.Ed.2d 624 (1997) does not apply to federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Having thoroughly reviewed the facts of this case and the applicable law as reflected in the record on appeal and the briefs of the parties, we are convinced that the district court ruled correctly in dismissing Boggan\u2019s action under Rule 12(b)(6). Our 1999 holdings in <em>Combs </em>and <em>Starkman </em>remain fully viable and controlling. Unless they are nullified by some future holding of the Supreme Court of the United States or by this court en banc, the courts of this circuit continue to be bound by the holdings of <em>Combs </em>and <em>Starkman. </em>For essentially the reasons cogently and correctly expressed by the district court, its judgment of dismissal is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
