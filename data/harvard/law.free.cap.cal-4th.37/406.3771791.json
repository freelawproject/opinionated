Superior Court </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 945 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 672, 16 P.3d 94] <em>(Powerine I), </em>we held that under the wording of the standard primary comprehensive general liability (CGL) policy, the term \u201cdamages\u201d limits the insurer\u2019s indemnification obligation to \u201cmoney ordered by a court,\u201d i.e., a money judgment entered against the insured in a third party suit for damages. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 960, 964.) We went on to conclude that the duty to indemnify does not extend to the costs of complying with a governmental agency\u2019s environmental cleanup and abatement orders because such administratively imposed liabilities do not constitute \u201cmoney ordered by a court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 966.)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">The central insuring provision in the policy at issue here likewise obligates Ace to indemnify the County for all sums the insured becomes obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law for \u201cdamages\u201d resulting from the destruction or loss of use of tangible property. The trial court concluded that the term \u201cdamages\u201d is controlling and limits the indemnification obligation in the policy to court-ordered money judgments in the same way this court concluded the term circumscribes the scope of coverage under the standard primary CGL policy examined in <em>Powerine I. </em>The Court of Appeal agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>with the trial court\u2019s reasoning and affirmed its judgment. For reasons to follow, we agree with the lower courts\u2019 interpretation of the operative term \u201cdamages\u201d in Ace\u2019s nonstandard policy. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">We reach a contrary conclusion in another decision also filed <em>today\u2014Powerine Oil Company, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 377 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 562] <em>(Powerine </em>II)\u2014because the literal insuring language of the excess/umbrella policies at issue in that case is materially different from the insuring language in the Ace excess policy and the standard primary CGL policy considered in <em>Powerine I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The County as cross-complainant appealed from a judgment entered against it after the trial court granted the summary adjudication and summary judgment motions of cross-defendant Ace.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The County contended that the trial court misinterpreted Ace\u2019s nonstandard excess third party liability policy as not providing coverage for the County\u2019s settlements of nonlitigated claims, including an administrative order to remediate groundwater contamination and third party property damage claims arising from the contamination. Specifically, the County asserted that the trial court erred by applying <em>Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 945, in which this court held that the term \u201cdamages\u201d in the insuring clause of the standard CGL policy is limited to \u201cmoney ordered by a court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 960, 964.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The Ace policy here in issue is commonly referred to in insurance industry parlance as a nonstandard or \u201cmanuscript form\u201d policy. (See Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation (The Rutter Group 2004) ][ 3:38, p. 3-7.) It was in effect from 1974 through 1977. The policy requires Ace to indemnify the County \u201cfor all sums which the insured is obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law or assumed under contract or agreement,\u201d arising from \u201cdamages\u201d caused by personal injuries or the destruction or loss of use of tangible property. Additional pertinent policy provisions are set forth and discussed in detail, <em>post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The following factual background was set forth in the opinion of the Court of Appeal. In 1969 the County began operating a solid waste facility known as the Ramona Landfill. The Ramona Landfill overlies potable groundwater, and in 1970 the Regional Water Quality Control Board (Regional Water Board) imposed operational requirements on the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>In March 1997, the Regional Water Board issued a cleanup and abatement order to the County, requiring it to investigate, monitor and remediate groundwater contamination caused by the Ramona Landfill. The County waived a hearing before the board to challenge imposition of the remedial cleanup order.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">In June 1997, the owners of property (the Sossamans) near the Ramona Landfill complained to the County that groundwater contamination would affect the property\u2019s marketability and their physical and mental health. The Sossamans requested that the County purchase their property without the necessity of litigation. The County believed it more likely than not that the Sossamans\u2019 property was contaminated. It had the property appraised \u201cand preliminary negotiations including the preparation of necessary transfer documentation [were] initiated.\u201d The Atkinsons, also property owners near the Ramona Landfill, filed a similar claim in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In November 1997, the County settled the Sossamans\u2019 claims by paying them $318,000 for the acquisition of their property and relocation benefits. In December 1998, the County settled the Atkinsons\u2019 claims by paying them $259,500 for the acquisition of their property and relocation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In May 1997, the County began seeking indemnification from Ace for costs of complying with the remedial cleanup order. Ace reserved its right to deny coverage on numerous grounds, including the absence of any third party lawsuit. In September 1997, the County began seeking indemnification from Ace for the Sossaman and Atkinson claims. Regarding these claims, none of the correspondence between the County and Ace is included in the appellate record. Ace never indemnified the County for any of the settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The County then filed a cross-complaint against Ace in a declaratory relief action brought against the County by another of its insurers, Pacific Indemnity Company.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The County\u2019s first amended cross-complaint included causes of action for declaratory relief, express indemnity, breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In the breach of contract cause of action, the County alleged Ace breached its duty to indemnify the County for losses it incurred in complying with the Regional Water Board\u2019s remedial cleanup order and in settling the Sossaman and Atkinson claims. In its cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>good faith and fair dealing, the County alleged, among other things, that Ace failed to \u201cattempt[] in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair and equitable settlement of the County\u2019s claims for indemnification although liability had become reasonably clear\u201d and failed \u201cto pay indemnification benefits to the County pursuant to said claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">In an affirmative defense to the cross-complaint, Ace alleged it had no duty to indemnify the County for costs incurred in complying with the remedial cleanup order or settling the Sossaman and Atkinson claims because the controlling term \u201cdamages\u201d in the insuring clause of the policy limited coverage to money judgments imposed against the insured in a court of law. The County moved for summary adjudication on this affirmative defense. The trial court initially granted the County\u2019s motion, determining that the \u201clanguage of the policy suggests a reasonable interpretation that the County need not suffer a judgment before [Ace\u2019s] duty to indemnify takes effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Ace moved for reconsideration of the ruling on the County\u2019s motion for summary adjudication, based on the decision in <em>Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 945. On the same ground, Ace also moved for summary adjudication of its duty to indemnify the County for its costs and expenses of complying with the Regional Water Board\u2019s remedial cleanup order. On reconsideration, the trial court reversed its ruling and denied the County\u2019s motion for summary adjudication. The court then granted Ace\u2019s motion for summary adjudication of its duty to indemnify the County for the costs and expenses of complying with the remedial cleanup order. The court determined that despite the nonstandard nature of the Ace policy, under <em>Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 945, Ace\u2019s duty of indemnity was limited to \u201cdamages\u201d imposed in a court suit, i.e., \u201cmoney ordered by a court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 960, 964.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The County in turn moved for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s order granting Ace\u2019s motion for summary adjudication. Ace countered with a motion for summary judgment on the question whether it had a duty to indemnify the County for the costs of the Sossaman and Atkinson settlements. The trial court denied the County\u2019s motion for reconsideration and granted Ace\u2019s summary judgment motion, explaining \u201c[t]here is no duty to indemnify [the] County for the so-called \u2018private property expenses\u2019 (purchase and moving expenses) because they were not \u2018money ordered by a court.\u2019 \u201d Judgment was entered for Ace in July 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, determining that the motions for summary adjudication and summary judgment were properly granted in the insurer\u2019s favor. The court held that under this court\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>in <em>Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 945, the term \u201cdamages\u201d in the insuring provisions of Ace\u2019s policy limits the duty to indemnify to money judgments ordered by a court, and that although certain other policy terms make reference to the settlement of claims, the policy language read as a whole does not extend the indemnification obligation to the costs and expenses of out-of-court settlement of claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">We granted the County\u2019s petition for review. Amicus curiae briefs in support of the County have been filed by the California State Association of Counties, United Policyholders, and the California Cast Metals Association. Amicus curiae briefs in support of Ace have been filed by the Complex Insurance Claims Litigation Association and the London Market Insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">1. <em>Standard of review and rules of insurance policy interpretation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The issue before both the trial court and Court of Appeal was one of law: the interpretation of the indemnification obligation under the nonstandard policy language of the policy issued to the County by Ace. \u201cWhen determining whether a particular policy provides a potential for coverage . . . , we are guided by the principle that interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law. <em>(AIU Ins.

The fact that a term is not defined in the policies does not make it ambiguous. <em>(Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lawyers\u2019 Mutual Ins.

We based this conclusion in part on what we termed \u201cFoster-Gardner\u2019s syllogism.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>Several years earlier, in <em>Foster-Gardner, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 857, this court held that the insurer\u2019s duty to defend the insured in a \u201csuit seeking damages\u201d under the wording of the same standard CGL policy is likewise limited to civil suits prosecuted in court. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 878-888.) In the analysis that followed in <em>Powerine I, </em>we explained that the insurer\u2019s obligation to indemnify for \u201cdamages\u201d is limited to \u201cmoney ordered by a court,\u201d in part because the provisions in the standard CGL policy imposing both a duty to defend and a duty to indemnify on the insurer each \u201clink[] \u2018damages\u2019 to a \u2018suit,\u2019 i.e., a civil action prosecuted in a court.\u201d <em>(Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 962.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Here, however, the Ace nonstandard third party liability policy is an \u201cexcess\u201d policy<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> providing the County as the insured with excess liability coverage over and above its \u201cself-insurance program or a self-insured retention arrangement for any part of the underlying limits of liability.\u201d Ace\u2019s nonstandard excess policy does <em>not </em>contain a duty to defend suits. Accordingly, the <em>Foster-Gardner </em>syllogism is not directly implicated in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">However, the scope of the indemnification obligation under this policy remains governed by our holding in <em>Powerine I. </em>The central insuring language of the Ace policy obligates Ace to indemnify the County for \u201call sums which [the County] is obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law or assumed under contract or agreement\u201d for <em>\u201cdamages </em>... by reason of injury of any nature sustained by any person or persons\u201d and <em>\u201cdamages </em>because of injury to or destruction of tangible property.\u201d (Italics added.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Court of Appeal below correctly concluded that the reasoning of our decision in <em>Powerine I </em>regarding the limitation the term \u201cdamages\u201d imposes on the scope of indemnity coverage under the standard CGL policy applies perforce to the insuring provisions of this nonstandard excess insurance policy which, like the standard CGL policy considered in <em>Powerine I, </em>utilizes \u201cdamages\u201d as the sole term of limitation of the indemnity obligation under the insuring agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">As we observed in <em>Powerine I, </em>\u201cthe duty to indemnify \u2018entails the payment of money\u2019 <em>(Aerojet-General Corp. v.

It is limited to money judgments in part because \u201cwithin the legal and broader culture,\u201d \u201c \u2018harm\u2019 exists traditionally outside of court [citations],\u201d whereas \u201c \u2018damages\u2019 exist traditionally inside of court. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 962.) We observed that inclusion of the term \u201cdamages\u201d in the insuring agreement of the standard CGL policy precluded a finding that a broad right to indemnification <em>outside the context of a lawsuit </em>was intended under the policy language: \u201c[0]ne would <em>not </em>speak of any \u2018sum that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay <em>as damages\u2019 apart from any order by a court. . . . </em>That is because, as a sum that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay, \u2018damages\u2019 presuppose an institution for their ordering, traditionally a court, albeit no longer exclusively.

In that decision, we have concluded that the literal wording of the central insuring agreement and incorporated definition of \u201cultimate net loss\u201d in nine excess/umbrella policies issued to the insured over the course of 10 years <em>did </em>unambiguously extend the indemnification obligation under those policies beyond \u201cdamages,\u201d i.e., a court-ordered money judgment against the insured, to the \u201cexpenses\u201d or liability of administratively imposed environmental response costs outside the context of a court suit. <em>(Powerine II, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 382.)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The Court of Appeal that authored the now superseded opinion in <em>Powerine II </em>agreed with the insured\u2019s reading of the indemnification obligation under the nine standard form excess/umbrella policies therein concerned. The Court of Appeal in this case had before it for consideration the published decision of the Court of Appeal in <em>Powerine II, </em>as review in that matter had not yet been granted as of the time the Court of Appeal filed its decision in this case. The Court of Appeal below expressly considered and <em>distinguished </em>the policy language at issue in <em>Powerine II </em>from the policy language at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">There are several key distinctions between the central insuring provision and incorporated definition of \u201cultimate net loss\u201d in the standard excess/umbrella policies at issue in <em>Powerine II, </em>and the central insuring provision and referenced definition of \u201cultimate net loss\u201d found in this <em>nonstandard </em>third party liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">First, the term \u201cexpenses\u201d was expressly contained in the central insuring clause of the excess/umbrella policies at issue in <em>Powerine II: </em>\u201c \u2018The Company hereby agrees ... to indemnify the Insured for all sums which the Insured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability . . . imposed upon the Insured by law ... for damages, direct or consequential <em>and expenses, all as more fully defined by the term \u2018ultimate net loss\u2019 </em>on account of: . . . property damage . . . caused by or arising out of each occurrence [covered hereunder] . . . .\u2019 (Italics added.)\u201d <em>(Powerine II, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at pp. 385-386, some italics omitted.) In contrast, the term \u201cexpenses\u201d is <em>not </em>found in the central insuring provision of the Ace policy\u2014the obligation to indemnify extends only to \u201call sums which the insured is obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law or assumed under contract or agreement\u201d for \u201cdamages\u201d resulting from personal injuries or the destruction or loss of use of tangible property.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Second, the central insuring provision of the standard excess/umbrella policies at issue in <em>Powerine II, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at pages 385-386, expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>purports to \u201c \u2018more fully define[]\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018damages, direct or consequential and expenses\u2019 \u201d through incorporation of a definition of \u201cultimate net loss\u201d into the insuring clause itself. (Italics omitted.) <em>In contrast, the definition of \u201cultimate net loss\u201d here is neither incorporated into, referenced, nor a part of the central insuring clause of the Ace policy. </em>Instead, as explained, it is referenced in the \u201climits of liability\u201d policy provision, the main function of which appears to be the setting forth of limits of <em>excess </em>liability coverage over the insured\u2019s \u201cself-insurance program or a self-insured retention arrangement for any part of the underlying limits of liability.\u201d In that specific context, the definition of \u201cultimate net loss\u201d merely serves to define the insured\u2019s total loss that will count toward such policy limits. \u201cInsurance policies are written in two parts: an insuring agreement which defines the type of risks being covered, and exclusions, which remove coverage for certain risks which are initially within the insuring clause.\u201d <em>(Rosen </em>v. <em>Nations Title Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1489, 1497 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 714].) Nothing in the \u201climits of liability\u201d provision of the Ace policy purports to expand Ace\u2019s indemnification obligation, once triggered, to anything other than \u201cdamages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">These two distinctions were not lost on the Court of Appeal below, which, in the course of rejecting the County\u2019s argument for an expansive construction of indemnity coverage under the Ace policy, distinguished the policy language in <em>Powerine II </em>when observing, \u201cIn contrast to <em>Powerine II, </em>the Ace policy\u2019s insuring clause does not include the term \u2018expenses\u2019 to broaden the coverage beyond that provided by the word \u2018damages.\u2019 . . . Further, the insuring clause does not define the term \u2018damages\u2019 by reference to the \u2018ultimate net loss\u2019 provisions, in which the references to the settlement or satisfaction of <em>claims </em>appears.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Finally, the Ace policy contains a \u201cno-action\u201d provision. As the Court of Appeal below explained, \u201c[T]he Ace policy provides that \u2018[n]o action shall lie against the company unless, as a condition precedent thereto, ... the amount of the insured\u2019s obligation to pay shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the insured after actual trial or by written agreement of the insured, the claimant and the company.\u2019 The Ace policy also provides that the County \u2018shall not, except at [its] own cost, voluntarily make any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense other than for such immediate medical and surgical relief to others as shall be imperative at the time of the occurrence.\u2019 Conditions such as these ordinarily appear in policies including the duty to defend, and they are intended to invest the insurer with the right to control the defense and preclude collusion between the insured and the third party claimant. (Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 7:439.6, p. 7A-116.) These conditions belie the notion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>term <em>damages </em>in the Ace policy extends the indemnity duty to any settlement entered into by the County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">In <em>Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 945, we briefly discussed the standard form CGL policy\u2019s \u201cso-called no-action provision, which, in typical language, generally states that \u2018no action\u2019 by a third party \u2018shall lie\u2019 against the insurer unless the insured\u2019s \u2018obligation to pay shall have finally been determined\u2019 either by a \u2018judgment\u2019 against the insured \u2018obtained after an actual trial\u2019 or by a \u2018settlement\u2019 reduced to contract to which the insurer \u2018agrees.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 962, fn. 4, italics omitted.) We explained that the \u201cno-action\u201d clause implies that the insurer may owe a duty to indemnify, but in its further reference to a \u201cjudgment,\u201d \u201cimplies as well that [the] duty is limited to money ordered by a court.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In sum, we agree with the Court of Appeal below that the insuring language of the standard CGL policy discussed in <em>Powerine I </em>and the insuring clause of the Ace nonstandard third party liability policy are substantively the same. The central insuring provision in the Ace policy, like the policy considered in <em>Powerine I, </em>contains only the \u201cdamages\u201d limitation standing alone, makes no express reference to \u201cexpenses,\u201d and does not purport to further define the scope of indemnity coverage set forth in the insuring provision by reference to the definition of \u201cultimate net loss,\u201d as was the case with the nine excess/umbrella policies scrutinized in <em>Powerine II. </em>We conclude that costs and expenses associated with responding to administrative orders to clean up and abate soil or groundwater contamination <em>outside the context of a government-initiated lawsuit seeking such remedial relief </em>and property buyout settlements negotiated with third party claimants outside the context of a court suit, do not fall within the literal and unambiguous coverage terms of the Ace policy\u2019s insuring agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">3. <em>Out-of-state authorities cited by the County</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">In supplemental briefing, the County has relied on several recent out-of-state decisions purportedly supporting its contention that the term \u201cdamages\u201d in the Ace policy should be construed more broadly than it was in <em>Powerine I. </em>We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The County first draws our attention to the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Central Illinois Light Co. v. Home Ins. Co. </em>(2004) 213 Ill.2d 141 [821 N.E.2d 206, 216-218, 290 Ill.Dec. 155] <em>(Central Illinois). </em>The plaintiff in <em>Central Illinois </em>brought a coverage action against its excess liability insurers for indemnification of funds expended to investigate and remediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>environmental coal tar contamination at several of its sites that formerly manufactured gas, creating coal tar as a by-product, in the era before natural gas pipelines became the predominant source of such fuel. <em>(Central Illinois, supra, </em>821 N.E.2d at pp. 208-209.) The <em>Central Illinois </em>policies expressly excluded coverage for expenses. The Illinois Supreme Court nonetheless concluded the insured\u2019s costs incurred in investigating and remediating environmental contamination at its facilities were covered under the policies, not as \u201cexpenses,\u201d but as sums the insurer was legally obligated to pay \u201cas damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">The <em>Central Illinois </em>court based that conclusion in large part on its belief that it is \u201cgenerally understood\u201d in the insurance industry that \u201cfunds paid to resolve . . . claims\u201d in the absence of a lawsuit constitute \u201cdamages,\u201d although the court offered no support whatsoever for this observation. <em>(Central Illinois, supra, </em>821 N.E.2d at p. 218.) In contrast, in <em>Powerine I </em>this court provided an extensive and authoritative analysis of why the term \u201cdamages\u201d has legally, commonly, and traditionally been understood to denote \u201cmoney ordered by a court,\u201d which conclusion was supported by a wide range of sources drawn from both legal and nonlegal authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The <em>Central Illinois </em>court discussed and distinguished this court\u2019s <em>Powerine I </em>decision on the ground that the primary CGL policies at issue in <em>Powerine I </em>contained a duty to defend, while the excess policies before it for interpretation did not. <em>(Central Illinois, supra, </em>821 N.E.2d at pp. 215-216.) That distinction is of no consequence here, since Ace\u2019s policy likewise contains no duty to defend, and we are not relying on the presence of such a clause in the policy to conclude that the term \u201cdamages\u201d limits indemnity to money ordered by a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Insofar as the policies at issue in <em>Central Illinois </em>expressly <em>excluded </em>coverage for \u201cexpenses,\u201d rather than conclude that the costs of complying with administrative cleanup orders are \u201cexpenses,\u201d the <em>Central Illinois </em>court concluded such costs fall within the meaning of \u201cdamages,\u201d and for that reason were covered under the policies there in issue. Indeed, in concluding that \u201cdamages\u201d are not limited to money ordered by a court, the <em>Central Illinois </em>court placed heavy reliance on the decision of the Maryland Court of Appeals in <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb </em>v. <em>Utica Mutual </em>(1993) 330 Md. 758 [625 A.2d 1021], noting, \u201cWe find <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb </em>highly persuasive and not readily distinguishable on its facts.\u201d <em>(Central Illinois, supra, </em>821 N.E.2d at p. 223.) In contrast, we expressly <em>rejected </em>the reasoning of <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb </em>and other similar cases in <em>Powerine I, </em>concluding our research revealed that the term \u201cdamages\u201d has legally and traditionally always been understood as limited to money ordered by a court. <em>(Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 965.)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>Central Illinois </em>is thus not availing to the County\u2019s position, particularly given the presence of a \u201cno-action\u201d clause in this policy, which reinforces our conclusion that the indemnification obligation set forth under the literal terms of the policy was intended to be limited to money judgments for damages against the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Next, the County draws our attention to the South Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Helena Chemical </em>v. <em>Allianz Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>(2004) 357 S.C. 631 [594 S.E.2d 455] <em>(Helena Chemical). </em>In the portion of the opinion cited by the County, the <em>Helena Chemical </em>court overturned the trial court\u2019s conclusion that sums expended to remediate soil contamination are not \u201cdamages\u201d <em>because they are not paid as compensation for property damage to a third party. </em>This, in essence, is the same conclusion unanimously reached by this court over 14 years ago in <em>AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pages 821-822. Moreover, <em>Helena Chemical, </em>like <em>Central Illinois, </em>places considerable reliance on the Maryland Court of Appeals decision in <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb v. Utica Mutual, supra, </em>625 A.2d 1021, and as explained, <em>ante, </em>this court has already <em>expressly rejected </em>the reasoning of <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb </em>and similar cases in <em>Powerine I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The court in <em>Helena Chemical </em>further concluded that the very fact that different courts across the nation have construed the term \u201cdamages\u201d differently is \u201c \u2018some indication of ambiguity.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Helena Chemical, supra, </em>594 S.E.2d at p. 459.) But \u201c \u2018some indication of ambiguity\u2019 \u201d is not the legal standard of review in California by which we determine whether the express terms of an insurance policy are ambiguous. (See, e.g., <em>California Casualty Ins. Co. v. Northland Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1682, 1694 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 434]; <em>Castro v. Fireman\u2019s Fund American Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d at p. 1120.) Our standard for declaring ambiguity in insurance policy language is a good deal more discriminating\u2014language \u201ccapable of two or more constructions, both of which are reasonable\u201d <em>(Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc., supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 18) is required before ambiguity will be declared and construed against the insurer in order to protect the insured\u2019s reasonable expectation of coverage. <em>(La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, Inc. v. Industrial Indemnity Co., supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 37.) In <em>Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at page 971, we expressly rejected the reasoning of out-of-state cases that have found the \u201cdamages\u201d limitation in third party liability policies ambiguous under different standards. The term, having been judicially construed by this court, is not ambiguous. <em>(Bartlome v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1235, 1239 [256 Cal.Rptr. 719].)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Next, the County also draws our attention to the Vermont Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Hardwick Recycling &amp; Salvage, Inc. v. Acadia Insurance Company </em>(2004) 2004 VT 124 [869 A.2d 82]. That decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>appears to have little if anything to do with the case at bench. It involved a \u201cclaims made\u201d third party liability policy, which is a <em>different </em>type of policy than the \u201coccurrence based\u201d policies at issue in <em>Powerine I, Powerine II, </em>and the instant case. The Acadia insurance policy in <em>Hardwick Recycling </em>covered damages arising from \u201cpollution liability hazard\u201d in the event a third party claim was made against the insured during the period the policy was in effect. The State of Vermont had issued a potentially responsible party letter (PRP) to Hardwick Recycling pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 et seq.), <em>and thereafter formally brought suit against the insured five years later. </em>Overturning the trial court\u2019s summary judgment order in favor of the insurer, the Vermont Supreme Court concluded that the state\u2019s 1995 PRP letter constituted a claim for damages within the 1995 policy period, thereby triggering the insurer\u2019s <em>duty to defend </em>the state\u2019s lawsuit subsequently filed in the year 2000. In reaching this ruling, the Vermont high court stated that the term \u201cdamages\u201d could reasonably be understood to include money the insured must pay out to remediate environmental pollution. <em>(.Hardwick Recycling, supra, </em>869 A.2d at p. 90.) Once again, that holding is functionally the same as this court\u2019s unanimous holding to that effect 14 years ago in <em>AIU.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Finally, in a footnote in its supplemental brief, the County has cited the Connecticut Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>R.T. Vanderbilt Co. v. Continental Cas. Co. </em>(2005) 273 Conn. 448 [870 A.2d 1048]. Here again, as far as we can discern, the decision in <em>R.T. Vanderbilt </em>has little if anything to do with the interpretation of the duty to indemnify in a third party liability policy. The decision does hold that the issuance of a PRP letter to an insured in and of itself can trigger the <em>duty to defend </em>in primary CGL policies under Connecticut law because, as the <em>R.T. Vanderbilt </em>court concluded, the term \u201csuits\u201d in the \u201cduty to defend\u201d clause, in the opinion of that court and several other sister-state courts, is ambiguous. Of course, this court held just the opposite in <em>Foster-Gardner, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 857, in which we found nothing ambiguous about the standard duty to defend clause that limits the defense obligation to \u201csuits for damages.\u201d In any event, as explained, since Ace\u2019s <em>nonstandard </em>excess third party liability policy issued to the County does not contain a duty to defend provision, our holding in <em>Foster-Gardner </em>is not directly implicated in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">4. <em>The County\u2019s claim of detrimental reliance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Last, the County asserts that Ace\u2019s payment history under the policy in question establishes that the parties reasonably believed the policy provides the expanded indemnity coverage sought by the County. Indeed, the County, in its reply brief, suggests that Ace has \u201cconceded\u201d (in its answer brief) that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>paid the County\u2019s claims in the 1970\u2019s, including claims that the County presented to Ace after settlements were consummated. Thus, the County argues, \u201cin the years directly after the issuance of the Ace Policy, Ace paid the County\u2019s claims after resolution, thereby confirming the County\u2019s reasonable expectations that \u2018claims\u2019 are covered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">We do not read Ace\u2019s briefs as containing the concession described by the County. To the contrary, Ace argued that \u201cThe parties\u2019 alleged course of dealing does not support the county\u2019s proposed interpretation of the policy.\u201d As Ace explained, a third party adjuster was retained to adjust liability claims <em>within the County\u2019s self-insured retention </em>during the three years that the Ace policy was in effect. During that time, the County submitted third party claim summaries, compiled by the adjuster and identifying sums the County had paid under its self-insurance program, to Ace. That is precisely what the express terms of this policy required. Under those terms, the independent adjuster was not establishing the value of claims for purposes of submission for payment by Ace. Rather, the adjuster was establishing the aggregate value of claims for purposes of allocating covered losses to the County\u2019s self-insured retention. Covered claims that must be paid up to a specified aggregate limit by the insured under its self-insured retention are not, by definition, subject to indemnification by the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Ace reports that it generally agreed with the valuation of the settlements of the claims as reported in the claim summaries. Third party claims paid by the County and reported to Ace for this purpose, we are told by Ace, involved routinely covered third party liability matters such as automobile accidents and false arrests. Ace has represented in its answer brief that \u201cthere is no evidence that the County ever reported payment of any costs associated with an administrative order or cleanup and abatement order ... in these claim summaries, nor is there any evidence that [Ace] agreed to pay any such costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Apparently there was one instance in which the County asked for, and Ace agreed to reimburse the County for, amounts reflected in the claim summaries that were in excess of the County\u2019s annual self-insured retention requirement under the policy. We agree with Ace that, on such facts, at most, the record establishes that Ace willingly reimbursed the County for sums paid to settle such claims before judgment. That is plainly within the insurer\u2019s discretion, and it is entirely consistent with other policy provisions recognizing the insurer\u2019s discretionary right to approve and fund any out-of-court settlement of claims, e.g., the \u201cno-action\u201d clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed, and the matter remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">George, C.

We were not asked to grant review to decide whether <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 945 <em>(Powerine I) </em>and <em>Foster-Gardner, Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 857, should be overruled, nor were these issues addressed by the parties. (Cf. <em>Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Companies </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287, 292 [250 Cal.Rptr. 116, 758 P.2d 58] [noting the arguments of counsel and amici curiae that our decision in <em>Royal Globe Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 880 [153 Cal.Rptr. 842, 592 P.2d 329] should be reconsidered].) I therefore concur under compulsion of the principles set forth in those cases. I am uncertain, however, of the soundness of these two decisions. (See <em>Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 945, 975 (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.); <em>Foster-Gardner, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 857, 888 (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).)</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b464-8\">KENNARD, J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"AV5\">In my dissenting opinion in <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 945, 975 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 672, 16 P.3d 94], I explained why, in my view, the word \u201cdamages\u201d in a standard comprehensive general liability insurance policy\u2019s indemnity provision does not refer only to judgments rendered in judicial proceedings but includes also the costs of complying with an administrative order to mitigate and remediate the effects of environmental pollution. Although the policies at issue here are excess/umbrella policies rather than comprehensive general liabilities policies, that difference is not material to the issue presented here. Therefore, unlike the plurality, I would not limit the word \u201cdamages\u201d in the indemnity provisions of these policies to money ordered by a court. Instead, I would hold that it includes expenses that the County of San Diego incurred to comply with the Regional Water Quality Control Board\u2019s cleanup and abatement order.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>I agree with the plurality, however, that the insurer was not obligated to indemnify the county for its costs of settling the claims of adjoining property owners, in the absence of the insurer\u2019s consent to the settlements, at least to the extent those costs were not mandated by any administrative order.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied October 26, 2005. Kennard, 1, and Werdegar, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
