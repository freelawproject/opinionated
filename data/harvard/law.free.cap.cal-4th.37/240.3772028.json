J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_c\">A jury found defendant Mark Lindsey Schmeck guilty of the first degree murder of Lorin Gwynne Germaine (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 189)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and of second degree robbery (\u00a7 211). The jury also found true the allegations that defendant killed the victim while engaged in the commission or attempted commission of a robbery (former \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(i), now \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(A)), and personally used a firearm in committing the murder and the robbery (\u00a7 12022.5 as amended by Stats. 1988, ch. 1249, \u00a7 3, p. 4161). The jury set the punishment at death.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">The case is before us on defendant\u2019s automatic appeal. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 11; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1239, subd. (b).) For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">\n<em>A. Guilt phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">The prosecution proceeded on the theory that defendant sought out a motor home to steal, and then robbed and murdered Lorin Germaine in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>stealing his motor home. The defense theory was that Jamie Gronley (defendant\u2019s girlfriend), Donald Willis, and perhaps William Duffy committed the murder and robbery, and that following the murder, defendant unwittingly had merely attempted to sell the motor home.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">1. <em>Prosecution evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">On the morning of May 30, 1986, Lorin Germaine left his Fremont residence to meet a prospective buyer for his motor home. On June 5, 1986, Germaine\u2019s body, with four or five bullet wounds in his head, was discovered on a road near Sunol.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">In May 1986, Lorin and his wife Rebecca Germaine placed an advertisement in Auto Trader magazine to sell their 1978 22-foot Dodge Brougham motor home, which had mileage of 38,000, for $14,000. Approximately 8:30 p.m. on Monday, May 26, Rebecca answered a telephone call from a man who said he had seen the advertisement in that magazine and was interested in buying the motor home. Rebecca handed the telephone to Lorin. On Tuesday, May 27, at approximately 6:00 a.m., Rebecca received a telephone call from the same man about the motor home, and again handed the telephone to Lorin. Afterwards, Lorin told Rebecca that during his lunch hour Lorin was going for a test drive in the motor home with the man who had telephoned. Prior to May 30, Rebecca recalled that the caller\u2019s name was Mark, but her two children believed his name was Mike.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">On the evening of May 27, Lorin told the family\u2019s babysitter, Carey Gilchrist, that the prospective buyer had mentioned that an aunt had died and left him $85,000, which was being managed by his sister. Later the same evening, Lorin told Rebecca that during the test drive the prospective buyer had commented that Lorin \u201clooked really familiar and he asked him if he had a younger brother, that [the prospective buyer] thought that he knew [Lorin\u2019s] younger brother.\u201d Rebecca testified that in fact Lorin had a younger brother who looked \u201c[e]xactly like him.\u201d Dennis Trede, a friend of the Germaine family, later testified that in April, 1986, defendant and Trede had been in the same holding cell in the municipal courthouse. Lorin\u2019s younger brother, John Germaine, appeared at the courthouse to visit Trede, and defendant made a comment about John Germaine to Trede.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">On Wednesday, May 28, Rebecca emptied the motor home of all of their personal belongings, vacuumed the carpet, and washed the interior and exterior. On Thursday, May 29, Rebecca and Lorin went to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and obtained the necessary documents to transfer title to the motor home. At trial, Rebecca identified the release of liability form that she and her husband completed, but she did not recognize the printing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the name for the buyer, Martin R. Freitas, whom the form identified as the ostensible purchaser of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">At approximately 6:00 a.m. on Friday, May 30, Rebecca answered another telephone call from the same man about the motor home, and she handed the phone to Lorin. This individual telephoned approximately one hour later, and Rebecca again handed the telephone to Lorin. Lorin drove their children to school. He returned to their home, spoke to Rebecca for a few minutes, and retrieved the DMV documents and keys to the motor home. Lorin also had a trifold wallet containing approximately $40 in cash and other items, including his Kaiser medical identification card. At approximately 8:30 a.m., Lorin departed in the motor home to meet the buyer at A Street and Grand in Hayward to finalize the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">During May, defendant made several statements that related to obtaining and selling a motor home. In that month, defendant sanded and painted the kitchen and dining area at the residence of Hernia (Wanda) Wilson and Melba Valdez. Wilson saw defendant making telephone calls with an Auto Trader magazine in his hand. Between May 16 and May 27, defendant asked Wilson and Valdez whether they knew anyone who wanted to buy a mobilehome for approximately $7,000, and offered to pay them $200 if they located a buyer. After his release from jail on May 16 and prior to May 30, defendant told Jamie Gronley, his girlfriend, that he wanted to acquire a motor home. Between those dates, defendant also told his friend William Duffy that defendant had a plan to make money, in which he would \u201cpretend [to] buy a motor home out of a newspaper and he would put the gun to the owner\u2019s head and insist that the owner sign over the pink slip to him or he would blow him away.\u201d On May 27, defendant told an acquaintance, John Maartense, he was going to obtain a motor home. When Maartense inquired how defendant would purchase a motor home without having a job, defendant replied, \u201cI have my ways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">At approximately 2:00 p.m. on May 27, a person identifying himself as Mark Schmeck telephoned Nohr\u2019s R. V. Center in Dublin. Phillip Sipes answered the telephone. The caller asked whether Nohr\u2019s was purchasing motor homes at that time, and whether they could make a quick deal. The caller stated that he was selling a 1978 22-foot Brougham motor home having approximately 39,000 miles. Sipes informed the caller that the Kelly Blue Book value of that vehicle was approximately $8,000 at wholesale, and $11,000 at retail, and that once Sipes inspected the vehicle, he could make a deal the same day. Sipes testified that his May 27 telephone log contained the following notation: \u201c \u201978 22-foot Brougham 39,000 miles, Mark Schmeck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Evidence was introduced concerning defendant\u2019s activities on May 30, the day of Lorin Germaine\u2019s disappearance. Between approximately 10:30 a.m. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>and 11:30 a.m., defendant appeared at the parking lot of an apartment complex where Jamie Gronley was assisting her acquaintance, Edward Tanner, move. Defendant spoke to Gronley for approximately five to 10 minutes and appeared to be upset. Defendant told Gronley that he was attempting to sell a motor home, but first had to take it to be cleaned at a car wash.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">On the same day between 10:30 a.m. and 11:00 a.m., a person identifying himself as Mr. Schmeck telephoned Phillip Sipes at Nohr\u2019s R. V. Center, reporting that he was running a bit late and would be in later. Sipes\u2019s telephone log of May 30 contained the notation: \u201cMark\u2014Be In Around 1:00 Brougham.\u201d At approximately 1:00 p.m., a person telephoned Sipes and identified himself as Mark, and stated he was running late because he had run out of gasoline, but would be there in another hour or so.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Between 2:00 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. on May 30, Sipes noticed a 1978 22-foot Brougham in the Nohr\u2019s RV Center parking lot. A man identified at trial as defendant asked to see Phillip Sipes, identifying himself as Mark Schmeck. Sipes recognized defendant\u2019s voice as that of the man who had telephoned him on May 27 and earlier that day, May 30. Defendant was shirtless but soon donned a jacket. Sipes looked inside the motor home and noticed that a section had been cut out of the carpet. Defendant stated he had cut out that part of the carpet because it was in poor condition. Defendant acted very \u201chyper, jumping around, wiping the walls down.\u201d Although defendant said he would \u201ctake any kind of offer\u201d for the motor home, Sipes was not interested in it at any price. Sipes suggested defendant try Lee Peterson\u2019s Motor Home Sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">At approximately 3:00 p.m., a man identified at trial as defendant told a salesman at Lee Peterson\u2019s Motor Home Sales that he had a motor home to sell \u201ccheap.\u201d Defendant stated the motor home had a book value of $8,000, but he would take $2,000 for it right then. Paul Weber, who was at the dealership purchasing propane, overheard this conversation. Weber followed defendant, who said his name was Martin Freitas, and asked him about buying the motor home. Defendant asked Weber whether he had cash in the bank, and allowed him to inspect the motor home. In Weber\u2019s truck, they drove to two different automatic teller machines, and Weber gave defendant $300 in cash. Weber agreed to pay defendant a balance of $1,200. Defendant gave Weber the motor home and several documents, including the pink slip, a bill of sale, a certificate of nonoperation, and a registration renewal form.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Later on May 30, Weber made efforts to determine whether defendant was the legitimate owner of the motor home. Weber subsequently met with Rebecca Germaine and accompanied her and her friends to the Alameda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>County Sheriff\u2019s Department, San Leandro Office, where Weber assisted in the preparation of a composite drawing of defendant. On Saturday, May 31, Dennis Trede saw the composite drawing, and he ultimately recognized the person depicted as defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Weber assisted the police in apprehending defendant. When defendant telephoned Weber several times, asking him to deliver the balance of $1,200 to \u201cStephanie Freitas,\u201d Weber refused and stated that he only would deal with defendant personally. One of the conversations, recorded on Weber\u2019s father\u2019s answering machine, was played for the jury. Ultimately Weber and defendant agreed to meet at 2:00 p.m. on June 1. The police equipped Weber with a \u201cwire\u201d in order to record sound, and instructed him to signal officers by removing his glasses. When defendant appeared, Weber gave the signal, and defendant was arrested on suspicion of vehicle theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Defendant made several statements connecting him to the commission of the crime. Following his arrest on June 1, defendant was interviewed by the police. Defendant was breathing hard, moving around a lot, and \u201cseemed hyper, nervous.\u201d Defendant initially denied any involvement with the stolen motor home, noting that he expected to inherit $85,000 in the coming months. When confronted by the circumstance that he had been identified as having been inside the motor home, defendant stated, \u201cI\u2019m gonna talk.\u201d Defendant maintained that on May 29 or 30, a person named \u201cDon,\u201d whose last name defendant did not know, had approached defendant about getting rid of a motor home that Don had inherited. Initially, defendant told the police that he merely looked at, but did not drive, the motor home. When the police mentioned that three persons had identified defendant as having been inside the motor home, defendant stated, \u201c[Ojkay, now I\u2019m gonna tell you everything.\u201d Defendant admitted driving the vehicle on May 30 and stated that Don had offered to pay defendant $200 to sell it. Don wanted a \u201cquarter pound\u201d (an apparent reference to drugs by weight), which was worth approximately \u201cthree or four thousand dollars,\u201d for the motor home. Defendant stated he took the motor home to Nohr\u2019s RV Center and Lee Peterson\u2019s Motor Home Sales, and eventually someone named Paul offered to buy the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m. on May 30, defendant told Jamie Gronley he had shot and killed a man in order to obtain his motor home. The killing took place inside the motor home on C Street in Hayward behind the BART station, in an industrial area. Defendant stated that he used the bathroom, and when he returned he shot Mr. Germaine in the head. Germaine grabbed his head, turned, looked at defendant, and asked him what he was doing. Whenever Germaine moved or attempted to say something, defendant shot him again. Defendant shot Germaine five times in the head. As defendant told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Gronley about the murder, he began to cry. Defendant had a trifold wallet that, as he told Gronley, belonged to the victim. Defendant changed his clothes, and he and Gronley went to the laundromat.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">That weekend, defendant told Gronley that if he were arrested for murder, he would implicate his enemy \u201cDon,\u201d who resembled defendant in height, hair color, mustache, and beard. Following his arrest, defendant asked Gronley to marry him so that she would not have to testify. Defendant also asked her to write statements incriminating Don, because defendant knew his mail was being read. Subsequently, Gronley wrote to defendant, \u201cRemember babe, they can\u2019t convict you of something you didn\u2019t do. I know you didn\u2019t kill him. Just pray they find Don.\u201d At trial, Gronley testified that Don was not involved in the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">On the evening of June 4, defendant telephoned Gronley at Detton\u2019s Bar and asked her to move Germaine\u2019s body. Defendant stated that if she followed Foothill Road until it became another road, then she would locate the body between a hairpin turn and an impassable bridge. The description was consistent with an area near Gronley\u2019s grandmother\u2019s residence that defendant had visited previously. Gronley became hysterical, and William Duffy, who was present with Gronley, contacted the police. On June 5, Gronley and Duffy accompanied the police to Foothill Road near Sunol. Germaine\u2019s body, which had an odor of rotting flesh, was discovered on a ledge below the roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Gronley testified that she had contacted the police on June 3 and had confessed that she had killed Germaine. During the police interview, Gronley was unable to describe Germaine and had never seen the motor home. She stated that two bullets had penetrated the windshield, a fact not reported by any witness who had inspected the motor home during defendant\u2019s sales efforts on May 30. Gronley reported that the body was located near a construction site on Acosta Boulevard in San Ramon. Following the interview, Gronley received a negative response to her inquiry whether the officers believed her. Gronley testified that she had confessed because she was in love with defendant and somehow felt responsible for Germaine\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Following his arrest, defendant made two telephone calls to Beverley Dupio, a friend of Gronley\u2019s with whom defendant was acquainted. In the first conversation, defendant told Dupio that \u201che made a mistake of killing this man but he didn\u2019t think he deserved 15 years for it.\u201d In the second conversation, defendant sought Dupio\u2019s assistance in arranging for defendant and Jamie Gronley to get \u201cmarried so she can\u2019t testify against him.\u201d Defendant also telephoned Wanda Wilson and requested that, should anyone call her and ask \u201cif [defendant] used a lot of drugs to say yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Certain physical evidence also connected defendant to the murder. At the time of his arrest on June 1, defendant wore a black jacket, which had a bloodstain possessing genetic markers that were consistent with Germaine\u2019s blood but inconsistent with defendant\u2019s. Blood consistent with the victim\u2019s was found on the carpet and the inside shower door of the motor home. Defendant\u2019s fingerprints were found on a plastic cup inside the motor home and on the DMV registration renewal form.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">During several searches of William Duffy\u2019s apartment, where defendant and Gronley stayed the night following the victim\u2019s disappearance, the police found a .22-caliber revolver, identified as belonging to defendant, behind a drawer. On the evening of May 30, Gronley observed defendant wiping down the gun and attempting to stuff something into the barrel, stating that would change the markings on \u201csomething like\u201d the bullet shells. Ballistics evidence confirmed that two bullets removed from the victim\u2019s head were fired from that gun. A third bullet removed from the victim had markings consistent with having been fired from that gun, but had insufficient detail to make a match. On the evening she observed defendant with the gun, Gronley found approximately five empty shells, which she placed into beer cans. Subsequently, the police found two spent .22-caliber cartridges in an empty beer can outside in the apartment trash.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In attic areas of William Duffy\u2019s apartment building, the police found a DMV release of liability form bearing the names Martin Freitas, Lorin Germaine, and Rebecca Germaine, a bag with six .22-caliber rounds of live ammunition, a portion of the victim\u2019s Kaiser identification card, and defendant\u2019s black baseball cap, which he had been seen wearing on Friday, May 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">In an effort to disprove the defense theory of the case, the prosecution introduced evidence to establish the whereabouts of Donald Willis and Jamie Gronley on May 30. Willis testified that on that date, he went to his sister Janice Suacci\u2019s residence in Santa Rosa, and did not at any time between May 30 and June 2 leave Santa Rosa and go to Hayward. His sister testified that she saw Willis sometime after 5:00 p.m. on May 30. Edward Tanner, his brother George, and Gronley testified that Gronley spent the morning of May 30 helping Edward Tanner move out. At approximately 12:30 p.m., Edward Tanner dropped off Gronley at William Duffy\u2019s apartment. Duffy and Gronley testified that they spent the afternoon together.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">A fingerprint expert testified that he compared the identifiable but unmatched latent prints found on the documents related to the motor home with the fingerprints of Donald Willis and concluded that none matched.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>2. <em>Defense evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Detective Muniz found a second gun in the attic crawl space outside William Duffy\u2019s apartment. The weapon was a very old, single-shot, .50-caliber, ball-and-cap type, and Muniz did not turn it in for ballistics or fingerprint testing. During Muniz\u2019s interview with Wanda Wilson, she said that defendant had left her residence after 12:30 p.m. on May 27.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">On May 30, Officer Jim Pontes of the Fremont Police Department took a missing person\u2019s report from Rebecca Germaine, who described the possible suspect as a White male, about 28 years of age, six feet tall, 170 pounds, of medium complexion, without facial hair, with long dark hair tied in a bun and a ponytail extending from the bun. Rebecca stated that the suspect\u2019s name was Mike or something similar, and that he was going to pay for the motor home with money from a $15,000 trust fund. Rebecca personally did not observe the suspect, but had obtained the description from one of her husband\u2019s coworkers.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Monica Hall, defendant\u2019s aunt, testified that on April 4 she summoned the police to a residence she owned, where defendant and Gronley were living without her permission. Hall subsequently found paperwork inside the residence with handwriting that appeared to be Gronley\u2019s, apparently containing directions to an area near the location where Mr. Germaine\u2019s body was found. Hall believed that in April 1986, defendant wore his hair straight down, and she never had seen him with a bun or a ponytail.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Sally Hughes, Pacific Bell\u2019s custodian of records for Northern California, testified that during the period of mid-May to mid-June 1986, only one collect telephone call (on June 7) was received at Detton\u2019s Bar, from South Lake Tahoe. Between mid-May and mid-August 1986, there were no collect telephone calls from the men\u2019s facility at the Santa Rita Jail to Beverly Dupio. During June and July 1986, eight collect telephone calls were made from the women\u2019s holding unit or dormitory at Santa Rita jail to Dupio.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">3. <em>Rebuttal evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Between April and May 1986, Gronley received a number of telephone calls from defendant while he was incarcerated in the Santa Rita Jail. When Gronley asked defendant how he could telephone from the jail without calling collect, defendant said he used a satellite or calling card number.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Raymond Ruiz, a product manager at Pacific Bell, testified that starting in the fall of 1985 through the summer of 1986, the company received complaints from long distance carriers concerning telephone calls that were being made from a number of penal institutions such as Santa Rita Jail, and were being billed to the carrier. Ruiz testified it was possible to reach a long distance carrier from a public telephone in several ways, including the use of a personal identification number or a seven-digit number beginning with \u201c950.\u201d Pacific Bell made efforts to block such calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Mark Ferrara, a security investigations administrator at Pacific Bell, testified that the company had received complaints about fraudulent use of satellite codes by inmates. A telephone call that was made utilizing a satellite code would not appear as a collect call on the recipient\u2019s telephone records.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Deputy Sheriff James Donnelly testified that on June 4, 1986, the Santa Rita compound in which defendant was incarcerated had coinless telephones that were available to inmates at all times.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">B. <em>Penalty phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">1. <em>Prosecution evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Documentary evidence was introduced that in 1984 defendant had suffered a prior felony theft conviction in the State of Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">2. <em>Defense evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">Several family members testified regarding defendant\u2019s childhood and youth. Defendant\u2019s father, Frank Schmeck, worked as an instrument technician at the Alameda Naval Air Station. Defendant was bom on February 3, 1957. Six months later, defendant\u2019s mother, Jacqueline, left Frank, taking with her defendant and his older sister, Lonnie. The children continued to have regular contact with Frank until defendant was approximately five years of age, when Frank remarried and moved to Washington. When defendant was about six or seven years of age, Jacqueline married Bill Freitas.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">Jacqueline was a hypochondriac and spent a great deal of time in bed during the day. Defendant and Lonnie were forced to make their own breakfast and lunch, and to do other chores around the house. When Lonnie was only in the second grade, she registered defendant for kindergarten. When defendant was seven years of age, Jacqueline would disappear for up to two weeks at a time. Jacqueline treated defendant well, but was not kind to Lonnie. When defendant was approximately nine years of age, Jacqueline on several occasions threatened her children with a weapon, and she attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>to stab defendant with a knife and a fork. By the time Lonnie was a teenager, the immediate family ascertained that Jacqueline had a substance abuse problem, for which Jacqueline ultimately received treatment. When Jacqueline was shot to death in 1979, defendant was traumatized.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Defendant\u2019s stepfather, Bill Freitas, was verbally and physically abusive to defendant, hitting him several times a month during a five- or six-year period. Defendant never struck back.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">When defendant was 16 years of age, he moved to Washington to live with his father, his father\u2019s second wife, and their adopted son, Frankie. Although defendant initially skipped classes at school, he stopped doing so as the result of his father\u2019s efforts. Defendant was not a discipline problem, and his father never struck him. Defendant was a member of several varsity sports teams, and shortly before his graduation he began to work at a local McDonald\u2019s restaurant. Defendant had a close relationship with his stepbrother, Frankie. Defendant opposed the use of drugs and alcohol, which influenced Frankie never to try using these substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Defendant resided with his father until after defendant\u2019s graduation from high school, when he found his own apartment nearby. Subsequently, defendant moved in with his sister Lonnie for approximately one year. Defendant worked at two jobs during this period. Defendant married Michelle Sather in 1978, and they moved to Washington. The couple owned their own home, and defendant had his own automobile body-and-fender-work business. Several years later, defendant and Michelle divorced, and defendant had a son, Justin, with another woman, Mary Isenman. In 1985, defendant left Mary and started seeing a woman named Jamie (presumably Jamie Gronley).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Defendant\u2019s high school football coach, a fellow member of the football team, and defendant\u2019s ex-wife all testified regarding defendant\u2019s nonaggressive character. Defendant\u2019s stepbrother Frankie and defendant\u2019s ex-wife described defendant\u2019s thoughtfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">When defendant\u2019s sister Lonnie saw defendant in February 1986, defendant was gaunt and had a greenish-yellow pallor to his skin. Lonnie suspected he was using drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Dr. Stephen Pittel, a psychologist, testified generally about the effect of amphetamines, including methamphetamines. A person who, during the afternoon, is hyperactive, sweating, rubbing his hands together, and talking to himself, would exhibit symptoms consistent with methamphetamine use, but probably those symptoms would not have been caused by use of that drug during the previous night. Sweating, hand rubbing, and hyperactivity could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>caused by many things other than amphetamine use, however.

V.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">During sequestered <em>Hovey </em>voir dire,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial court asked Prospective Juror R. V., \u201cDo you know of any reason why you could not be a juror in this case?\u201d The juror responded, \u201cWell, I consider execution by the state a sort of barbaric ritual and would find it difficult to render a judgment that would say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>a particular person should be executed by the state. I consider that a tad hypocritical of the state trying to say that murder is wrong and turn around and kill a citizen.\u201d Prospective Juror R. V. stated he would not have any trouble making a judgment of fact, such as would occur at the guilt phase of the trial. He added, \u201c[B]ut it[] seems that that final stage would be a determination of whether or not the moral quality of someone is such that this person deserves to be executed by the state and considering execution rather a sort of barbaric act it would . . . require a sort of extremely heinous moral quality on the part of the defendant to deserve such a barbaric treatment so .... If the final phase is simply [a] judgment of fact then there wouldn\u2019t be any problems I don\u2019t think. If the final phase is a moral judgment that says the moral character of this person is such that this person deserves to be executed I would have to\u2014have difficulty rendering a judgment like that.\u201d The trial court then stated that, as it understood Prospective Juror R. V.\u2019s statements, \u201cyou are not concerned that your views of the death penalty would [ajffect your ability to render a verdict in the first part of trial . . . but you are concerned because of your views as to how that might [ajffect your ability to serve in the second phase of the trial, is that true? And your ability to serve on a jury in a case other than this type would not be [ajffected but this one might be?\u201d Prospective Juror R. V. responded: \u201cThis is true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In response to questioning by defense counsel, Prospective Juror R. V. posed the question, \u201c[Wjhen you are putting this on the scale of values how do you draw the line as far as determining whether or not someone should be executed or put away for life?\u201d After a lengthy response by counsel regarding the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and discussion between counsel and the court, Prospective Juror R. V. stated: \u201cPresently I see that if someone is permanently removed from society and no longer a danger to citizens I don\u2019t see any reason for going through with further acts of barb[arjism, that is an execution. So I don\u2019t see the circumstances under which I could make the judgment that so and so should be executed.\u201d Defense counsel subsequently asked, \u201c[Tjhere is no set of circumstances either about the crime or about the defendant or about the both of them under this general factual outline that the court has given of this case under which you could vote for the death penalty?\u201d Prospective Juror R. V. responded, \u201cThe reason I find it difficult to imagine right now is if someone is permanently removed from society and no longer a danger to any of his or her fellow citizens, what would be the rationale for executing the person? . . . I don\u2019t see the rationale at the moment.\u201d Prospective Juror R. V. acknowledged, \u201cThe proponent could present arguments for execution that I haven\u2019t heard or considered enough to convince me that so and so should be executed so presently I lack that rationale and in the course of the proceedings the prosecution could present the rationale for execution that could convince me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Prospective Juror R. V. was then questioned by the prosecutor, who asked, \u201c[I]s Hitler one of those types of people that you might consider voting for the death penalty if he were still alive?\u201d Prospective Juror R. V. responded, \u201cWell, if I was convinced that there is some way he could be broken out of prison then I could vote for the death penalty for Hitler.\u201d When asked whether he ever could imagine voting for the execution of a person who intentionally killed during a robbery, Prospective Juror R. V. said, \u201cRight now I do not imagine myself voting for an execution. That does not mle out a very convincing presentation by the prosecution that would change my mind.\u201d Prospective Juror R. V. agreed that he had \u201ca strong bias against the death penalty law,\u201d and stated that he voted against and disagreed with such laws. When asked whether there was any practical situation in which he could see himself imposing the death penalty, R. V. stated that not only would he have to be convinced that defendant had committed a rather heinous crime and that there were very few possibilities of repentance and rehabilitation, but also \u201cthat in the last section of the trial that I\u2019m rendering a judgment of facts according to the law and not making a moral statement that the death penalty is good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">When the prosecutor challenged Prospective Juror R. V. for cause pursuant to <em>Wainwright v. Witt </em>(1985) 469 U.S. 412 [83 L.Ed.2d 841, 105 S.Ct. 844] <em>(Witt), </em>the trial court sustained the challenge over defense objection, explicitly finding \u201cfrom this juror\u2019s demeanor and responses that this juror\u2019s views would prevent or substantially impair his ability to be neutral and follow the court\u2019s instruction.\u201d After defense counsel reiterated his objection, the trial court added that \u201cafter viewing the questioning of [R.V.] as a whole, I was left. . . with the definite impression that he would be unable to faithfully and impartially apply the law . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">ii. <em>Prospective Juror M. M.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">In response to the trial court\u2019s questioning, Prospective Juror M. M. stated, \u201cI really strongly feel I\u2019m not sure that I could under any circumstances vote for the death penalty.\u201d The court inquired whether she was concerned \u201cthat if there were a penalty phase in the trial that you would not enter that phase in a neutral position as it were?\u201d She responded, \u201cYes.\u201d Defense counsel subsequently asked, \u201cAre there certain types of cases, certain types of factual situations where you feel the death penalty would be appropriate?\u201d Prospective Juror M. M. responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I mean I have concerns. I feel strongly against the death penalty. However, it gets a little gray, especially where there are crimes against women and children, so but morally I\u2019m against the death penalty.\u201d Defense counsel asked, \u201cDo you feel . . . there are certain situations where you could feel it was appropriate?\u201d Prospective Juror M. M. said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve been trying to figure this out since last week <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>and I\u2019m not sure how ... it would come out. So I think that I feel very opposed to the death penalty. So I think that I would tend to go more in that direction. I don\u2019t know how to be any clearer than that.\u201d When the prosecutor challenged Prospective Juror M. M. for cause under <em>Witt, supra, </em>469 U.S. 412, defense counsel responded, \u201csubmitted.\u201d The trial court sustained the challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">iii. <em>Prospective Juror M. W.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In response to the court\u2019s inquiry as to whether there was any reason she could not serve as a juror in the case, Prospective Juror M. W. stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know that in the end if I could really vote for the death penalty. . . .\u201d The court inquired, \u201c[A]re you telling me . . . you are concerned that you would be unable regardless of the facts and circumstances presented in the second phase that you are concerned you would have difficulty regardless of what those facts and circumstances were considering or voting for the death penalty, am I understanding you correctly?\u201d Prospective Juror M. W. responded, \u201cYeah. Not so much what I would think in the guilt phase but actually having to decide the death penalty.\u201d The court inquired, \u201cYou don\u2019t think you could do that?\u201d Prospective Juror M. W. responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think I could do it.\u201d The court subsequently inquired: \u201cBut the point is whether you in fact could make a choice or exclude one of those choices because of your state of mind. That\u2019s the question.\u201d Prospective Juror M. W. responded, \u201cThis is so hard for me. I know it is California law and a lot of times things that I read in the paper I say of course I believe in the death penalty. You know honestly I feel like I might have to exclude that as one of my choices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Defense counsel, referring hypothetically to an \u201cextreme case\u201d in which \u201cyour conscience as an individual says there is no redeeming factor about this situation,\u201d inquired: \u201c[C]ould you bring yourself to say I don\u2019t think that person should live any longer and you could sign [a]long with the other 11 people a verdict that says the death penalty?\u201d Prospective Juror M. W. responded, \u201cI don\u2019t feel I could. I wish I could say that I could do that but\u2014\u201d Defense counsel subsequently inquired: \u201cI guess the bottom line after we have kicked this around what say you if the circumstances demanded it if the aggravating factors substantially outweighed the mitigating circumstances could you go into that situation and give it a fair shot as to both sentencing choices, that\u2019s what it boils down to?\u201d Prospective Juror M. W. replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think I could.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">The prosecutor challenged Prospective Juror M. W. for cause under <em>Witt, supra, </em>469 U.S. 412, and defense counsel responded, \u201csubmitted.\u201d The trial court sustained the challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>iv. <em>Prospective Juror H. L.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Prospective Juror H. L. was asked by the trial court, \u201c[D]o you see any reason why you could not serve on this jury?\u201d The prospective juror responded, \u201cWell, in my conscience I don\u2019t believe in the death penalty in most cases. Under very rare circumstances would I ever consider the death penalty.\u201d The court stated, \u201c[L]et me ask you this. Is it your state of mind, is it such that you could never vote for the death penalty regardless of what circumstances might be presented to you?\u201d Prospective Juror H. L. replied, \u201cOf a case of this kind definitely.\u201d The following colloquy ensued: The court: \u201cThat is your state of mind?\u201d H. L.: \u201cYes.\u201d The court: \u201cYou could not in a case such as this vote for the death penalty regardless of what circumstances, aggravating and mitigating circumstances would be presented?\u201d H. L.: \u201cThat is correct.... It would have to be another type of case where I could possibly consider it.\u201d When the court inquired, \u201cBut that would not be a case where the charge is murder with the special circumstance that I have described here?,\u201d Prospective Juror H. L. replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Defense counsel asked Prospective Juror H. L., \u201cIn your mind if it was this type of case very generally, this special circumstance being an intentional killing during the course of a robbery and there were very severe aggravating factors that shocked you . . . that you found were so abhorrent and fit into that circumstance, you could consider and be open to both penalties?\u201d Prospective Juror H. L. responded, \u201cI still would not consider the death penalty. That is not the circumstances I\u2019m talking about. . . More like a mass murder or like crimes against humanity or political crimes.\u201d The court then inquired, \u201cWhat kinds of crimes?\u201d Prospective Juror H. L. replied, \u201cLike the Eichmann type murders.\u201d Defense counsel inquired, \u201cSo am I correct in understanding you that in this type of factual situation of a potential killing during the course of a robbery that you would not be open to both penalties under any circumstances?\u201d Prospective Juror H. L. responded, \u201cUnder any circumstances, yes.\u201d The prosecutor challenged Prospective Juror H. L. for cause under <em>Witt, supra, </em>469 U.S. 412, and defense counsel responded, \u201csubmitted.\u201d The court sustained the challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">b. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\u201cThe applicable law is settled. The trial court may excuse for cause a prospective juror whose views on the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair the performance of that juror\u2019s duties\u201d in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions and the juror\u2019s oath. <em>(People v. Smith </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 581, 601 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 68 P.3d 302] <em>(Smith); </em>see <em>Witt, supra, </em>469 U.S. at p. 424 [setting forth that standard as the applicable federal standard].) \u201cThe standard of review of the court\u2019s ruling regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>prospective juror\u2019s views on the death penalty is essentially the same as the standard regarding other claims of bias. If the prospective juror\u2019s statements are conflicting or equivocal, the court\u2019s determination of the actual state of mind is binding. If the statements are consistent, the court\u2019s ruling will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>(People v. Horning </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 871, 896-897 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 305, 102 P.3d 228].)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Here, with regard to the excusal of Prospective Jurors M. M., M. W., and H. L., defendant merely submitted the question to the trial court. Hence, as a practical matter, he \u201cdid not object to the court\u2019s excusing the juror, but. . . also refused to stipulate to it.\u201d <em>(People v. Cleveland </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 704, 734 [11 Cal.Rptr.3d 236, 86 P.3d 302].) Although \u201cthis failure to object does not forfeit the right to raise the issue on appeal, ... it does suggest counsel concurred in the assessment that the juror was excusable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 734-735; see <em>Witt, supra, </em>469 U.S. at pp. 434-435 [in light of counsel\u2019s failure to question the prospective juror or object to her excusal for cause, \u201cit seems that ... no one in the courtroom questioned the fact that her beliefs prevented her from sitting\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Moreover, with respect to all four of the prospective jurors in question, substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that, based upon their demeanor and responses, the views of these prospective jurors would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties. All four prospective jurors indicated at various points during their voir dire that, in light of their views concerning the death penalty and the normative role assigned to the jury under California\u2019s death penalty law, they were unable to state that they could consider imposing the death penalty in this case as a reasonable possibility. Thus, Prospective Juror R. V. repeatedly indicated that although his views regarding the death penalty would not affect his ability to make a finding of fact, those views would affect his ability to make \u201ca moral judgment that says the moral character of this person is such that this person deserves to be executed.\u201d Prospective Jurors M. M., M. W., and H. L. all indicated that they could not state that they would be able to consider imposing the death penalty, either in any case or in the kind of case at issue here. Under these circumstances, the trial court properly could find that each juror\u2019s views regarding the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his or her duties. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Ashmus </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 932, 963 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 112, 820 P.2d 214] [a prospective juror must be able to do more than simply consider imposing the death penalty at the penalty phase; he or she \u201cmust be able to . . . consider imposing the death penalty <em>as a reasonable possibility </em>\u201d ].)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Defendant acknowledges that numerous decisions of this court have held that when a prospective juror\u2019s statements are conflicting or equivocal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the trial court\u2019s determination as to the juror\u2019s actual state of mind is entitled to deference. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Horning, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 896; <em>People v. Mincey </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 408, 456-457 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 822, 827 P.2d 388]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Frierson </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 730, 742-743 [280 Cal.Rptr. 440, 808 P.2d 1197].) Defendant contends, however, that this long and well-established line of authority is inconsistent with the United States Supreme Court decisions in <em>Gray, supra, </em>481 U.S. 648, and <em>Adams v. Texas </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 38 [65 L.Ed.2d 581, 100 S.Ct. 2521] <em>(Adams), </em>and should be overruled. Relying in substantial part upon the transcripts of the jury voir dire and the arguments advanced in the briefs that were filed in <em>Gray </em>and <em>Adams, </em>defendant contends that those cases \u201cmade clear that when a prospective capital case juror gives equivocal responses, the state has not carried its burden of proving that the juror\u2019s views would \u2018prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror.\u2019 \u201d On this basis, defendant contends that the trial court improperly excused the four prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">We reject defendant\u2019s contention. In its decision in <em>Witt, supra, </em>469 U.S. 412\u2014decided several years after Adams\u2014the high court clearly explained that despite \u201clack of clarity in the printed record . . . there will be situations where the trial judge is left with the definite impression that a prospective juror would be unable to faithfully and impartially apply the law. . . . [T]his is why deference must be paid to the trial judge who sees and hears the juror.\u201d <em>(Witt, supra, </em>469 U.S. at pp. 425-426; see <em>id. </em>at p. 428 [a trial court\u2019s finding concerning a prospective juror\u2019s state of mind \u201cis based upon determinations of demeanor and credibility that are peculiarly within a trial court\u2019s province. Such determinations [are] entitled to deference ... on direct review . . . .\u201d (Fn. omitted.)].) Nothing in the high court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Gray, supra, </em>481 U.S. 648, purports to depart from or alter <em>Witt\u2019s </em>holding with regard to the deference that properly must be accorded to a trial court\u2019s finding concerning a prospective juror\u2019s state of mind; indeed, the issue before the court in <em>Gray </em>did not involve the determination of the correct standard for excusing a prospective juror under <em>Witt </em>at all, but rather the standard of prejudice that applies when a prospective juror improperly has been excused for cause under <em>Witt. (Gray, supra, </em>481 U.S. at pp. 659-668.) Accordingly, there is no basis for reconsidering this court\u2019s uniform line of decisions on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">In sum, we conclude that the trial court did not err under the applicable federal constitutional standard in excluding the four prospective jurors for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">2. <em>Asserted </em>Caldwell <em>error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Defendant contends that because the prosecutor told a \u201cfully qualified juror that a death sentence was only a \u2018recommendation\u2019 that defendant be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>executed in the future, and the trial court was forced to discharge this prospective juror as a consequence, reversal is required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">During the <em>Hovey </em>voir dire of Prospective Juror S. W., the prosecutor made the following remark: \u201cIf the aggravating factors are substantially heavy in your mind in an ethical and moral value then you may impose the death penalty and it\u2019s a vote, it\u2019s a recommendation to the court the defendant should be executed at some time in the future.\u201d The prosecutor then questioned Prospective Juror S. W. about her occupation. Several days later during the jury selection, defendant moved that the court excuse Prospective Juror S. W. Relying upon <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1985) 472 U.S. 320 [86 L.Ed.2d 231, 105 S.Ct. 2633] <em>(Caldwell), </em>defense counsel expressed concern that the prosecutor\u2019s comment might cause Prospective Juror S. W., were she selected as a juror, to inform other jurors, \u201cWell, it\u2019s all right, we can vote for a certain penalty because it\u2019s subject to the court\u2019s review, if we made a mistake it can be taken care of.\u201d Defense counsel noted that \u201csince this is the only juror such a remark has been made to, ... I would ask the court to excuse the juror,\u201d and requested that the court \u201cadmonish the district attorney not to make a comment like that in the future, either in jury selection or in the final argument.\u201d After affording the prosecutor an opportunity to review and present relevant authority, the trial court took the matter under submission and ultimately excused Prospective Juror S. W. for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Defendant contends that the prosecutor violated <em>Caldwell </em>by making the comment in question, and that \u201c[b]ased on this <em>Caldwell </em>violation, the trial court was forced to discharge [Prospective Juror S. W] from serving on the jury. . . . [B]ecause the prosecutor\u2019s <em>Caldwell </em>violation resulted in the exclusion of an otherwise fully qualified juror, reversal is required,\u201d and it is unnecessary to analyze whether the error caused prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">In raising this issue, defendant cites <em>Witt, supra, </em>469 U.S. 412, and <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 510 [20 L.Ed.2d 776, 88 S.Ct. 1770] <em>(Witherspoon), </em>as well as <em>Caldwell. Witherspoon </em>and <em>Witt </em>address the issue of potential juror bias regarding the death penalty, as does <em>Caldwell, </em>but the decisions differ in certain critical respects. Error arising under <em>Witherspoon </em>and <em>Witt </em>is \u201crooted in the constitutional right to an impartial jury\u201d under the Sixth Amendment, and is reversible per se. <em>(Gray, supra, </em>481 U.S. at p. 668.) The excusal of prospective jurors who <em>improperly </em>are determined to be biased against the death penalty may lead to a jury \u201c \u2018uncommonly willing to condemn a man to die.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Adams, supra, </em>448 U.S. at pp. 43-44; see <em>Gray, supra, </em>481 U.S. at p. 666.)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">By contrast, <em>Caldwell </em>error is based upon the Eighth Amendment, and focuses on the reliability of the death penalty verdict \u201cas well as bias in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>of death sentences\u201d when a jury improperly is told that responsibility for the penalty verdict lies elsewhere. <em>(Caldwell, supra, </em>472 U.S. at p. 330; see <em>id. </em>at p. 333 [the risk that an invitation to the jury to rely upon appellate review \u201cwill generate a bias toward returning a death sentence is simply too great\u201d]; <em>Sawyer v. Smith </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 227, 244 [111 L.Ed.2d 193, 110 S.Ct. 2822] [\u201cour concern in <em>Caldwell </em>was with the \u2018unacceptable risk\u2019 that misleading remarks could affect the reliability of the sentence\u201d].) <em>Caldwell </em>error creates \u201cthe danger of a defendant\u2019s being executed in the absence of any determination that death was the appropriate punishment.\u201d <em>(Caldwell, supra, </em>472 U.S. at p. 332.) Thus, unlike <em>Witherspoon </em>and <em>Witt, Caldwell </em>does not address error involving jurors who <em>improperly </em>are determined to be biased regarding the death penalty and then are excused; rather <em>Caldwell </em>requires that a reviewing court determine whether the jury <em>was biased </em>toward the death penalty because of \u201cstate-induced suggestions that the sentencing jury may shift its sense of responsibility.\u201d (472 U.S. at p. 330.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In the present case, the prospective juror to whom the prosecutor\u2019s questioned comment was made never was impaneled, but was excused at the request of defendant. That circumstance precludes any claim on appeal that a juror biased in favor of the death penalty participated in determining the punishment imposed upon defendant, or that the penalty verdict was rendered unreliable because of the prosecutor\u2019s comment during sequestered voir dire. (See <em>Smith, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at pp. 602-603 [the defendant did not suffer any prejudice from prosecutor\u2019s comment on voir dire allegedly undermining the seriousness of a death penalty verdict, because the prospective juror did not sit on the jury].) The circumstance that the prosecutor\u2019s action prompted defendant\u2019s motion to excuse the prospective juror does not alter that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Moreover, defendant is not free to contend on appeal that the trial court erred in granting his motion to excuse the prospective juror for cause. It is clear that other measures short of excusal\u2014for example, subsequent clarifying instruction by the trial court\u2014were available to remedy any misunderstanding arising from the prosecutor\u2019s single comment made during sequestered voir dire. Comments that might lead to <em>Caldwell </em>error are capable of subsequent correction, and a reviewing court may consider other prosecutorial argument or the trial court\u2019s instructions in determining whether any <em>Caldwell </em>claim is valid. <em>(Caldwell, supra, </em>472 U.S. at p. 333 [\u201cthe <em>uncorrected </em>suggestion that the responsibility for any ultimate determination of death will rest with others presents an intolerable danger that the jury will in fact choose to minimize the importance of its role\u201d (italics added)]; <em>id. </em>at p. 339 [the \u201ctrial judge in this case not only failed to correct the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, but in fact openly agreed with them\u201d].) In the present case, defendant did not seek corrective action other than the excusal granted by the trial court. No basis for reversal appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>3. <em>Asserted </em>Wheeler <em>error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Defendant contends that reversible error arose under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments because the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons for exercising peremptory challenges against Jewish prospective jurors were mere pretexts, and that the trial court applied an incorrect standard in ruling on defendant\u2019s <em>Wheeler </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748] <em>(Wheeler) </em>we held \u201c \u2018that the use of peremptory challenges by a prosecutor to strike prospective jurors on the basis of group membership violates the right of a criminal defendant to trial by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community under article I, section 16, of the California Constitution. Subsequently, in <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 79, 84-89 [90 L.Ed.2d 69, 106 S.Ct. 1712] <em>[(Batson)] </em>... the United States Supreme Court held that such a practice violates ... the defendant\u2019s right to equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v.

The United States Supreme Court has not similarly extended <em>Batson, </em>although some state and federal courts have done so. (See <em>Miller-El v.

[noting \u201c[s]ome lower courts have extended <em>Batson\u2019s </em>rule to religious affiliation as well\u201d].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Assuming without deciding that <em>Batson, </em>like <em>Wheeler, </em>applies to peremptory challenges based upon bias against religious groups, we nevertheless conclude that defendant has failed to demonstrate purposeful discrimination against Jewish prospective jurors. (See <em>Purkett v. Elem </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 765, 768 [131 L.Ed.2d 834, 115 S.Ct. 1769] [\u201cthe ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike\u201d]; <em>Batson, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 93 [the burden is \u201con the defendant who alleges discriminatory selection of the venire \u2018to prove the existence of purposeful discrimination\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The high court recently restated the <em>Batson </em>standard as follows: \u201cFirst, the defendant must make out a prima facie case \u2018by showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\u2019 [Citations.] Second, once the defendant has made out a prima facie case, the \u2018burden shifts to the State to explain adequately the racial exclusion\u2019 by offering permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes.

(Johnson, supra, </em>545 U.S. at p. 168 [125 S.Ct. at p. 2416].) In the present case, the trial court elicited the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for the peremptory challenges, and thus the issue whether defendant established a prima facie case is moot. <em>(Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 352, 359 [114 L.Ed.2d 395, 111 S.Ct. 1859] <em>(Hernandez); People </em>v. <em>Welch </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 701, 745-746 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 203, 976 P.2d 754] <em>(Welch).) </em>We proceed to the third step of the <em>Batson </em>analysis and, specifically, to defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor\u2019s justifications were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">a. <em>Asserted pretextual justifications for excusal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Defendant asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons for excusing Prospective Jurors D. H. and M. B. were not supported by the record but instead were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">On May 10, 1989, and July 5, 1989, Prospective Jurors D. H. and M. B. were examined, respectively, on voir dire. In response to defense counsel\u2019s questioning, Prospective Juror D. H. stated that he was \u201craised Jewish\u201d and continued to participate in certain ceremonies of that religion. Also in response to questioning by defense counsel, Prospective Juror M. B. stated that he had attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem for four months, that he practiced \u201ccertain things to do with Judaism,\u201d and that religion was \u201cpersonally very important.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">On September 11, 1989, these and all other qualified prospective jurors returned to the court for the exercise of peremptory challenges. At this time, Prospective Juror D. H. was questioned during sequestered voir dire regarding a letter he had written to the court regarding his aversion to cigarette <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>smoke.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Immediately following this voir dire, the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge against Prospective Juror D. H. Subsequently, the prosecutor challenged Prospective Juror M. B. After the latter peremptory challenge, defendant brought a <em>Wheeler </em>motion, alleging that the prosecutor \u201chas used his challenges to strike most of the members of\u2019 the group of Jewish prospective jurors. Defendant also cited <em>Batson, supra, </em>476 U.S. <em>19.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The prosecutor noted that both Prospective Jurors D. H. and M. B. had given \u201cterrible\u201d answers when they were examined \u201csome months ago. I made my decisions long ago. ... I didn\u2019t even realize they were Jewish until [defense counsel] mentioned it this morning.\u201d The trial court subsequently noted that the prosecutor had mentioned his reasons for excusing these prospective jurors and asked him to state the reasons again. The prosecutor responded that: \u201cIn my estimation neither of them would ever impose the death penalty against\u201d defendant. The trial court stated, \u201cAll right. I\u2019d like you to be a bit more specific to them individually,\u201d and requested that the prosecutor review his notes during the noon recess.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">At the afternoon hearing on the motion, the prosecutor noted that Prospective Juror D. H. had written a letter to the trial court stating that he was allergic to cigarette smoke and did not want to be in a place where persons smoked. The prosecutor \u201cfelt that because of that he might not be able to get along with others.\u201d The prosecutor, citing the record of voir dire in May 1989, added that Prospective Juror D. H. had stated that it was possible he had feelings that would prevent him from voting to execute a person. The prosecutor explained that the \u201coverriding statement\u201d by Prospective Juror D. H. that led to the peremptory challenge was that this juror might consider it a mitigating circumstance if a suspect committed a crime, was cornered by a police officer, and then shot the police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Again referring to the record of voir dire, the prosecutor stated that Prospective Juror M. B. appeared to have difficulty understanding the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and the relationship between a special circumstance and the penalty. As the prosecutor pointed out, that prospective juror also \u201cfelt that the death penalty should be limited [to] heinous crimes,\u201d such as those committed by Charles Manson or Richard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Ramirez. Prospective Juror M. B. stated he believed he could not impose the death penalty for crimes \u201clesser\u201d than those committed by Manson and Ramirez, but then said he thought he could. The prosecutor also pointed to the prospective juror\u2019s statement that a \u201cpast history of violence may weigh more heavily with respect to aggravating factors and mitigating circumstances.\u201d The prosecutor noted that because \u201cdefendant doesn\u2019t have a terribly heavy history of violence, I felt that Mr. [M. B.] would not be a good juror for me.\u201d Prospective Juror M. B. also had indicated that an attempted home robbery he had experienced had not had a profound impact on him. The prosecutor stated: \u201cSo I felt with Mr. [M. B.\u2019s] attitude that he would not be a proper juror,\u201d and \u201cin neither of these gentleman\u2019s cases did I consider their religion at all.\u201d The prosecutor stated that he had made his \u201cdecisions on both of these guys the same day they were here as I did with everybody else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The trial court considered defendant\u2019s motion in light of the prosecutor\u2019s explanations and found defendant had failed to persuade the court that the challenges were motivated by bias \u201calone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s claim, we conclude the record does not establish that the prosecutor\u2019s justifications were pretextual. Although the prosecutor stated he did not realize these prospective jurors were Jewish until defense counsel mentioned this, despite the circumstance the record of the voir dire reflects that both prospective jurors briefly discussed their affiliation with Judaism, the relevant voir dire examination of these prospective jurors had taken place a number of months prior to the occasion on which the prosecutor exercised the peremptory challenges, and the prosecutor had not reviewed the transcripts of the voir dire when he initially made the challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The prosecutor also explained he had decided to excuse Prospective Juror D. H. on the same day the prospective juror was questioned on voir dire\u2014May 10, 1989. As defendant observes, however, the prosecutor also specified that he relied upon the letter Prospective Juror D. H. wrote to the court requesting that he be excused if indoor cigarette smoking would be allowed\u2014dated May 24, 1989. Considered in context, the prosecutor\u2019s comments indicate that his decision on May 10 to excuse Prospective Juror D. H. was reinforced by the subsequent discovery that the prospective juror had written to the court. The prosecutor exercised his challenge against Prospective Juror D. H. soon after the revelation of the letter\u2019s existence. Regarding defendant\u2019s current challenge to the accuracy of the prosecutor\u2019s conclusions that the letter indicated D. H. might experience difficulty getting along with others, we note that the latter specifically stated cigarette smoke would render the prospective juror \u201cimpatient and unable to function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The prosecutor\u2019s other stated reasons for excusing Prospective Jurors D. H. and M. B.\u2014namely, the prosecutor\u2019s perception that the prospective jurors\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>views concerning imposition of the death penalty in certain circumstances were unfavorable to the prosecution and that Prospective Juror M. B. experienced difficulty understanding certain critical aspects of the law\u2014are supported by the record of the prospective jurors\u2019 statements during the voir dire. None of the proffered justifications appear to have been pretextual. Although, on appeal, defendant emphasizes other statements by these prospective jurors that might have provided a prosecutor with a rationale for their retention as jurors, the question before the trial court was whether the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons were supported by the record and whether the court was persuaded they were not pretextual. In denying the <em>Wheeler </em>motion, the trial court did not rely upon its memory of the voir dire occurring months earlier, but noted, rather, that it had \u201creview[ed] the transcripts with regard to both of these jurors,\u201d presumably to make certain that the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons were supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Defendant further contends that the pretextual nature of the prosecutor\u2019s excusal of these prospective jurors is demonstrated by a comparison of the voir dire answers of Prospective Jurors D. H. and M. B. with those of several nonchallenged and seated jurors. Defendant did not engage in a comparative juror analysis in the trial court. We disapproved of performing for the first time on appeal such a comparative analysis in <em>People v. Johnson </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 1194, 1221 [255 Cal.Rptr. 569, 767 P.2d 1047]. Even assuming without deciding that this aspect of <em>People v. Johnson </em>has been called into question by the decision in <em>Miller-El </em>v. <em>Dretke, supra, </em>545 U.S. 241 [125 S.Ct. 2317], we conclude that the comparative juror analysis relied upon by defendant fails to demonstrate purposeful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In <em>Miller-El v. Dretke, supra, </em>545 U.S. 239 [125 S.Ct. 2317], in the context of a challenge based upon racial bias, the high court observed that if a prosecutor\u2019s explanation for a challenged strike \u201capplies just as well to an otherwise-similar nonblack [juror] who is permitted to serve, that is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 239 [125 S.Ct. at p. 2325].) As noted, <em>ante, </em>the prosecutor remarked that the \u201coverriding statement\u201d made by Prospective Juror D. H. that led to the peremptory challenge was D. H.\u2019s observation that the juror might consider it a mitigating circumstance if a suspect who committed a crime was cornered by a police officer and shot the police officer. In addition, Prospective Juror D. H. had corresponded with the court regarding his aversion to cigarette smoke and desire to avoid locations in which persons might smoke, giving rise to questions whether the prospective juror could \u201cget along with others.\u201d Finally, the prospective juror revealed the possibility his feelings would prevent him from executing someone.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Defendant does not refer us to, and we have not discovered, any comment by a seated juror that was similar to D. H.\u2019s comment that, following a crime, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>a perpetrator\u2019s stressful confrontation preceding the shooting of a police officer would constitute mitigating evidence. Defendant does not point to any other occasion in which a seated juror communicated with the court to identify behavior of others rendering jury experience so unpleasant as to justify a request to be excused from service. Although defendant correctly observes that Jurors R. F. and G. R. gave responses bearing some similarity to those of Prospective Juror D. H. concerning their feelings about the death penalty,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> these two jurors were not \u201cotherwise [] similar\u201d to Prospective Juror D. H. in any other respect contributing to the prosecutor\u2019s challenge. The circumstance that the two jurors made a single comment having similarity does not establish that the prosecutor\u2019s reasons were pretextual or that defendant established purposeful discrimination under the facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We further conclude that a comparison of Prospective Juror M. B. to seated Jurors E. E., P. L., R. F., M. T, C. V., G. R., and D. St. and Alternate Juror J. C. does not demonstrate that these jurors were substantially similar, nor that the prosecution\u2019s stated justifications for his peremptory challenge were therefore pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">For example, the prosecutor justified his challenge of Prospective Juror M. B. in part based upon the juror\u2019s statement that his experience with an attempted home robbery (which occurred while the prospective juror was at home) had not had a profound impact on him. Defendant does not refer us to, nor have we found, any similar comment made by any seated juror. Indeed, because the special circumstance alleged in this case was murder in the course of a robbery committed in a motor home, it is understandable that a prosecutor would challenge a juror who was not deeply affected by an attempted robbery in his own home. (See <em>Miller-El </em>v. <em>Dretke, </em>supra, 545 U.S. at p. 247 [125 S.Ct. at p. 2329] [noting the court\u2019s prior decisions holding that the credibility of the prosecutor\u2019s justifications \u201ccan be measured by \u2018how reasonable, or how improbable, the explanations are; and by whether the proffered rationale has some basis in accepted trial strategy\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In addition, the prosecutor stated he had excused Prospective Juror M. B. because the juror had remarked that a \u201cpast history of violence may weigh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>more heavily with respect to aggravating factors and mitigating circumstances.\u201d The prosecutor noted that defendant \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a terribly heavy history of violence.\u201d By contrast, none of the seated jurors referred to by defendant stated that a history of violence might weigh more heavily than other aggravating circumstances. Juror C. V. simply responded, \u201cYeah,\u201d when defense counsel, during a colloquy about the various factors that might be important in determining the appropriate penalty, inquired whether \u201cit [would] make any difference to you if the defendant had never done a serious crime of violence before? Would that be important to you in deciding [the appropriate penalty]?\u201d Similarly, Alternate Juror J. C. was asked by defense counsel, \u201cWe can also present to you whether this is the first and only incident of violence in his life. [Is] [t]he past history . . . with regards to other crimes or other history of violence something that you would seriously consider?\u201d She responded, \u201cYes.\u201d She had previously been asked about the importance of premeditation, defendant\u2019s childhood and family history, and defendant\u2019s job accomplishments, and following a subsequent inquiry as to whether a history of drug problems would be important stated, \u201cI feel they\u2019re all important, yes.\u201d Juror G. R. was asked by defense counsel \u201c[Wjould it be important to you that there [were] no other instances of violence in the person\u2019s background before the factors alleged here?\u201d Juror G. R. responded, \u201cYes.\u201d Defense counsel asked, \u201cSo background facts about the defendant would be important in determining the penalty in addition to the facts about the crime?\u201d Juror G. R. stated, \u201cWhat would be presented, yes.\u201d Finally, Juror D. St. responded \u201cSure,\u201d when asked by defense counsel whether she \u201cmight be interested if it got to the penalty phase in knowing more about the life of the defendant?\u201d Defense counsel then inquired, \u201cApart from the crime . . . ?\u201d Juror D. St. said, \u201cYes. . . . Habitual criminal, people who have done the same crime over and over again.\u201d Defense counsel asked a question the juror did not understand, and then inquired, \u201cYou might find it important to know whether there was an absence of violence in the person\u2019s past?\u201d \u201cSure. Right.\u201d \u201cOr whether they had a record of violence?\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Moreover, Prospective Juror M. B. expressed confusion as to the role played by a special circumstance in the penalty process and as to the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. By contrast, Juror E. E., whom defendant compares to Prospective Juror M. B., stated he would not want to know about defendant\u2019s past, but \u201c[o]nly what is said here.\u201d Once it was explained that he would hear evidence and, implicitly, could consider defendant\u2019s past, Juror E. E. said he would \u201cwant to know a little about his past.\u201d Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, Juror P. L. was not \u201cinitially confused about the weighing process.\u201d Rather, when the prosecutor asked, \u201cDo you feel as though you as a human being could ever vote to execute another human being,\u201d Juror P. L. said, \u201cCould I do it personally?\u201d The court explained that the prosecutor meant \u201c[a]s a member of the jury,\u201d and Juror P. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>replied, \u201cOh, I thought you meant just as an individual could I do this.\u201d The prosecutor said, \u201cNo, as a juror, not as the executioner but as a juror.\u201d Juror P. L. said \u201cYes.\u201d Nor did Juror R. F. appear to have difficulty understanding the weighing process, but rather appeared to indicate he personally would need \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d to reach a death verdict. Juror M. T. initially may have had difficulty understanding the weighing process, but she clearly understood the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, as is demonstrated by the portion of the voir dire upon which defendant relies. In any event, defendant does not assert that Juror M. T. was similar to Prospective Juror M. B. on any of the other three bases upon which the prosecutor relied. We do not believe the single similarity demonstrates the prosecutor gave pretextual justifications for his challenge. Defendant is correct that somewhat similarly to Prospective Juror M. B., both Juror R. F. and Alternate Juror J. C. stated that they believed the death penalty was appropriate for \u201cheinous\u201d crimes. They were not, however, similar to Prospective Juror M. B. on any other basis. Again, this one similarity does not demonstrate that pretextual reasons were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In sum, the record supports the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons, and a comparison of the two challenged prospective jurors with the seated jurors does not demonstrate such a degree of similarity as to establish the existence of pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We further note that a prospective juror\u2019s religious affiliation, if it is not stated on a jury questionnaire or revealed during voir dire, is not ascertained as readily as is his or her race or gender. (See <em>Davis v. Minnesota </em>(1994) 511 U.S. 1115 [128 L.Ed.2d 679, 114 S.Ct. 2120] (cone. opn. of Ginsburg, J.) [denial of petn. for cert., noting the Minnesota high court\u2019s observation that religious affiliation \u201c \u2018is not as self-evident as race or gender\u2019 \u201d and that ordinarily \u201c \u2018inquiry . . . into a juror\u2019s religious affiliation and beliefs is irrelevant and prejudicial\u2019 \u201d].) In the present case, the record does not reflect that the prosecutor consistently examined prospective jurors to ascertain whether they were Jewish. (See <em>Batson, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 97 [\u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s questions and statements during <em>voir dire </em>examination\u201d may \u201crefute an inference of discriminatory purpose\u201d].) Rather, Prospective Jurors D. H. and M. B. both discussed their affiliation with Judaism in response to defense questioning. Indeed, on his jury questionnaire, Prospective Juror M. B. stated that he was not a member of any \u201creligious\u201d organization, although he did note elsewhere that he had lived in Israel for nearly a year. Likewise, Prospective Juror D. H., who completed a different version of the jury questionnaire, stated he belonged to no \u201csocieties, unions, professional associations, civic clubs, or other organizations\u201d that could be characterized as religious.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Because religious affiliation may not emerge in the absence of specific questioning, there may have been additional persons of the Jewish faith who served on defendant\u2019s jury\u2014notwithstanding the many juror questionnaires from which it appeared prospective jurors lacked religious affiliation. For example, Jurors G. R., P. L., and D. St. and Alternate Jurors R. B. and J. C. either responded in the negative when asked on the jury questionnaire whether they belonged to any \u201creligious\u201d or other organizations, or listed organizations that could not reasonably be characterized as religious. Using a different form of the questionnaire, Jurors M. T., C. V, T. E, E. E., R. E, D. St., and K. M. and Alternate Jurors M. S. and D. L. also stated that they belonged to no \u201csocieties, unions, professional associations, civic clubs, or other organizations\u201d that reasonably could be characterized as religious.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Yet on voir dire, Juror E. E. nevertheless identified himself as a \u201cbom Catholic\u201d and \u201cnow a bom again Christian\u201d; Juror P. L. identified herself as a Baptist who attended church; Juror D. St. had a Lutheran background; and Juror M. T. stated she was Catholic and went to church every Sunday. Further, the religious affiliation of seven jurors (Jurors G. R., C. V., D. N., D. St., T. E, R. E, and K. M.), or greater than one-half the number of jurors, and all four alternate jurors (Alternates J. C., D. L., M. S., and R. B.), never was elicited or otherwise identified.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Thus, it is virtually impossible on this record to state the number of Jewish persons who served on the jury, or who were in the jury pool. (Cf. <em>Miller-El v. Dretke, supra, </em>545 U.S. at p. 240 [125 S.Ct. at p. 2325] [noting the prosecution challenged 10 out of 11 African-American prospective jurors not removed for cause].) As observed, <em>ante, </em>even when jurors did not list religious organizations on their questionnaires, on several occasions voir dire revealed that they were in fact religious. Thus, although the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges against two prospective jurors who, during voir dire, identified affiliations with Judaism in response to questioning by defense counsel, the circumstance that neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel ever inquired into the religious affiliation of the majority of the seated jurors and alternates, and that the prosecutor had no other reasonable means of ascertaining their religious affiliation, undercuts any suggestion of purposeful discrimination against Prospective Jurors D. H. and M. B. because of their Jewish faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Finally, as we do in any case of alleged bias, we defer to the trial court\u2019s determination as to credibility. <em>(Hernandez, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 365 [best evidence of whether race-neutral explanation should be believed is often \u201cthe demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge,\u201d and \u201cevaluation of the prosecutor\u2019s state of mind based on demeanor and credibility lies \u2018peculiarly within a trial judge\u2019s province\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Batson, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 98, fn. 21 [\u201cSince the trial judge\u2019s findings in the context under consideration here largely will turn on evaluation of credibility, a reviewing court ordinarily should give those findings great deference\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">We therefore conclude, with respect to both Prospective Jurors M. B. and D. H., that defendant has not demonstrated that the prosecutor engaged in purposeful discrimination against prospective Jewish jurors, and that the defense motion below was properly denied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">b. <em>Asserted incorrect standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Defendant contends that the trial court applied an incorrect standard to decide the <em>Wheeler </em>motion. He asserts that the trial court determined that group bias played a part in the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenges, but nonetheless denied defendant\u2019s <em>Wheeler </em>motion because group bias was not the \u201csole\u201d reason motivating the prosecutor. In advancing this argument, defendant relies upon the circumstance that the trial court, in rejecting defendant\u2019s <em>Wheeler </em>motion, stated: \u201cNow after an analysis of the proffered reasons with regard to the exercise of these two peremptory challenges, the court will find at this time that the peremptory challenges in question were not predicated on group bias alone and accordingly the motion will be denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">In <em>Wheeler, </em>this court stated that \u201cthe use of peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors on the <em>sole </em>ground of group bias violates the right to trial by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community under article I, section 16, of the California Constitution.\u201d <em>(Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 276-277, italics added; see <em>id. </em>at p. 281 [\u201cIf the court finds that a prima facie case has been made, the burden shifts to the other party to show if he can that the peremptory challenges in question were not predicated on group bias alone\u201d (fn. omitted)]; <em>id. </em>at p. 287 [\u201call claims in California courts that peremptory challenges are being used to strike jurors solely on the ground of group bias are to be governed by article I, section 16, of the California Constitution and the procedure outlined above\u201d]; see also <em>Batson, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 89 [\u201cthe Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors <em>solely </em>on account of their race or on the assumption that black jurors as a group will be unable impartially to consider the State\u2019s case against a black defendant\u201d (italics added)]; see also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>People v.

(See <em>People v.

(Cf. <em>Arlington Heights </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. </em>(1977) 429 U.S. 252, 265 [50 L.Ed.2d 450, 97 S.Ct. 555] [in seeking to establish that zoning decision was motivated by racial bias in violation of the equal protection clause, challenger need not establish \u201cthat the challenged action rested solely on racially discriminatory purposes. Rarely can it be said that a legislature or administrative body . . . made a decision motivated by a single concern, or even that a particular purpose was the \u2018dominant\u2019 or \u2018primary\u2019 one\u201d (fn. omitted)]; <em>Price Waterhouse </em>v. <em>Hopkins </em>(1989) 490 U.S. 228, 241, 258 [104 L.Ed.2d 268, 109 S.Ct. 1775] [in action under tit. VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, plaintiff need not prove that unlawful discrimination was the sole factor motivating an employment decision in order to establish a violation of the act]; see also <em>Desert Palace, Inc. </em>v. <em>Costa </em>(2003) 539 U.S. 90, 101-102 [156 L.Ed.2d 84, 123 S.Ct. 2148] [considering use of circumstantial evidence as proof in mixed-motive case under 1991 amendments to tit. VII].) Defendant acknowledges that neither in <em>Wheeler </em>nor in any subsequent decision has our court actually addressed or decided the question whether a mixed-motive peremptory challenge could constitute a violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, but he maintains that the question must be decided in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">We do not agree that we need to or properly should address the mixed-motive question in this case. For the reasons explained, <em>ante, </em>we have rejected defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons for the peremptory challenges were pretextual, and defendant points to no evidence in the record other than the mere circumstance that two Jewish prospective jurors were excused through peremptory challenges upon which the trial court could have found such group bias. Under these circumstances, we conclude it is not reasonable to interpret the trial court\u2019s use of the language from <em>Wheeler </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>denying defendant\u2019s motion as a determination by the trial court that the prosecutor was motivated in part by group bias. Rather, in light of the record in this case, we believe the trial court\u2019s statement simply reflected its finding that defendant had not established that the peremptory challenges in question were motivated by group bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">B. <em>Guilt phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">1. <em>Asserted erroneous limitation on scope of cross-examination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Defendant contends the trial court committed reversible error, and violated his state and federal constitutional rights to confrontation, a fair trial, due process of law, and a reliable verdict, when it refused to allow him to cross-examine Jamie Gronley concerning promises made to her in exchange for her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">During cross-examination, defense counsel asked Gronley whether a month earlier she had been convicted of the felony of possession of heroin. She replied \u201cyes,\u201d and also responded affirmatively when asked whether she was awaiting sentencing on that conviction. Defense counsel then asked, \u201cAt the time you pled guilty to that offense ... did the district attorney recommend you be released from custody?\u201d \u201cNo, he did not.\u201d \u201cWithin 10 minutes of you entering that plea were you released from custody?\u201d \u201cI was released. That was my release date from Hayward was August 30th. That\u2019s the day I got out of jail. My sentencing date for this case that I picked up is on November 3rd.\u201d \u201cDid your attorney represent to you that if you entered a guilty plea in this case the district attorney would recommend you be released from custody?\u201d \u201cThere were no promises made.\u201d \u201cWere you released [from] custody the very date you entered your plea?\u201d \u201cI was released on O.R. [own recognizance] and also upon my release date and I was put on O.R. for the new date.\u201d \u201cAnd are you awaiting sentence at this time?\u201d \u201cYes, I am.\u201d Defense counsel then asked, \u201cHas your attorney indicated if your testimony is favorable in this case the district attorney\u2014\u201d The prosecutor objected, and Gronley stated, \u201cWhether I had a case or not I would testify.\u201d The prosecutor stated that defense counsel was \u201casking [Gronley] to violate the lawyer-client privilege.\u201d The trial court sustained the objection \u201cas to anything her attorney may have told her\u201d and told defense counsel to proceed. Defense counsel then changed the subject, asking Gronley whether she had suffered a prior felony conviction in Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, it is apparent defendant was not \u201ccompletely precluded\u201d from exploring the topic of what promises, if any, were made to Ms. Gronley in exchange for her testimony. Rather, defense counsel cross-examined Gronley at some length concerning the chain of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>events leading to her impending sentencing in the felony case, apparently in an effort to delineate circumstances that implicitly might demonstrate that the prosecutor had accorded her leniency. As the high court has observed, \u201cthe Confrontation Clause only guarantees \u2018an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie </em>(1987) 480 U.S. 39, 53 [94 L.Ed.2d 40, 107 S.Ct. 989].)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Defendant could have asked Gronley, but did not, whether any promises of leniency were made to her in exchange for her testimony in the present case, without inquiring as to her conversations with her attorney. Instead, defendant simply abandoned the subject. Under these circumstances, we are reluctant to find error of constitutional proportion based upon the trial court\u2019s ruling sustaining an objection to a single question regarding a witness\u2019s conversation with her attorney.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">In addition, on May 12, 1987, in the context of a broad discovery order entered prior to trial, the trial court ordered that the prosecutor disclose to defense counsel, with respect to all witnesses, the following: \u201cany and all promises, inducements, offers of reward or immunity, or affirmative representations made or implied to such persons in an effort to obtain information or testimony as to the investigation and/or prosecution of the alleged offenses as charged in the information, and as to such persons, any and all threats made or implied for a like purpose.\u201d This order was to \u201cbe deemed a continuing and ongoing order through the completion of trial, so that any items granted by this order, which are actually or constructively obtained by or become known to the District Attorney of Alameda County or any of his deputies, investigators, employees, or agents after initial compliance with this order has been made, shall also be made available forthwith to defense counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">On September 11, 1989, the eve of opening statements to the jury, the prosecutor noted that \u201cThere\u2019s been a continuing discovery order. . . . [T]he court ordered me to continue to disclose any promise or representation I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>made to any prospective witnesses.\u201d The prosecutor then stated that he had spoken with Jamie Gronley\u2019s attorney, Jack Noonan. Mr. Noonan stated that Gronley was in jail for probation violations and would be released on August 31; she had a court date on August 30 regarding a felony. The prosecutor informed the court that he had told Mr. Noonan: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t object if she pleads guilty to the felony to have an out of custody [report and sentence] and I said other than that there are no promises as to her. So that was the representation made and it is my understanding that she did plead guilty to the felony or nolo, and that she is out of custody . . . [f]or purposes of report and sentence.\u201d The court asked defense counsel, \u201cMr. Meyer, anything further on that issue, sir?\u201d Mr. Meyer responded, \u201cThat is the District Attorney\u2019s representation pursuant to the previous order and I have no further comments at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">There is no evidence in the record indicating that, subsequent to the colloquy described by the prosecutor, and despite the circumstance that the prosecutor was subject to the May 1987 discovery order until the \u201ccompletion of trial,\u201d he made undisclosed promises to Gronley in exchange for her testimony. The prosecutor\u2019s pretrial disclosure suggests that defense counsel did not have any reason to pursue the topic with Gronley during cross-examination after the trial court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Defendant further contends that the trial court erred by failing to hold a hearing to determine the admissibility of communications between Gronley and her attorney concerning the treatment she might expect in exchange for her favorable testimony. Defendant never sought a hearing on this issue, however, nor indeed did he even suggest the trial court erred in sustaining the objection. Defendant thus waived the claim on appeal. Even assuming the claim was not waived, it is clear that any error would have been harmless under any standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">2. <em>Asserted improper admission of hearsay evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Defendant contends that reversal is required because the trial court admitted unreliable hearsay evidence concerning the issue of identity, in violation of defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to confrontation of adverse witnesses, due process of law, and reliable guilt and penalty determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">During her direct testimony, Rebecca Germaine was asked whether her husband Lorin Germaine told her \u201canything that the buyer said to him?\u201d Over defense objection, Rebecca responded that during the test drive, the prospective buyer had commented to Lorin that he \u201clooked really familiar and he asked him if he had a younger brother, that [the prospective buyer] thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>that he knew [Lorin\u2019s] younger brother.\u201d Rebecca further testified that in fact, Lorin did have a younger brother, John, who looked \u201c[e]xactly like him.\u201d Subsequently, Trede testified that Rebecca Germaine told him that Lorin had said the prospective buyer \u201cthought he knew Lorin\u2019s brother.\u201d Trede further testified that in April 1986, defendant and Trede were in the same holding cell in municipal court. John Germaine was in the courtroom visiting Trede, and defendant made a comment about him to Trede.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">On appeal, defendant challenges the admission of the testimony of Rebecca Germaine with regard to Lorin\u2019s recollection to her of the prospective buyer\u2019s comments, as well as Trede\u2019s testimony that Rebecca Germaine repeated to him the statement her husband Lorin assertedly made to her concerning the prospective buyer\u2019s conversation with Lorin. Defendant asserts that Rebecca\u2019s testimony describing Lorin\u2019s statements to her was double hearsay, and that Trede\u2019s testimony was triple hearsay, admitted in violation of the confrontation clause and serving \u201conly to exacerbate the harm caused by introduction of the original hearsay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">A statement by defendant to Lorin constituted a statement by a party, and was relevant to the prospective buyer\u2019s identity. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 1220; <em>People v. Robinson </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 434, 444-445 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 179].) Nonetheless, that purported statement of the prospective buyer was recounted by the victim to Rebecca and subsequently to Trede. Assuming that the testimony of Rebecca and Trede presented multiple hearsay that should not have been admitted, there is no conceivable prejudice under any standard of review, because of the overwhelming evidence against defendant, including his admission to Gronley that he was the killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">3. <em>Asserted illegal search and seizure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Defendant contends that the police violated his United States Constitution, Fourth and Eighth Amendment rights by performing a warrantless search of belongings that he had stored in a private home, and by introducing in evidence a letter recovered in the search subsequently used to establish his identity as the killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The trial court held a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence recovered in the search, in particular, as relevant here, defendant\u2019s letter to Gronley of May 9, 1986, indicating that defendant wanted to obtain \u201csome wheels for us right away, prob[ably] a van.\u201d Hayward Police Detectives Muir and Muniz testified at the hearing on June 1, 1986, that following defendant\u2019s arrest and interview with the police, the officers went to the residence of Melba Valdez and Wanda Wilson, arriving at approximately 7:30 p.m. Valdez identified herself as the tenant of the premises. After the officers identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>themselves and explained the purpose of their visit, Valdez invited them to examine several paper bags containing defendant\u2019s clothing that were located in her garage. There, Detective Muir found defendant\u2019s May 9 letter to Gronley. Detective Muir believed that Valdez had authority to consent to an examination of the contents of the bags containing defendant\u2019s belongings.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Valdez testified she had given the officers permission to enter and to search three bags containing defendant\u2019s clothing that were stored in her garage. During much of May, defendant sanded and painted her kitchen. Defendant did not live there, but on a \u201ccouple\u201d of occasions when he fell asleep while watching television, she covered him with a blanket and let him sleep there rather than awaken him. Defendant did not have a key, had to be let in each day, and did not receive mail at her residence. After he finished sanding and painting for the day, defendant would shower and Valdez would wash his clothes and place them back inside the paper bags. Defendant never told Valdez not to open the bags. Valdez did not learn defendant\u2019s last name until the officers informed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Defendant did not testify at the hearing. The trial court denied the motion to suppress evidence, finding, among other things, that Valdez had authority to consent to the search by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The trial court ruled correctly. Although defendant asserted ownership of the contents of the bags, such an assertion is merely one factor in the determination whether he had a legitimate expectation of privacy therein. <em>(Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 98, 105 [65 L.Ed.2d 633, 100 S.Ct. 2556].) Significantly, defendant left these belongings in bags at a residence occupied by two other persons, knowing that one of them (Valdez) routinely placed his laundered clothing inside the bags, and he never instructed her not to do so. Accordingly, Valdez had access to defendant\u2019s personal effects sufficient to endow her with authority to consent to the search.  \u201c[C]onsent of one who possesses common authority over . . . effects is valid as against the absent, nonconsenting person with whom that authority is shared.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Matlock </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 164, 170 [39 L.Ed.2d 242, 94 S.Ct. 988]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 976-977 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 997 P.2d 1044].) By permitting Valdez common access to the bags, and storing them at her home, defendant \u201cassumed the risk\u201d that Valdez \u201cwould allow someone else to look inside.\u201d <em>(United States v. Matlock, supra, </em>415 U.S. at p. 171.) Regardless whether defendant is characterized as a mere invitee or as an overnight guest, he had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the bags with respect to Valdez, an occupant of the residence who consented to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>4. <em>Asserted mishandling of physical evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Defendant contends the state\u2019s failure to honor discovery orders requiring the disclosure of physical evidence to the defense and to preserve and store the evidence properly, as well as the state\u2019s destruction of certain physical evidence, violated his right to a fair trial under federal principles of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">a. <em>Factual background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">At the time of his arrest on June 1, 1986, defendant was wearing a bloodstained black jacket. In November 1988, in the trial court, defendant filed a \u201cMotion for Sanctions for Failure to Properly Preserve Material Evidence\u201d and in March 1989, filed supplemental points and authorities in support of that motion. Defendant asserted that the jacket should have been maintained in a frozen state to make it possible to perform more refined tests on the bloodstains at a later time. Defendant sought to exclude \u201call testimony regarding blood tests on the jacket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">At the May 1989 hearing on the motion, Sharon Binkley, a criminalist in the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s laboratory, testified that she had received the jacket from the Hayward Police Department on June 5, 1986. She stored the jacket in a freezer \u201cto slow down the deterioration of the genetic markers that can be found in the biological evidence.\u201d Subsequently, Binkley received known blood samples from the murder victim and from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">At some point, Binkley examined the jacket and found human blood on the right sleeve. She cut out a portion of the bloodstained area and tested it for genetic markers. As a result of these tests, Binkley concluded that the blood on the jacket was consistent with victim Lorin Germaine\u2019s blood, but inconsistent with that of defendant. Performing the genetic marker typing consumed a portion of the bloodstain, and therefore Binkley did not retain the cut out portion she had tested. Another criminalist returned the jacket to the Hayward Police Department on September 29, 1986. It was not Binkley\u2019s practice, upon release of items of property, to advise the police how to maintain biological specimens, and she was unfamiliar with the provisions used by police departments for the storage of biological material.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">Dr. Edward Blake, a forensic serologist and defense expert, testified that, on August 11, 1987, he received the jacket from Inspector McGrath. On September 11, 1987, Dr. Blake received blood specimens originating from the victim and from defendant. The prosecutor informed him that the jacket had not been maintained in a frozen state and that the material removed by Binkley was unavailable. Dr. Blake stated that, because of the jacket\u2019s black <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>color and the nature of the fabric, it was \u201cvery difficult to perceive whether or not there [were] any biological fluids dried onto the fabric.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Dr. Blake cut out a portion of the jacket adjacent to the area previously removed, and determined that it contained type A human blood. He was unable to perform more refined genetic marker tests, most likely because the sample had not been properly preserved or frozen. His tests would have sought to determine whether the excised bloodstain remained consistent with the victim\u2019s blood. Dr. Blake was furnished with a copy of Binkley\u2019s laboratory report and her notes. He found no inadequacy in her laboratory technique, nor any inconsistency between her report and her notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, finding \u201cthere was no suggestion or showing of governmental bad faith either by the Hayward Police Department or the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Laboratory, and die failure to refrigerate the evidence here . . . could at worst be described as negligent.\u201d The trial court further found that \u201cwhile the failure to preserve the bloodstain and jacket evidence may preclude the defendant from obtaining comparable evidence by other reasonably apparent means, that evidence did not possess an apparent exculpatory value before the suggested failure to properly preserve but rather possessed upon completion of tests performed by criminalist Sharon Binkley an apparent inculpatory value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">b. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The state has a duty to preserve evidence that both possesses \u201can exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed,\u201d and is of \u201csuch a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\u201d <em>(California v. Trombetta </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 479, 489 [81 L.Ed.2d 413, 104 S.Ct. 2528] <em>(Trombetta).) </em>Moreover, a constitutional violation is not established unless the authorities acted in bad faith in failing to preserve potentially useful evidence. <em>(Arizona v. Youngblood </em>(1988) 488 U.S. 51, 58 [102 L.Ed.2d 281, 109 S.Ct. 333] <em>(Youngblood).)</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">In the present case, the trial court properly found that because the bloodstain evidence was inculpatory rather than exculpatory at the time the jacket was returned to the Hayward Police Department, the <em>Trombetta </em>test was not satisfied. Therefore, any failure of the police properly to preserve the jacket in a frozen state did not constitute a violation of defendant\u2019s right to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Defendant asserts that, because the state had been aware of the inculpatory value of the evidence, \u201c[b]y a parity of reasoning, the state had to be equally aware of the potential exculpatory value of the jacket. The absence of the victim\u2019s blood on the jacket would make it unlikely that Mr. Schmeck was the shooter.\u201d That reasoning, however, does not constitute the applicable test. The circumstance that additional, more refined testing possibly could have excluded the victim as the source of the bloodstain on the jacket worn by defendant does not suggest the evidence properly can be characterized as exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Defendant contends that bad faith was evident in the asserted violation of a discovery order by the police. On June 19, 1986, defendant filed in municipal court a discovery motion that requested all physical evidence, and at the hearing he indicated that the parties had stipulated to a July 16, 1986 date for compliance. On July 16, the prosecutor explained, presumably referring in part to the bloodstains on the jacket, that the laboratory analysts had not yet completed their tests because a blood sample from defendant was required. The court continued to August 12, the date set for compliance with the discovery order. On July 24, the court ordered that a blood sample be taken from defendant. On August 12, the court observed that the parties still were waiting to receive certain laboratory reports, and continued to August 29, the date set for compliance with the discovery order. Subsequently, the court continued to September 12, 1986, the date set for compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The reporter\u2019s transcripts of the hearings held on September 12, September 26, and October 24, 1986, have been destroyed. Nonetheless, at a hearing held on December 11, 1986, the prosecutor observed that at some point during that period, the laboratory report \u201cregarding the blood\u201d had been provided to defendant, and that the only item defendant still required was the \u201cscientific lab work that provided the foundation for the report.\u201d The prosecutor indicated that those notes would be provided, probably the following day, and inquired, \u201cIs there anything else in the way of discovery that the defense is requesting at this point?\u201d Defense counsel answered, \u201cNot that we know of. However, we would reserve the right to bring it to the Court\u2019s attention if something may come up from the very materials that the District Attorney has indicated he will furnish us tomorrow. We don\u2019t anticipate anything else.\u201d On December 18, 1986, defense counsel noted that at the last hearing the defense was notified that it would be provided with the lab notes of the blood analysis, and stated, \u201cWe now have received the entire contents of blood analysis that was done by the Alameda County Lab.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>On May 11, 1987, shortly after defendant\u2019s arraignment in superior court, he filed a discovery motion that included a request for \u201call physical evidence.\u201d Defendant did not request the jacket, or note that he had not received the jacket, in the discovery request or in defense counsel\u2019s supporting declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">As noted, <em>ante, </em>on August 11, 1987, defendant received the jacket for testing. Defendant, who wore the jacket at the time of his arrest in June 1986, knew it was in the possession of the police, yet at no time during those hearings did the defense indicate it had not received the jacket; rather, the defense indicated it had received the related laboratory reports and notes. In sum, we conclude the record fails to establish any violation of the discovery order, let alone any bad faith on the part of the prosecution or law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">5. <em>Asserted instructional error and prosecutorial misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Defendant contends that so-called structural error occurred because the jury improperly was instructed that the state did not have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the killer, and because the prosecutor\u2019s opening and closing arguments included comments that reinforced the erroneous instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The trial court instructed the jury regarding the difference between a confession and an admission, and that the jury was the exclusive judge whether defendant had made a confession or an admission and, if so, whether the confession or admission was true in whole or in part. The trial court also instructed the jury that evidence of an oral confession or admission by defendant should be viewed with caution unless it had been tape-recorded. The court further instructed: \u201cEvidence has been received from which you may find that an oral statement of intent, plan or design was made by the defendant before the offense with which he is charged was committed. It is for you to decide whether such a statement was made by the defendant. Evidence of an oral statement ought to be viewed with caution.\u201d The court then read the challenged instruction: \u201cNo person may be convicted of a criminal offense unless there is some proof of each element of the crime independent of any confession or admission made by him outside of this trial. The identity of the person who is alleged to have committed a crime is not an element of the crime nor is the degree of the crime. Such identity or degree of the crime may be established by a confession or admission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Defendant concedes that the \u201cmere provision of these [corpus delicti] instructions itself is not enough to establish a \u2018reasonable likelihood\u2019 that the jury failed to apply the correct burden of proof to the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>identity.\u201d (See <em>People v. Frye </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 894, 959-960 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 25, 959 P.2d 183].) Defendant insists, however, a reasonable likelihood existed that the jury did not apply the correct burden of proof, because in addition the prosecutor made two misleading statements. The prosecutor assertedly made the first during his opening argument, prior to describing the elements of robbery: \u201cI represent the people of the state of California, I represent the society, the group of people that live in this state. And anyone who is accused of a crime has to be convicted beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty. And that\u2019s my responsibility to you, the jury. Each crime has certain elements, and each element has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt or the crime fails. <em>The identity of a person who is accused of a crime is not an element of a crime.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s statement or seek an admonition, and no exception to the general requirement of an objection is applicable; to the extent defendant claims the prosecutor committed misconduct by misstating the law, defendant has forfeited this claim on appeal. <em>(People v. Turner </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 406, 430 [20 Cal.Rptr.3d 182, 99 P.3d 505].) Moreover, defense counsel observed in closing argument that the prosecutor \u201csays that identity of the perpetrator is not an element. He\u2019s correct in [that] it\u2019s not one of those steps or those elements that satisfy the particular crime. But what you are talking about is it\u2019s got to be the person that\u2019s on trial If that\u2019s not the person that did that crime then the crime is not applicable to that person. . . . [T]he People have not proved homicide against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Indeed, the identity of the killer was the primary issue disputed at trial and in counsels\u2019 arguments to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The prosecutor made the second statement at the outset of closing argument, when he characterized as conjecture and insinuation defense counsel\u2019s argument attempting to persuade the jury that Jamie Gronley and Donald Willis had committed the murder, and then added, \u201cIf you are going to present a case that someone else committed this crime, you\u2019ve got to put on evidence.\u201d Defense counsel objected and sought an assignment of misconduct, noting that \u201cthere is no burden on the defense. The burden is on\u201d the prosecutor. The trial court reminded the jury that the statements of counsel are not evidence and that the court would instruct them \u201cas to the law at the conclusion of the arguments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Despite any ambiguity in the prosecutor\u2019s statements, the trial court\u2019s instructions made clear that defendant\u2019s identity as the murderer had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>(Boyde v. California </em>(1990) 494 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>U.S. 370, 384 [108 L.Ed.2d 316, 110 S.Ct. 1190] [\u201c[Arguments of counsel generally carry less weight with a jury than do instructions from the court. The former are usually billed in advance to the jury as matters of argument, not evidence [citation], and are likely viewed as the statements of advocates; the latter, we have often recognized, are viewed as definitive and binding statements of the law\u201d]; <em>Cupp </em>v. <em>Naughten </em>(1973) 414 U.S. 141, 146-147 [38 L.Ed.2d 368, 94 S.Ct. 396] [\u201ca single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge\u201d].) In view of the parties\u2019 emphasis at trial upon the issue of identity, and the substance of the remaining instructions, we conclude there is no reasonable likelihood the jury would not have understood it must determine whether it had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant killed Lorin Germaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Defendant further contends that even if this asserted error \u201cdid not require reversal of the guilt phase verdict, it separately would require reversal of the death sentence.\u201d He observes that in arguing at the penalty phase against any lingering doubt, the prosecutor stated: \u201c[A]sk yourself did they present any evidence, did they present any evidence to show that the defendant was not there? Did they bring in an alibi? No. Nothing. The evidence as you have . . . determined it, he\u2019s the killer.\u201d Nothing in the prosecutor\u2019s comment indicates that defendant\u2019s identity as the killer was not relevant to his murder conviction or to the penalty that should be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">We have concluded that no reasonable juror would interpret the corpus delicti instruction or the prosecutor\u2019s argument during the guilt phase to mean that it was unnecessary to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>identity as the killer. In view of our conclusions regarding the claims of instructional error and prosecutorial misconduct, we also reject defendant\u2019s related contention that this claimed instructional error and prosecutorial misconduct violated his federal and state constitutional rights to proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and his Eighth Amendment right to a reliable determination of guilt and penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">6. <em>Asserted additional prosecutorial misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Defendant contends that the prosecutor committed other misconduct violating defendant\u2019s federal and state rights to due process of law and a reliable guilt and penalty phase determination. Considering his claims either singly or in combination, we conclude there was no prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">First, defendant contends the prosecutor committed misconduct in telling a prospective juror during <em>Hovey </em>voir dire that her vote was merely a recommendation as to penalty. We previously rejected this claim in considering whether that prospective juror erroneously was excused (see <em>ante, </em>at pp. 263-265), and reject the claim in the present context for the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Defendant contends that during closing argument, the prosecutor relied upon the \u201cfailure of the defense to present certain evidence when the defense was kept from presenting the evidence by the prosecutor\u2019s own motion.\u201d During that argument, the prosecutor stated that the defense \u201cconjecture[s] that I have some secret deal with Jamie Gronley about her sentencing on a felony matter that we didn\u2019t divulge out here in the open.\u201d Although defense counsel objected that he had made no such argument or statement, no objection was made on the ground that the defense had been precluded from learning about any deal the prosecution had made with Gronley. Thus, the claim is waived. It also is lacking in merit for the reasons stated in our discussion of defendant\u2019s similar claim regarding the assertedly improper limitation of the defense cross-examination of Gronley. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 277-279.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Defendant also reiterates the claim that we rejected, <em>ante, </em>in considering the instructions on corpus delicti, that the prosecutor committed misconduct when he told the jury \u201cthat the state did not have to prove identity beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (See <em>ante, </em>at p. 287.) As discussed, <em>ante, </em>the prosecutor did not so inform the jury but rather stated that \u201c[t]he identity of a person who is accused of a crime is not an element of a crime.\u201d As we have noted, defendant forfeited this claim by not objecting. Nor did the prosecutor\u2019s challenged comment during the penalty phase indicate that defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>identity as the killer was not pertinent to his murder conviction or to the appropriate penalty to be imposed. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 286-288.) For the reasons stated in our earlier discussion, we conclude that the prosecutor did not commit misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Defendant contends that on \u201cnumerous\u201d occasions during argument the prosecutor referred to facts that were not in evidence. The prosecutor stated that \u201cdefendant saw John Germaine[,] and John and Dennis [Trede] look alike. . . . [Defendant said \u2018Is that your brother?\u2019 [Trede said] No, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a friend.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Defense counsel objected on the ground that the prosecutor was misstating the testimony. The trial court reminded the jury that the arguments of counsel are not evidence. Defendant notes that the trial court earlier had sustained (on the ground of hearsay) defendant\u2019s objection to Trede\u2019s testimony regarding what defendant had said to Trede. But defendant fails to demonstrate that the prosecutor\u2019s brief reference infected the trial with such unfairness as to render the subsequent conviction a denial of due process, or that the reference involved deceptive or reprehensible methods employed to persuade the trial court or the jury. <em>(People v. Ayala </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 225, 283-284 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 682, 1 P.3d 3] <em>(Ayala).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Defendant raises the same claim regarding the prosecutor\u2019s comment on the order in which the bullets were fired. The prosecutor stated: \u201cNow if you recall, the first two rounds did not penetrate the skull. Those were number 2 and number 3 here\u2014.\u201d Defense counsel objected on the ground that the pathologist had testified she was unable to ascertain the order in which the bullets were fired. The trial court reminded the jury that the arguments of counsel are not evidence. The prosecutor next described the evidence supporting the ballistic expert\u2019s opinion, based upon certain assumptions, in light of the combined weight of the fragments that two shots were fired into the victim\u2019s scalp.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Defendant reiterates in this court his argument that the pathologist was unable to determine the order in which the bullet wounds were sustained. But in light of defendant\u2019s statement to Gronley that after defendant fired the first shot the victim grabbed his head, looked at defendant, and asked defendant what he was doing, it reasonably may be inferred that the victim sustained one or more superficial gunshot wounds before the fatal ones. In any event, the prosecutor\u2019s use of the word \u201cfirst\u201d was isolated, and his apparent point was to refer to the ballistic expert\u2019s conclusion that there were two bullet wounds in the victim\u2019s scalp, not one, regardless of the order in which those shots were fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Next, defendant contends the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the defense had \u201casked for and got [an instruction on] murder in the second degree\u201d was not based upon the evidence. Defense counsel objected and sought an admonition. The trial court \u201cadvise[d] the jury they will be instructed on the law at the conclusion of the arguments of counsel.\u201d Defendant correctly observes there is no evidence who requested the second degree murder instruction, and in any event that information is irrelevant. Nonetheless, the comment was brief and probably not given any consideration by the jury, and defendant makes no attempt to demonstrate that it infected the trial with such a degree of unfairness as to render the subsequent conviction a denial of due process, or involved the use of deceptive or reprehensible methods to persuade the trial court or the jury. <em>(Ayala, supra, 23 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 283-284.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Finally, defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to gunshot residue was not based upon the evidence. During defendant\u2019s closing argument, in the course of challenging the thoroughness of the police investigation, counsel stated: \u201cThe fact that there is no evidence that when the defendant was arrested any attempt was made to find out if he had discharged the firearm, had powder bums on his clothes or his hands . . . .\u201d Apparently in response, the prosecutor stated, \u201cWhat if? That\u2019s pure speculation. What if. Did they take powder bums off the defendant\u2019s hands two days after a shooting? Can\u2019t.\u201d Defense counsel objected on the ground that \u201cThat\u2019s not in the evidence.\u201d The trial court reminded the jury that \u201cthe statements of counsel are not evidence.\u201d Defendant is correct in noting that no evidence was introduced regarding the ability to detect powder bums two days following a shooting, but in any event the prosecutor\u2019s comment was brief and cannot reasonably be viewed as having affected the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">7. <em>Asserted additional instructional error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">a. <em>Instructions on consciousness of guilt</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Defendant contends that his murder and robbery convictions must be reversed because the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that defendant\u2019s false statements and attempts to suppress evidence, if any, could be considered as evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">The jury in this case was instmcted, in the language of CALJIC Nos. 2.03 and 2.06, that any willfully false or deliberately misleading statements or efforts to conceal or destroy evidence on the part of defendant could be considered as a circumstance tending to prove consciousness of guilt.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, neither instruction was improper merely because the theory of the defense was that defendant assisted Donald Willis only after the murder and the robbery were committed and hence the defense theory already \u201cpresupposed commission of a crime.\u201d If found to have been made, defendant\u2019s false statements to the police disclaiming his involvement in the robbery of Lorin Germaine, and his attempt to wipe down and alter the murder weapon, were evidence of a consciousness of guilt of the robbery and the murder. As such, the evidence was relevant to a determination of defendant\u2019s guilt of those offenses, even though the defense conceded that other offenses were committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Defendant also contends that these instructions allowed the jury to draw impermissible inferences. We previously have rejected this claim, and defendant fails to offer any persuasive basis for revisiting our prior decision. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Breaux </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 281, 303-304 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 81, 821 P.2d 585] [nothing in CALJIC Nos. 2.03 and 2.06 compels the drawing of impermissible inferences].)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">b. <em>Asserted failure to instruct on being an accessory after the fact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Defendant contends that the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the crime of being an accessory after the fact, in violation of defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to trial by jury and due process of law, and his right under the Eighth Amendment to procedures ensuring a reliable guilt phase verdict.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We conclude that no such error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Defendant concedes that the offense of being an accessory after the fact is not a lesser included offense to robbery and murder, and that he did not request an instruction to the jury regarding this crime.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We have held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>that a trial court has no duty to instruct on an uncharged lesser related offense when requested to do so by the defendant <em>(People v. Birks </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 108, 136 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 848, 960 P.2d 1073]) and, therefore, it is clear that the trial court did not err in failing sua sponte to so instruct on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Nor, contrary to his assertion, was defendant deprived of an adequate opportunity to present his defense. The jury fully was apprised of the theory of the defense through defendant\u2019s statement to the police, the defense\u2019s impeachment of prosecution witnesses, and defense counsel\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">8. <em>Asserted juror misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Defendant contends that the trial court violated his state and federal rights to fair hearing and trial, and reliable guilt and penalty phase verdicts, by failing to hold an adequate hearing after learning that Juror D. N. committed -misconduct in speaking to nonjurors about the case and prejudging it. Defendant further asserts that the error requires reversal of his conviction and the sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">a. <em>Factual background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">On November 6, 1989, the jury returned its guilt phase verdict. Prior to the commencement of the penalty phase, on November 15, defense counsel brought to the court\u2019s attention an alleged incident of juror misconduct, further filing on November 20, a written \u201cmotion for mistrial and new trial.\u201d In support of that motion, defendant attached the declarations of Bobby McGough and Ellis Williams.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">The trial court held a hearing on the motion on November 27. Mr. McGough testified that he knew Juror D. N. because at the time McGough lived on Dohr Street the juror lived across the street from him, and McGough had lived with Juror D. N.\u2019s sister, J. N. McGough also had known defendant since 1985, when McGough brought his automobile to a body shop where defendant worked. At that time, McGough had a conversation with defendant about defendant\u2019s racism.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">On a Thursday in late October or early November 1989, at approximately 11:30 a.m. or 12:00 noon, McGough, who previously had been convicted of four felonies, was in custody at court, waiting to appear for \u201cmultiple armed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>robbery and assault with a deadly weapon.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> McGough testified that he noticed Juror D. N., called out to him, and then had a four-minute to five-minute conversation with the juror. McGough was on one side and Juror D. N. was on the other side of a door that had a screen on it. Ellis Williams, McGough\u2019s codefendant, also was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In their conversation, Juror D. N. told McGough, in a sentence that was interrupted and never was completed, that defendant \u201cwas giving him dirty looks, looks that consisted of racial\u2014.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Juror D. N. also told McGough in the middle of the conversation that he \u201cwasn\u2019t going to vote not guilty in terms of [defendant], that him and two other ladies were going to vote not guilty.\u201d [Sz'c.] At the end of the conversation, McGough told Juror D. N. \u201cto go ahead and do what you gotta do.\u201d The conversation ended when a man told Juror D. N. and another woman who was about 12 to 18 feet away, \u201cIt\u2019s time to go in.\u201d On the same day McGough relayed this conversation to defendant during the lunch break.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Ellis Williams also testified at the hearing. Williams had one prior felony conviction, recently had pleaded guilty to five counts of robbery and \u201ca few\u201d counts of assault with a deadly weapon, and was awaiting sentencing on the latter charges. Williams testified that at some point while he and McGough were at court, McGough had a conversation with a Black juror, who was five feet seven inches or five feet eight inches in height and weighed approximately \u201c150, 160 pounds.\u201d McGough had called out to the juror and inquired whether he remembered McGough \u201cfrom when he used to date his sister.\u201d The conversation was two or three minutes and no more than five minutes in length. During the conversation, Williams left the area \u201cfor a minute or two.\u201d Williams did not see anyone standing near the juror during the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Juror D. N. also testified. Although the trial court encouraged counsel for both parties to suggest questions to the court outside the presence of the juror, the court conducted all of the questioning of Juror D. N. In response to questioning, that juror stated that during the course of the trial, he did not have any conversation with an individual incarcerated in a holding cell in the area of the jury deliberation room, or any discussion about the case with anyone who was inside a holding cell. At some point when the jurors headed down the stairs to the courtroom, Juror D. N. heard someone \u201chollering\u201d something like: \u201cThe guy is innocent, the guy is innocent, he didn\u2019t do it.\u201d The juror could not tell who was yelling or to whom the comment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>directed, nor could he recall whether the incident occurred during deliberations. The jurors never discussed the comment during deliberations. Juror D. N. knew that 10 to 15 years earlier his sister J. N. had dated someone named \u201cBobby,\u201d but the juror was not certain he ever had seen \u201cBobby\u201d or whether he would recognize the person if he saw him. Juror D. N. stated that he had lived on Dohr Street. The court admonished Juror D. N. not to discuss the hearing or what had transpired at the hearing with anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The trial court denied the motion for a mistrial and for a new trial, as well as defendant\u2019s request to discharge Juror D. N. The court found Juror D. N.\u2019s testimony \u201cmore credible than that of the other witnesses. Further, as to the comments that Mr. [D. N.] testified that he heard, there is no sufficient basis to believe at this time, . . . that the juror\u2019s impartiality was affected, the defendant\u2019s case thereby prejudiced or harmed, the fairness of the trial affected or the verdict affected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">b. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">In determining whether juror misconduct occurred, \u201c[w]e accept the trial court\u2019s credibility determinations and findings on questions of historical fact if supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>(People v. Nesler </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 561, 582 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 454, 941 P.2d 87] (lead opn. of George, C. J.); see <em>People v. Pride </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 195, 260 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 833 P.2d 643] <em>(Pride) </em>[\u201cwe defer to the court\u2019s observations and credibility determinations\u201d regarding whether misconduct occurred].) In the present case, the trial court credited the testimony of Juror D. N. over that of McGough and Williams, and found that no misconduct had occurred. Because that finding is supported by substantial evidence we defer to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the hearing held by the trial court on this matter was adequate in dealing with the possibility of juror misconduct. Defense counsel reasonably was precluded from eliciting testimony from other jurors merely to ascertain whether anyone else observed the alleged conversation between Juror D. N. and McGough, or heard a voice \u201chollering\u201d down the stairs. (See <em>People v. Hedgecock </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 395, 419 [272 Cal.Rptr. 803, 795 P.2d 1260] <em>(Hedgecock) </em>[evidentiary \u201chearing should not be used as a \u2018fishing expedition\u2019 to search for possible misconduct\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Defendant also contends the trial court abused its discretion in failing to hold a second evidentiary hearing on additional claims of juror misconduct following the penalty phase. In support of his motion for new trial, defendant submitted a March 24, 1990 declaration from Juror D. St. stating in relevant part: \u201cI observed during deliberations a prisoner speak to [D. N.], another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>juror, when Mr. [D. N.] and myself were in the hall outside the jury room. The prisoner yelled out hello to Mr. [D. N.] from behind a door with a screen, and Mr. [D. N.] went up to the door to talk to the prisoner. Mr. [D. N.] told me that the prisoner had dated his sister, and I joked with Mr. [D. N.] about who his friends were. Mr. [D. N.] did not speak with the prisoner about the Schmeck trial. I believe Mr. Schmeck received a just sentence and a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to hold a further evidentiary hearing. The trial court is required to hold such a hearing only when the defense adduces evidence demonstrating a \u201cstrong possibility that prejudicial misconduct has occurred,\u201d and generally a hearing is unnecessary unless there is a material conflict in the evidence presented by the parties. <em>(Hedgecock, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 419.) Even assuming that a conversation occurred between Juror D. N. and the prisoner, whether Juror D. N. spoke to someone was not a material issue in the case, and evidence of any such conversation did not create a likelihood of prejudicial misconduct. Rather, the conversation, if one occurred, was relevant only if Juror D. N. spoke to a third person about the case, and the declaration expressly stated that the juror did not do so. Indeed, the trial court previously had held an evidentiary hearing to investigate assertions that the juror committed misconduct, and found no misconduct. Under these circumstances, the trial court acted within its discretion in declining to hold a second evidentiary hearing. <em>(People v. Brown </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 518, 582 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 145, 73 P.3d 1137].)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">C. <em>Penalty phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">1. <em>Failure to discharge Juror D. N.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Defendant contends that even if Juror D. N. did not engage in misconduct at the guilt phase, his reaction to the trial court\u2019s inquiry and to events subsequent to that inquiry demonstrated a significant risk that Juror D. N. was biased against defendant, and hence the trial court\u2019s failure to discharge that juror violated defendant\u2019s federal and state constitutional rights to a fair penalty phase and his Eighth Amendment right to a reliable penalty phase determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">On November 16, 1989, while discussing the claims of misconduct by Juror D. N. to be considered at the hearing on November 27, 1989, the trial court stated that \u201cout of an abundance of caution, I know it is not necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>but there was discussion about declarations and the declarations to which the court was referring I hope obviously w[ere] declarations from the two prisoners set forth in [defense counsel] Mr. Meyer\u2019s declaration, and I know it need not be said. The jury has not been discharged and we were scheduled to proceed with the penalty proceeding and I\u2019m not suggesting or directing that declarations be taken from sitting jurors. That is not to occur at this stage of the proceedings. I know I need not say this but I want to make sure there was no misunderstanding. . . . [W]e are clear on the issue of no contact with jurors I presume, Mr. Meyer?\u201d Attorney Meyer responded, \u201cCertainly clear with me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">On November 29, 1989, two days after the hearing and one day after the ruling on the motion for mistrial and new trial, the court clerk received a telephone call from Juror D. N. asking to speak with the trial judge. Juror D. N. was advised by the clerk to put any concerns in writing, and counsel were advised of his call. Later that same day, Juror D. N. delivered a letter to the court in which he inquired: \u201cIs it lawful or unlawful for an investigator, an official, or any other persons from the office of the public defender to personally go to the residence of an immediate family member of a juror with no prior notice and question them off the record regarding matters related and/or not unrelated to this case on [ric] parties involved and parties not involved in this case? Do they have [the] right to question members of a juror\u2019s family regarding the juror\u2019s whereabouts such as where does he work? What church does he go to? Where does he live? Et cetera. If this should happen to a juror in a case such as this what should he or she do if approached by above officials? Is this to be expected in a case such [as] this?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">After receiving this letter, the trial court held a hearing on November 30, 1989, at which Juror D. N. and counsel were present. Juror D. N. testified that when his sister J. N. (the letter N signifies her former surname) telephoned him late on Tuesday night, November 28, 1989 (one day following the earlier hearing on the claims of juror misconduct), to invite him to a baby shower, he told his sister that if anyone asked for his address or telephone number, not to give them that information. J. N. replied, \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing that you asked me that because somebody already came looking for you.\u201d On the telephone, and later in person, J. N. relayed to Juror D. N. that that morning, at approximately 9:00 or 9:30 a.m., a woman knocked at J. N.\u2019s door. J. N. let her in, and the woman began to ask J. N. a series of questions, including whether J. N. had lived with Juror D. N. on Dohr Street. J. N. had answered, \u201cNo.\u201d J. N. was surprised that the woman had located her, because she had not used this last name for 20 years. The woman visitor was forceful, and J. N., who was nine months pregnant, asked her to leave. The woman responded that she had to obtain this information, and continued her series of questions, such as where Juror D. N. resided and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>worked. At that point, J. N.\u2019s husband entered the room because he had heard J. N. ask the woman to leave, and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to leave, ma\u2019am.\u201d The woman continued with her questioning, asking J. N. whether she knew Bobby or defendant. J. N. replied, \u201cNo, who are these people?\u201d Her husband stated that all Juror D. N. did was \u201cgo to work and go to church,\u201d prompting the woman to inquire as to which church he attended. J. N.\u2019s husband again asked the woman to leave, and she then wrote on a legal pad something to the effect that she \u201cdid not obtain any information.\u201d The woman then asked J. N.\u2019s husband for his telephone number. He replied that they did not have a telephone number yet, and although they expected to receive one, he would not divulge that information to the woman, and he again asked her to leave. At that point, the woman gave J. N. a business card identifying herself as Elizabeth Litov, a senior investigator in the Office of the Public Defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">After receiving this information from his sister, Juror D. N. had difficulty sleeping and wondered what was the proper thing to do in such a situation. He stated at the hearing: \u201cThat\u2019s why I wrote the letter. . . . Because I didn\u2019t want to jeopardize this case in any kind of way .... I wanted to know how I go about handling something like this if it happens to a juror.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The court assured Juror D. N. he had done the correct thing in bringing the incident to the court\u2019s attention. In response to the court\u2019s inquiry as to whether Juror D. N. could continue to be fair and impartial to both sides, he said, \u201cYeah, because ... I want Mark and Mrs. Germaine to get a\u2014I want to hear both sides basically. I can do that. I been like that since the beginning.\u201d The court asked, \u201cAnd you continue to feel that way?\u201d Juror D. N. said, \u201cYeah, uh-huh ... It\u2019s no reflection on him.\u201d The court asked, \u201cNo reflection on the defendant?\u201d Juror D. N. said, \u201cNo, huh-uh, Mark deserves a fair trial.\u201d The court subsequently asked, \u201cBased on everything as you\u2019ve described it that\u2019s occurred, is there any reason at all that you can\u2019t be a fair juror here and give Mr. Schmeck a fair trial?\u201d Juror D. N. answered, \u201cNone whatsoever.\u201d The court asked, \u201cAnd give the People a fair trial?\u201d Juror D. N. replied, \u201cNone whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The court also asked Juror D. N. about the earlier inquiry, held on Monday November 27, 1989: \u201cIs there anything at all about the questions that I asked on Monday or that inquiry that you feel impacts your ability to be fair and impartial to both sides in this case?\u201d Juror D. N. responded, \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d The court admonished Juror D. N. not to discuss the case, and not to discuss with any other juror anything that had occurred at the November 27 or November 30 hearings, or \u201canything about\u201d his letter to the court. Juror D. N. said, \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Defendant moved to discharge Juror D. N. for implied bias. After hearing argument, the trial court denied the motion. The court noted that Juror D. N. consistently had stated \u201che could be fair and that what occurred was no reflection on the defendant, that the defendant deserved a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Pursuant to section 1089, when a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to discharge a juror is supported by substantial evidence, it will be upheld. (See <em>Turner, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 205.) In the present case, the trial court, which was in a position to observe Juror D. N.\u2019s demeanor, found that the juror consistently had stated that he could be fair and did not harbor bias against defendant because of the conduct of the Public Defender\u2019s investigator. The trial court acted within its discretion in declining to discharge Juror D. N. Lacking any factual predicate, defendant\u2019s constitutional claims also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The trial court also did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to discharge Juror D. N. after the first inquiry held on November 27, 1989. Juror D. N. specifically was asked whether anything in that inquiry affected his ability to be fair and impartial, and he responded in the negative. Although defendant asserts there was \u201ca genuine risk . . . that [Juror D. N.] would believe the defense instigated the misconduct inquiry,\u201d such a concern is unfounded in view of the circumstance that the court, not counsel, conducted the examination. Substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">2. <em>Asserted prosecutorial misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Defendant contends that misconduct by the prosecutor at the penalty phase violated his federal and state rights to due process of law and a reliable penalty phase determination. Considering the claims both singly and cumulatively, we conclude there was no prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Defendant asserts that the prosecutor \u201cattack[ed] the integrity of defense counsel, cast aspersions on defense counsel, [and] suggested] that defense counsel ha[d] fabricated a defense.\u201d First, defendant notes that the prosecutor displayed for the jury a photograph of defendant taken at the time of his arrest, and commented that the defense had altered defendant\u2019s appearance at trial so that he did not look \u201clike the dope dealing lying rat that he really is.\u201d Defendant did not object to this comment below, and no exception to the general requirement of an objection applies. Defendant therefore has forfeited this claim of error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Boyette </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 381, 432 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 544, 58 P.3d 391].) Moreover, the jury properly could be shown any differences between defendant\u2019s past and present appearance, and the prosecutor\u2019s remark constituted fair comment on such evidence. The prosecutor\u2019s remark came \u201cwithin the bounds of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u2018wide latitude\u2019 given to prosecutors during closing argument\u201d at the penalty phase. <em>(Welch, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 763; see <em>People v. Hawkins </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 920, 961 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 897 P.2d 574] [no misconduct in referring to the defendant as \u201c \u2018coiled like a snake,\u2019 \u201d or to life imprisonment for the defendant being like \u201c \u2018putting a rabid dog in the pound\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Defendant asserts that the prosecutor committed misconduct by stating: \u201cRecall in the guilt phase that the defense counsel argued to you knowing well that it wasn\u2019t true that those blue Levi\u2019s were the trousers that the defendant was wearing when he murdered . . . Lorin Germaine. You know that that wasn\u2019t true. You know that the defense accused Jamie Gronley of conspiring to commit this murder with another person. Falsely accused her. You know that they tried to get the defendant off from being found guilty of first degree murder, robbery and the special circumstance. They didn\u2019t want him convicted at all.\u201d Defendant also objects to the prosecutor\u2019s comments that \u201cyou can\u2019t believe anything they tell you,\u201d and that defendant was \u201ca coward. He wouldn\u2019t stand up to anyone but he would sneak up behind you. Maybe like they\u2019ve been trying to sneak up behind you all telling you one lie after another and then asking you don\u2019t gas him.\u201d The defense did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments; no exception to the general requirement of an objection applies, and defendant\u2019s claim of error therefore is forfeited. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th 406, 430.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">We similarly view the prosecutor\u2019s comment that, \u201cWhen [Defense Counsel] Judith Harris came out here and told you that it was tragic, but she doesn\u2019t care. She does not want you to give the defendant the death penalty notwithstanding that the severity of this crime, the severity of the circumstances and the defendant\u2019s past call for it clearly and loudly ...Defendant did not object; no exception applies to the general requirement of an objection, and defendant\u2019s claim of error is therefore forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Defendant also claims that the prosecutor \u201csuggested] that defense counsel believe[d] his client [was] guilty or [did] not believe in his client\u2019s case.\u201d Defendant relies upon the prosecutor\u2019s statement, \u201cThere isn\u2019t one person in this room, not one, that has any doubt about the defendant\u2019s responsibility in this case.\u201d Defendant objected; the jury was admonished that the statements of counsel are not evidence, and the prosecutor moved on to a different topic. There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the prosecutor\u2019s fleeting remark as referring to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Defendant next asserts that the prosecutor made misstatements of law. The prosecutor argued: \u201cThe question is ... if the mitigating circumstances are substantially outweighing of the aggravating factors, then you can return a life in prison without the possibility of parole. If the mitigating circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>and the aggravating factors are equal, then you may return and must return a verdict of life without parole. But if the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating circumstances, . . . you may return a death <em>[sic]. </em>When you do, the aggravating factors must so substantially outweigh the mitigating circumstances that it calls for the defendant\u2019s death.\u201d Defendant did not object to this statement; no exception to the general requirement of an objection is applicable, and defendant\u2019s claim of error is therefore forfeited. Moreover, the slight misdescription of the weight of the mitigating factors would not have misled the jury, in light of the other comments by the prosecutor and the instructions given by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Nor did the prosecutor commit misconduct by stating that \u201csympathy is a factor both for aggravation and for mitigation if any.\u201d Defendant objected and sought an assignment of misconduct, and the court admonished the jury that it would be \u201cinstructed as to the law at the conclusion of the arguments of counsel.\u201d A jury properly may consider sympathy for the defendant in determining the weight of aggravating evidence, and that, apparently, is what the prosecutor meant. Shortly before the making the comment assigned as error, the prosecutor stated: \u201cYou\u2014each and every one of you\u2014are free to assign whatever moral or sympathetic value you deem appropriate to each and all\u2014all includes the aggravating factors\u2014to each and all of the various factors you are permitted to consider.\u201d Nor, contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, did the prosecutor \u201crepeatedly [tell] the jury it could consider defendant\u2019s lack of remorse in determining if sympathy should be considered aggravating.\u201d Moreover, the jury was instructed: \u201cWhile remorse is a factor you may consider in mitigation, you may not consider the absence of remorse as a factor in aggravation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Defendant contends that the prosecutor \u201cminimized the magnitude\u201d of the penalty decision by referring to a statement by the philosopher Immanuel Kant that \u201cThe last murderer on earth has to be punished, the last, otherwise there is no justice.\u201d We previously have rejected the substantially similar claim that such a reference constitutes error under <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>472 U.S. 320. <em>(People v. Young </em>(2005) 34 Cal.4th 1149, 1222 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 112, 105 P.3d 487] [no <em>Caldwell </em>error in citing to Kant, because there was \u201cno reasonable likelihood that the prosecutor\u2019s argument misled the jury regarding its responsibility in determining the appropriateness of a death sentence\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Finally, defendant asserts that the prosecutor improperly commented on defendant\u2019s decision not to testify at the penalty phase. Nothing in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument reasonably can be so construed. Moreover, the jury was instructed at the request of the defense that defendant had a \u201cconstitutional right not to be compelled to testify at . . . the penalty phase,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>and that the jury \u201cmust not draw any inference from the fact that a defendant does not testify. Further, you must neither discuss this matter nor permit it to enter into your deliberations in any way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">3. <em>Asserted improper admission of facts underlying the Washington State prior conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s admission of the facts underlying his 1984 prior felony theft conviction in Washington State, and the prosecutor\u2019s reliance upon that evidence, violated his state and federal constitutional rights. Defendant is correct that the circumstances surrounding his prior conviction of nonviolent auto theft were inadmissible at the penalty phase. (\u00a7 190.3, factor (c); <em>People v. Livaditis </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 759, 776 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 72, 831 P.2d 297].) He did not, however, object on this basis below, and his claim of error therefore is waived.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Nor did the prosecutor commit misconduct by referring to defendant\u2019s having stolen a car and been placed on probation. Defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument, and no exception to the general requirement of an objection is applicable. Defendant\u2019s claim of error therefore is forfeited. Moreover, on the merits, it would be difficult under the circumstances to fault the prosecutor for simply referring to evidence that had been admitted by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">4. <em>The trial court\u2019s failure to inform defense counsel that the jury believed defendant had suffered two prior felony convictions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s failure to inform defense counsel that the jury believed defendant had suffered two prior felony convictions, and the court\u2019s failure to correct that misunderstanding, violated his constitutional rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and also violated section 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the parties stipulated that the exhibits that had been received in evidence could be forwarded to the jury room upon the jury\u2019s request, without the need to convene court and inform counsel. During its deliberations, the jury sent the court a note that read: \u201cWe would like to see the wedding photo, and the two (2) f[e]lony convictions from the State of Washington.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Defendant\u2019s prior conviction repeatedly was referred to in the singular, both by counsel in argument and by the court in instruction to the jury. Moreover, the prosecutor encouraged the jury to examine the two exhibits (Nos. 64-B and 64-C) documenting the prior conviction, in determining whether defendant had suffered that conviction. In light of such argument and instruction, the trial court may have interpreted the jury\u2019s note to signify simply that the jury wished to see those two documents. Because that interpretation was not unreasonable, and the parties had stipulated not to convene whenever the jury merely requested exhibits, it does not appear that the trial court erred in failing to notify counsel of the existence or content of the jury\u2019s note. Moreover, even had the jury believed, at the time it requested the exhibits, that defendant had suffered two prior felony convictions, it would have been disabused of that notion after it received and examined the documents that clearly reflected but a single prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">5. <em>Asserted admission of nonstatutory evidence in aggravation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s admission of nonstatutory evidence in aggravation regarding an uncharged burglary and theft, and the prosecutor\u2019s reliance upon that evidence in asking the jury to impose the death penalty, violated his state and federal constitutional rights and requires that he be granted a new trial as to penalty phase proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">At the guilt phase, on cross-examination Jamie Gronley testified that she and defendant had entered defendant\u2019s aunt\u2019s residence when the aunt was not present and had stayed there for \u201ca couple of weeks\u201d until their arrest. The defense also called as a witness defendant\u2019s aunt, Monica Hall, who testified that she had telephoned the police because defendant and Gronley were in her house without her permission. Because that testimony was elicited by defendant, who did not object to it, defendant on appeal does not challenge its admission at the guilt phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Defendant asserts, however, that the evidence \u201chad no place in the penalty phase\u201d because it was not unadjudicated violent criminal activity that was admissible under section 190.3, factor (c). Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, there was no prosecutorial misconduct in referring to this guilt phase evidence during the penalty phase closing argument. At defendant\u2019s request, the jury was instructed that it could consider as a circumstance in mitigation, or in determining the appropriate sentence, evidence that defendant \u201chas potential for rehabilitation and for leading a useful life while incarcerated in prison for life without the possibility of parole.\u201d In arguing that defendant was not amenable to rehabilitation, the prosecutor noted the residential break-in was one of many times that defendant had squandered the opportunities in his life. In making this argument, the prosecutor did not suggest that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the jury treat this evidence as aggravating evidence. Moreover, the jury was instructed that other than the alleged Washington theft conviction, \u201cyou may not consider any evidence of any other crime as an aggravating circumstance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">6. <em>Routine instructional and constitutional challenges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Numerous pages of defendant\u2019s opening brief are dedicated to presenting generic claims that we repeatedly have considered and rejected in prior capital cases. Before we address those individual claims, we comment generally upon the briefing of these and similar generic claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Counsel for appellants regularly reassert such claims in this court, primarily in order to preserve them for review in federal court. (See <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Hillery </em>(1986) 474 U.S. 254, 257-258 [88 L.Ed.2d 598, 106 S.Ct. 617] [habeas corpus petitioner must have \u201c \u2018fairly presented\u2019 \u201d to the state courts what is, in \u201csubstance,\u201d the same claim upon which he is seeking federal habeas corpus review]; <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Reese </em>(2004) 541 U.S. 27, 29, 33 [158 L.Ed.2d 64, 124 S.Ct. 1347] [a federal habeas corpus petitioner complies with the exhaustion requirement by \u201calerting [the state] court to the federal nature of the claim\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Although a \u201cfair\u201d presentation is all that is necessary to preserve such claims, the briefing that this court often receives in capital appeals such as this one frequently contains extensive exploration and discussion that is unnecessary to preserve generic claims that we repeatedly have considered and rejected. The extensive nature of such briefing may arise from a perception that this court <em>requires </em>such a presentation and that, in the absence of such a presentation, the claim might be labeled by this court as \u201cperfunctorily asserted\u201d\u2014thus possibly precluding both merit review in this court and subsequent federal review of such claims. Upon reflection, we recognize that certain language in a number of our prior decisions may have contributed to this perception.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>We take this opportunity to clarify that routine or generic claims that we repeatedly have rejected, and which are presented to this court primarily to preserve them for review by the federal courts, have been and will be deemed by this court to be fairly presented so long as the claim is stated in a straightforward manner accompanied by a brief argument. Such a claim is fairly presented even when the defendant does no more than (i) identify the claim in the context of the facts, (ii) note that we previously have rejected the same or a similar claim in a prior decision, and (iii) ask us to reconsider that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">We now turn to the numerous contentions of instructional error and deficits in the death penalty statute that defendant presents in order to preserve these claims for future review. We find none meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The jury was instructed that before it could consider the alleged 1984 crime as an aggravating circumstance, \u201cyou must first be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was in fact convicted of such prior crime.\u201d Defendant contends the trial court violated his Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights by failing to instruct the jury that it must agree unanimously that defendant had committed that crime. The court\u2019s instruction was sufficient. <em>(People v. Prieto </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 226, 263, 275 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 18, 66 P.3d 1123]; <em>People v. Medina </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 694, 782 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 165, 906 P.2d 2].) Nothing in <em>Ring v. Arizona </em>(2002) 536 U.S. 584 [153 L.Ed.2d 556, 122 S.Ct. 2428] affects our conclusions in this regard. <em>(People v. Prieto, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at pp. 263, 275.) Nor did the trial court violate defendant\u2019s Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, or Fourteenth Amendment rights in failing to instruct the jury that it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cox </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 916, 971-972 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 272, 70 P.3d 277].) Again, nothing in <em>Ring, supra, </em>536 U.S. 584, mandates a different conclusion. <em>(People v. Cox, supra, </em>at pp. 971-972.) Nor does the death penalty statute as construed by this court fail to perform the narrowing function required by the Eighth Amendment. <em>(People v. Sakarias </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 596, 632 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 17, 995 P.2d 152].) Section 190.3, factor (a), as applied, does not fail to sufficiently minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. (Cf. <em>Tuilaepa v. California </em>(1994) 512 U.S. 967, 975-980 [129 L.Ed.2d 750, 114 S.Ct. 2630]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crittenden </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 156 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 474, 885 P.2d 887].) Nor do instructions in the language of CALJIC No. 8.85 violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments by failing to delete inapplicable sentencing factors, delineate between aggravating and mitigating circumstances, or specify a burden of proof either as to aggravation (except for other crimes evidence) or the penalty decision. <em>(People v. Box (2000) 23 </em>Cal.4th 1153, 1217 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 69, 5 P.3d 130].) Nor are potentially mitigating factors unconstitutionally limited by the adjectives \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201csubstantial,\u201d because section 190.3, factor (k), as expanded in <em>People </em>v. <em>Easley </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 858 [196 Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d 813], allows consideration of \u201c \u2018any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime\u2019 and any other \u2018aspect of [the] defendant\u2019s character or record . . . that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 878, fn. 10; see <em>People v. Yeoman </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 93, 165 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 186, 72 P.3d 1166].) Defendant fails to specify or offer any argument as to which factors he concludes are \u201cvague and ill-defined;\u201d in any event, we do not perceive that any factors are so.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Defendant further contends that the death penalty statute violates international law, and that his death sentence therefore must be vacated. Defendant fails to point to any authority that \u201cprohibit[s] a sentence of death rendered in accordance with state and federal constitutional and statutory requirements\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hillhouse (2002) </em>27 Cal.4th 469, 511 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 45, 40 P.3d 754]), and we reject his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">D. <em>Posttrial motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_y\">1. <em>Asserted juror misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant his motion for new trial or hold an evidentiary hearing after learning of alleged juror misconduct at the penalty phase violated his right to a fair trial under principles of due process of law, and his federal and state constitutional rights to the effective assistance of counsel, requiring reversal of his death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">At the penalty phase, the jury was instructed that it was not \u201cto speculate about whether or not there are circumstances that might preclude either a sentence of death or life without the possibility of parole from being carried out.

Danks </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 269, 298, fn. 9, 301-302 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 767, 82 P.3d 1249].)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Juror J. M. stated: \u201cIn deliberations, it was discussed in the jury room by some jurors that the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole would not necessarily mean that Mark Schmeck would spend the rest of his life in prison. Several jurors discussed during deliberations that the defendant, if given a life without the possibility of parole sentence, could be released in the future. [][] In the course of the penalty phase deliberations, the jury foreman raised the issue of a television program in which a prisoner who had been sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole came up for parole. This information was discussed by jurors during deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Juror P. L. stated that \u201c[o]ne morning before all the jurors were assembled, one of the jurors mentioned a talk show about a prisoner, who was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, but was released and committed another crime. The Jury was not deliberating at this time and the subject was dropped and never brought up again to my knowledge.\u201d Juror K. M. stated, \u201c[0]ne morning before we began deliberation there was a conversation which I overheard about a Television program \u2018L.A. Law.\u2019 The conversation was between Mr. [E.], Mr. [V.] and Mr. [F.]. That conversation was never discussed by any of the jurors in deliberations and was never part of the deliberations.\u201d Juror D. St. declared, \u201c[0]ne morning during the Schmeck case, before the jurors were assembled and deliberating, a juror mentioned a television show about an unknown subject. I ignored it since it was not directed at me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>No juror misconduct occurred. The declarations suggest that either before or during deliberations, the jurors briefly discussed the possibility that defendant would be released despite any verdict of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, and also discussed television episodes dramatizing such an event. As we have observed: \u201cThe court can, and here did, tell the jury that a life without parole sentence means just that, but no one can predict the future with certainty. No one, including a court, can <em>guarantee </em>that a person will never be paroled or otherwise get out of prison. The possibility that sometime in the future a person might be released, perhaps because of a change in the law, is a matter \u2018of common knowledge appreciated by every juror who must choose between a death sentence and a sentence of life without parole.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Steele </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1230, 1264-1265 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 47 P.3d 225]; see <em>Pride, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at pp. 267-268 [\u201cDefendant incorrectly suggests misconduct occurs whenever the jury, though instructed to consider only the evidence before it, nonetheless discusses speculative, irrelevant, and/or erroneous facts or opinions. ... [][].. . The average juror undoubtedly worries that a dangerous inmate might escape\u201d]; <em>People v. Cox, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 696 [juror\u2019s reference to \u201cformer [California] Chief Justice Rose Bird and the fact \u2018that the death penalty had not been exercised in California since the 1960s\u2019 \u201d was not misconduct in light of it being only \u201ca single reference to factual matters of which the entire jury undoubtedly had some independent knowledge\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">As we observed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Riel </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1153 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 998 P.2d 969] in a similar context: \u201cA prediction that the court would commute a death verdict, if in fact made, was merely the kind of comment that is probably unavoidable when 12 persons of widely varied backgrounds, experiences, and life views join in the give-and-take of deliberations. Not all comments by all jurors at all times will be logical, or even rational, or, strictly speaking, correct. But such comments cannot impeach a unanimous verdict; a jury verdict is not so fragile. \u2018The introduction of much of what might strictly be labeled \u201cextraneous law\u201d cannot be deemed misconduct. . . . Jurors bring to their deliberations knowledge and beliefs about general matters of law and fact that find their source in everyday life and experience. That they do so is one of the strengths of the jury system. It is also one of its weaknesses: it has the potential to undermine determinations that should be made exclusively on the evidence introduced by the parties and the instructions given by the court. Such a weakness, however, must be tolerated. \u201c[I]t is an impossible standard to require . . . [the jury] to be a laboratory, completely sterilized and freed from any external factors.\u201d [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Moreover, under that \u201cstandard\u201d few verdicts would be proof against challenge.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 1219.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We also conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing. Defense counsel expressly stated during the hearing on the motion for new trial that he had nothing to offer by way of evidence pertaining to this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">2. <em>Asserted erroneous ruling on automatic motion to modify penalty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Finally, defendant contends that in ruling on his automatic motion to modify the death sentence (\u00a7 190.4, subd. (e)), the trial court failed to consider the mitigating evidence introduced by defendant at the penalty phase. The trial court stated it was aware of its obligation to make \u201can independent determination whether imposition of the death penalty upon the defendant is appropriate in light of the relevant evidence and the applicable law.\u201d In addition, the court stated it had \u201cexamined and reviewed all the evidence presented to the jury, both in the guilt phase and the penalty phase, in making its determination as to the appropriate penalty,\u201d and \u201cpersonally and carefully reviewed the transcripts] and evidence as to the penalty phase of the trial.\u201d Immediately prior to denying the motion, the court concluded: \u201cConsidering all of the evidence and by independent review, the court\u2019s personal assessment is that the factors in aggravation outweigh those in mitigation and further the court independently finds that the evidence in aggravation is so substantial as compared to the evidence in mitigation that death is warranted and not life without possibility of parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Thus, read in context, the trial court\u2019s challenged comments such as \u201cthere are no factors in mitigation which will extenuate and mitigate the gravity of the crimes committed\u201d\u2014did not indicate that the court failed to consider the mitigating evidence presented, or that it considered such evidence \u201clegally irrelevant.\u201d Rather, such comments indicate, as does the trial court\u2019s ultimate ruling, that the court <em>\u201cconsidered </em>all of the evidence offered in mitigation; it merely found that much of that evidence did not, in fact, mitigate in light of the evidence as a whole.\u201d <em>(Smith, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 640; <em>People v.
