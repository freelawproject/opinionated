(Welf. &amp; Inst. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 6600 et seq.) Before its 1982 amendment, Penal Code section 1016, former subdivision (3), provided that a defendant\u2019s nolo contendere plea \u201cmay not be used against the defendant as an admission in any civil suit based upon or growing out of the act upon which the criminal prosecution is based.\u201d (Stats. 1976, ch. 1088, \u00a7 1, p. 4931.) The issue is whether an SVPA proceeding is a \u201ccivil suit\u201d for purposes of this former subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">For reasons that follow, we conclude that an SVPA civil commitment proceeding is a special proceeding of a civil nature, and not a \u201ccivil suit\u201d under Penal Code section 1016, former subdivision (3). As such, defendant Norman Yartz\u2019s 1978 conviction for child molestation may be used as a predicate prior conviction to support his SVPA civil commitment. (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Thus, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which held to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In 1978, defendant pled no contest to, and was convicted of, committing a lewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288.) The victim was a 10-year-old girl who was living with her mother and defendant at defendant\u2019s residence for several weeks. He admitted molesting the victim over a period of one week. He was committed to Atascadero State Hospital as a mentally disordered sex offender (MDSO). After the medical director determined defendant was not amenable to treatment, defendant\u2019s MDSO commitment was terminated. On January 22, 1980, a superior court sentenced defendant to five years in state prison. In 1985, defendant was again convicted of violating Penal Code section 288 involving another victim, an eight-year-old girl who was a friend of defendant\u2019s daughter. Defendant was sentenced to 22 years in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">On May 16, 1997, the San Joaquin County District Attorney petitioned to commit defendant as a sexually violent predator (SVP) under the Act. (\u00a7 6601.) The petition alleged that defendant had two prior convictions for sexually violent offenses against two separate victims, one in 1978 and the other in 1985. Defendant moved to exclude evidence of his 1978 conviction. He argued that this conviction was based on his no contest plea, which at the time was governed by Penal Code section 1016, former subdivision (3). This former subdivision, defendant maintained, prohibited the use of his no contest plea in a later civil suit, including an SVPA civil commitment proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The trial court denied the motion. A jury found defendant to be an SVP and the court committed him to the Department of Mental Health for two years. Defendant appealed. The Court of Appeal reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Citing <em>Leake v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 675, 680 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 767] <em>(Leake), </em>which concluded that an SVPA proceeding is a \u201ccivil action or a special proceeding of a civil nature,\u201d the Court of Appeal agreed with defendant that his 1978 conviction was subject to the limitation of Penal Code section 1016, former subdivision (3): \u201cCertainly, it must be said that an SVP proceeding which relies in part on defendant\u2019s earlier conviction for violating [Penal Code] section 288 necessarily is a civil action based upon or growing out of the act upon which that criminal prosecution was based.\u201d In addition, the Court of Appeal concluded that the 1982 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>amendment to Penal Code section 1016, subdivision (3), which made a no contest plea to a felony charge \u201cthe same as that of a plea of guilty for all purposes,\u201d did not apply to defendant\u2019s 1978 conviction to permit its use in the current SVPA proceeding. \u201cIn effect, what the People seek is an impermissible retroactive application of the amendment to section 1016 in 1982.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Based on the foregoing, the Court of Appeal concluded defendant\u2019s 1978 conviction based on his no contest plea could not be used as a predicate offense to support his civil commitment under the SVPA. (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a).) It reversed the trial court\u2019s commitment order. We granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Relying on Penal Code section 1016, former subdivision (3), defendant argues that his 1978 conviction based on his nolo contendere plea may not support his civil commitment as an SVP. From 1976 to 1982, Penal Code section 1016, former subdivision (3), governed nolo contendere pleas.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe legal effect of [a nolo contendere] plea shall be the same as that of a plea of guilty, but the plea and any admission required by the court during any inquiry it makes as to the voluntariness of and factual basis for the plea <em>may not be used against the defendant as an admission in any civil suit based upon or growing out of the act upon which the criminal prosecution is based.\u201d </em>(Stats. 1976, ch. 1088, \u00a7 1, p. 4931, italics added.) At issue here is whether an SVPA commitment proceeding is a \u201ccivil suit\u201d for purposes of Penal Code section 1016, former subdivision (3). We begin with a discussion of the SVPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">A. <em>The SVPA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">\u201cThe SVPA provides for the involuntary civil commitment of an offender immediately upon release from prison, for a two-year period, if the offender is found to be an SVP.\u201d <em>(Cooley v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 228, 243 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d <em>177, </em>57 P.3d 654] <em>(Cooley).) </em>To establish that an offender is a \u201c[s]exually violent predator,\u201d the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person (1) \u201chas been convicted of a sexually violent offense against two or more victims,\u201d and (2) \u201chas a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 6600, subd. (a)(1), 6604.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The SVPA is not punitive in purpose or effect. <em>(Hubbart v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1138, 1166, 1171 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 492, 969 P.2d 584] <em>(Hubbart).) </em>Its proceedings are \u201ccivil in nature.\u201d <em>(Cooley, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 250, citing <em>Hubbart, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1172; <em>People v. Superior Court (Preciado) </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1122, 1128 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 159].) More than 40 years before the SVPA\u2019s 1995 enactment, we concluded that \u201c[s]exual psychopathy proceedings are special proceedings of a civil nature which are collateral to the criminal case. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Gross v. Superior Court </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 816, 820 [270 P.2d 1025] <em>(Gross) </em>[former \u00a7 5500 et seq., recodified as former \u00a7 6300 et seq.]; see also <em>In re Gary W. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 296, 309 [96 Cal.Rptr. 1, 486 P.2d 1201] [\u00a7 1800 \u201c[commitment proceedings are \u2018special proceedings of a civil nature\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Relying in part on <em>Hubbart, </em>several Courts of Appeal have described an SVPA commitment proceeding as a \u201cspecial proceeding of a civil nature.\u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court (Cheek) </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 980, 988 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 760] <em>(Cheek); </em>see <em>Bagration </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1677, 1685 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 292] <em>(Bagration) </em>[following <em>Cheek]; </em>see also <em>Leake, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 680; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hedge </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1477 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 52].) However, the <em>Leake </em>Court of Appeal also concluded that the Legislature enacted the SVPA \u201cas a civil action.\u201d <em>(Leake, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 680.) Based on <em>Leake, </em>the Court of Appeal here declared that an SVPA proceeding is a civil action, and as such, concluded that Penal Code section 1016, former subdivision (3), prohibited the use of defendant\u2019s 1978 conviction. We conclude that <em>Leake </em>incorrectly implied that an SVPA proceeding is a civil action. (See <em>Gross, supra, </em>42 Cal.2d at p. 820.)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">In <em>Leake, </em>the Court of Appeal held that the Civil Discovery Act of 1986 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2016 et seq.) applies to SVPA proceedings. <em>(Leake, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 679.) In so holding, the Court of Appeal first noted the 1986 act applies to an \u201caction,\u201d which includes \u201ca civil action and a special proceeding of a civil nature\u201d under Code of Civil Procedure section 2016, subdivision (b)(1). <em>(Leake, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 679.) Citing several civil commitment schemes as support, the court next concluded: \u201cIt is apparent that the Legislature designed the SVPA as a civil action or special proceeding of a civil nature because it set the SVPA in the Welfare and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Institutions Code among other civil commitment statutory schemes.\u201d <em>(Leake, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 680 [citing Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS Act) (\u00a7 5000 et seq.), Mentally Disordered Sex Offenders Act (former \u00a7 6300 et seq., repealed in 1981), Mentally Retarded Persons Law (\u00a7 6500 et seq.)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">However, in correlating a civil action with a special proceeding, the <em>Leake </em>Court of Appeal incorrectly suggested that proceedings under one or more of the civil commitment schemes constituted \u201ccivil actions.\u201d (See <em>Bagration, supra, </em>110 Cal.App.4th at p. 1685, fn. 7 [\u201cspecial proceedings\u201d include proceedings under LPS Act and \u00a7 6500]; <em>People v. Succop </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 785, 789 [63 Cal.Rptr. 569, 433 P.2d 473] [former \u00a7 5500 et seq. \u201cestablish special proceedings of a civil nature relating to mentally disordered sex offenders\u201d].) Contrary to <em>Leake\u2019s </em>suggestion, there is a critical distinction between a civil action and a special proceeding of a civil nature; by definition, they are mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Since 1872, judicial remedies have been divided into two classes: actions and special proceedings. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 21.) An \u201caction\u201d is defined as \u201can ordinary proceeding in a court of justice by which one party prosecutes another for the declaration, enforcement, or protection of a right, the redress or prevention of a wrong, or the punishment of a public offense.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 22; see <em>id., </em>\u00a7 30 [defining \u201ccivil action\u201d].) A \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d is \u201c[e]very other remedy\u201d that is not an \u201caction.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 23; <em>Tide Water Assoc. Oil Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1955) 43 Cal.2d 815, 822 [279 P.2d 35] [\u201cAs a general rule, a special proceeding is confined to the type of case which was not, under the common law or equity practice, either an action at law or a suit in equity\u201d].) With respect to civil actions, \u201can \u2018action\u2019 means the same thing as a \u2018suit.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1996), Actions, \u00a7 11, p. 64, italics omitted; see 1 Am.Jur.2d (2005) Actions, \u00a7 4, p. 798.) Indeed, the Legislature used the terms \u201ccivil action\u201d and \u201ccivil suit\u201d interchangeably in this context. Evidence Code former section 1300 (Stats. 1965, ch. 299, \u00a7 2, p. 1345), which used the term \u201ccivil action,\u201d reflected Penal Code section 1016, former subdivision (3)\u2019s policy of limiting the use of a nolo contendere plea in a \u201ccivil suit.\u201d <em>(Cartwright, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 774, fn. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Thus, as the <em>Cheek </em>Court of Appeal correctly concluded, \u201can SVPA commitment proceeding is a special proceeding of a civil nature, because it is neither an action at law nor a suit in equity, but instead is a civil commitment proceeding commenced by petition independently of a pending action.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number><em>(Cheek, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.4th at p. 988.) To the extent it suggests that an SVPA proceeding is a civil action, we disapprove <em>Leake </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 675.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">B. <em>Penal Code Section 1016, Former Subdivision (3)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Defendant, however, argues that even if the SVPA civil commitment proceeding is not a civil action but a special proceeding of a civil nature, the definition of \u201ccivil suit\u201d under Penal Code section 1016, former subdivision (3), is broader than a civil action, encompassing \u201call actions at law, actions in equity and special proceedings.\u201d The Attorney General, however, maintains an action is the same thing as a suit; therefore, the provision does not apply to an SVPA proceeding and defendant\u2019s 1978 conviction may be used to support his civil commitment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Penal Code section 1016, former subdivision (3), provided in part that a nolo contendere plea \u201cmay not be used against the defendant as an admission in any civil suit based upon or growing out of the act upon which the criminal prosecution is based.\u201d (Stats. 1976, ch. 1088, \u00a7 1, p. 4931.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The former subdivision did not define the term \u201ccivil suit,\u201d nor does the current version define it in the context of nolo contendere pleas in nonfelony cases. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1016, subd. (3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">\u201cIn construing a statute, our task is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent and purpose for the enactment. <em>(People v. Tindall </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 767, 772 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 533, 14 P.3d 207].) We look first to the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>meaning of the statutory language, giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning. <em>(Ibid.) </em>If there is no ambiguity in the statutory language, its plain meaning controls; we presume the Legislature meant what it said. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u2018However, if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation, courts may consider various extrinsic aids, including the purpose of the statute, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, and the statutory scheme encompassing the statute.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 1166, 1172 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 464, 52 P.3d 648].) For reasons that follow, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that the term \u201ccivil suit\u201d under Penal Code section 1016, former subdivision (3), is broader than a \u201ccivil action,\u201d and includes a \u201cspecial proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">As noted above, the term \u201ccivil action\u201d is by definition not a \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 22, 23, 30), and \u201ccivil action\u201d does not have a different meaning from \u201ccivil suit.\u201d (See <em>ante, </em>at p. 536.) Furthermore, the Legislature used both \u201ccivil suit\u201d and \u201ccivil action\u201d in complementary statutory provisions (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1016, former subd. (3); Evid. Code, former \u00a7 1300; see <em>ante, </em>at p. 536), confirming that these terms are interchangeable in this context. When the Legislature added former subdivision (3) to Penal Code section 1016 in 1963 and used the term \u201ccivil suit,\u201d it was presumably aware of not only these statutory definitions, but also our earlier holding that \u201c[s]exual psychopathy proceedings are special proceedings of a civil nature.\u201d <em>(Gross, supra, </em>42 Cal.2d at p. 820.) \u201cThe Legislature, of course, is deemed to be aware of statutes and judicial decisions already in existence, and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Harrison </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 321, 329 [256 Cal.Rptr. 401, 768 P.2d 1078].)  Based on the statutory language, we conclude that the Legislature did not intend to include a special proceeding like a sexual psychopathy proceeding within the definition of \u201ccivil suit.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1016, former subd. (3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Although there is little legislative history of the amendment adding the nolo contendere plea to Penal Code section 1016,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the background behind this amendment undercuts defendant\u2019s broad definition of \u201ccivil suit.\u201d (See <em>Quinn v. State of California </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 162, 173 [124 Cal.Rptr. 1, 539 P.2d 761] [\u201ccontemporaneous construction may shed important light on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>legislative intent\u201d].) In 1963, the Legislature amended Penal Code section 1016\u2014permitting defendants to enter a nolo contendere plea with the consent of the district attorney and the approval of the court\u2014reportedly in response to our decision in <em>Teitelbaum Furs, Inc. v. Dominion Ins. Co., Ltd. </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 601 [25 Cal.Rptr. 559, 375 P.2d 439] <em>(Teitelbaum). </em>(Note, <em>Nolo Contendere\u2014Its Use and Effect </em>(1964) 52 Cal. L.Rev. 408, 409 (hereafter <em>Nolo Contendere.) </em>In <em>Teitelbaum, </em>we held that in certain circumstances, \u201cany issue necessarily decided in a prior criminal proceeding is conclusively determined as to the parties if it is involved in a subsequent civil action.\u201d <em>(Teitelbaum, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d at p. 607.) We also said, \u201cA plea of guilty is admissible in a subsequent civil action on the independent ground that it is an admission.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 605.)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">After our <em>Teitelbaum </em>decision, \u201c[i]t is reported that at the legislative hearings on California Penal Code Section 1016(3), a general dissatisfaction was voiced against using criminal cases as a basis for civil actions. By providing defendants with a <em>nolo </em>plea, the legislators hoped to curb the overlapping of criminal and civil cases. The plea enables the defendant both to save the time and expense of trial and guard himself against admissions that could be used in a subsequent civil suit.\u201d <em>(Nolo Contendere, supra, </em>52 Cal. L.Rev. at p. 409, fn. omitted.) Reviewing the 1963 legislation, the State Bar Journal explained, \u201cThe plea of nolo contendere permits speedy disposal of the criminal charge. Defendants charged with traffic offenses and defendants in corporate fraud cases, which are usually long and complex, are among those expected to utilize the plea.\u201d <em>(Review of 1963 Code Legislation </em>(1963) 38 State Bar J. 751, 752.) The foregoing suggests that when the Legislature added former subdivision (3) to Penal Code section 1016, limiting the use of a nolo contendere plea in a subsequent civil suit, it intended the limitation to apply to matters like traffic offenses and corporate fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The Legislature\u2019s <em>subsequent </em>amendment of section 1016\u2014deleting the limitation with respect to felony cases\u2014supports this understanding of the legislative intent. (Stats. 1982, ch. 390, \u00a7 3, p. 1725; see <em>ante, </em>at p. 537, fn. 6.) \u201cAlthough an expression of legislative intent in a later enactment is not binding upon a court in its construction of an earlier enacted statute, it is a factor that may be considered. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Cummins, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 478, 492 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 823, 115 P.3d 98].) In amending section 1016, former subdivision (3), the Legislature declared its intent to \u201cassist the efforts of victims of crime to obtain compensation for their injuries from the criminals who inflicted those injuries.\u201d (Stats. 1982, ch. 390, \u00a7 1, p. 1725.) \u201cThe Legislature further finds and declares that the practice of permitting defendants in criminal cases to enter pleas of nolo contendere and thus avoid the use of the criminal conviction in a civil suit wherein the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>of the crime seeks to recover damages for injuries sustained by the criminal act runs counter to the interest of victims of crime.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Matters like traffic offenses, corporate fraud, and crime victims\u2019 damages suits are quite distinct from SVPA proceedings, which identify a \u201c \u2018small but extremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators that have diagnosable mental disorders\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hubbart, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1144, in. 5), and are highly critical to the public\u2019s safety. (But see <em>People </em>v. <em>Vasquez </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 1225, 1233 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 610, 25 P.3d 1090] [SVPA commitment and loss or denial of professional license both seek to protect public from felon\u2019s future harmful conduct].)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">As the Attorney General points out, to preclude the use of a nolo contendere plea in a subsequent SVPA proceeding would frustrate the \u201cnarrow and important purpose\u201d of the Act, which is \u201cconfining and treating mentally disordered individuals who have demonstrated their inability to control specific sexually violent behavior through the commission of similar prior crimes.\u201d <em>(Hubbart, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1164.) Delaying this necessary identification and treatment would obviously place the public at significant risk. \u201cThe Legislature indicated that to the extent such persons are currently incarcerated and readily identifiable, <em>commitment under the SVPA is warranted immediately upon their release from prison. </em>The Act provides treatment for mental disorders from which they currently suffer and reduces the threat of harm otherwise posed to the public.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1144, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Defendant and the dissent, however, assert that our decision in <em>Cartwright, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 762, is dispositive of the meaning of \u201ccivil suit,\u201d and precludes the use of defendant\u2019s 1978 conviction in the SVPA proceeding. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">In <em>Cartwright, </em>chiropractor Adam Cartwright pled no contest to Penal Code section 316, a misdemeanor, for keeping a \u201cdisorderly house\u201d for purposes of prostitution. <em>(Cartwright, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 765, fn. 3.) Based on this conviction, the state Board of Chiropractic Examiners (Board) revoked Cartwright\u2019s license to practice because the Board concluded the conviction constituted a \u201c \u2018conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude\u2019 \u201d under section 10 of the Chiropractic Act. <em>(Cartwright, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 765.) Ordering the Board to set aside its revocation, the trial court concluded that \u201cunder a settled California rule of decision a conviction based on a plea of nolo contendere could not be a basis for discipline under section 10 of the Chiropractic Act.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 765.) In a four-to-three decision, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>After reviewing the relevant case law, the <em>Cartwright </em>majority agreed with the trial court that the \u201creasonable expectations of persons examining the law on the subject\u201d are that a conviction based on a nolo contendere plea cannot be used as a \u201cground for discipline or other adverse consequences authorized by a statute for convictions generally.\u201d <em>(Cartwright, </em>supra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 773, relying on <em>Caminetti v. Imperial Mut. L. Ins. Co. </em>(1943) 59 Cal.App.2d 476 [139 P.2d 681] [Insurance Commissioner\u2019s conservatorship]; <em>In re Hallinan </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 243 [272 P.2d 768] [State Bar discipline]; <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. App. Bd. </em>(1969) 3 Cal.App.3d 209 [83 Cal.Rptr. 89] <em>(Kirby) </em>[revocation of liquor license].) The \u201csettled nature of the California rule against collateral use of convictions based on nolo contendere pleas is an important reason for permitting the rule to remain in effect unless and until changed by legislation. Those who have entered nolo contendere pleas in the past instead of standing trial were entitled to rely upon the limitations announced by California decisions on subsequent uses of their pleas and of the ensuing convictions. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Cartwright, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 773.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s and the dissent\u2019s suggestion, <em>Cartwright </em>is not dispositive of the issue here. It did not rest its holding on Penal Code section 1016, former subdivision (3), much less critically examine its statutory language. Although the <em>Cartwright </em>majority may have <em>implicitly </em>rejected the argument that an administrative proceeding is not a \u201ccivil suit\u201d under former subdivision (3) (see <em>Cartwright, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at pp. 779-780 (dis. opn. of Richardson, J.)), it did not therefore give \u201ccivil suit\u201d an expansive meaning to include a special proceeding of a civil nature. (See <em>City of Oakland v. Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 29, 48 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 151] [administrative proceeding is neither a \u201ccivil action\u201d nor \u201cspecial proceeding of a civil nature\u201d for statute of limitations purposes].)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Moreover, <em>Cartwright </em>does not reasonably stand for the broad proposition that a conviction based on a nolo contendere plea cannot be used in <em>any </em>subsequent proceedings. (See <em>Cartwright, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at pp. 770-771, discussing <em>Kirby, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.3d 209.) <em>Kirby, </em>on which the <em>Cartwright </em>majority extensively relied, made clear that it was concerned with the effect of a nolo contendere plea in an administrative proceeding in particular. <em>{Kirby, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.3d at p. 219 [\u201cThe collateral effect of a nolo contendere plea in an administrative proceeding is a subject that produces little unanimity of opinion in legal circles\u201d].) Significantly, neither <em>Cartwright </em>nor the cases it relied on involved a sexual psychopathy-type proceeding, which we had already concluded was a special proceeding of a civil nature. <em>(Gross, supra, </em>42 Cal.2d at p. 820.) A fair reading of <em>Cartwright </em>makes clear that the decision at most extended the reach of the bar against using the nolo contendere plea and conviction (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1016, former subd. (3)) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>administrative proceedings. Indeed, because our earlier holding in <em>Gross </em>strongly suggested that the limitations of Penal Code section 1016, former subdivision (3), would not apply in sexual psychopathy proceedings, <em>Cartwright's </em>main concern that defendants \u201cwere entitled to rely upon the limitations announced by California decisions on subsequent uses of their pleas and the ensuing convictions\u201d <em>(Cartwright, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 773), is not an issue in the SVPA context.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Defendant also points out that <em>Cartwright </em>emphasized that a \u201cconviction is significant in the statutory scheme only insofar as it is a reliable indicator of actual guilt.\u201d <em>(Cartwright, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 773.) A nolo contendere plea\u2019s reliability as such is \u201csubstantially reduced\u201d because of a \u201cdefendant\u2019s reservations about admitting guilt for all purposes,\u201d and the suggested \u201cweakness in the available proof of guilt.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, in the SVPA context, a conviction based on a defendant\u2019s nolo contendere plea does not undermine the determination of a defendant\u2019s suitability for civil commitment. For instance, requisite convictions alone \u201cshall not be the sole basis for the determination\u201d that a person is an SVP. (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a)(3).) A person alleged to be an SVP \u201cshall be entitled to a trial by jury, to the assistance of counsel, to the right to retain experts or professional persons to perform an examination on his or her behalf, and to have access to all relevant medical and psychological records and reports.\u201d (\u00a7 6603, subd. (a).) If the person demands a jury trial, a unanimous verdict is required. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (f).) The trier of fact \u201cshall determine whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, the person is a sexually violent predator.\u201d (\u00a7 6604.) Thus, we conclude the SVPA provides sufficient safeguards to ensure that a defendant\u2019s conviction from a nolo contendere plea is reliable as evidence of the defendant\u2019s current mental disorder and future violent sexual behavior. (See <em>Hubbart, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 1145-1146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">In sum, we conclude that Penal Code section 1016, former subdivision (3), does not preclude the use of defendant\u2019s 1978 conviction based on his nolo contendere plea.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">We reverse the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">George, C.

Because we reject defendant\u2019s claim based on Penal Code section 1016, former subdivision (3), we also reject his claim based on Evidence Code former section 1300, the scope of which was coextensive with former subdivision (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal, Fifth Appellate District, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b581-7\">KENNARD, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"A68\">Before it was amended in 1982, Penal Code section 1016, subdivision (3) (section 1016, former subdivision (3)), stated that a no contest plea \u201cmay not be used against the defendant as an admission in any civil suit based upon or growing out of the act upon which the criminal prosecution is based.\u201d (Stats. 1976, ch. 1088, \u00a7 1, p. 4931.) As the majority construes it, section 1016, former subdivision (3), does not bar use of a 1978 conviction based on a no contest plea as a predicate prior conviction in a proceeding under the Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVPA) (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600 et seq.). Because the majority\u2019s interpretation of section 1016, former subdivision (3), is irreconcilable with a decision of this <em>court\u2014Cartwright </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 762 [129 Cal.Rptr. 462, 548 P.2d 1134] (Cartwright)\u2014that was controlling precedent when defendant entered his no contest plea, and on which defendant was entitled to rely, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">The majority reasons that \u201ccivil suit\u201d means the same thing as \u201ccivil action,\u201d that the term \u201ccivil action\u201d has a technical legal meaning under the Code of Civil Procedure, and that the Legislature intended the term \u201ccivil suit\u201d in section 1016, former subdivision (3), to have the technical legal meaning of a \u201ccivil action\u201d under the Code of Civil Procedure. Applying that interpretation of section 1016, former subdivision (3), to SVPA proceedings, the majority concludes that a conviction based on a no contest plea may be used as a predicate conviction under the SVPA because an SVPA commitment proceeding is not a civil action but rather a \u201cspecial proceeding of a civil nature.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 535-540.)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">If the majority is correct that \u201ccivil suit\u201d in section 1016, former subdivision (3), has the restrictive technical meaning of \u201ccivil action\u201d under the Code of Civil Procedure, then it necessarily follows that under that provision a conviction based on a no contest plea may be used to impose discipline in an administrative proceeding, because an administrative proceeding is not a civil action under the Code of Civil Procedure (see, e.g., <em>Little Company of Mary Hospital </em>v. <em>Belsh\u00e9 </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 325, 329 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 626]). Yet, this court held just the opposite in <em>Cartwright, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>762, that under section 1016, former subdivision (3), a conviction based on a no contest plea could <em>not </em>be used in an administrative disciplinary proceeding to revoke a chiropractor\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The <em>Cartwright </em>majority stated: \u201cA review of prior California decisions on this question shows that except in one instance convictions based on nolo contendere [no contest] pleas have until now been rejected in California as a basis for discipline <em>or other adverse legal consequences </em>unless a statute expressly specifies such convictions as a basis for such consequences.\u201d <em>(Cartwright, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 762, 768, some italics added.) The <em>Cartwright </em>majority then discussed <em>Caminetti v. Imperial Mut. L. Ins. Co. </em>(1943) 59 Cal.App.2d 476 [139 P.2d 681], which held that, because the convictions were based on no contest pleas, the Insurance Commissioner could not use the federal convictions of two officers of an insurance company to justify continuing a conservatorship over the company\u2019s assets; <em>In re Hallinan </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 243 [272 P.2d 768], which held that the State Bar had properly refused to initiate disciplinary proceedings against attorneys whose criminal convictions were based on no contest pleas; <em>Kirby v. Alcoholic Bev. etc. App. Bd. </em>(1969) 3 Cal.App.3d 209 [83 Cal.Rptr. 89], which held that a liquor license could not be revoked because of a criminal conviction based on a no contest plea; and <em>Grannis v. Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 551 [96 Cal.Rptr. 863], which held that a medical doctor\u2019s certificate to practice medicine could not be revoked because of a conviction based on a no contest plea. (Cartwright, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 769-771.) The <em>Cartwright </em>majority discussed and disapproved <em>Christensen v. Orr </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 12 [79 Cal.Rptr. 656], which had permitted the Department of Motor Vehicles to suspend a driver\u2019s license because of a conviction based on a no contest plea. <em>(Cartwright, supra, </em>at p. 772.) The <em>Cartwright </em>majority then stated: \u201c. . . <em>Christensen </em>cannot fairly be said to have altered the reasonable expectations of persons examining the law on the subject, namely, that in California a conviction based on a plea of nolo contendere would not be allowed as a ground for discipline or other adverse consequences authorized by a statute for convictions generally. . . . Those who have entered nolo contendere pleas in the past instead of standing trial were entitled to rely upon the limitations announced by California decisions on subsequent uses of their pleas and of the ensuing convictions.\u201d <em>(Cartwright, supra, </em>at p. 773.)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The <em>Cartwright </em>majority implicitly rejected the arguments in the dissenting opinion authored by Justice Richardson. In vain, the <em>Cartwright </em>dissent urged a construction of section 1016, former subdivision (3), similar to the one the majority here adopts: \u201cIndeed, the very language of [section 1016, former subdivision (3)], and particularly the reference to \u2018any civil suit,\u2019 discloses an intent to confine application of the section to ordinary civil litigation. An administrative disciplinary proceeding is not a \u2018civil\u2019 action; the word \u2018civil\u2019 connotes actions or special proceedings <em>in courts, </em>and not hearings before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>boards.\u201d <em>(Cartwright, supra, </em>at p. 780 (dis. opn. of Richardson, J.).) Like the <em>Cartwright </em>dissent, the majority here urges a restrictive construction of \u201cany civil suit\u201d in section 1016, former subdivision (3). But the majority\u2019s construction of \u201cany civil suit\u201d is even narrower than the one proposed by the <em>Cartwright </em>dissent, which apparently would have included special proceedings as well as civil actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The majority asserts that <em>Cartwright </em>\u201cis not dispositive of the issue here\u201d because it \u201cdid not rest its holding on Penal Code section 1016, former subdivision (3), much less critically examine its statutory language\u201d and because \u201cneither <em>Cartwright </em>nor the cases it relied on involved a sexual psychopathy-type proceeding.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 541.) I disagree. By rejecting the view of the <em>Cartwright </em>dissenters that section 1016, former subdivision (3), applied only to ordinary civil litigation, not to administrative proceedings, the <em>Cartwright </em>majority implicitly construed that provision as broadly applicable to proceedings of a civil nature, such as the SVPA proceedings here. Thus, the majority here cannot construe section 1016, former subdivision (3), as inapplicable to such proceedings without overruling <em>Cartwright. </em>Given the irreconcilable conflict between <em>Cartwright\u2019s </em>holding and the majority\u2019s construction of section 1016, former subdivision (3), the majority has <em>impliedly </em>overruled <em>Cartwright, </em>even though it has not done so <em>expressly.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Of course, this court has the authority to overrule <em>Cartwright, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 762, and to adopt a different and narrower construction of section 1016, former subdivision (3). But this court does not have the authority to apply its new statutory construction retroactively to persons like defendant here who may have relied on <em>Cartwright. </em>Although a judicial decision ordinarily applies retroactively, a judicial decision is not given retroactive effect when it overrules controlling authority that parties might justifiably have relied on. <em>(Claxton v. Waters </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 367, 378-379 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 246, 96 P.3d 496]; <em>Smith v. Rae-Venter Law Group </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 345, 372 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 516, 58 P.3d 367]; <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Young </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 315, 330 [279 Cal.Rptr. 613, 807 P.2d 455]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Simon </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 1082, 1108 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 25 P.3d 598]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Blakeley </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 82, 91-92 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 451, 999 P.2d 675].) Because parties entering no contest pleas after <em>Cartwright </em>was decided in 1976, and before the Legislature amended Penal Code section 1016 in 1982, could justifiably have relied on <em>Cartwright\u2019s </em>assurance that \u201cin California a conviction based on a plea of nolo contendere would not be allowed as a ground for discipline or other adverse consequences authorized by a statute for convictions generally\u201d <em>(Cartwright, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 773), this court may not now retroactively apply its decision overruling <em>Cartwright </em>to the detriment of parties who might justifiably have relied on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>As the <em>Cartwright </em>majority explained, \u201cThose who have entered nolo contendere pleas in the past instead of standing trial were entitled to rely upon the limitations announced by California decisions on subsequent uses of their pleas and of the ensuing convictions.\u201d <em>(Cartwright, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 773.) The majority here casts aside this important restriction on judicial authority when it applies its new interpretation of section 1016, former subdivision (3), to defendant\u2019s conviction, which was based on the no contest plea he entered in 1978 when <em>Cartwright </em>was the law. For this reason, I cannot join the majority\u2019s decision. I would affirm the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Werdegar, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
