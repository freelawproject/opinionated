In <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 945 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 672, 16 P.3d 94] <em>(Powerine I), </em>an earlier writ proceeding in the instant case, we held that the insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify Powerine, the insured, for \u201c \u2018all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages\u2019 \u201d under the wording of the standard comprehensive general liability (CGL) insurance policy is limited to \u201cmoney ordered by a court,\u201d and does not extend to environmental cleanup costs ordered by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 960.) This conclusion flowed logically both from the literal language of the standard CGL policy, which provides coverage for court-ordered \u201cdamages,\u201d and from our earlier decision in <em>Foster-Gardner, Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 857 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 107, 959 P.2d 265] (Foster-Gardner), which held that the insurer\u2019s duty to defend the insured in a suit \u201cseeking damages\u201d under the wording of the same standard CGL policy is likewise limited to civil suits prosecuted in court. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 878-888.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">In this matter, following on the heels of the earlier writ proceeding, we are called upon to decide whether the obligation of another insurer to indemnify Powerine under the wording of nine <em>excess/umbrella </em>insurance policies is likewise limited to money ordered by a court in a suit for damages against the insured. The Court of Appeal concluded it is not, reasoning that the insuring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>language of the excess/umbrella policies here in question is broader than that of the standard primary CGL policy at issue in <em>Powerine </em>/, and covers costs that <em>the </em>insured must expend in complying with an administrative agency\u2019s pollution cleanup and abatement orders. For reasons to be explained, we agree. Although other policy provisions or exclusion clauses yet to be litigated could ultimately defeat coverage as this litigation progresses, the express wording of the central insuring agreement in these nine excess/umbrella policies goes well beyond mere coverage for court-ordered money \u201cdamages,\u201d and is broad enough to include coverage for the liability of environmental cleanup and response costs ordered by an administrative agency. Under a literal reading of these policies, we conclude such would be the objectively reasonable expectation of the insured. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal directing the trial court to deny the insurer\u2019s motion for summary adjudication of the duty to indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The parties have stipulated to the underlying facts. The issue before the lower courts and now this court is one of law, and involves the interpretation of the insuring provisions of nine standard form excess/umbrella policies issued by real party in interest Central National Insurance Company of Omaha (Central National) to Powerine over the course of 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Powerine, through its various owners, was periodically engaged in oil refinery operations in Southern California since the mid-1930\u2019s. These included oil refining, oil- and petroleum-related exploration, production, terminaling and transportation operations throughout the western states. At one point Powerine\u2019s business occupied over 100 acres at its Santa Fe Springs refinery. In 1985, however, a soft petroleum market forced Powerine into bankruptcy. Since that time, the refinery has not been operated at all and only a skeleton crew of employees has remained for environmental compliance and equipment maintenance purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">As a result of its operations, Powerine faces govemmentally imposed environmental liabilities arising from alleged soil and groundwater contamination at various locations. The California Regional Water Quality Control Boards for the Los Angeles and San Diego regions (Regional Water Boards) initiated remedial administrative proceedings against Powerine pursuant to an environmental statute, the Porter-Cologne Act. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 13000 et seq.) Two cleanup and abatement orders were issued to Powerine requiring it to remediate pollution resulting from its past oil refinery operations at 10 locations. It is undisputed that these orders were not issued as a result of litigation or as part of an injunction. Cleanup and abatement order No. 97-118, issued by the Los Angeles Regional Water Board, allegedly followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>negotiations and a series of compromises between Powerine and that Regional Water Board concerning the scope of the order and the nature and extent of investigative activities to be undertaken thereunder. As of the date of the proceedings in the Court of Appeal, Powerine had not incurred any expenses pursuant to either order.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Powerine notified its many insurers of the orders, giving rise to a declaratory relief action against it. <em>(Highlands Insurance Company v. Powerine, etc., et al. </em>(Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2002, No. VC025771).) Powerine cross-complained against numerous insurers, including certain London underwriters which had issued both primary CGL and excess/umbrella policies, and real party in interest Central National, which had issued nine excess/umbrella policies covering periods from 1973 to the expiration of the last policy in February 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The cross-complaint alleged that each insurer had a contractual duty to defend and indemnify Powerine for the costs of cleanup and abatement arising from the environmental orders issued by the Regional Water Boards, and sought, inter alia, declaratory relief and damages for breach of contract and of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">While the declaratory relief action and cross-complaint were pending, this court decided <em>Foster-Gardner, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 857, holding that under the standard CGL policy defense-clause language, no duty to defend arises in connection with prelitigation administrative proceedings as it does when a suit \u201cseeking damages\u201d is commenced through the filing of a complaint in court. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 878-888.) Consequently, the primary insurers in this action (Certain Underwriters at Lloyds of London, hereafter the London Market Insurers) moved for summary adjudication of their duty to defend and duty to indemnify costs resulting from the Regional Water Boards\u2019 administrative proceedings and issuance of cleanup and abatement orders under the Porter-Cologne Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the trial court denied the motion, the primary insurers petitioned for a writ of mandate in the Court of Appeal. That court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ordered the issuance of a writ directing entry of an order granting the primary insurers\u2019 summary adjudication motion on the duty to indemnify.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As noted, this court affirmed in <em>Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 945, holding that the primary insurers had no duty to indemnify Powerine for costs or expenses incurred in connection with the Porter-Cologne administrative proceedings because the insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify under the standard CGL policy language is limited to money ordered by a court in a suit for damages. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 960, 964.)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">After <em>Powerine I </em>was decided, Central National moved for summary adjudication of the duty to indemnify under the Central National policies, resulting in the judgment giving rise to the instant writ proceeding. In its motion, Central National sought an order that, pursuant to <em>Powerine I </em>and <em>Foster-Gardner, </em>it has no duty to indemnify Powerine under its excess/umbrella policies for any sums expended by Powerine in connection with the Regional Water Boards\u2019 proceedings because no money had been ordered by a court in a suit for damages against the insured within the meaning of those policies. Powerine in turn argued that this court\u2019s holding in <em>Powerine I </em>was not controlling because the earlier writ proceeding involved only primary CGL policies which, Powerine argued, are different in nature, purpose, and wording than the excess/umbrella policies issued by Central National.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The trial court granted Central National\u2019s motion for summary adjudication. Pursuant to <em>Powerine I, </em>the trial court ruled that Central National has no duty to indemnify Powerine under its various policies for sums Powerine expends pursuant to the cleanup and abatement orders issued by the Regional Water Boards. The trial court focused on the policies\u2019 inclusion of the term \u201cdamages\u201d in the insuring provisions, concluding, as this court did in <em>Powerine I, </em>that the term does not encompass environmental response costs ordered by an administrative agency outside the context of a lawsuit. The trial court rejected Powerine\u2019s argument based on the difference in purpose between its excess/umbrella policies and the primary CGL policies at issue in <em>Powerine I, </em>reasoning it could not apply a meaning to \u201cdamages\u201d that changes from policy to policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The insuring language of Central National\u2019s standard form excess/umbrella policies is identical throughout all nine policies. It provides, in relevant part: \u201cThe Company hereby agrees ... to indemnify the Insured for all sums which the Insured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability . . . imposed upon the Insured by law . . . <em>for damages, direct or consequential and expenses, all as more fully defined by the term \u2018ultimate net loss\u2019 </em>on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>account of: . . . property damage . . . caused by or arising out of <em>each occurrence </em>happening anywhere in the world.\u201d (Italics added.) \u201cUltimate net loss\u201d is defined as \u201cthe total sum which the Insured, or any company as his insurer, or both, become obligated to pay by reason of . . . property damage . . . either through adjudication or compromise, and shall also include hospital, medical and funeral charges and all sums paid as salaries, wages, compensation, fees, charges and law costs, premiums on attachment or appeal bonds, interest, expenses for doctors, lawyers, nurses and investigators and other persons, and for litigation, settlement, adjustment and investigation of claims and suits which are paid as a consequence of any occurrence covered hereunder . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Seven of the nine Central National policies also contain defense coverage endorsements identical in substance to the duty to defend clauses of the primary CGL policies at issue in <em>Foster-Gardner </em>and <em>Powerine I.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>They obligate Central National to defend \u201cany <em>suit </em>against the insured alleging liability insured under the provisions of this policy and seeking <em>damages </em>on account thereof,\u201d \u201c[a]s respects <em>occurrences </em>covered under this policy, but not covered under the underlying insurance or under any other collectible insurance . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Each of the nine policies further contains an absolute pollution exclusion. Additional policy provisions deemed relevant to the issues raised herein are set forth and discussed, <em>post.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Powerine appealed from the trial court\u2019s order granting Central National\u2019s summary adjudication motion on the duty to indemnify under the policies. In a published decision, the Court of Appeal issued a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order and to issue a new order denying the motion. The court held that the duty to indemnify in these excess/umbrella policies is \u201cbroader in scope\u201d than that of the policies in <em>Powerine I </em>and Foster-Gardner, \u201cand includes the costs Powerine expends in responding to administrative agencies\u2019 cleanup and abatement orders.\u201d The court found that the term \u201cexpenses,\u201d as used in the insuring and \u201cultimate net loss\u201d provisions, must be broadly construed to include costs arising from \u201ccompromise\u201d as well as adjudication and third party \u201cclaims\u201d as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>suits. The court concluded that the fact that the duty to defend (in seven of the nine policies) is limited to \u201csuits seeking damages\u201d under <em>Foster-Gardner </em>does not foreclose indemnity coverage under the so-called <em>Foster-Gardner </em>syllogism<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because the wording of these policies is different than the standard CGL policy examined in <em>Powerine I </em>and <em>Foster-Gardner. </em>Finally, the Court of Appeal opined that the Central National policies are different in scope and purpose from the standard primary CGL policy in that they expressly provide umbrella coverage which can operate to \u201c \u2018fill any gaps\u2019 \u201d in higher-level primary coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">We granted Central National\u2019s petition for review. Amicus curiae briefs in support of Central National have been filed by the London Market Insurers and the Complex Insurance Claims Litigation Association. Amicus curiae briefs in support of Powerine have been filed by ITT Industries, Inc., and United Policyholders/Richard Giller.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">1. <em>Issue preclusion and law of the case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">At the threshold we address Central National\u2019s procedural argument that the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the <em>prior </em>writ proceeding culminating in <em>Powerine </em>/, which granted the London Market Insurers summary judgment on certain excess/umbrella policies issued by those insurers to Powerine, establishes law of the case and, under principles of issue preclusion, bars Powerine from here revisiting the matter of coverage for nonlawsuit expenditures under Central National\u2019s express/umbrella policies. (See, e.g., <em>Interinsurance Exchange of the Auto. Club v. Superior Court </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 177, 181 [257 Cal.Rptr. 37] [\u201c \u2018[A] former judgment ... is a collateral estoppel on issues which were raised, <em>even though some factual matters or legal arguments which could have been presented were </em>not.\u2019 (7 Witkin [Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Judgment] \u00a7 257, p. 696, original italics.)\u201d]; <em>Kowis </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 888, 894 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 728, 838 P.2d 250] [law of the case doctrine applicable to writ proceedings]; <em>McCutchen v. City of Montclair </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1138, 1144 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 95] [doctrine of issue preclusion applicable where issue in present proceeding is identical to one actually litigated and necessarily decided in prior proceeding].)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>This procedural argument was considered and rejected by the Court of Appeal on the following basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">\u201cCentral National insists that our [now superseded] decision in <em>Powerine I . </em>. . precludes Powerine from arguing that the scope of coverage here is not limited to money ordered by a court. Observing that in our <em>Powerine I </em>decision we mentioned one umbrella and four excess policies issued by the [Certain Underwriters] insurer in addition to the primary policy, Central National asserts that that decision \u2018definitively resolved the identical issue,\u2019 namely, that \u2018no coverage exists for administratively imposed costs under [the insurer\u2019s] excess and umbrella policies covering damages that the insured is legally obligated to pay.\u2019 Central National argues any references we made to the umbrella policy in that opinion is law of the case and is binding on Powerine inasmuch as Powerine did not appeal from that issue and the issue was not addressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Powerine I. </em>Not so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">\u201cFirst, we stated clearly in our [superseded] opinion that \u2018we are only concerned with the primary policy issued to Powerine by Certain Underwriters,\u2019 and \u2018we have no reason to reach or consider the several excess policies which Certain Underwriters also issued over a 20-year period . . . .\u2019 Such statements render any comments made about the secondary policies pure obiter dictum. Second, we quoted from the language of the excess and umbrella policies in that opinion. The language is materially different from the language at issue here because, inter alia, the policies\u2019 language does <em>not \u2018more fully define\u2019 </em>the term \u2018damages\u2019 by reference to another clause in the policy. For these reasons, our opinion in <em>Powerine I </em>is neither law of the case nor binding on Powerine for anything involving the excess or umbrella policies there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">We do not necessarily agree with the Court of Appeal that statements made in its now superseded opinion in the prior writ proceeding <em>(.Powerine I) </em>respecting the London Market Insurers\u2019 excess/umbrella policies were \u201cpure obiter dictum.\u201d The Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in that proceeding did, after all, grant summary adjudication in favor of those insurers on their excess/umbrella policies <em>in addition to </em>finding no coverage under their primary CGL policy. But the fact remains that the Central National policies here at issue were <em>not </em>directly at issue in <em>Powerine I, </em>nor, indeed, was Central National itself even a party to that earlier writ proceeding. And, as the Court of Appeal has indicated, the wording of the insuring provisions of the London Market Insurers\u2019 excess/umbrella policies is different than that of the Central National excess/umbrella policies here concerned. Finally, given that the parties\u2019 appeal in <em>Powerine I </em>presented only the issue of coverage for administratively ordered environmental cleanup costs under the standard primary CGL policy issued by the London Market Insurers <em>(Powerine I, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 950), this court had no occasion to directly address coverage issues concerning those insurers\u2019 excess/umbrella policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">As will be explained, <em>post, </em>while insurance policies are a special category of contracts, they fundamentally remain contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation must be applied. Whatever the Court of Appeal may have concluded about coverage under the London Market Insurers\u2019 excess/umbrella policies in the earlier writ proceeding, the fact remains that Central National\u2019s excess/umbrella policies are distinct contractual policies of insurance, and the express wording and provisions of Central National\u2019s policies were not before the lower courts in <em>Powerine I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">As the Court of Appeal below observed, the now superseded opinion of the Court of Appeal in <em>Powerine I </em>contained statements to the effect that \u201c \u2018we are only concerned with the primary policy issued to Powerine by Certain Underwriters,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018we have no reason to reach or consider the several excess policies which Certain Underwriters also issued over a 20-year period. . . .\u2019 \u201d We further observe that in ultimately entering judgment on those excess insurance policies in favor of the insurers in the prior proceeding, the Court of Appeal appears to have focused on the circumstance that coverage under the London Market Insurers\u2019 <em>excess </em>policies could not be triggered because the underlying primary CGL policy was found not to provide coverage, and exhaustion of the limits of the underlying primary policy was a prerequisite to coverage under the <em>excess </em>policies. Thus, not only were Central National\u2019s excess/umbrella policies not directly at issue or considered in the prior writ proceeding, the umbrella or \u201cdrop down\u201d coverage included in Central National\u2019s policies does not lend itself to the \u201cexhaustion of limits\u201d analysis by which the Court of Appeal in that proceeding determined there could be no indemnity coverage under the London Market Insurers\u2019 policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that Central National\u2019s procedural argument\u2014 that Powerine should be estopped from claiming coverage under the Central National excess/umbrella policies here at issue as a result of the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in the first writ proceeding\u2014must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">2. <em>Standard of review and rules of insurance policy interpretation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">We next set forth the applicable standard of review and rules of insurance policy interpretation that govern resolution of the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">This second writ petition was presented to the trial court upon stipulated facts. The issue before both the trial court and the Court of Appeal was one of pure law: the interpretation of the indemnification obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>under the insuring clauses of Central National\u2019s nine excess/umbrella policies issued to Powerine. \u201cWhen determining whether a particular policy provides a potential for coverage . . . , we are guided by the principle that interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law. <em>(AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 818 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253].)\u201d <em>(Waller v. Truck Ins.

We reiterated those rules in our decision in <em>Foster-Gardner:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u201c \u2018While insurance contracts have special features, they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.\u2019 <em>(Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545]; <em>see AIU [Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra,] </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 821-822.) \u2018The fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.\u2019 <em>(Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1264.) \u2018Such intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract.\u2019 <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 822.) \u2018If contractual language is clear and explicit, it governs.\u2019 <em>(Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1264.)\u201d <em>(Foster-Gardner, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 868.)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">\u201c \u2018A policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions, both of which are reasonable.\u2019 <em>(Waller </em>v. <em>Truck Ins.

Co., supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 869.) In doing so, we considered the provision in its full context; we proceeded to find, in effect, that it was clear in its limitation to a civil action prosecuted in a court, and that, in such limitation, it did not run counter to the hypothetical insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 869-871, 878-888.) We declined to take either a \u2018functional\u2019 or a \u2018hybrid\u2019 approach <em>(id. </em>at p. 869), each of which treats the provision as \u2018ambiguous\u2019 <em>(id. </em>at p. 872), the former deeming \u2018suit\u2019 to reach anything that is equivalent to a suit, apparently without qualification <em>(id. </em>at p. 871 &amp; pp. 871-872, fn. 7), the latter deeming \u2018suit\u2019 to reach anything that is equivalent to a suit, but \u2018only if it is sufficiently coercive and threatening\u2019 <em>(id. </em>at pp. 871-872 &amp; p. 872, fn. 8). We declined to take either approach because the duty to defend involved a \u2018suit,\u2019 and not something equivalent to a suit or even something equivalent to a suit that was sufficiently coercive and threatening. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 872, 879.)\u201d <em>(Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 959, fn. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">\u201cIn light of the foregoing, we went on to conclude that the insurer\u2019s duty to defend the insured did not extend to a proceeding conducted before an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute .... <em>(Foster-Gardner, Inc. v.

Our reason was that a proceeding conducted before an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute does not constitute a \u2018suit,\u2019 i.e., a civil action prosecuted in a court, but rather implicates a \u2018claim.\u2019 <em>(Ibid.)\u201d (Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at pp. 959-960.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">\u201cIn arriving at our conclusion, we declined to rewrite the provision imposing the duty to defend in order to remove its limitation to a civil action prosecuted in a court. <em>(Foster-Gardner, Inc. v.

Neither would we do so for considerations of public policy, in order, perhaps, to bring such a proceeding to a timely and appropriate outcome through such a shifting of costs. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 888.) Our reason was that we do not rewrite any provision of any contract, including the standard policy underlying any individual policy, for any purpose. <em>(Ibid.)\u201d (Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 960.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>b. Powerine I</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">While <em>Foster-Gardner </em>interpreted the scope of the duty to defend under the standard CGL policy, <em>Powerine I </em>addressed the scope of the duty to indemnify under that same standard policy, in the form utilized by the London Market Insurers below. <em>(Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 950.) As noted, we held in <em>Powerine I </em>that \u201cthe insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify the insured for \u2018all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as <em>damages'1 </em>under the standard [CGL] insurance policy is limited to money ordered by a court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 960, 964, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In the analysis that followed, we explained that \u201cthe duty to indemnify and its limitation to money ordered by a court is sufficiently supported when we look to what we may call Foster-Gardner's \u2018syllogism\u2019 alone.\u201d <em>(Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 960.) The syllogism can be summarized this way; \u201cThe duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. The duty to defend is not broad enough to extend beyond a \u2018suit,\u2019 i.e., a civil action prosecuted in a court, but rather is limited thereto. A fortiori, the duty to indemnify is not broad enough to extend beyond \u2018damages,\u2019 i.e., money ordered by a court, but rather is limited thereto.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 961.) Put another way, the insurer\u2019s obligation to indemnify for \u201cdamages\u201d is limited to \u201cmoney ordered by a court\u201d because the provisions in the standard CGL policy imposing both a duty to defend and a duty to indemnify on the insurer each \u201clink[] \u2018damages\u2019 to a \u2018suit,\u2019 i.e., a civil action prosecuted in a court.\u201d <em>(Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 962.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">In reaching our holding in <em>Powerine I, </em>we distinguished between the term \u201cdamages\u201d used in the insuring agreement of the standard CGL policy, and the term \u201cexpenses,\u201d which does not appear in the insuring provisions of that standard policy. The duty to indemnify for \u201cdamageswe explained, \u201cdoes <em>not </em>extend to any <em>expenses </em>required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute\u2014specifically, here, proceedings conducted before the Regional Water Boards pursuant to the Porter-Cologne Act. Our reason is that expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute, whether for the cleanup of a contaminated site and the abatement of the contamination\u2019s effects or otherwise, do not constitute money ordered by a court.\u201d <em>(Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 966, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">As the Court of Appeal below correctly observed, \u201cRead together, <em>Foster-Gardner </em>and <em>Powerine I </em>stand for the proposition that the duty to defend a \u2018suit\u2019 seeking \u2018damages\u2019 under the standard CGL policies is re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>stricted to civil actions prosecuted in a court, initiated by the filing of a complaint, and does not include <em>claims, </em>which can denote proceedings conducted by administrative agencies under environmental statutes. Likewise, the duty to indemnify for \u2018 \u201call sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as <em>damages\u2019'\u2019 </em>\u2019 <em>(Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 961, italics added) in the same standard primary policies is limited to money ordered by a court, and does not include <em>expenses </em>such as may be incurred in responding to administrative agency orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">c. AIU</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 807, a unanimous opinion authored by then Chief Justice Lucas, we were called upon to determine whether various primary and excess CGL policies issued to real party in interest FMC Corporation (FMC) obligated the insurers to provide coverage to FMC for contamination cleanup and other environmental response costs incurred pursuant to CERCLA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 et seq.) and related state and federal environmental laws. FMC sought review of a peremptory writ of mandate issued by the Court of Appeal that had directed the superior court to enter summary adjudication on this issue in favor of the insurers. We reversed. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 813-814.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The insurance policies at issue in <em>AIU </em>provided coverage to FMC for all sums FMC became legally obligated to pay as \u201cdamages\u201d (under two standard policy forms) or \u201cultimate net loss\u201d (under a third) as a result of \u201cproperty damage\u201d within the meaning of the policies. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 814.) Several of the policies in the latter category contained insuring language substantially identical to the insuring provisions in Central National\u2019s excess/umbrella policies. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 814-815 &amp; fin. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">We explained in <em>AIU </em>that \u201c[ujnder established principles of contract interpretation, we construe policy language according to the mutual intentions of the parties and its \u2018plain and ordinary\u2019 meaning, resolving ambiguities in favor of coverage\u201d <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 814). We concluded that all of the policies at issue afforded coverage for the costs of reimbursing government agencies and complying with injunctions ordering contamination cleanup under CERCLA and similar environmental statutes. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\"><em>AIU </em>established early on that liability arising from government suits for injunctive relief and costs incurred in cleaning up polluted sites pursuant to an environmental statute fall within the definition of \u201cproperty damage\u201d found in standard form primary and excess CGL policies. <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Cal.3d at p. 842.) We explained that \u201cthe mere fact that the governments may seek reimbursement of response costs or injunctive relief without themselves having suffered any intangible harm to a proprietary interest does not exclude the recovery of cleanup costs from coverage <em>under the \u2018damages\u2019provision </em>of CGL policies.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Unlike this case, the government in <em>AIU </em>brought suit against the insured for remedial relief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Powerine I </em>we explained that \u201cWe did not hold [in <em>AIU] </em>that the duty [to indemnify] extends to any money in addition to that ordered by a court\u2014including any expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute. Indeed, we did not even consider the issue.\u201d <em>(Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 966, italics omitted.) We had no occasion to consider the issue in <em>AIU </em>precisely because the government had brought suit; hence the facts of that case did not present it. Here, it is undisputed that the two cleanup and abatement orders were issued to Powerine through administrative proceedings and were not the result of court-ordered injunctive relief. The issue is squarely presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">4. <em>The insuring agreement in Central National\u2019s excess/umbrella policies provides indemnity coverage for the liability of administratively ordered environmental response costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The insuring language in Central National\u2019s standard form excess/umbrella policies is identical throughout all nine policies. It provides, in relevant part: \u201cThe Company hereby agrees ... to indemnify the Insured for all sums which the Insured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability . . . imposed upon the Insured by law ... for <em>damages, </em>direct or consequential <em>and expenses, all as more fully defined by the term \u2018ultimate net loss\u2019 </em>on account of: ... . property damage . . . caused by or arising out of each occurrence happening anywhere in the world.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">\u201cUltimate net loss\u201d in turn is defined as \u201cthe total sum which the Insured, or any company as his insurer, dr both, become obligated to pay by reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>of . . . property damage . . . <em>either through adjudication or compromise, and shall also include </em>hospital, medical and funeral charges and all sums paid as salaries, wages, compensation, fees, charges and law costs, premiums on attachment or appeal bonds, interest, expenses for doctors, lawyers, nurses and investigators and other persons, and for <em>litigation, settlement, adjustment and investigation of claims and suits </em>which, are paid as a consequence of any occurrence covered hereunder . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The mutual intention of the parties is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract. Where contractual language is clear and explicit, it governs. <em>(Bank of the West v. Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1264; <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 822.) Like the Court of Appeal, we conclude that coverage under Central National\u2019s excess/umbrella policies is unambiguous and clearly extends beyond money ordered by a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The phrase \u201cobligated to pay by reason of the liability . . . imposed upon the Insured by law\u201d in the insuring agreement of Central National\u2019s excess/umbrella policies is the functional equivalent of the phrase \u201csum that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay\u201d in the standard CGL policy considered in <em>Powerine I. </em>(See <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 814-815 [\u201clegally obligated\u201d and \u201cobligated ... by law\u201d treated as similar].) Both connote a legal obligation in the \u201cabstract.\u201d <em>(Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 963.) In the standard primary CGL policy, it is the addition of the single word \u201cdamages\u201d that limits the indemnification obligation to money ordered by a court. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The insuring clause of the Central National excess/umbrella policies, in contrast, provides indemnification coverage for \u201cdamages, direct or consequential <em>and expenses </em>. . . .\u201d \u201cThe use of both terms raises the inference that they were not intended to be synonymous.\u201d <em>(Reserve Insurance Co. v. Pisciotta </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 800, 811 [180 Cal.Rptr. 628, 640 P.2d 764].) In <em>Powerine I </em>we ourselves used the term \u201cexpenses\u201d when explaining that <em>\u201cexpenses </em>required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute, whether for the cleanup of a contaminated site and the abatement of the contamination\u2019s effects or otherwise, do not constitute money ordered by a court.\u201d <em>(Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 966, italics added.) Surely then, an insured would harbor an objectively reasonable expectation that these policies also afforded coverage for such expenses, something above and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>beyond court-ordered \u201cdamages.\u201d We agree with the Court of Appeal that the addition of the term \u201cexpenses\u201d in the central insuring clause of these excess/umbrella policies extends coverage beyond the limitation imposed were the term \u201cdamages\u201d used alone, and thereby enlarges the scope of coverage beyond \u201cmoney ordered by a court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">In addition to the inclusion of the term \u201cexpenses,\u201d which itself broadens the scope of coverage beyond that afforded under the standard primary CGL policy, the central insuring clause of these policies \u201cfurther define[s]\u201d the indemnification obligation by reference to and incorporation of a definition of \u201cultimate net loss.\u201d \u201cUltimate net loss\u201d in turn is defined as the total sum which the insured becomes \u201cobligated to pay by reason of . . . property damage . . . either through adjudication <em>or compromise, and shall also include ... all sums paid </em>... for litigation, <em>settlement, adjustment and investigation of claims </em>and suits ... as a consequence of any occurrence covered hereunder . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Sums that the insured becomes legally \u201cobligated to pay\u201d through \u201cadjudication\u201d denote court-ordered money damages. But sums the insured becomes legally \u201cobligated to pay\u201d through \u201ccompromise\u201d or the \u201csettlement, adjustment and investigation of claims\u201d do not necessarily reflect an underlying court suit. As the Court of Appeal observed, \u201cA compromise may be reached in order to avert a lawsuit altogether.\u201d Moreover, as we explained in <em>Foster-Gardner, </em>a \u201cclaim\u201d is not a \u201csuit.\u201d A claim \u201c \u2018can be any number of things, <em>none of which rise to the formal level of a </em>suit.... While a claim may ultimately ripen into a suit, <em>\u201cclaim\u201d and \u201csuit\u201d are not </em>synonymous.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Foster-Gardner, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 879, quoting <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 65 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 418], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Finally, as explained, this court has already held in <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 807, that a court order for payment of expenses to remediate or abate pollution pursuant to an environmental statute constitutes liability for \u201cproperty damage\u201d within the meaning of the standard primary CGL policy. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 831, 842.) It follows that where the express insuring language of an excess/umbrella policy broadens indemnity coverage for sums paid in furtherance of a \u201ccompromise\u201d or \u201csettlement\u201d of a \u201cclaim\u201d initiated by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>administrative agency for such remedial relief, the insured\u2019s liability for such expenses falls within the policy\u2019s indemnification obligation even though no government suit was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">We therefore conclude that under a literal reading of Central National\u2019s excess/umbrella policies, the indemnification obligation is expressly extended beyond court-ordered money \u201cdamages\u201d to include expenses incurred in responding to government agency orders administratively imposed outside the context of a government lawsuit to clean up and abate environmental pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">We reach the same conclusion when considering the insuring provisions of these policies in the context of the policies as a whole. <em>(Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 961; <em>Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1265.) Central National argued in the Court of Appeal that these policies were intended to operate primarily as excess insurance policies,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> i.e., following the form of the underlying policies adjudicated in <em>Foster-Gardner </em>and <em>Powerine I. </em>If that were the case, then the circumstance that the underlying primary CGL policies afforded no indemnity coverage by virtue of our holding in <em>Powerine I </em>would end the inquiry, as the limits of those underlying policies were not exhausted for purposes of triggering \u201cexcess\u201d coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">But the policies here in question are <em>not </em>merely intended to operate as excess insurance. Under the limitation of liability provision, Central National has agreed to pay the excess of \u201cthe amount of ultimate net loss ... in respect of each occurrence <em>not covered by said underlying insurances.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Hence, these policies also provide umbrella coverage,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> i.e., \u201calternative primary coverage as to losses \u2018not covered by\u2019 the primary policy.\u201d <em>(Reserve Insurance Co. v. Pisciotta, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 812; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number><em>Century Indemnity Co. v. London Underwriters </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1701, 1707, fn. 5 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 393].) The umbrella coverage here may serve to \u201c \u2018fill any gaps in coverage left open by the [underlying] coverage ....\u2019\u201d (Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation, <em>supra, </em>f 8:84, p. 8-43.)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">We agree with the Court of Appeal that \u201cThe fact these Central National policies also provide umbrella indemnity tells us that the insured would have expected the policies to grant broader coverage than that provided by the primary insurance. [Citation.] Our reading of the Central National insuring clause to be more expansive than the primary insurance in <em>Powerine I </em>gives effect to the mutual intent of the parties as evinced by the mechanism of umbrella insurance. [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">5. <em>Central National\u2019s remaining arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Central National raises a number of additional arguments in opposition to the conclusions reached by the Court of Appeal, none of which we find has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">a. <em>Redundancy of the term \u201cdamages\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">First, Central National argues that to interpret the insuring provisions as affording coverage for the \u201cexpenses\u201d of a compromise or settlement of a government claim for environmental cleanup and response costs would render the \u201cdamages\u201d limitation in these policies redundant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">The term \u201cdamages\u201d in these policies serves the same purpose that it does in the standard primary CGL policy\u2014it extends the indemnity obligation to \u201cmoney ordered by a court\u201d in a suit against the insured. Were the term not included in the policy language, the insurer could be heard to argue that coverage is not provided for court-ordered money judgments. As our decision in <em>Powerine I </em>implies, one reason the term \u201cdamages\u201d limits coverage to money ordered by a court under the standard CGL policy is that there is no other term contained in the insuring clause of that policy that could serve to expand coverage. Here, in contrast, the central insuring provision extends coverage for \u201cdamages, direct or consequential <em>and expenses\u201d </em>(italics added), and \u201cfurther define[s]\u201d the scope of the indemnity agreement through the definition of \u201cultimate net loss,\u201d which in turn defines coverage for liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>for property damage as including sums expended \u201ceither through adjudication <em>or compromise, and shall also include ... all sums paid </em>... for litigation, <em>settlement, adjustment and investigation of claims </em>and suits . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) There is no merit to Central National\u2019s assertion that to give effect to the literal terms of these policies would render the term \u201cdamages\u201d in the insuring agreement a redundancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">b. <em>The insurer\u2019s right to approve out-of-court settlements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Next, Central National argues that to construe the literal language of these policies as expanding coverage for the \u201cexpenses\u201d of a compromise or settlement of a government claim for environmental response costs would mean that the insured could settle such claims without Central National\u2019s participation and obtain coverage under the policies for settlements to which Central National objected. Central National asserts that its right to participate in and approve any out-of-court settlement would be compromised under such an interpretation of the scope of coverage. It points to the \u201cassistance and cooperation\u201d clause as the source of that right. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">As the Court of Appeal observed, Central National has failed to identify any language in these particular policies requiring that it approve out-of-court settlements or compromises <em>as a prerequisite to coverage. </em>Nor do we read the \u201cassistance and cooperation\u201d clause as linking any such right to the threshold question of coverage, much less making it a <em>prerequisite </em>to coverage under the policies. That clause provides, in pertinent part, that the insurer \u201cshall have the right and shall be given the opportunity to associate with the Insured or the Insured\u2019s underlying insurers, or both, in the defense and control of any claim, suit or proceeding relative to an occurrence where the claim or suit involves, or appears reasonably likely to involve the [Insurer] . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">We believe the question whether these excess/umbrella policies afford coverage for environmental cleanup and response costs ordered outside the context of a lawsuit <em>turns on the literal language of the insuring agreement, </em>and is a <em>separate issue </em>from whether the insured has complied with the terms of the \u201cassistance and cooperation\u201d clause. Enforcement of the latter clause is not inherently incompatible with an interpretation of the insuring clauses as affording coverage for administratively ordered environmental cleanup. To be sure, failure to comply with the assistance and cooperation clause may furnish a defense to coverage. On this record, however, we know little about the communication and interaction, if any, between Powerine and Central <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>National during the period of negotiations between Powerine and the Regional Water Boards regarding the terms of the two cleanup and abatement orders. Compliance with the \u201cassistance and cooperation\u201d clause is a matter that remains to be addressed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Even assuming the insured has fulfilled its duty under the assistance and cooperation clause of promptly notifying and attempting to involve the insurer in its negotiations with the government agency, under Central National\u2019s interpretation of these policies, if the insurer in its discretion declines to participate in or approve any settlement, the insurer would have no obligation to indemnify the insured for administratively ordered cleanup costs. We believe this result would stand in conflict with the insuring agreement in these policies, which, as has been shown, by its literal language extends indemnity coverage for such liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">c. <em>Absence of a \u201cno action\u201d clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">We further find significant the absence of a \u201cno action\u201d clause in the policies utilized by Central National. In <em>Powerine I, </em>we briefly discussed the standard form CGL policy\u2019s \u201cso-called no-action provision, which, in typical language, generally states that \u2018no action\u2019 by a third party \u2018shall lie\u2019 against the insurer unless the insured\u2019s \u2018obligation to pay shall have finally been determined\u2019 either by a \u2018judgment\u2019 against the insured \u2018obtained after an actual trial\u2019 or by a \u2018settlement\u2019 reduced to contract to which the insurer \u2018agrees.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 962, fn. 4, italics omitted.) Although the purpose of a \u201cno action\u201d clause is to discourage collusion between an insured and a third party claimant (see Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 7:439.6, p. 7A-116), the language of the standardly worded clause does appear to spell out the insurer\u2019s right to approve any out-of-court settlement, at least for purposes of making it a condition precedent to any suit brought directly against the insurer. Central National, however, chose not to include a \u201cno action\u201d clause in its policies. We will not rewrite the policies to insert a provision that was omitted. <em>(Powerine I, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 960; <em>Foster-Gardner, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 886-888.)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">d. <em>Function of the definition of \u201cultimate net loss\u201d as \u201cburning limits\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Central National also faults the Court of Appeal\u2019s understanding of the function served by the definition of \u201cultimate net loss\u201d in the insuring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>agreement. According to Central National, that clause largely serves the purpose of \u201cburning limits,\u201d i.e., reducing the indemnity limits \u201cdollar for dollar by defense costs until zero is reached and the duty to indemnify . . . [is] then terminated. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Aerojet-General Corp. v. Transport Indent. Co. </em>(1997) 17 Cal.4th 38, 76, fn. 29 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 118, 948 P.2d 909].) Central National and its amici curiae argue that where the \u201cultimate net loss\u201d clause serves to consume policy limits, the clause cannot also be understood as expanding coverage. Once again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">As the Court of Appeal observed, \u201cthese Central National policies lack [an explicit] provision indicating the policies function as \u2018self-consuming\u2019 or \u2018burning limits\u2019 contracts. (See Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 7:357, p. 7A-90 (rev. # 1 1998).) Had Central National wanted to include a burning limits clause, it knew how to do so.\u201d In any case, even if the definition of \u201cultimate net loss\u201d also serves the function of \u201cburning limits,\u201d it is clear from the literal wording of the central insuring provision that the \u201cultimate net loss\u201d definition also serves the function of \u201cfurther defining]\u201d the scope of indemnity coverage under these policies well beyond \u201cdamages,\u201d i.e., money ordered by a court. To conclude otherwise would belie the explicit policy language and hardly comport with the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">e. <em>The \u201closspayable\u201d clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Central National\u2019s excess/umbrella policies also contain the standard \u201closs payable\u201d clause.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Central National argued in the Court of Appeal that \u201cwhere the underlying policies only indemnify for damages in the form of money ordered by a court pursuant to <em>Powerine I, </em>the loss payable condition \u2018evidences the same intent to cover damages arising in a judicial context or in a settlement . . . <em>reached with the insurer\u2019s </em>consent.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.) Powerine in turn argued that under the loss payable clause, the insurer\u2019s obligation to pay <em>can be triggered </em>by the insured\u2019s payment of any expenses included within the definition of \u201cultimate net loss,\u201d without a court-ordered judgment for the payment of money damages <em>or </em>an insurer-approved settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>It does not appear that the \u201closs payable\u201d clause itself functions to trigger coverage in the first instance under these policies. The first sentence of the clause provides that the insurer\u2019s indemnification obligation under the policy does not commence until any underlying policy limits have been exhausted by actual payment of a covered loss. (See <em>Span, Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated Internat. Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 463, 467-468 [277 Cal.Rptr. 828].) Accordingly, the provision speaks to the <em>timing </em>of the excess insurer\u2019s obligation to indemnify in relation to the exhaustion of underlying primary policy limits. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, the \u201cexcess\u201d coverage afforded under these policies was not invoked because the limits of the underlying primary CGL policy were neither paid nor exhausted. Rather, it is the umbrella \u201cdrop down\u201d aspect of coverage that is being looked to by the insured for coverage of liability for \u201cproperty damage\u201d incurred as a result of the administratively imposed remediation orders, liability not covered as \u201cdamages\u201d by the underlying primary policy. In any event, whatever be the scope and effect of the \u201closs payable\u201d provision contained in these policies which afford both excess and umbrella coverage, it cannot defeat the scope of coverage established under the literal language of the insuring clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">f. <em>Application of the </em>Foster-Gardner <em>syllogism</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">As noted, seven of the nine Central National policies contain a defense coverage endorsement adding a duty to defend to those policies. Central National argues that those endorsements provide a duty to defend substantially identical to the duty to defend found in the standard primary CGL policy, and hence, as regards those seven policies, the <em>Foster-Gardner </em>syllogism announced in <em>Powerine I </em>must be applied to defeat coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">A syllogism is deductive reasoning. (Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Diet. (1981) p. 2315, col. 3.) As the Court of Appeal observed, \u201cThe <em>[Foster-Gardner] </em>syllogism does not apply here for the simple reason that the parties contracted for full indemnity as declared by the broad language of the excess/umbrella policies themselves. The actual words used in the Central National policies\u2019 indemnity provision confer broader coverage than those contained in the defense coverage endorsement, or in <em>Powerine I </em>and <em>Foster-Gardner. </em>Hence, the conclusion of the <em>Foster-Gardner </em>syllogism does not logically follow from its premise when applied to the Central National policies.\u201d We agree with the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">We further observe that the defense coverage endorsements in question provide that \u201cnothing herein contained shall vary, alter, waive or extend any of the terms, representations, conditions or agreements of the policy other than as above stated.\u201d Particularly in light of this language, it would not be objectively reasonable for the insured in this case to expect that the duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>defend endorsements contained in seven of the nine excess/umbrella policies would alter, much less defeat or override, the express terms of the insuring agreement. Moreover, unlike the standard primary CGL policy, excess/umbrella policies do not as a matter of course contain a duty to defend, as evidenced by the very policies here in question. From an equitable standpoint, it would be manifestly unfair to penalize the insured for paying a premium to obtain added protection by concluding that the defense coverage endorsements purchased for the seven policies defeat indemnity coverage otherwise clear under the literal policy language.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">g. <em>\u201cExpenses\u201d construed narrowly as \u201clitigation expenses\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Finally, at oral argument, Central National urged that the term \u201cexpenses\u201d contained in the central insuring clauses of these excess/umbrella policies should be read as referring only to the \u201cexpenses\u201d of litigation where a court suit has been brought. The argument will simply not hold up to a plain reading of the literal terms of the insuring clause and coupled definition of \u201cultimate net loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">In conclusion, we have explained that the provisions of an insurance policy will be considered ambiguous when they are capable of two or more constructions, both of which are reasonable. <em>(Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc., supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 1, 18.) We find no ambiguity here. The literal wording of the insuring clauses of Central National\u2019s nine excess/umbrella policies extends indemnity coverage to the \u201cexpenses\u201d of responding to the environmental cleanup orders imposed on Powerine through the Regional Water Boards\u2019 administrative proceedings pursuant to the Porter-Cologne Act. We have considered all aspects of Central National\u2019s contrary arguments and conclude they do not furnish a reasonable alternative construction of the policy language. The literal language of the policies controls, as does the objectively reasonable expectations of Powerine, the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">As indicated at the outset, noncompliance with key policy provisions establishing conditions precedent to coverage, or exclusion clauses yet to be litigated, could ultimately defeat coverage under these policies according to the evidence developed as this litigation progresses. (See <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 814 [\u201cAlthough many of the policies contain exclusions arguably relevant to whether environmental cleanup costs are covered, we do not consider the applicability of exclusions in this case, which comes to us on motion for summary adjudication solely as to the coverage clauses.\u201d].) We hold only that the nature of the coverage sought by Powerine under these excess/umbrella policies is encompassed within the insuring language in the first instance, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal directing the trial court to enter an order denying the insurer\u2019s motion for summary adjudication of the duty to indemnify is affirmed, and the matter remanded to the Court of Appeal for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">George, C.

The remaining five Central National policies, CNU 12-79-39, CNU 03-31-78, CNU 03-49-44, CNU 00-40-80, CNU 00-81-61, each provide indemnity limits of $9.5 million in excess of the $50,000 self-insured retention and $450,000 limits of the underlying primary CGL policies.
