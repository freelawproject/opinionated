J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9\">Defendant James Robinson, Jr., appeals from a judgment of the Los Angeles Superior Court imposing a sentence of death following his conviction of two counts of first degree murder of James White and Brian Berry (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and one count of second degree robbery <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 211). The jury found true both robbery-murder and multiple-murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>special-circumstance allegations. (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3) &amp; (17).) The jury also found true the allegations that defendant personally used a firearm in the commission of the offenses. (\u00a7\u00a7 1203.06, subd. (a)(1), 12022.5, subd. (a).) After the initial penalty phase proceedings ended in mistrial, a new jury was selected to consider the question of penalty, and that jury fixed the punishment at death. In addition to imposing a judgment of death for each murder conviction, the trial court sentenced defendant to the midterm of three years for the robbery plus four years for the weapons enhancements. Defendant\u2019s appeal is automatic. (\u00a7 1239, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">A. <em>Guilt Phase Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">1. <em>The prosecution\u2019s case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Defendant James Robinson, Jr., was a student at California State University, Northridge (CSUN), where he lived in a dormitory and had a part-time job on campus. In the spring of 1990 he had not paid his tuition or student fees and stopped attending classes. Defendant moved to a condominium, which he shared with roommates near the CSUN campus. In August 1990 he began a part-time job at a nearby Subway sandwich shop, where he worked for approximately five months. Stuart Schlosser, owner of the Subway shop, described defendant as a courteous and cooperative employee, but also noted that defendant and another employee had been \u201clet go\u201d after he (Schlosser) confronted them concerning money that was missing and warned that, if the money was not returned, they would be \u201cterminated.\u201d After leaving employment at the Subway shop, defendant continued to patronize the shop and had pleasant interactions with Schlosser.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">Defendant found a part-time job as a meat wrapper at a supermarket and remained there for three months. In April 1991 defendant\u2019s credit union assessed various overcharge fees and ultimately closed his checking account because he had written more than three overdrawn checks in the prior six months. A second supermarket hired defendant as a part-time employee in May 1991. Meanwhile, defendant\u2019s newspaper subscription was cancelled for lack of payment, and a debt collection agency pursued him concerning other obligations. Defendant cashed his paychecks at the supermarkets where he worked and kept most of his money in currency. The credit union ultimately reversed some of the overcharge fees, and defendant was able to honor each of the returned checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Defendant terminated his condominium lease in May 1991 and moved into an apartment occupied by Tai Williams (Williams), his friend since seventh grade. Williams shared that apartment with his girlfriend, Donna Morgan, and their baby daughter. During this period, defendant began to work full time for Lucky\u2019s supermarket in the meat department, where he met Dennis Ostrander (Ostrander), who occasionally loaned defendant money for lunch or busfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Williams owned a gun, as did another mutual friend, Tommy Aldridge (Aldridge), whom defendant also had known since seventh grade. Williams frequently took defendant and Aldridge to a nearby shooting range for target practice. In early June 1991, defendant purchased an inexpensive .380 semiautomatic handgun to use for target practice. He testified that he purchased the firearm because previously at the practice range he had been forced to rent expensive guns for which ammunition also was quite costly, and he wanted instead to have a simple and serviceable gun that would use less expensive ammunition. After the mandatory 15-day waiting period expired, defendant took possession of the gun on June 18, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Williams testified that defendant\u2019s behavior then changed and that he began to handle and play with the gun and became \u201cobsessed\u201d with it. In addition, Williams testified, defendant \u201cbecame, quote, unquote, a bigger man, you know, because he had all this protection behind him so now he could walk and talk big.\u201d Williams explained that defendant\u2019s possession of the gun gave him \u201can attitude, like he was just invincible\u201d and that \u201cwherever he went the gun went. . . . And you could just tell, you know. When someone changes you can just tell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Williams also testified that, when defendant still was working at the Subway shop and on numerous occasions well before defendant moved into Williams\u2019s apartment in June 1991, defendant mentioned the possibility of robbing the Subway shop because he needed money. Williams related that defendant said the shop would be an easy target \u201cbecause he . . . knew the place.\u201d According to Williams, he told defendant he was crazy and assumed defendant was joking.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">These conversations, Williams explained, recurred on numerous occasions after defendant moved into Williams\u2019s apartment in June 1991. Williams recounted that defendant told him how he planned to rob the Subway shop and repeated that he would do so because he needed money: \u201cHe told me he was going to go in and order some food. After that he was going to hold \u2019em up, and if, when he went in, . . . they were people that he knew he would have to kill them, shoot them execution style.\u201d According to Williams, defendant also spoke specifically of his \u201cneed to get his hands on some money,\u201d the layout of the shop, the absence of security cameras, the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>pliers to remove money from the shop\u2019s safe, and the relative ease of escaping through the shop\u2019s back door.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Williams testified that he went with defendant to the Subway shop on one occasion after defendant had ceased working there and that defendant, after joking with the employees, commented to Williams as they left the shop, \u201cWell, too bad if they are in there. Too bad. I\u2019ll have to kill them if they are in there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Aldridge testified that he was present at Williams\u2019s apartment when, approximately one week prior to the commission of the crimes, defendant spoke of his need for money to pay various bills and his plan to commit a robbery at either the Subway shop or a gas station, or perhaps to rob a person walking on the street. According to Aldridge, defendant raised the subject again two days later, also while at Williams\u2019s apartment, with Williams and Donna Morgan also present. On that occasion, defendant focused his plan upon the Subway shop at which he had worked. According to Aldridge, defendant asserted that he \u201cknew the hours. He knew the people who worked there. He knew . . . where the safe was and what he decided to do was pick this individual Subway because it was the easiest target for him to rob.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Aldridge recounted a third conversation that occurred at Williams\u2019s apartment, in which defendant repeated his plan to rob the Subway shop that weekend and execute the employees who were on duty at that time by \u201clay[ing] them down and blowing] them away at the back of their heads, using his words.\u201d Aldridge testified that he and Williams were \u201cpretty much trying to discourage [defendant] from trying to rob somebody. We knew we had no control over [him]. He had just purchased a gun. He was really excited about that. We were more or less trying to save his life and getting him out of a bad situation.\u201d Nevertheless, Aldridge testified, defendant stated that although he \u201cfelt bad\u201d that he would have to kill people whom he knew, he also repeatedly stated that he needed money and did not \u201cgive a damn. They are going to die because I need the money.\u201d Aldridge asserted that he declined defendant\u2019s request for a ride to the planned robbery because \u201cone, ... it was a crazy idea, and two, my car was being painted that weekend.\u201d Aldridge asserted that neither he nor Williams believed that defendant actually would commit the planned robbery, because defendant \u201cwas one for talking and not doing things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Williams further testified that on Saturday, June 29, 1991, he informed defendant that defendant would have to move out of the apartment because he (defendant) had told Donna Morgan \u201cthings that weren\u2019t true\u201d (that Williams had been unfaithful to her) and because defendant had caused Williams\u2019s telephone to be disconnected due to nonpayment of defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>long distance bills. During that conversation Williams left defendant alone in the apartment living room at one point, and thereafter Williams and Donna heard defendant load his gun. Williams testified that Donna mentioned that defendant was loading his gun and that Williams replied to her, \u201cdon\u2019t worry, he is not a fool.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Williams testified that, after defendant left the apartment, he checked the \u201cgun box\u201d that defendant kept in the living room on the side of the couch and found it empty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant returned to the apartment half an hour later and asked to speak with Williams, who met him outside the front door. Williams testified that defendant was depressed and crying and that he told Williams that he loved Williams like a brother, did not want Williams to be \u201clike him,\u201d and wanted Williams to be \u201cbetter than him.\u201d According to Williams, defendant then gave him a note, the general contents of which he could not recall, but the last line of which read, \u201cpray for me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Because defendant had no other place to go that night, Williams and Donna agreed to let him remain in the apartment until the next morning. Defendant again departed from the apartment at approximately 11:30 p.m. Williams testified that he believed defendant took his gun because he heard defendant handling it only shortly beforehand, and because defendant \u201calways had it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Rebecca James (James) resided in an apartment next to the Subway shop, which was located approximately five blocks from Williams\u2019s apartment. At approximately 1:30 a.m. on Sunday, June 30, as James walked home from a date, she passed the Subway shop. The shop was well lit and she saw three males inside: one White person behind the counter, who appeared to be an employee; one Black person in front of the counter, who appeared to be a customer; and a third person, who was White. James testified that the Black person was holding what she thought or assumed was a metal pan. She thereafter described hearing a loud sound, which she assumed was the metal pan being dropped to the floor. James explained that after she heard the noise, she \u201cimmediately saw the customer [the Black person] either run around the counter or jump on the counter and over. I thought maybe he was chasing him.\u201d James assumed that the three were simply \u201croughhousing,\u201d proceeded to walk to her own apartment, and saw nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">At approximately 1:45 a.m., another person\u2014David Kallman\u2014approached the shop, noticed \u201ca body with blood around it,\u201d and telephoned 911. Police arrived at the scene at approximately 2:00 a.m. and found Brian Berry lying dead in a pool of blood near the counter. A Subway employee, James White, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>was found lying facedown in a pool of blood behind the cash register, alive but mortally wounded. Brian Berry had been shot twice, once in the cheek from 12 to 18 inches away and a second time while the gun was in contact with his head, just above the right ear. James White had been shot with a gun that was in contact with the crown of his head when fired. A forensic pathologist testified that the trajectory of the bullet that struck White was consistent with the victim having been shot while kneeling. All three bullets were recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The cash register was empty of all paper currency, and the shop\u2019s floor safe was open. Testimony revealed that approximately $580 had been taken from the cash register and the floor safe (including approximately $200 in paper currency and rolled coins that were missing from the safe). Of this sum, between 60 and 75 one dollar bills, some of which had been kept in the safe for making change, were missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The cash register\u2019s journal tape showed that the last transaction had taken place at 1:32 a.m.\u2014an order for a turkey and bacon sandwich, a seafood sandwich, and two tuna salads. The order had been subtotaled, but the items apparently had not been paid for. Investigators found a plastic Subway bag containing a wrapped turkey and bacon sandwich in an alley outside the shop\u2019s back door. The prosecution\u2019s fingerprint expert testified that defendant\u2019s left index fingerprint and left thumbprint were found on the bottom left-hand comer of the plastic Subway bag. According to that witness, analysis of the position of the two prints\u2014both of which were on the same side of the bag\u2014disclosed that they \u201ccould not [have been] placed\u201d on the bag at the same exact time, but must have been placed on the bag at different times. The three bullets recovered from the victims\u2019 bodies were examined by an independent firearms expert who testified that, in his opinion, each had been fired from the gun later confiscated from defendant upon his arrest and could not have come from any other weapon. Finally, investigators recovered a shoe print from the top of the Subway shop\u2019s counter, but were unable to match that print with the single shoe seized from defendant\u2019s residence immediately following his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Defendant subsequently returned to Williams\u2019s apartment, where Williams heard defendant enter at approximately 3:00 or 3:30 a.m. on June 30, 1991. Williams testified that when he awoke in the morning, defendant was gone, but his personal belongings still were there. According to Williams, defendant returned to the apartment later that day and was \u201cvery excited, kind of hyper almost\u201d and asked whether Williams had read the newspapers. Williams <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>responded \u201cno,\u201d and defendant told Williams that there had been a robbery at the Subway shop. Williams testified that defendant then gave him $60 in cash for his share of the apartment telephone bill and said that he had made living arrangements in the dorms at CSUN.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Later on Sunday, June 30, Aldridge \u201csaw on the news [that] the specific Subway that [defendant] had planned to rob had been robbed and two people had been murdered, just as [defendant] said he would murder them.\u201d Aldridge immediately telephoned Williams, who also had seen the report. Aldridge testified that defendant telephoned him later that evening and was \u201cvery hyper. ... He constantly told me he had a surprise for me. And I asked him specifically if he had done the murders and robbed the Subway. He giggled. He would not tell me no, but he wouldn\u2019t tell me yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Defendant was scheduled to work in the supermarket meat department on Sunday, June 30, but telephoned to say that he was ill. At approximately 11:00 a.m. that day, defendant rented an apartment from Donna Lopez, producing $400 in cash in $10 and $20 bills. Lopez testified that she advised defendant that she could not accept cash and that she needed to run a credit report. Defendant returned shortly thereafter with a completed application and two money orders for $400 total, plus $25 in $1 bills for the credit check. He moved into the apartment the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">James, who had observed the interior of the Subway shop at or around the time of the crime, was contacted by the police on June 30 and described the Black man whom she had seen as being in his early twenties, \u201capproximately 5-11,\u201d \u201cnot real Black in color,\u201d with \u201cbig lips\u201d and \u201cshort cropped hair, Afro style.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Defendant attended his job at the supermarket on July 2. Ostrander, who also was on duty at that time, testified that he was busy with customers but that defendant at one point grabbed his arm and said \u201cI need to talk to you about something.\u201d According to Ostrander, defendant inquired whether Ostrander knew about the Subway killings. Ostrander replied that he was unaware and testified that defendant replied, \u201cwell, there was killings at the Subway shop. I popped those two kids.\u201d Ostrander testified that he did not believe defendant and that he replied, \u201cYeah, right.\u201d In response, Ostrander asserted, defendant showed him a small handgun that defendant kept in his right sock.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">According to Ostrander, defendant told him that he had been wrongly accused of stealing money from the Subway shop and had been upset about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>that false charge. Ostrander recounted that defendant said he had been in the shop\u2019s parking lot for an hour with a friend, planning the robbery. And then, Ostrander asserted, defendant \u201ctold me how he did everything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">\u201cHe said he went into the shop to make it look like he was purchasing a sandwich . . . and looked around. ... He said he noticed that there was somebody sitting at a booth, a young kid. . . . And ... the kid made a remark to him, \u2018hey, don\u2019t I know you from somewheres?\u2019 [f] And [defendant] told me he said back to the kid, \u2018no, I don\u2019t know you. . . .\u2019 []Q And the kid said, \u2018oh no, I do. I know you from somewheres.\u2019 [f] [Defendant] told me that he . . . knew he had to pop that kid because ... he knew that kid would remember him.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] [f] And at that time he pulled the gun out and made both of them go around the back of the counter because he said he knew the safe was in the floor. And also, he wanted to keep the guy away . . . from the cash register . . . because he knew there was a buzzer . . . that was supposed to be there. [][] And when he walked him up to the safe, he made the guy unlock the safe. And as soon as he unlocked the safe he said the guy that was unlocking the safe that was working there, he had his back to [defendant], and [he] shot him in the back of the head. And at that time he said the kid turned around and the guy just looked at him, and he shot him again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Ostrander continued: \u201cHe said that ... he was pissed about [the gun] because he said it didn\u2019t have enough, excuse my language, \u2018fucking killing power.\u2019 [f] And at that time he said the one that opened the safe . . . went down on the ground. And then the other kid in the shop started to run. And . . . [defendant] caught him on the left side of the temple of the head and shot him in the side of the head, and he fell down on the opposite side of the counter, [f] And he said that ... he went over to the other kid and put the gun up to his head and the kid, he said he was laying in a puddle of blood crying and screaming, and he pulled the trigger and it went \u2018click, click,\u2019 and he said the gun ran out of \u2018fucking bullets.\u2019 [][] And then he had a brown bag with him that he carried ... so he could pick ... up [the cartridges] so nobody could trace it. And he forgot to do that when he first fired the gun . . . [a]nd . . . couldn\u2019t find all the bullets. ... [f] He said when he ran out of the shop, the kid on the outside of the counter that was laying in the blood . . . was still screaming and stuff like that, and he ran out of bullets. And at that time he said he knew the kid was living, and he just ran out of the shop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Ostrander added that defendant told him that the Subway employee who had opened the safe was one of the persons who had told Subway management that defendant earlier had stolen money from the shop and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>defendant \u201chad a grievance against him, and that both victims had pleaded, \u2018[pjlease don\u2019t shoot me. Don\u2019t shoot me.\u2019 \u201d Ostrander further testified that defendant told him that he took \u201ca little less than 500 bucks\u201d\u2014and that when defendant told him \u201call of this,\u201d he \u201cabsolutely [did] not\u201d believe defendant, because he did not seem to be the type of person who would commit such acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Aldridge recounted that he had additional telephone conversations with defendant on July 1 and 2 and that, during the latter conversation, defendant directed Aldridge to go to an abandoned gas station and telephone him at a specific number from a phone booth there. Aldridge, accompanied by his friends Raquel Rose and Wendell Jones, drove to that location as directed and, while standing at the phone booth, Aldridge heard defendant call him from across the street. Aldridge testified that he reentered his car, drove across the street, and picked up defendant, who directed that Aldridge drive circuitously to defendant\u2019s apartment. Aldridge testified that defendant, contrary to his normal character, was extremely nervous and patted him down \u201cto see if I had a gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Aldridge testified that defendant was carrying his gun without its clip but with a bullet in the chamber and that once they were inside defendant\u2019s apartment, Aldridge insisted that defendant place Ms gun on a shelf where all could see it. Thereafter, Aldridge recalled, he and defendant walked outside alone and Aldridge asked defendant whether he had committed the murders. Defendant responded again in a giggling manner and, smiling broadly, said \u201cyeah, I blew them away.\u201d Aldridge explained, \u201che knew what the subject would be about, and after I asked him, he just let loose. It was a big laugh and a big yes.\u201d Aldridge recounted: \u201cHe . . . told me [that] ... to avoid being id\u2019d, he felt bad about it, but he had to blow them away, and he described [how] he shot one of them behind the head and another one on the side of the head and he wasn\u2019t sure if he was dead yet, so he shot the other guy behind the head again.\u201d According to Aldridge, defendant committed the crimes because \u201che needed the money.\u201d Defendant told Aldridge that he had gathered approximately $600 or $700 in the robbery. Defendant treated the group to food and drinks, and they spent the night together at his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">After Aldridge drove defendant to his supermarket job the following morning, Aldridge telephoned Williams. Aldridge testified that he did not want to turn defendant in, but believed that Williams would take that step.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Williams and Donna Morgan did so, and Aldridge eventually also contacted the police and cooperated with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The witness who lived near the Subway shop, James, learned that a reward was being offered in connection with the crime investigation, and her family arranged for her to meet with a private attorney in connection with any possible reward. On July 9, 1991, James helped the police produce a composite drawing of the Black man she had seen inside the Subway shop and later testified that the completed sketch looked \u201csomething like\u201d the man she had seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The sketch showed a man without eyeglasses. Various witnesses testified that defendant usually wore glasses but sometimes did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Although James had been unable to identify defendant from a photographic lineup shown to her a few days after the crimes, at the trial nearly two years later, James was \u201cabsolutely positive\u201d that defendant was the man she had seen in the Subway shop. Nevertheless, James acknowledged, there were dissimilarities between defendant and the man she recalled having seen and described to the police: James did not recall the man\u2019s wearing eyeglasses, and she recalled the man as having a rounder build and face than defendant\u2019s as he appeared at trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Ostrander further testified that, despite having been told by his own girlfriend about the Subway crimes, he still had not believed defendant\u2019s story, and for that reason did not disclose to the police, until after defendant had been arrested, the admission that defendant had made to him. Ostrander explained that defendant previously had made up various stories \u201cto impress me or whatever,\u201d but that he had begun to believe defendant\u2019s story when, upon departing at the end of one of his shifts, he was met in the parking lot by a pair of Black men who told him to \u201ckeep [his] fucking mouth shut.\u201d Thereafter, according to Ostrander, the two men, both wearing sunglasses, met him as he arrived for work and stared at him for approximately 30 seconds. At that point, Ostrander stated, he \u201cknew [he] had a problem,\u201d went inside the market, called a meeting of his supervisors, and told them \u201cwhat\u2019s going on.\u201d Ostrander testified that he subsequently received numerous threatening telephone calls at his workplace and that his employer moved him to three different stores during a six-month period in response to those threats. Ostrander also testified that, after he attended the preliminary hearing in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>case, his supervisor told him not to go to work that day, because other supermarket employees had reported that two men with sunglasses had been waiting for him at the meat department for about 20 minutes. Ostrander explained that he was kept off the work schedule for a few days thereafter. Finally, Ostrander testified that once, while driving to discuss these matters with a supermarket supervisor, he was run off the road, but was told by supermarket management that it was unnecessary to file a police report concerning that incident and that the supermarket would protect him by moving his work location from one store to another. Ostrander conceded that, because of these experiences, he feared for his own safety and once had told police officers that if the case against defendant \u201cgoes to trial I am not going to remember anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">On cross-examination, defense counsel confronted Ostrander with a prior statement Ostrander had made to the police, in which he had said: \u201cI just want to be truthful. I will go to the court for you, but that\u2019s my terms and I want to do it. And if I have to ask the police department to help me out with [my employer] with a lawyer stating, okay, this man, we are going to need him. This is the terms. You are going to give him a settlement and it is not going to be no $50,000 or something because he cannot live. I want to get something going for myself.\u201d Ostrander explained his comments as reflecting his frustration that, because he had reluctantly become a witness in this case, he had \u201clost\u201d his 11-year career at the supermarket and had sought a settlement from the market so that he could relocate. When asked by defense counsel whether the above-quoted statement \u201crepresents] your feelings on the subject?\u201d Ostrander responded: \u201cMy feelings is I feared for my life and wanted to move away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Nine days after the crimes were committed, defendant was arrested on the street, in front of his apartment. He was not wearing eyeglasses. He waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights <em>(Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602]) and agreed to speak with the police. The police report\u2019s summary of that interview reads as follows: \u201c[Defendant] denied both the murders of James White and Brian Berry, and the robbery of the Subway sandwich shop. [Defendant] claimed that on the date of the crime, 6-30-91, he was visiting a CSUN student, Etsuko Sugita. He was visiting with her until about 0140/0145 hours. [Defendant] said that he did not have his gun with him because when he left the apartment earlier in the evening he could not find it. [Defendant\u2019s] statements to the detectives included T always carry the gun with me. I carried it all the time until this happened.\u2019 \u201d A transcript of the tape-recorded interview was prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>2. <em>The defense case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Defendant testified on his own behalf. He denied committing the robbery or the murders, denied having the various conversations recounted by Williams, Aldridge, and Ostrander, and denied much of the testimony by other witnesses. He testified he was frightened when he spoke to the police, and assumed he had been arrested because he is Black and formerly had worked at the Subway shop. Defendant further explained that he was nervous and embarrassed during the interview because he knew who had committed the crimes, but thought that the police would not believe his story about being at the scene and for that reason did not tell the full truth at that time. He also testified that he began wearing eyeglasses in third grade and cannot see clearly without them.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Defendant asserted that Williams had made various comments about robbing the Subway shop. Specifically, defendant testified that Williams had picked him up at least once from his shift at the shop and had remarked that the enterprise did not appear to be making money. Defendant testified that, in response, he showed Williams hourly logs reporting the sums that had been collected. Defendant further testified that, in early June 1991 (while defendant was living at Williams\u2019s apartment), Williams raised the idea of robbing the Subway shop after Williams and Donna Morgan watched a crime program on television. As defendant described it, Williams was sitting on the living room floor, holding his baby, and commented, \u201cHey, if you rob the Subway, you can go out the back door, can\u2019t you?\u201d Defendant testified he replied by observing that such a plan would not work, because a certain gate was kept locked. Defendant added that Williams again brought up the subject approximately one week prior to the commission of the crimes, when he and defendant were at the target practice range. At that point, according to defendant, Williams asked him, \u201cif you shoot people in the Subway, can\u2019t you kill them in the refrigerator?\u201d Defendant recounted that he responded, \u201cif you shoot anybody in a place like that, you\u2019ll lose your hearing.\u201d Defendant testified that he began to believe that Williams \u201cwas a little bit overboard with this,\u201d but that defendant \u201cdid not worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Defendant testified that when he lived with Williams and Donna Morgan, they bickered constantly, were unfaithful to each other, and called upon him to help settle disputes that arose between them. Defendant also asserted that when he left Williams\u2019s apartment on the evening prior to the Subway crimes, he placed three $20 bills on a counter in the living room to cover his share of the telephone bill. He further testified that when he returned to the apartment shortly thereafter to speak with Williams, he assured Williams that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>he was not trying to interfere with Williams\u2019s relationship with Donna and told Williams that he (Williams) would be a \u201cbetter man\u201d if he took defendant\u2019s advice and applied for a job at a supermarket, which in turn would provide benefits for Williams\u2019s child. Defendant also recounted that he told Williams not to worry about him and that he understood that Williams had to \u201cdo what you have to do.\u201d Defendant denied Williams\u2019s testimony that he gave Williams a note. Defendant asserted that he asked, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on?,\u201d and that Williams responded, \u201cmeet me at the Subway at one o\u2019clock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Defendant testified that, after he left Williams\u2019s apartment, he walked to a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant where he kept his bicycle locked and rode it to the supermarket to speak with an acquaintance who previously had offered to share an apartment with him, in order to make arrangements for new housing. The acquaintance was not at work. Defendant testified that he then went to the CSUN dorms to visit a Japanese student named Etsuko, whom he had met earlier that evening, and made plans to meet her at her dorm at midnight. Defendant testified that he left Etsuko\u2019s dorm after 1:00 a.m. and did not care that he was late for his appointment with Williams at the Subway shop at 1:00, because he had since come to the conclusion that he \u201cdid not want to hear anything that [Williams] had to say\u201d to him. Nevertheless, defendant testified, he decided to walk the half- or quarter-mile to the Subway shop, because he thought Williams would be upset with him for failing to arrive as planned at 1:00 and defendant wanted to be able to later tell Williams that he indeed had been there after the meeting time and simply had tired of waiting for him. Defendant further explained that he planned to be able to describe to Williams the employees who had been working that shift, in order to prove to Williams that he had been at the shop after 1:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Defendant testified that as he entered the shop he noticed a person with a bloody face sitting on the floor facing the counter\u2014a position that, defendant conceded on direct examination, was different from that shown in the crime scene photos. Thereafter, defendant claimed, he heard the two-by-four board that was used to bolt the shop\u2019s back door drop to the ground, and he then heard the distinct sound of two sets of footsteps in the back of the shop. Defendant described one set of the footsteps as sounding \u201clike tennis shoes\u201d and making a \u201cchirping\u201d noise and the other set as sounding \u201clike a different shoe, a heavier shoe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Defendant asserted he walked toward the back of the shop, jumped over another person lying on the ground behind the cash register, looked around a comer, and saw the back door closing slowly, as if under its own motion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Defendant testified he ran out the back door, saw a departing 1990 Mustang, and chased after it. According to defendant, the car\u2019s brake lights illuminated, revealing white light emitted from broken plastic panels on each side. Defendant asserted he realized at that point that the car was Williams\u2019s (who drove a gray 1990 Mustang with broken tail lights). Defendant explained he \u201cimmediately thought that I should take something and let him know that I know what he did.\u201d According to defendant, \u201cwhen I looked down I saw the [Subway sandwich] bag. I went to reach for it and then something told me don\u2019t touch anything so I didn\u2019t, and then I ran.\u201d Later in his testimony, defendant explained: \u201cWhen I looked down I saw the bag and the logo, and I could see the asphalt up under it so there was nothing in the bag. And I had went to pick it up, and then I just thought don\u2019t touch it. And there was nothing in the bag that I can remember seeing. I saw clear through the bag to the asphalt. It was dark beneath.\u201d Asked if he recalled \u201cactually touching the bag itself,\u201d defendant responded: \u201cIn a way I do, but I don\u2019t think that I had\u2014I don\u2019t believe that I had actually lifted it. I had never completed a stand from off the ground where I had bent over to touch it. Right then I let go before I began to lift up.\u201d Defendant twice demonstrated for the jury how he had bent down and touched the bag by pinching it between his left forefinger and thumb, and he reiterated that the bag he had touched had been empty.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Thereafter, according to defendant, he ran down the alley and \u201cthought about going down to the police station but didn\u2019t know if that was the right thing to do. Because I knew who did it personally. [][] I began to think . . . [w]hen I was crossing the street . . . \u2018why did he ask me to meet him there.\u2019 And then I begin to wonder if he was going to kill me because he was acting like he was mad at me that night I left. So I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Defendant testified that, when he arrived back at Williams\u2019s apartment in the early hours of Sunday, June 30, he \u201ctried not to go to sleep so that I wouldn\u2019t get confronted\u201d by Williams or be \u201ccaught off guard\u201d by him. On cross-examination, defendant acknowledged he was armed with his own gun at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Defendant further testified he left the apartment at 6:00 on Sunday morning, June 30, checked into a nearby hotel, and then departed to look for an apartment to rent. Defendant stated that Aldridge had paged him numerous times at work following the Subway crimes and that he finally telephoned Aldridge because the constant pages were annoying. Defendant asserted he agreed to let Aldridge come to see his new apartment so that he (defendant) \u201cwould be able to know whether Tai had intended to do what he did . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor quoted extensively from the transcript of defendant\u2019s postarrest interview, which revealed that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>repeatedly and emotionally had denied being at the Subway shop on the morning when the crimes were committed. The prosecutor exposed and highlighted scores of inconsistencies in defendant\u2019s testimony<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and ultimately asked defendant why the jury should believe his story and disbelieve the numerous witnesses who had testified contrary to his version of the events. Defendant responded that nearly everyone else who had been called by the prosecution to testify at his trial had lied\u2014some witnesses, about \u201ca lot of things\u201d; others, about \u201ca few things\u201d\u2014and that he had \u201ctried\u201d to tell \u201cnothing but the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Los Angeles Police Officer Peggy Moseley, one of the investigating officers in the matter, was called to testify by defendant and recounted that eyewitness James had been unable to identify defendant in a photographic lineup conducted three days after the Subway crimes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">B. <em>Penalty Phase Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">After finding defendant guilty of the charged offenses and making true findings on the two special circumstance allegations, the jury heard penalty phase evidence and ultimately deadlocked seven to five in favor of imposing a sentence of death. The court declared a mistrial as to penalty, after which defendant\u2019s trial counsel (Bruce Hill) was relieved due to a conflict<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>replacement counsel (Richard Leonard) was appointed to represent defendant. Nine months later, the court empanelled a new jury and the prosecution presented, in essence, the evidence set forth <em>ante, </em>detailing the circumstances of the crime: defendant had financial problems in the months prior to June 1991 and was living with friends because he could not afford an apartment of his own; he purchased a handgun in early June 1991 and spoke repeatedly of robbing the Subway shop; on June 29, 1991, defendant robbed the Subway shop and fatally shot each of the two victims in the head; and defendant thereafter admitted doing so to his friend Aldridge and his coworker Ostrander. (Aldridge testified on direct examination that both he and Williams had received $7,000 in reward money that had been offered in connection with the Subway crimes.) Finally, as explained <em>post </em>(pt. U.C.4.), the victims\u2019 relatives testified concerning the devastating impact of the killings on their own lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Defendant again testified on his own behalf, essentially repeating his testimony at the guilt phase of the trial. In addition, defendant described his childhood and his brief service in the United States Marine Corps. He explained that he had dropped out of college because he had misspent financial aid money that had been granted to pay for his housing expenses, and that he also had written a few bad checks in May and June of 1991, but asserted the bank erroneously had failed to honor some of his checks. Defendant denied robbing the Subway shop or killing the two victims and asserted that Tai Williams was the true perpetrator of the crimes. Defendant explained that he previously had lied to the police and had not implicated Williams, because defendant did not trust the police and was frightened. Defendant repeatedly stated that he now was telling the truth and that the various prosecution witnesses who testified otherwise were lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Thirteen witnesses testified extensively on defendant\u2019s behalf. Some explained that they had met defendant as a child when his mother had joined a church choir group and that they found him to be nice, quiet, nonviolent, responsible, and mild-mannered. Others\u2014such as former neighbors at college\u2014gave similar testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Defendant\u2019s mother testified that she was strict when raising defendant and his sisters and that she remained protective of defendant when he was in college, sometimes visiting him two or three times a week and supplying him with money and groceries. She also explained that after defendant misspent the financial aid money that had been intended for his housing expenses, she met with defendant and school officials and arranged to repay the school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>more than half of the funds, with the understanding that defendant would repay the balance. Defendant\u2019s mother characterized him as meek, mild, and soft-hearted, and testified that when he telephoned her in mid-June to tell her that he was staying with Williams, she became angry and told him to return home, but he refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Defense counsel also introduced six photographs of defendant, depicting him (a) during a family vacation cruise celebrating his 16th birthday, (b) during a visit to Hearst Castle in San Simeon, (c) in second grade \u201cwhen he first got his glasses,\u201d (d) at an Order of the Eastern Star banquet that defendant attended with his mother and sisters as a Junior Mason, (e) in a helicopter, along with his sisters, at a Young Marine Corps camp, and, finally, (f) graduating from high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In rebuttal, the prosecution presented the testimony of the detective who had interviewed defendant on the day of his arrest. The officer recounted that defendant repeatedly and forcefully had denied being present at the Subway shop on the night of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">A. <em>Asserted Errors During Selection of the First Jury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">The court prepared, and prospective jurors completed, a detailed juror questionnaire. Defendant challenges the use and administration of the questionnaire and the resulting jury selection process in this case. Indeed, in the course of his combined 210 pages of briefing on this subject, he argues that this case \u201cpresents virtually every imaginable form of error which can possibly occur in voir dire and jury selection.\u201d We address immediately <em>post </em>the challenges that affect the first trial. We shall consider in a subsequent section (pt. II.B.l.) defendant\u2019s additional voir dire challenges relating specifically to the penalty phase retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">1. <em>Claims concerning Code of Civil Procedure section 223</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">At the time of the first and second trials in this matter, Code of Civil Procedure section 223 provided that, in a criminal case, the court \u201cshall conduct the examination of prospective jurors,\u201d but that the parties \u201cupon a showing of good cause\u201d may \u201csupplement the examination.\u201d (As added by \u00a7 7 of Prop. 115, approved by electorate eff. June 6, 1990; see generally <em>People v. Taylor </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1299, 1307-1309 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 676] <em>(Taylor) </em>[describing the history of the statute].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> By contrast, in <em>civil </em>cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>at the time of the trials in this case (as now), Code of Civil Procedure section 222.5 generally conferred a <em>right </em>of attorney voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Defendant contends that the restrictions imposed by Code of Civil Procedure section 223 upon voir dire in criminal cases violated his equal protection rights under the state and federal Constitutions. We reject that claim for the same reasons that we recently set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 494 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 575, 101 P.3d 478]: \u201cThe right to voir dire the jury is not constitutional, but is a means to achieve the end of an impartial jury. <em>(People v. Estorga </em>(1928) 206 Cal. 81, 84 [273 P. 575].) . . . . \u2018[T]here is no constitutional right to any particular manner of conducting the voir dire and selecting a jury so long as such limitations as are recognized by the settled principles of criminal law to be essential in securing impartial juries are not transgressed.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Boulerice </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 463, 474 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 279] <em>(Boulerice).) </em>[][] Federal and state courts have held, however, that the Legislature may establish reasonable regulations or conditions on the right to a jury trial as long as the essential elements of a jury trial are preserved, including number of jurors (12), unanimity, and impartiality. <em>(Boulerice, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 474.) The purpose of Code of Civil Procedure former section 223 was to curb commonly known abuses during the voir dire process in criminal cases. <em>(Boulerice, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 474.) [f] As the People observe, therefore, the statute\u2019s distinction between criminal and civil voir dire is constitutional as long as it is rationally related to a legitimate state purpose under the rational relationship test, a test met here. <em>(People v. Leung </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 482, 496 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 290].) By enacting Code of Civil Procedure section 223, the voters sought to prevent abuse of the jury selection process in criminal cases. Prevention of abuse of a statutory right is a legitimate purpose, and the voters\u2019 action was aimed at achieving a legitimate purpose rationally related to the distinction made by the law. <em>(Leung, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 496.) Because the classification drawn by Code of Civil Procedure section 223 was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose, it did not deny defendant his equal protection rights under the California and United States Constitutions. <em>(Leung, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 496.) \u201d <em>(Ramos, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th 494, 512-513.)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Defendant also argues that reversal is required because the trial court did not understand the extent of its discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 223. We reject defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Defense counsel moved unsuccessfully under that statute for both attorney-conducted voir dire and individual sequestered voir dire concerning the issue of death qualification. At the hearing on that motion, the trial court discussed a number of cases cited by defense counsel, including <em>Taylor, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th 1299. Defendant focuses upon one sentence of the court\u2019s description of <em>Taylor, </em>in which the court asserted, \u201cA trial court is not allowed to ask open-ended questions but may ask those questions that could call for a yes or no answer.\u201d We agree that the trial court\u2019s characterization of <em>Taylor </em>was inapt\u2014that case held only that open-ended questions were not constitutionally compelled <em>in that case </em>(see <em>id., </em>at pp. 1315-1316). But the record in the present matter discloses that the court\u2019s extensive 20-page juror questionnaire (which was, of course, part of the voir dire process itself) contained numerous open-ended questions (such as \u201cwhat, if anything, have you already learned about this case or about the defendant?\u201d). Moreover, during the court\u2019s own voir dire examination of the prospective jurors, it did occasionally ask open-ended questions (inquiring, for example, \u201cwhat are those situations?\u201d in response to a prospective juror\u2019s assertion that he could vote for the death penalty in some situations). In any event, the record demonstrates the trial court\u2019s general <em>awareness\u2014at both </em>the first trial and the penalty phase retrial\u2014that it possessed discretion to conduct oral voir dire as necessary and to allow attorney participation and questioning as appropriate. For example, at the start of the first trial, the court specifically advised the parties that it did not preclude \u201cany consideration of additional questions on a juror by juror basis, and I will consider each request individually as they come up.\u201d Moreover, as further explained immediately <em>post, </em>defendant has not shown that the voir dire examination conducted by the trial court in this matter was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">2. <em>Claims of error concerning the jury selection process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s voir dire examination was insufficiently comprehensive, thereby impairing both defense counsel\u2019s ability to make challenges for cause and the trial court\u2019s ability to rule properly on those challenges, and that \u201cthere is no guarantee that the jurors selected in either phase of the capital trial were fair and impartial.\u201d As noted <em>ante, </em>the trial court required all prospective jurors to complete a 20-page juror questionnaire that asked 56 questions, many with subparts, calling for more than 90 total responses. Although the court offered counsel the opportunity to suggest modifications to the questionnaire, the record does not reflect that either party did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The resulting questionnaire required the prospective jurors to provide answers to a broad range of questions. Each juror was directed to state his or her name, age, sex, area of residence, occupation and employer, total family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>income, former occupations, and prior places of employment, as well as whether he or she had served in the Armed Forces, and if so, whether he or she had any involvement with the military police or military justice system. The questionnaire inquired as to each prospective juror\u2019s marital status, as well as the names, ages, occupations, and employers of spouses and children. It also probed each prospective juror\u2019s level of education, as well as any legal or medical training.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Some questions required only \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answers or other similarly brief responses. Many urged the prospective juror to explain his or her answer to open-ended questions such as inquiries regarding any experience visiting an incarcerated friend or family member, any association with attorneys, law enforcement officials, psychologists, or psychiatrists, and any prior jury service. Each prospective juror was asked whether he or she (or a close friend or relative) had been involved in any criminal incident. Other questions probed each prospective juror\u2019s ownership or use of weapons, participation in neighborhood crime prevention groups, and pressing business or personal matters or health problems that could affect the prospective juror\u2019s ability to sit through a lengthy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The questionnaire further explored whether each prospective juror would have difficulty following the law as given by the trial court, even if he or she disagreed with the law. Each was asked whether he or she had \u201cany feelings against the defendant solely because the defendant is charged with this particular offense . . .\u201d and whether the \u201cmere fact that criminal charges had been filed against the defendant\u201d caused the prospective juror to conclude that the defendant is \u201cmore likely to be guilty than not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Each prospective juror was asked whether he or she knew \u201canything about this case other than what you have heard in open court,\u201d or was acquainted with defendant or the attorneys. Followup questions inquired: \u201cWhat, if anything, have you already learned about this case or about the defendant? Where did you learn this? Did this information make you favor the prosecution or the defense?\u201d Additional questions inquired about newspapers or periodicals frequently read, radio and television news broadcasts frequently heard or watched, the most recent book read, specific news stories or topics followed by each prospective juror, and participation in civic, social, religious, or volunteer work or organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The questionnaire probed, in open-ended questions, each prospective juror\u2019s willingness to \u201cstay as long as is necessary to reach a verdict\u201d and to keep an open mind until all the evidence was presented and arguments were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>heard. Each prospective juror was told that parties, attorneys, or witnesses \u201cmay come from a particular national, racial, or religious group\u201d or have \u201clifestyles different from your own,\u201d and each was asked, \u201cWould that fact affect your judgment or the weight and credibility you would give his or her testimony?\u201d Each also was asked: \u201cDo you know of any reason why you would not be a completely fair and impartial juror in this case regardless of whether the victim was male or female, an adult or child, related to the defendant, or a stranger, etc.?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Finally, a separate five and one-half page section of the questionnaire probed each prospective juror\u2019s attitude concerning the death penalty.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The trial court conducted further voir dire examination of each prospective juror, first asking whether he or she wished to change any response set forth in the written questionnaire, then additionally questioning each person who failed to respond to any written inquiry or who gave ambiguous, conflicting, or otherwise problematic answers to those inquiries. Finally, the trial court asked each prospective juror a series of four questions concerning his or her attitude regarding the death penalty.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">a. <em>General challenges to the voir dire process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Defendant claims the voir dire examination was inadequate because (1) the questionnaire itself was unduly lengthy and complex; (2) the questionnaire was \u201cpoorly administered,\u201d in that prospective jurors were pressured to complete the forms quickly, with many spending less than an hour doing so, and some of the completed forms contained inaccuracies; (3) the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>displayed a \u201ccavalier attitude\u201d when it conducted only \u201crushed\u201d and \u201csuperficial\u201d followup questioning that did not clarify confusion experienced by some prospective jurors; (4) the court improperly conveyed, through the style and tenor of its questioning, that \u201cthe important thing was for the jurors to provide the \u2018correct\u2019 answer\u201d and did not \u201capproach voir dire with an interest in discovering information about [the] prospective jurors\u2019 real views and attitudes,\u201d but instead was \u201csolely interested in impaneling a jury as quickly as possible\u201d; (5) the court\u2019s voir dire exhibited a pro-prosecution and pro-death-penalty bias; and (6) the court\u2019s voir dire examination did not provide sufficient information with which to determine the parties\u2019 challenges for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Because defendant failed to object or suggest modifications to the questionnaire, he has forfeited any challenge to its length and asserted complexity or to any other aspect of its contents. <em>(People v. Avena </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 394, 413 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 301, 916 P.2d 1000] <em>(Avena).) </em>In any event, on the merits, no basis for reversal appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">It is established that a trial court \u201cis in the best position to assess the amount of voir dire required to ferret out latent prejudice, and to judge the responses\u201d <em>(Taylor, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th 1299, 1314), and hence a trial court has \u201c \u2018great latitude in deciding what questions should be asked on voir dire.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Earp </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 826, 852 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 857, 978 P.2d 15], quoting <em>Mu\u2019Min v. Virginia </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 415, 424 [114 L.Ed.2d 493, 111 S.Ct. 1899] <em>(Mu\u2019Min).) </em>In the present case, \u201c[viewing the voir dire record as a whole, we cannot say that the voir dire was inadequate and that the resulting trial was fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>(Stewart, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th 425, 458.)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Defendant observes that the trial judge distributed the questionnaires to prospective jurors midmoming and repeatedly admonished that they be returned to the court \u201cby noon today, no later than 1:30 .. . this afternoon.\u201d The trial judge also informed the prospective jurors that the courtroom would be closed between noon and 1:30 p.m. and that, if the form could not be returned by noon, they would need to wait to do so until the court reconvened at 1:30 p.m. According to defense counsel at trial, most jurors took approximately 45 minutes to complete their forms, which, defendant calculates, averages approximately 28 seconds per response. From this, defendant argues, prospective jurors must have been pressured into completing the forms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>quickly and, he theorizes, inaccurately. In support, defendant observes that a few prospective jurors left some questions blank, thereby demonstrating that they were rushed or confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">As the trial court observed, however, many of the questionnaire inquiries could be answered quickly with a few words, and most of the forms were fully completed, many with thoughtful written answers to the various open-ended questions. Questions that any prospective juror did not respond to were in turn repeated by the judge during the in-court voir dire examination of that prospective juror and, in some instances, the exchange disclosed that the prospective juror had not been confused, but simply had left items blank in lieu of responding \u201cno\u201d or \u201cinapplicable.\u201d Prospective jurors who gave inconsistent or ambiguous answers were asked followup questions by the trial court and, in each instance, the confusion was dispelled and an answer given. Defendant fails to identify any prospective juror who indicated to the court any difficulty in completing the questionnaire in the time provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Nor do we believe that the record supports defendant\u2019s claim that the court\u2019s voir dire examination of the prospective jurors was unduly rapid or otherwise improper. The record shows instead that the trial court was merely efficient\u2014the process was completed in approximately three hours and 20 minutes, resulting in an average examination of approximately three minutes per prospective juror. Nor does the record support defendant\u2019s general assertion that the trial court exhibited a pro-prosecution bias or that it pressured prospective jurors to give appropriate answers. For example, one prospective juror had indicated in her questionnaire that she believed defendant \u201cmore likely to be guilty\u201d because an information had been filed against him. The trial court explained the presumption of innocence to the prospective juror and asked whether she still believed that defendant was likely guilty. When she replied, \u201cprobably not,\u201d the court explained that \u201c \u2018probably\u2019 is not good enough.\u201d The prospective juror then changed her answer to \u201cno,\u201d prompting the trial court to state: \u201cWhen I say it is not good enough, I don\u2019t want you to change your answer just to please me. Don\u2019t worry about me. I like all of you. I don\u2019t care how you think. Do you understand this is very, very important?\u201d The juror conceded that she still believed a criminal defendant more likely to be guilty and the parties stipulated to her excusal for cause. In dismissing the juror, the trial court stated, \u201cI want to thank you for your honesty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">We conclude that the questionnaire described <em>ante </em>and used in this case adequately probed the prospective jurors\u2019 backgrounds and views in numerous relevant areas and, together with the trial judge\u2019s followup questions, provided an adequate basis upon which the parties were able to exercise challenges for cause as well as peremptory challenges. (See <em>Boulerice, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>5 Cal.App.4th 463, 477 [\u201cIf there is sufficient questioning to produce some basis for a reasonably knowledgeable exercise of the right of challenge, voir dire by the trial judge alone does not deprive a defendant of the right to adequate voir dire under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments\u201d].) Moreover, as noted <em>ante, </em>consistent with Code of Civil Procedure, section 223, the trial court in this case informed counsel that it would consider \u201crequests]\u201d for \u201cadditional questions on a juror by juror basis . . . individually as they come up,\u201d but defense counsel did not act on that offer, apparently because he did not believe any such additional questions were necessary in order for him to exercise his peremptory and for-cause challenges.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Defense counsel employed only 14 of his 20 available peremptory challenges, and evidently was content with the jurors selected. \u201c \u2018The failure to exhaust peremptories is a strong indication \u201cthat the jurors were fair, and that the defense itself so concluded.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dennis </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 468, 524 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 680, 950 P.2d 1035] <em>(Dennis).) </em>Indeed, in view of the circumstance that the first trial eventually deadlocked seven to five on the issue of penalty, there appears to be no reason to question defense counsel\u2019s apparent conclusion that the jurors would be fair to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">b. <em>Challenge to examination for potential racial bias and the possible adverse effect of pretrial publicity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Defendant claims that, in light of the circumstance that he is a Black man charged with murdering two young White men in the early 1990\u2019s (which was, defendant asserts, a time of heightened racial tension in the Los Angeles area), the voir dire process inadequately probed prospective jurors\u2019 potential racial biases and the possible effect of pretrial publicity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">As noted <em>ante, </em>the questionnaire employed at the first trial specifically informed the prospective jurors that a party or witness \u201cmay come from a different nationality, racial or religious group,\u201d and it asked: \u201cWould that fact affect your judgment or the weight and credibility you would give to his or her testimony?\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> One prospective juror responded in writing, \u201cI might\u2014I try <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>to control my prejudices but depending on what the differences were I might ascribe more or less weight to that person.\u201d Addressing that prospective juror orally in open court, the trial judge referred the individual to his response to the questionnaire inquiry and then stated: \u201c I am going to give you instructions on how to judge the credibility of a witness, how you can tell whether a witness is telling the truth and telling a lie, and it has nothing to do with any racial characteristics or ethnic characteristics or any different life style than yours. That is not to be considered in determining whether a witness is telling the truth or not. [f] Do you think that you can follow that?\u201d The prospective juror replied, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d Defense counsel thereafter exercised a peremptory challenge to excuse that prospective juror. If counsel had believed that further inquiry was necessary in this instance or with regard to other prospective jurors, he could have submitted additional questionnaire inquiries or suggested additional oral questions. As noted <em>ante, </em>defense counsel\u2019s failure to do so forfeits the claim on appeal. <em>(Avena, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 394, 413.)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Even if we were to agree that the voir dire examination was flawed, we would not find any reversible error. Addressing this same issue in another capital case, <em>People v. Holt </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 619, 661 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 782, 937 P.2d 213] <em>{Holt), </em>we rejected the claim of error, observing that \u201c[u]nless the voir dire by a court is so inadequate that the reviewing court can say that the resulting trial was fundamentally unfair, the manner in which voir dire is conducted is not a basis for reversal.\u201d Defendant asserts that <em>Holt </em>is distinguishable, in that counsel in that case were permitted to participate directly in the voir dire process by asking questions of prospective jurors, whereas in the present case the trial court foreclosed that direct form of participation. As observed <em>ante, </em>however, the trial court did not foreclose counsel from suggesting additional questions to be put to specific prospective jurors, and defense counsel apparently found no need to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Relying principally upon <em>Taylor, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th 1299, defendant insists that the trial court should have made further inquiry into possible racial bias against him. Defendant argues that the court in <em>Taylor </em>found such bias under roughly analogous circumstances and urges that we do so here as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The Court of Appeal in <em>Taylor </em>reviewed applicable federal and state authority (including high court cases relied upon by defendant, <em>Turner v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number><em>Murray </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 28 [90 L.Ed.2d 27, 106 S.Ct. 1683] (Turner) and <em>Mu\u2019Min, supra, </em>500 U.S. 415), concluding that \u201can interracial crime is a \u2018special circumstance\u2019 in which inquiry about racial prejudice must be made.\u201d <em>(Taylor, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1315.) The appellate court proceeded to reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the voir dire in that case \u201cwas improper because the [trial] court preceded some of its questioning (including the voir dire on racial prejudice) with statements that \u2018signaled\u2019 the proper answer. It is not error for a judge to remind prospective jurors that racial prejudice has no place in the courtroom. As Justice Kennedy observed in <em>Mu\u2019Min, </em>a trial judge may choose to ask what information a prospective juror has about a subject, but \u2018the judge can also evaluate impartiality by explaining the trial processes and asking general questions about the juror\u2019s commitment to follow the law and the trial court\u2019s instructions.\u2019 <em>(Mu\u2019Min v. Virginia, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. [451], dis. opn. of Kennedy, J.)\u201d <em>(Taylor, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The court in <em>Taylor </em>continued: \u201cHaving said this, we must also say that the [trial] court should have made further inquiry in the area of possible racial bias against defendant. [][] As we have discussed, the trial judge asked the prospective jurors if any of them had any quarrel with the principle that no one should be found guilty because of race, creed, color, religion or national origin. The judge also asked whether they would put aside any biases and prejudices they may have had. But the court asked no questions designed to elicit whether any juror actually held such bias. In a case such as this, where there is a potential of racial or other invidious prejudice against the defendant, a further inquiry should be made.\u201d <em>(Taylor, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In conclusion, the court in <em>Taylor </em>stated: \u201cThe failure to do so in this case is harmless, for two reasons. First, the trial court repeatedly emphasized the importance of juror neutrality and a fair trial. Second, both counsel were specifically invited to ask the court to conduct further voir dire on any proper subject, including possible racial bias, but were satisfied that it was not necessary to do so.\u201d <em>(Taylor, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The same reasoning applies here. As in <em>Taylor, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th 1299, 1317, even assuming that the trial court should have asked additional questions designed to elicit whether any prospective juror actually held a racial bias, any such error would have been harmless for the reasons described. We cannot say that the voir dire examination that was conducted was \u201cso inadequate that ... the resulting trial was fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>(Holt, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th 619, 661.)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Defendant also asserts that the trial court\u2019s voir dire examination was insufficient to reveal possible biases resulting from exposure to pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>publicity concerning the Subway crimes and defendant\u2019s arrest. Once again, if defense counsel believed that further inquiry was necessary with regard to any particular prospective juror, he could have submitted additional questionnaire inquiries or suggested additional oral questions\u2014and his failure to do so forfeits that claim on appeal. <em>(Avena, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 394, 413.) In any event, as explained <em>post, </em>on the merits there is no basis for defendant\u2019s claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The juror questionnaire contained numerous inquiries related to the issue of pretrial publicity. In addition to asking each prospective juror what, if anything, he or she already had learned about the case or defendant, from what source such information had been obtained, and whether that information made the prospective juror favor one side or the other, the questionnaire asked: \u201c33. What newspapers and periodicals do you read frequently? [SI] (a) What portion(s) do you read? (Front page? Sports? Editorials? Crime stories?) [S[] (b) Do you try to follow major crime stories? (Yes?

Do you try to follow stories about the functioning of the criminal justice system? (Yes? No?) . . . [f] 37. If the court instructs you not to read, view, or discuss any news media coverage of this case, will you follow the court\u2019s instructions? HQ ... H] 41. Do you subscribe to or regularly read any newspaper, or periodicals? If so, please state them . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Defense counsel appended to his motion for attorney-conducted voir dire copies of 12 newspaper articles concerning the Subway crimes, all of which were at that time at least 14 months old. In denying that motion, the trial court observed that it had read each of the completed juror questionnaires and found that \u201cvery, very few, if any of the prospective jurors have detailed memory of this incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Subsequently, the trial court questioned prospective jurors whose questionnaire responses indicated knowledge of defendant\u2019s case. Although defendant characterizes that followup questioning as cursory and incomplete, the record reveals that the court repeatedly probed whether any information obtained would cause the prospective juror to be biased, and each assured the court that he or she would be fair and impartial. For example, defendant highlights one prospective juror who ultimately sat as a juror at the first trial. The juror had indicated in his written questionnaire responses that he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>have no difficulty keeping an open mind, but also noted that he had learned of the case in the newspaper and on television. The trial judge, in followup questioning, observed that the juror had not answered the specific questionnaire inquiry, \u201cWhat, if anything, have you already learned about this case or the defendant?\u201d\u2014and again posed that question to the juror. The juror answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about the defendant. I read it when it first came out in the paper. That\u2019s all. This is close to where I live.\u201d The trial judge asked whether the information received made the juror favor either the prosecution or the defense, and the juror responded, \u201cno.\u201d When the trial judge subsequently asked, \u201cDo you try to follow stories about the functioning of the criminal justice system?,\u201d the juror responded, \u201cI read \u2019em, yeah.\u201d Once again, defense counsel did not request further questioning and, in our view, defense counsel\u2019s conduct was reasonable: the questionnaire responses and further answers to followup questioning by the trial judge dispelled any concern that the juror had been tainted by pretrial publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">As the high court observed in <em>Mu\u2019Min, supra, </em>500 U.S. 415, 427, \u201cwide discretion [is] granted to the trial court in conducting <em>voir dire </em>in the area of pretrial publicity. . . .\u201d Although defendant faults the trial judge for failing to ask specific questions concerning the specific content of media publicity, the trial judge\u2019s failure to do so in the presence of other prospective jurors who had not been exposed to the same material was reasonable, and doing otherwise would have risked exposing the others to the publicity. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 425; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 704, 737 [11 Cal.Rptr.3d 236, 86 P.3d 302] <em>(Cleveland).) </em>Failure to ask such questions in a sequestered voir dire examination is constitutional error only if that failure \u201crender[s] the defendant\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>(Mu\u2019Min, supra, </em>500 U.S. 415, 426.) On this record, in which relatively mild publicity was at least 14 months old, thereby minimizing its impact (see <em>Dennis, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 468, 524 [noting, in context of change-of-venue determination, that passage of time can dispel the prejudicial effect of pretrial publicity]), and where defense counsel failed to ask the court to pose any additional question to any prospective juror, defendant cannot establish that the resulting guilt phase trial was fundamentally unfair. Indeed, as we have observed, \u201c \u2018The failure to exhaust peremptories is a strong indication \u201cthat the jurors were fair, and that the defense itself so concluded.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As explained <em>ante, </em>in view of the circumstance that after exercising only 14 of his 20 peremptory challenges, counsel ended up with a jury that hung seven to five on the issue of penalty, there appears to be no reason to question defense counsel\u2019s apparent conclusion that the jurors would be fair to defendant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>B. <em>Guilt Phase Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">1. <em>Exclusion of evidence of third party culpability and impeachment evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred by excluding his proffered evidence of third party culpability and impeachment evidence concerning prosecution witnesses Williams and Aldridge. The proffered evidence was as follows. First, approximately 10 days after defendant was arrested, Williams and Aldridge were stopped and arrested by the Beverly Hills police at 1:30 a.m. (approximately the same time as the Subway crimes), and subsequently each was convicted of a misdemeanor, possessing a concealed handgun. Second, defendant asserts that the trial court excluded evidence of a police report that, according to defendant, contained information that a civilian witness\u2014one \u201cRalph Dudley\u201d\u2014reported to a police officer that he had seen a gray Mustang (like Williams\u2019s car) in the alley behind the Subway shop at the time of the crimes. As explained <em>post, </em>we conclude that the trial court did not err in excluding evidence of the handgun conviction. Moreover, because the appellate record does not support defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court \u201cexcluded\u201d any police-report evidence, we must reject that aspect of the claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">a. <em>Evidence that Williams and Aldridge suffered convictions for possession of a concealed handgun</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Defense counsel sought to introduce evidence of Williams\u2019s conviction for possession of a concealed handgun for, as counsel explained, \u201cdual purposes\u201d: first, as evidence of third party culpability in the Subway crimes and, second, as impeachment of Williams\u2019s credibility. The trial court ruled against introduction of the evidence for either purpose, reasoning, with regard to third party culpability, that the evidence was inadmissible under our decisions in <em>People v. Sandoval </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 155 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 342, 841 P.2d 862] <em>(Sandoval), </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcala </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 742 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 842 P.2d 1192] <em>(Alcala), </em>but that the court would reconsider that determination \u201csubject to other evidence coming in.\u201d Turning to the use of the proffered handgun conviction as impeachment evidence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>after hearing an offer of proof concerning the proposed testimony of Williams (which set forth, in broad outline, his subsequent testimony described <em>ante), </em>the trial court reasoned that, although the misdemeanor conviction \u201cmay [reflect] a crime of moral turpitude,\u201d whatever \u201cslight relevance\u201d and probative value the proposed evidence had with respect to Williams\u2019s veracity was outweighed by the prospect of \u201cconfusing the issues to the jury, especially in light of the third party culpability aspect, even though I would instruct the jury [not to consider the evidence for any purpose other than impeachment].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Defense counsel subsequently made the same \u201cdual purposes\u201d motion concerning Aldridge\u2019s handgun conviction, and the trial court, after hearing a further offer of proof (which set forth, in broad outline, Aldridge\u2019s subsequent testimony described <em>ante), </em>denied the motion as to both proposed uses of the proffered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">As explained <em>post, </em>the trial court rulings were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">With regard to third party culpability, we note that <em>Sandoval, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th 155, 176, and <em>Alcala, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th 742, 792, both followed <em>People v. Hall </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 826 [226 Cal.Rptr. 112, 718 P.2d 99] <em>(Hall). </em>In <em>Hall, </em>we recognized that third party culpability evidence is admissible if it is \u201ccapable of raising a reasonable doubt of [the] defendant\u2019s guilt,\u201d but also observed; \u201c[W]e do not require that <em>any </em>evidence, however remote, must be admitted to show a third party\u2019s possible culpability. . . . [E]vidence of mere motive or opportunity to commit the crime in another person, without more, will not suffice to raise a reasonable doubt about a defendant\u2019s guilt: <em>there must be direct or circumstantial evidence linking the third person to the actual perpetration of the crime.\u201d (Hall, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 833, italics added.) As we also explained in <em>Hall, </em>in making these assessments \u201ccourts should simply treat third-party culpability evidence like any other evidence: if relevant it is admissible ([Evid. Code,] \u00a7 350) unless its probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk of undue delay, prejudice, or confusion ([Evid. Code,] \u00a7 352).\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>(Hall, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 834.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">In reviewing an assessment made by a trial court under Evidence Code section 352, we shall not disturb the ruling on appeal absent a finding that the trial court abused its discretion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 334, 372-373 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 272, 28 P.3d 34] <em>(Lewis).) </em>We find no such abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>of discretion here. The crimes for which Williams and Aldridge were arrested approximately 10 days after defendant\u2019s arrest had at most very slight probative value concerning the issue of third party culpability. Contrary to defendant\u2019s claim that this evidence supported an \u201cobvious inference . . . that Williams and Aldridge were on a robbery spree which may have included the Subway . . . crimes,\u201d the proffered evidence did not directly or even circumstantially link Williams or Aldridge to the Subway crimes. <em>Their </em>firearms were shown by ballistics evidence <em>not </em>to have fired the bullets discharged during the Subway shootings. By contrast, as we have noted, defendant\u2019s gun was determined to have fired the bullets that killed the Subway victims. In view of this evidence, the trial court reasonably concluded that the proffered arrest evidence was insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt that Williams and/or Aldridge, instead of defendant, committed the Subway crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The trial court\u2019s ruling concerning impeachment also was correct. It is clear, as defendant argues, that Williams and Aldridge were key prosecution witnesses and that defendant had a strong interest in impeaching them, both in order to blunt their damaging testimony <em>and </em>in order to promote his own theory that they, not he, were the perpetrators of the Subway crimes. We also agree with defendant that the misdemeanor convictions suffered by Williams and Aldridge reflected a crime of moral turpitude and therefore were relevant to the witnesses\u2019 honesty and veracity. (See <em>People v. Wheeler </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 284, 295-296 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 841 P.2d 938].) Admission of such evidence, however, is subject to the trial court\u2019s discretion to exclude it under Evidence Code section 352. As noted <em>ante, </em>a trial court\u2019s broad latitude in this respect will not be upset on appeal absent a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>(Lewis, supra, 26 </em>Cal.4th 334, 372-373.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">We discern no such abuse of discretion. As the trial court observed, the slight relevance and probative value of the evidence with respect to the veracity of Williams and Aldridge were outweighed by the prospect of confusing the issues\u2014in particular, the jury might use that evidence not only with regard to veracity, but also (despite the trial court\u2019s possible limiting instructions concerning third party culpability evidence) for a purpose that the court had determined would be improper under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">We similarly reject defendant\u2019s various claims that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the proffered evidence violated his federal constitutional rights to present a defense, to confront and cross-examine witnesses, and to receive a reliable determination on the charged capital offense. There was no error under state law, and we have long observed that, \u201c[a]s a general matter, the ordinary rules of evidence do not impermissibly infringe on the accused\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>[state or federal constitutional] right to present a defense.\u201d <em>(Hall, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 834; see also <em>Lewis, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at pp. 373-374.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Finally, even if we were to assume that the trial court erred in excluding the proffered evidence, any state law error would be harmless under the \u201creasonable probability\u201d test of <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243] <em>(Watson) </em>and, indeed, any federal constitutional error would be harmless under the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d test of <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 23-24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824] <em>(Chapman). </em>Strong evidence linked <em>defendant </em>to the crimes. Defendant had been employed at the Subway shop and knew its procedures, the location of the safes and the backdoor exit, and the general layout of the premises. He needed money and had talked of robbing the shop and killing its staff\u2014 indeed, he even admitted discussing the robbery with Williams and Aldridge in the context of pointing out problems with their own alleged suggestions for the robbery. James, after initially failing to do so, identified defendant as the man she had seen in the shop immediately prior to the shootings. Defendant conceded being at the scene of the crime immediately after the shootings (and indeed while one of the victims still was alive), and his fingerprints were found on a bag containing the final purchase entered into the shop\u2019s register. The bullets that killed the two Subway victims were fired from defendant\u2019s gun. On the day after the crimes, defendant attempted to pay hundreds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>of dollars of rent in cash and also offered a $25 deposit in $1 bills. He then bragged, both to his friend Aldridge and to his coworker Ostrander, about his role in the robbery and killings. In view of this evidence, even if the jury had been informed of the handgun convictions suffered by Williams and Aldridge (and indeed, even if the jury were to credit defendant\u2019s testimony and infer from it that Williams, and possibly Aldridge as well, also was present during the crimes), we cannot conclude that would have raised a reasonable doubt among the jurors regarding <em>defendant\u2019s </em>guilt of the Subway shop crimes. We conclude that a different result would not have been reasonably probable absent the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the proffered evidence and, indeed, that any alleged error would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">b. <em>Evidence that a witness saw Williams\u2019s car at the scene of the crime</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Los Angeles Police Detective Peggy Moseley assisted in the crime investigation and assembled case-related materials in a so-called murder book\u2014a compilation of reports, including leads and tips, relating to the Subway shop crimes. Moseley, called as a defense witness, testified that the book totaled approximately 1,200 pages contained in three volumes, and that she periodically reviewed the book \u201cto sift information\u201d and \u201cfollow up on clues and evidence\u201d in the case. Defense counsel asked: \u201cIn doing so do you recall receiving or becoming aware of any information that someone had imparted to the Los Angeles Police Department the fact that there had been a gray Mustang lurking in the area of this particular Subway sandwich shop?\u201d At that point, the prosecutor successfully objected on hearsay grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Defense counsel thereafter asked: \u201cDid you personally conduct any interviews with anyone who indicated the presence of a gray Mustang at the scene?\u201d Detective Moseley replied, \u201cNot that I recall.\u201d Defense counsel asked: \u201cDo you recall a witness by the name of Ralph Dudley?\u201d Moseley replied, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d Defense counsel made no offer of proof to establish that any admissible evidence supported an assertion that \u201cRalph Dudley\u201d or any other witness had reported observing a gray Mustang near the crime scene, and instead stated that he had no further questions. After brief cross-examination, Moseley was excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Defendant now claims that the trial court erroneously \u201cgranted the prosecutor\u2019s motion to exclude\u201d this evidence and \u201cprevented defense counsel from questioning Detective Moseley about Ralph Dudley\u2019s sighting of the gray Mustang in the alley behind the Subway.\u201d The record, however, does not support this characterization. Instead it shows simply that counsel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>allowed to question Detective Moseley about \u201ca witness by the name of Ralph Dudley\u201d and that the detective did not recall any such witness. Nor does the record support defendant\u2019s contention that \u201cRalph Dudley,\u201d or anyone other than defendant, made a \u201csighting\u201d of a gray Mustang at the crime scene.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Because there was no offer of proof in this regard, there is no basis in the appellate record upon which to conclude that the \u201cmurder book\u201d contained a report concerning an observation by \u201cRalph Dudley,\u201d or anyone else, of such a car near the scene of the crimes and at the time they were committed. Accordingly, we reject defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erroneously \u201cexcluded\u201d any such evidence at the guilt phase of the trial. As far as we can discern, no such evidence was offered or excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In any event, assuming that the challenged evidence in fact did exist and that the trial court (erroneously) excluded it, for the reasons discussed in part II.A.l.a., any error would have been harmless under both the <em>Watson </em>standard and the <em>Chapman </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">2. <em>Admission of testimony concerning probable relative positions of the victims and the shooter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Christopher Rogers, M.D., a board-certified forensic pathologist and deputy medical examiner employed by the Los Angeles County Coroner\u2019s Office, testified that he had performed \u201chundreds\u201d of autopsies involving gunshot wounds and had been qualified as an expert witness on approximately 200 occasions. Dr. Rogers testified that, in his opinion, each victim died of a bullet wound to the top of the head fired at very close range or while the firearm was in direct contact with the victim. He also described the trajectories of the shots. Defense counsel did not object to this evidence, and defendant does not now assert any error with respect to that aspect of Dr. Rogers\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Dr. Rogers further testified\u2014over defense objection\u2014concerning the probable respective positions of the shooter and the two victims at the time of the shootings. On direct examination, Dr. Rogers was asked to consider the height of defendant (five feet 10 to 11 inches), the height of victim James White (six feet one inch), and the location and trajectory of the entry wound in White\u2019s forehead, and to consider three possible scenarios relating to that victim. First, assuming White had been standing, Dr. Rogers testified that the shooter\u2019s hand might have been positioned essentially even with and slightly above the victim\u2019s head\u2014which would have meant that the shooter either had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>held the gun over his head or stood on something so as to be higher than the victim\u2019s head. Second, assuming White had been lying on the floor at the time of the shooting, Dr. Rogers testified that, based upon the physical evidence, the shooter might have been lying on the floor or crouched next to him. Third, assuming that White had been shot while he was kneeling on the floor, Dr. Rogers testified that shooter would have been standing next to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Dr. Rogers conceded that each of the three described posture scenarios was possible, but the first two would have meant that the shooter had been in an awkward position. Hence, in his opinion, those scenarios were less likely than the third theory, that victim White was kneeling next to the shooter, who would have been standing and holding the gun \u201cin a somewhat natural position\u201d at waist level. On cross-examination, Dr. Rogers acknowledged that, based upon the evidence, there were a \u201cmultitude of different positions that could have been assumed by the decedent and the person inflicting the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">During closing argument, the prosecutor asserted that Dr. Rogers\u2019s testimony corroborated Ostrander\u2019s description of defendant\u2019s bragging about how he had carried out the shootings and that James White must have been shot while he was on his knees, \u201cpraying for his life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Defendant now contends that this aspect of Dr. Rogers\u2019s testimony improperly was admitted and requires reversal of the guilt phase judgment for the following reasons: (1) the expert testimony was not relevant and in any event was not the proper subject of expert testimony because the jurors were capable of drawing their own conclusions about the manner of the shootings; (2) even if the testimony was relevant and helpful to the jury, the prosecution failed to lay a proper foundation for that expert opinion; and (3) the trial court\u2019s admission of this testimony was an abuse of discretion under Evidence Code section 352 and violated his state and federal constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">A trial court\u2019s determination to admit expert evidence will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing that the court abused its discretion in a manner that resulted in a miscarriage of justice. <em>(People v. Catlin </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 81, 131 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 31, 26 P.3d 357]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodrigues </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 235, 885 P.2d 1].) Here, there was no such abuse of discretion. As the trial court recognized, the challenged evidence was relevant to prove one of the prosecution\u2019s theories of the homicides\u2014that of premeditated and deliberated murder. An execution-style shooting of a kneeling victim clearly supported that theory and was relevant to prove it. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolin </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 297, 320 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>412, 956 P.2d 374].) The challenged evidence also was relevant to corroborate the testimony of prosecution witnesses Williams, Aldridge, and Ostrander.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">A closer question is whether the testimony properly was the subject of expert opinion evidence. Evidence Code section 801, subdivision (a) limits such evidence to that which is \u201c[rjelated to a subject. . . sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact.\u201d As defendant observes, in considering this testimony the trial court stated: \u201cI have to say that based upon the proffered offer of proof that the People have made that it doesn\u2019t take too much expertise to render an opinion as to the position of the bodies based upon the medical evidence. In fact, it is something that <em>almost </em>a lay person, given these facts, could render.\u201d (Italics added.) The trial court ultimately allowed the expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">We find no error. Victim James White was discovered lying facedown in a pool of blood on the Subway shop\u2019s floor. As the People observe, unassisted by Dr. Rogers\u2019s challenged testimony and \u201c[rjelying on intuition alone, the jurors might reasonably have had no idea how his fatal wound was inflicted,\u201d but Dr. Rogers\u2019s testimony provided the jurors with an informed context, letting them know that, \u201calthough the shooter might have assumed any number of positions when necessarily placing the gun perpendicular to the crown of the victim\u2019s head, the least awkward position would be that of the victim kneeling.\u201d This evidence indeed would \u201cassist the trier of fact\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 801, subd. (a)), both in determining whether the killing was premeditated and deliberated, and in assessing the credibility of the prosecution witnesses who testified concerning defendant\u2019s precrime statements that he planned to execute witnesses and his postcrime statements that he shot the kneeling victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Nor do we find that the prosecution failed to lay a proper foundation for the challenged aspect of Dr. Rogers\u2019s testimony. The witness clearly was qualified to testify concerning gunshot wounds and to render the quite limited opinion that he eventually proffered: that, in view of the location of the wounds and their trajectories, of the three general scenarios presented\u2014the shooter standing next to a standing victim, the shooter lying or crouched near a lying victim, or the shooter standing near a kneeling victim\u2014the last was the least awkward and most likely. Contrary to defendant\u2019s suggestions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>such testimony could be given only by one qualified as a crime scene reconstructionist, the opinion evidence here at issue did not require that the witness have expertise <em>beyond </em>that which was shown\u2014that is, that he was an experienced pathologist who possessed extensive familiarity with gunshot wounds. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding Dr. Rogers qualified to give the challenged opinion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Farnam </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 107, 162 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 47 P.3d 988] [\u201cError regarding a witness\u2019s qualifications as an expert will be found only if the evidence shows that the witness 1 \u201c <em>1clearly lacks </em>qualification as an expert.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davenport </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1171, 1207 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 800, 906 P.2d 1068].)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court should have concluded that the challenged testimony was more prejudicial than probative, and hence that its introduction was barred under Evidence Code section 352 and violated defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights. Evidence is not \u201cunduly prejudicial\u201d under the Evidence Code merely because it strongly implicates a defendant and casts him or her in a bad light, or merely because the defendant contests that evidence and points to allegedly contrary evidence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Instead, undue prejudice is that which \u201cuniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against a party as an individual, while having only slight probative value with regard to the issues.\u201d <em>(People v. Crittenden </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 134 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 474, 885 P.2d 887] (Crittenden); see also <em>People v. Garceau </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 140, 178 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 664, 862 P.2d 664].) As noted <em>ante, </em>the challenged evidence was highly relevant to the prosecution\u2019s theory of premeditated and deliberated murder and also relevant as corroboration of the three prosecution witnesses who testified concerning defendant\u2019s stated plan to execute witnesses and his boasts of having shot the victims in the head. Evidence of deliberate, premeditated killing often is very disturbing, but the jury properly was instructed not to be influenced by passion, sympathy, or prejudice and to conscientiously consider and weigh the evidence in applying the law. The trial court acted within its discretion in finding that the probative value of the evidence outweighed the risk of prejudice. <em>(Crittenden, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 134 [finding that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>\u201creasonably could determine that the probative value of the [crime scene photographs of victims] outweighed their potentially prejudicial effect\u201d].) We discern no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">3. <em>\u201cReadback\u201d of testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">During guilt phase deliberations, the jury sent a note to the court requesting that three portions of the testimony be \u201cre-read\u201d: (1) The prosecution\u2019s fingerprint expert\u2019s testimony \u201cregarding the position of fingerprints on the bag. Also, the number of prints and whether put on at the same time.\u201d (2) \u201cTestimony of [defendant] regarding whether Tai [Williams] was home when [defendant] returned home on Sunday morning.\u201d (3) \u201cWhether [defendant] had the gun Sunday morning after he returned home.\u201d After reading the jury\u2019s communication to the parties in open court (but without the jury present), the trial judge observed that, as to the second request, the reporter had advised that there was no such testimony. Counsel for both parties concurred, and the court stated it would so advise the jury. Concerning the other two requests, the court commented: \u201cI take it all the testimony has been found as to those items and the jury and alternates will be read those in the jury room.\u201d The court then asked, \u201cNow, does counsel wish to be present during the reading or rereading of the testimony?\u201d Counsel for both parties answered in the negative and, after defense counsel consulted with defendant, defendant also stated he did not wish to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The jury returned to the courtroom, and the trial court explained that, \u201cafter a thorough search, and after discussion with counsel, I can tell you right now that there was no testimony of [defendant] regarding whether Tai [Williams] was home when [defendant] returned home on Sunday morning.\u201d The court advised the jury that the other two requested items would be read back. At the trial court\u2019s direction, the reporter thereafter entered the jury room, spent approximately 20 minutes reading back testimony, and then left the jury room, at which time deliberations resumed. The reporter\u2019s transcript reveals that the testimony read back to the jury in response to the jury\u2019s third question (\u201cWhether [defendant] had the gun Sunday morning after he returned home\u201d) was the following: \u201cVolume 11, page 1176, line 19 to line 24 [(an excerpt from defense counsel\u2019s redirect examination of defendant) and] page 1069, line 23 to page 1073, line 17 [(from the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination of defendant)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Defendant contends the trial court\u2019s statement concerning the first and third questions\u2014\u201cI take it all the testimony has been found as to those items and the jury and alternates will be read those in the jury room\u201d\u2014reveals that the trial court \u201clet the court reporter decide which testimony was responsive to the jurors\u2019 questions\u201d and failed to participate in the planning and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>supervision of the readback. Thus, defendant argues, the trial court abdicated control over the readback process in violation of section 1138, which provides that, when a jury requests a readback of testimony, \u201cthe information required must be given in the presence of, or after notice to, the prosecuting attorney, and the defendant or his counsel, or after they have been called.\u201d Relying upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Litteral </em>(1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 790, 794 [145 Cal.Rptr. 186] (Litteral) (finding reversible error under section 1138 and admonishing trial courts to exercise \u201cstrong supervision\u201d over such matters), defendant argues that reversal is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">As we recently observed in <em>Roldan, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th 646, 729, <em>Litteral, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.3d 790\u2014a case in which a trial court <em>refused </em>a jury\u2019s request for a readback of testimony\u2014is distinguishable. Moreover, as we also observed in <em>Roldan, </em>a claim of error in the selection of the testimony read back to a jury, as well as any alleged impropriety or failure to comply with section 1138, is waived by defense counsel\u2019s failure to object at the time the trial court directed the readback. <em>(Roldan, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at pp. 729-730.) But even if we were to overlook the absence of an objection, we conclude defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Viewing the record in context, we question whether the record supports defendant\u2019s theory that the trial court let the court reporter decide which testimony was responsive to the jurors\u2019 questions. As the People observe, within a few minutes of the trial court\u2019s comment made outside the presence of the jury (\u201cI take it all the testimony has been found as to those items . . .\u201d), the court, in addressing the jury, implied that, with regard to its second request, the court <em>personally </em>had determined that no such testimony existed: \u201cAfter a thorough search, and after discussion with counsel, I can tell you right now that there was no [such] testimony . . . .\u201d In view of the court\u2019s latter comment, the People contend it is doubtful that the trial court abdicated its responsibility concerning the first or third item requested for readback. Defendant, on the other hand, argues that, when viewed in context, the trial court was not representing that it had read <em>any </em>of the prior testimony under consideration, and that its comment merely relayed to the jury the prior \u201crepresentations [made to the court by] counsel and the court reporter that this portion of the testimony requested does not exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">We need not resolve this fact-specific dispute, because it is well established that \u201c \u2018[a] conviction will not be reversed for a violation of section 1138 unless prejudice is shown\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Jenkins </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 1027 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 997 P.2d 1044] <em>(Jenkins)) </em>and, as explained <em>post, </em>in the present case there can be no such showing: if the trial court failed to monitor the readback of testimony as closely as it should have, any resulting error would have been harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Defendant argues that too much testimony was read back in response to the jury\u2019s third question, some of which was \u201cnot relevant to the jurors\u2019 request,\u201d and that other \u201crelevant and responsive\u201d testimony was withheld. As the People observe, the material that defendant now asserts should <em>not </em>have been part of the material that was read back spanned three and one-half transcript pages of the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of defendant. All of that challenged material directly related to the time period concerning which the jury inquired\u2014namely, <em>\u201cafter </em>[defendant] returned home\u201d to Tai Williams\u2019s apartment on Sunday morning. The readback material established that defendant was in Williams\u2019s apartment from approximately 2:20 a.m. to 6:00 a.m., during which time he was fearful that Williams might kill him, and\u2014in the sole passage that defendant concedes properly was read back to the jury\u2014that defendant had his firearm with him at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Defendant claims that parts of the passages read back, although pertinent to the time period concerning which the jury inquired, included material not directly related to the jury\u2019s specific question. Some of the questions and answers read back to the jury concerned whether defendant, during that time, thought about providing help for the two severely wounded victims whom he had observed at the Subway crime scene or considered calling the police. The material also contained a passage reflecting that, after defendant at one point stated he had been tired upon returning to the apartment in the early morning hours, the prosecutor asked, \u201cKilling people wears you out, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Defendant argues that \u201c[t]he repetition of this cross-examination, and particularly the gratuitous remark about killing people,\u201d was improper, and that \u201c[t]his was not a balanced presentation of relevant testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">As we have observed, section 1138 \u201cdoes not forbid giving the jury more than it requests so [that] it also receives the context\u201d of the testimony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hillhouse </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 469, 506 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 45, 40 P.3d 754], italics added.) But even assuming that some of the testimony should not have been included in the readback, a violation of section 1138 ordinarily will not result in reversal of a conviction unless prejudice is shown <em>(Jenkins, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th 900, 1027)\u2014and here there was no prejudice. Earlier in the trial, the jury properly had heard the entire cross-examination of defendant, many parts of which forcefully emphasized the same points of which defendant now complains. In view of the substantial other evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, it simply is not plausible that the <em>repetition </em>of some of those passages in response to the jury\u2019s request for a readback of testimony contributed significantly to the jury\u2019s verdict. Any state law error in this regard would have been harmless under the \u201creasonable probability\u201d test of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 836 and, indeed, any alleged federal constitutional error also was harmless under the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d test of <em>Chapman, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23-24.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Defendant finally contends that in one other respect\u2014regarding the brief excerpt that was read back from defense counsel\u2019s redirect examination\u2014\u201cthe readback process resulted in the jury not receiving testimony which was relevant and responsive to the request.\u201d We disagree. In that readback passage, defense counsel stated: \u201cIn response to [the prosecutor\u2019s] questions, you have indicated for us that you did have the gun in the apartment in the period between [two o\u2019clock] or three o\u2019clock in the morning and somewhere around six o\u2019clock in the morning when you left.\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d But, defendant complains, the readback testimony did not include the very next question and answer posed on redirect examination: \u201cDid you have it during the hours of, say, [11:00] o\u2019clock on Saturday night and the time when you returned to that apartment?\u201d \u201cNo, sir.\u201d Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion that failure to read back the latter passage was error, this testimony appears to have been outside the scope of the jury\u2019s third question, which focused upon whether defendant had his gun in his possession <em>after </em>he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>returned to Williams\u2019s apartment. The jury did not ask whether defendant had possession of his gun immediately prior to his arrival at the apartment. Defendant fails to point to any other evidence pertaining to the jury\u2019s question but not included in the readback testimony. In sum, we perceive no error and, in any event, no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">4. <em>Reasonable doubt and burden of proof instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Defendant claims that the standard \u201creasonable doubt\u201d instruction (CALJIC No. 2.90), which at the time of trial in this case employed phrases such as \u201cmoral evidence\u201d and \u201cmoral certainty,\u201d is \u201cincomprehensible to a modem jury\u201d and that its use here compels reversal of the judgment. We repeatedly have rejected this claim (e.g., <em>People v. Maury </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 342, 429 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 561, 68 P.3d 1] <em>(Maury); People v. Seaton </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 598, 668 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 441, 28 P.3d 175]; <em>People v. Ray </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 313, 346-347 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 296, 914 P.2d 846]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jennings </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 334, 385-386 [279 Cal.Rptr. 780, 807 P.2d 1009] <em>(Jennings)) </em>and do so here as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">We conclude likewise concerning defendant\u2019s related claim that the combination of two other standard instmctions (CALJIC Nos. 2.01 and 8.83, both relating to circumstantial evidence) improperly lightened the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof. We repeatedly have rejected similar challenges to those instmctions and do so here as well. (E.g., <em>Maury, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th 342, 428; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hughes </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 346-347 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 401, 39 P.3d 432]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Millwee </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 96, 160 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 954 P.2d 990]; see also <em>Jennings, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 334, 385-386 [rejecting joint challenge to CALJIC Nos. 2.90 and 2.01].)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">5. <em>Asserted cumulative error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Defendant claims that cumulative error during jury selection and at the guilt and special circumstances phase of the trial requires reversal of the guilt phase judgment and the special circumstances findings. We have found no error, but, even assuming error (and, indeed, cumulative error), for the reasons set forth in part II.B.l.a. any such improprieties would have been harmless under the \u201creasonable probability\u201d test of <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 836, and even under the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d test of <em>Chapman, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">C. <em>Penalty Phase Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">As noted earlier, the initial penalty phase proceedings ended in a mistrial after the jury deadlocked seven to five in favor of imposing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>sentence of death. Nine months later, after the trial court relieved defendant\u2019s former trial counsel due to a conflict and appointed replacement counsel, the court empanelled a new jury to retry the penalty phase. From that jury\u2019s verdict and the resulting judgment of death, defendant raises the following claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">1. <em>Asserted errors during jury selection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Reprising claims similar to those raised and rejected with regard to the guilt and special circumstances phase of the trial <em>(ante, </em>pt. H.A.), defendant raises a number of challenges to the penalty phase jury-selection process. We do not find any of them meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Defendant suggests the trial court was unaware of its discretion to conduct oral voir dire as necessary and to allow attorney participation and questioning as appropriate. The record does not support defendant\u2019s position. At the retried penalty proceedings (as in the first trial), the court made it clear that counsel were free to seek to question the prospective jurors. Specifically, in response to questions whether, with respect to the voir dire procedures, if there arose \u201csome follow-up questions that counsel may deem appropriate based on the questionnaire, do we ask to approach the bench?\u201d and \u201cMay we ask to approach if we deem it appropriate?,\u201d the court responded, \u201cOf course\u201d and also advised counsel, \u201cI may or may not ask if you wish to inquire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Nor does the record support defendant\u2019s claim that the voir dire examination conducted by the trial court in the retried penalty proceedings was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">The questionnaire employed at the first trial was reused after being modified slightly to eliminate two subquestions concerning each prospective juror\u2019s ability to return a guilty verdict or a finding of special circumstances\u2014issues previously resolved by the first jury. As in the first trial, the judge conducted an in-court voir dire examination of every prospective juror and asked each whether he or she wished to change any response made in the written questionnaire. The court further questioned all prospective jurors who failed to respond to any questionnaire inquiry or who gave ambiguous, conflicting, or otherwise problematic answers to questionnaire inquiries. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Finally, the court also asked each prospective juror two questions concerning his or her attitude concerning the death penalty.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Defendant claims this process was inadequate because the questionnaire was lengthy, its administration was rushed, and the trial court conducted what defendant characterizes as a hasty and superficial voir dire examination that did not produce information sufficient for defense counsel to make (and for the court to rule upon) challenges for cause. Defendant additionally argues that the court\u2019s voir dire examination was defective insofar as it related to potential racial prejudice among potential jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Because defendant failed to object to or suggest modifications to the questionnaire, he has forfeited any challenges to its length and allegedly undue complexity or any other aspect of its content. <em>(Avena, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 394, 413.) Even if we were to overlook that procedural failing, we would find defendant\u2019s challenges lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s arguments, there is no evidence that prospective jurors were unduly rushed in completing the questionnaire. They appear to have been given the questionnaire at approximately 11:30 a.m. and were told that they could return it at noon, or 1:30 p.m. at the latest. Resulting questionnaire inquiries that any prospective juror failed to answer were addressed by the judge during the voir dire examination of that prospective juror and, as in the first trial, in some instances the exchange disclosed that the prospective juror had not been confused by the question, but simply had left responses blank in lieu of responding \u201cno\u201d or \u201cinapplicable.\u201d In other instances, the exchange revealed that the prospective juror needed more information before answering.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Although the trial court declared that counsel were free to seek to pose followup questions to the prospective jurors, defense counsel did not attempt to do so. At the end of the selection process, instead of stating dissatisfaction with the final jury, counsel announced that defendant \u201caccepted] the jury as constituted\u201d\u2014indicating defense counsel\u2019s apparent satisfaction with the voir dire examination and with the resulting jury. We conclude that the described questionnaire sufficiently probed the prospective jurors\u2019 backgrounds and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>views in numerous relevant areas and, together with the trial court\u2019s followup questions, provided an adequate basis upon which the parties were able to exercise challenges for cause as well as peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">We reach the same conclusion concerning defendant\u2019s specific claim that the voir dire process inadequately probed the possible racial bias of prospective jurors. As observed earlier, the questionnaire informed the prospective jurors that a party or witness \u201cmay come from a different nationality, racial or religious group,\u201d and it asked: \u201cWould that fact affect your judgment or the weight and credibility you would give to his or her testimony?\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In addition, in response to defense counsel\u2019s request that the court\u2019s voir dire examination \u201caddress the . . . fact that my client is Black and the fact that the victims in this case are White,\u201d the trial court agreed to do so, thereafter addressing the group of prospective jurors as follows: \u201cNow, one thing I will mention is the defendant, as you can see, is an African-American. The victims in this case are White. Now race is not an issue at a penalty trial and is not to be considered by you. [|] Is there anyone on the panel before me that would ignore this dictate? [f] Negative response.\u201d The trial court repeated the essence of this admonition and question at least five more times prior to the conclusion of the voir dire process.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Defendant relies upon <em>Turner, supra, </em>476 U.S. 28, 36-37, in which the high court reversed a death judgment of a Black defendant convicted of killing a White victim, because the trial court erroneously had declined to ask <em>any </em>question during the voir dire examination concerning possible racial prejudices of the prospective jurors. Here, by contrast, the trial court probed that issue on two occasions, once in the questionnaire and again\u2014at defense counsel\u2019s specific request\u2014during the voir dire examination of the prospective jurors. If defense counsel believed that further inquiry was necessary, he could have submitted additional questionnaire inquiries or suggested additional oral questions. Again, defense counsel\u2019s failure to do so forfeits this aspect of the claim on appeal. <em>(Avena, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 394, 413.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">In any event, even if we were to overlook defendant\u2019s failure to preserve the issue, we would not find any reversible error. The voir dire examination concerning possible racial prejudice was not \u201cso inadequate that ... the resulting trial was fundamentally unfair . . . .\u201d <em>(Holt, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th 619, 661.) Even if we were to accept defendant\u2019s position that the group questions posed by the trial court to the various panels were not the most effective means of ferreting out possible racial prejudices and that the court should have inquired further concerning possible racial bias (see <em>Taylor, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th 1299, 1316), we would conclude that the court\u2019s failure to do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>here was harmless. As in <em>Taylor, </em>\u201cthe trial court repeatedly emphasized the importance of juror neutrality and a fair trial,\u201d and \u201cboth counsel were specifically invited to ask the court to conduct further voir dire on any proper subject, including possible racial bias, but were satisfied that it was not necessary to do so.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1317.)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">2. <em>Evidence that Williams and Aldridge were convicted of charges of concealment of a handgun and that a witness observed Williams\u2019s car at the scene of the crime</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">As noted <em>ante </em>in connection with the guilt phase of the trial, defendant claimed that the trial court improperly excluded evidence that, approximately 10 days after defendant\u2019s arrest, Williams and Aldridge were arrested in the early morning hours in Beverly Hills and subsequently were convicted of carrying concealed handguns in their car. (Pt. II.B.L, <em>ante.) </em>Defendant asserts that the court made the \u201csame ruling\u201d at the penalty phase retrial, thereby \u201cprohibiting any defense questioning concerning Tai [Williams\u2019s] and Tommy [Aldridge]\u2019s gun possession arrests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The reporter\u2019s transcript page cited by defendant for the proposition that the trial court made such a ruling during the retrial of the penalty phase contains no such passage or ruling, nor does our review of the record of the penalty phase retrial reveal such a ruling. Indeed, the record reveals that defense counsel was permitted to cross-examine Aldridge concerning the essence of the firearm-concealment charges, resulting in the witness\u2019s acknowledgment that he and Williams had carried their guns with them to Beverly Hills and, the witness conceded, \u201cran into problems with having our guns illegally stored in the car.\u201d Accordingly, we reject the claim that the trial court excluded any such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Even assuming that the trial court improperly excluded evidence related to the concealed handguns, for the reasons discussed in part II.B.l.a., <em>ante </em>and because defense counsel in fact cross-examined Aldridge on the subject and elicited the testimony described, any state law error was harmless under the \u201creasonable possibility\u201d standard of <em>People v. Brown </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 432, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>448 [250 Cal.Rptr. 604, 758 P.2d 1135] <em>(Brown), </em>and any federal constitutional error was nonprejudicial under the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard of <em>Chapman, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Defendant also reprises his claim that the trial court improperly excluded evidence that witness \u201cRalph Dudley\u201d observed Williams\u2019s car at the scene of the crime. As explained <em>post, </em>the record shows that, at the retried penalty proceedings (as at the first trial), defendant never <em>offered </em>evidence concerning \u201cRalph Dudley\u201d or any other such witness and the trial court never excluded any such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The record reveals that during cross-examination of Aldridge, defense counsel established that the witness remembered testifying at the preliminary examination, and counsel then proceeded to read aloud a question that had been asked of Aldridge at that time: \u201cQuestion: Did you know that Tai Williams\u2019s car was seen in the alley the night of the murders\u2014.\u201d At that point the prosecutor successfully objected on the ground that defense counsel\u2019s inquiry \u201cassumes facts not in evidence.\u201d When defense counsel immediately thereafter asked the witness where he was at 1:30 a.m. on the day of the crimes, the prosecutor approached the bench and, outside the presence of the jury, objected to \u201cthis entire line of questioning. This is dealing with third party . . . culpability. That\u2019s where he is going . . . .\u201d Defense counsel made an offer of proof that defendant would testify (as he had at the first trial) that he was at the crime scene shortly after the shootings and saw Williams\u2019s distinctive gray Mustang departing from the alley behind the Subway shop, and that defendant \u201cbelieves that Tommy Aldridge was with Tai Williams in the car that night.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s offer of proof did not mention any witness named \u201cRalph Dudley\u201d or an alleged sighting by that witness or by any such other witness (other than defendant himself) of a gray Mustang at the crime scene at the time of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The trial court, citing <em>Hall, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 826, and <em>Alcala, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th 742, agreed that defendant \u201cdoes have a right to present evidence of third party culpability if it is capable of raising a reasonable doubt about defendant\u2019s own guilt,\u201d but also concluded, as it had at the first trial, that defendant\u2019s offer of proof presented insufficient \u201cdirect or circumstantial evidence linking the third person[s] to the actual perpetration of the crime,\u201d sustaining the prosecutor\u2019s objection on that basis. As it had in similar circumstances at the first trial, however, the court added: \u201cIf, upon the testimony, your offer of proof through your client there is other evidence, I can change my [ruling].\u201d Defense counsel responded, \u201c[t]hat\u2019s fine,\u201d and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>when proceedings resumed before the jury, he withdrew his last question (concerning whether Aldridge knew that Williams\u2019s car had been seen at the crime scene) and announced he had no further questions.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erroneously \u201cexcluded\u201d evidence of \u201cRalph Dudley\u2019s\u201d alleged sighting of a gray Mustang at the crime scene. As explained <em>ante, </em>the defense offered no such evidence at the retried penalty phase of the proceedings, and the trial court did not exclude any such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">In view of that determination, defendant\u2019s various claims that the trial court\u2019s \u201cexclusion\u201d of his proffered evidence violated his Eighth Amendment right to a reliable, individualized capital-sentencing determination necessarily fail as well. <em>(Hall, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 834; <em>Lewis, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at pp. 373-374.)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Finally, even assuming that the challenged evidence in fact existed and that the trial court improperly excluded it, in view of the other strong evidence that linked defendant to the charged offenses any state law error would have been harmless under the \u201creasonable possibility\u201d standard of <em>Brown, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d 432, 448 and any federal constitutional error would have been nonprejudicial under the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard of <em>Chapman, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">3. <em>Admission of testimony concerning probable relative positions of the victims and the shooter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">We concluded earlier that the trial court did not err in allowing Dr. Rogers, a Los Angeles County deputy medical examiner, to testify regarding the probable relative positions of the shooter and the victims. Dr. Rogers gave similar testimony at the retried penalty proceedings, at which time he again considered three possible scenarios for the wound suffered by victim James White: the shooter may have shot the victim while both were in a standing position (in which event the shooter may have stood on a chair or on the countertop); the shooter may have crouched or knelt next to the victim; or the shooter may have stood next to a kneeling victim. Dr. Rogers again testified that White\u2019s wound was consistent with the third scenario, but that \u201cjust based on the wound, I can\u2019t really determine which of those occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Defendant contends the evidence was irrelevant. We disagree. Evidence suggesting that at least one of the victims could have been shot while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>kneeling was relevant to aggravation of penalty under section 190.3, factor (a). For reasons previously discussed, we also reject defendant\u2019s claims that the evidence was not a proper subject of expert testimony and that it was given without proper foundation. Finally, we again reject defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court should have concluded that the challenged testimony was more prejudicial than probative and hence that its introduction was barred under Evidence Code section 352 and violated defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights. As we have explained, evidence is not \u201cunduly prejudicial\u201d under the Evidence Code merely because it strongly implicates a defendant and casts him or her in a bad light or merely because the defendant contests that evidence and points to allegedly contrary evidence. Here, the challenged evidence was highly relevant to the prosecution\u2019s theory of premeditated and deliberated murder, and to corroboration of the testimony of the three prosecution witnesses who recounted defendant\u2019s stated intention to execute witnesses and his boasts of having shot the victims in the head. And, as noted <em>ante, </em>the evidence also was relevant in aggravation of penalty as a circumstance of the crime. The trial court acted within its discretion in concluding that the challenged evidence was more probative than prejudicial. <em>(Crittenden, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th 83, 133-134.) We discern no error, statutory or constitutional.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">4. <em>Victim impact evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Without objection, the parents and twin sister of Brian Berry, as well as the mother of James White, testified extensively at the retried penalty proceedings concerning certain attributes of each victim and the effects of the murders upon them and their families. Much of the testimony, which covers 37 transcript pages, was delivered in lengthy narratives, portions of which we reproduce <em>post.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Brian Berry\u2019s father, Jan Stephen Berry, began with a detailed account of how he and his wife learned of their son\u2019s death:</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">\u201cIt was eight o\u2019clock on Sunday morning, the 30th of June, and we were awakened by a knocking by the sheriff at our cabin door in Big Bear. All he told us was to call home about a death in the family, [f] . . . [M]y first thought was that it was probably news of one of my parents. I said that to Terry [his wife], but as I said it to her she started to cry and said, oh, my God, our children. That was unthinkable to me, and I couldn\u2019t give it any consideration or credence at all. [ft We had been together just that Saturday before kidding around at home, having fun, and enjoying grandma\u2019s visit from Northern California. Everybody was fine, [ft We didn\u2019t have a phone in the cabin so we drove to a phone booth outside a little restaurant on Highway 18. Terry and I squeezed into the phone booth, and I placed a call to our home, [ft It was a little breath of sunshine and heaven when Shannon [his daughter] answered the phone. I said Hi Shannon so her mom could hear her voice and know that she was okay. I groped for words to ask what had happened, [ft Shannon said that Brian had been killed. And I was stunned, I couldn\u2019t believe what I had heard. I asked if there had been a traffic accident. She said no. Then I continued to try and ask questions as she struggled to try and tell me what had happened, [ft After several repeats and repeats and repeats I could understand what she was trying to tell us. She was trying to tell us that Brian had been killed, he had been murdered at the Subway Sandwich Shop where Jimmy [James White] had worked. Jimmy had been killed also, [ft Numb and shaken I told her that I loved her, that we\u2019d be home as soon as we could, [ft Terry and I stood in that little tiny phone booth screaming and crying for a long while. Finally, we went back to our car and we sat and cried and screamed and carried on trying to comprehend what we had been told. It was a long time before we could get ourselves together enough to drive back to the cabin, [ft When we finally headed home, it was in numb shock and disbelief. How could this be? It couldn\u2019t possibly be true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Mr. Berry also described the impact of his son\u2019s death on the family:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">\u201cWords absolutely fail to convey the devastation. It\u2019s like trying to describe seeing to a blind person or music to someone who can\u2019t hear, [ft We hear terrible things on the news every day. You just can\u2019t imagine what the impact is until it is our leg amputated or our 18 year-old-son killed. It is pain like I have never known before in my life, [ft His dreams of life and adventure gone. We struggled to help him learn and grow. For what? The sharing of his joys and sorrows, gone. All his potential, gone. The hope of someday his children to love and share, gone. The friends he had yet to make we\u2019ll never know the extent of this loss. The friends left behind, empty and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>hurting and asking why. [f] Our family tom apart, struggling to accept an unacceptable loss. [][] His twin sister alone after being there for each other all their lives. They were so different from one another, yet such good friends, [f] Even though he was 18 years old and now an adult, as a father you always feel that you are there to protect your children and it is very difficult to think that at the time when he most needed somebody I couldn\u2019t be there to help him. How can I ever escape the image of my son\u2019s terror as he defenselessly pleaded for his life and not by accident, not in anger, not in fear, but for a few hundred dollars someone could look my son in the eye, and without feeling or mercy, in a point-blank range shoot him in the face, then put the gun against the side of his head and shoot him again.[<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>] [][] The family and friends and church family and counseling and prayer, books. Almost three years the grief goes on, and I guess it will the rest of my life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Brian Berry\u2019s twin sister, Shannon, described the telephone conversation in which she had revealed her brother\u2019s murder to her parents, the especially close relationship she had had with her brother, and the impact of her brother\u2019s death upon her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">\u201cI can\u2019t even say everything that it\u2019s impacted. It impacted everything. From going to having a built-in best friend, I\u2019m alone. I don\u2019t have my brother, my other half. My birthdays aren\u2019t a celebration anymore. I can\u2019t share them with the person I shared them with for 18 years. Instead of celebrating birthdays I have to mourn on them. [][] All the things that I want to share with him I have to go to the cemetery. I bought a new car, and I took it to the cemetery to show my brother. [][] There [are] so many things that we had left to share: getting married and having kids. And having family barbeques.

Finally, she described the impact of her son\u2019s death on herself and her family:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">\u201cI don\u2019t know how a mom can put into words what it\u2019s like to have a child murdered.

He will never be able to fulfill those goals. His life was taken away from him. The possibility of marriage and children, all gone. His career and goals and plans will never become a reality. HD Brian and Shannon had always planned to spend time together when they had families of their own. They would go on vacations together, summer barbeques, all of those precious family things that people always do, and she doesn\u2019t have anybody to share that with now. ['\u00a3] When the future for your child has been destroyed, then all the hopes and dreams that you have for your child and yourself are gone. [][] Brian Berry and James White were childhood friends. They became friends in the fourth grade. Their friendship remained strong through elementary, junior high and senior high school. They were like brothers. They had plans to share an apartment and life\u2019s experiences together, but instead, they died together, [f] Brian was one of my dearest friends.

But that was a very special time for me and these, too, are gone. I don\u2019t have those precious times anymore. [1] When your child dies, a large part of you dies too.

I should have been able to be at home with both of my children to celebrate the joy of being a mom, but instead I had to go to the cemetery to thank Brian for 18 years. I, too, have been in and out of therapy for the last two and a half years, but I still can\u2019t find any joy. I find only sorrow and pain. I have become a member of Compassionate Friends hoping to find some peace and understanding, but that\u2019s difficult too.

The prosecutor asked her to describe how she learned of her son\u2019s fatal injury. Because her son did not die immediately from his wound, the police took Mrs. White and her daughters to the hospital where James was being treated. Mrs. White described in detail holding her son in that setting, talking to him, and crying as he died. She then described her emotional reactions immediately after his death, explaining that she kept her son\u2019s possessions in his room and that she sleeps with his teddy bear for comfort. Asked by the prosecutor to describe the impact of her son\u2019s death upon herself and her family \u201cat this time,\u201d Mrs. White testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">\u201cEven though the boys are gone, James is gone, they are still here (indicating) with us always.

He was a wonderful brother, a wonderful son. He would have been a great teacher and helped lots of other people in the world, [f] This trial itself, the whole legal process, is very bewildering. I sit here and listen to the facts of the case and know it\u2019s my son, my little boy. [f] All of these things that you have heard about replay in our minds like videotape, the events of what happened at Subway.

[f] Jackie, the 11 year old, asked me a couple of weeks ago if I ever wished that I was dead so that I could be with Jimmy. I had to tell her yes. But she had to have that thought herself to be able to ask me. This is an 11 year old girl, [f] She believes like I do, that there is life after this one. And sometimes I long to be there because I miss my son so much, [f] I wonder if he will look the same in heaven. I wonder if I will be able to hug him.

Sometimes I wish I could just turn the clock back and it would all go away. It seems like yesterday and it\u2019s been three years, [f] I can close my eyes, and I can see him so clearly walking into the room with his big smile and saying, \u2018Hi Mom, I\u2019m going to Brian\u2019s,\u2019 and holding out his hands to give me a hug.

And, in the course of the above testimony, the prosecution also introduced\u2014again without objection\u201422 photographs of the victims taken while they were alive.

The prosecutor also argued that, whereas defendant could receive visits from his family while he was in prison, the victims\u2019 families could \u201cvisit\u201d their sons only at the cemetery and asserted that the jury should \u201ctake that into account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Defendant acknowledges that so-called victim impact evidence may be introduced at penalty phase proceedings under the federal Constitution <em>(Payne </em>v. <em>Tennessee </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 808 [115 L.Ed.2d 720, 111 S.Ct. 2597] <em>(Payne)) </em>and that we also have found such evidence (and related \u201cvictim character\u201d evidence) admissible as a \u201ccircumstance of the crime\u201d under section 190.3, factor (a). <em>(Roldan, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th 646, 730-731; <em>People v.

Such testimony in <em>Payne </em>consisted of a single response to a question posed to a witness who was the mother and grandmother of the two victims. The witness was asked how a surviving young child had been affected by the murders of his mother and sister, which had been committed in his presence. The witness responded: \u201c \u2018He cries for his mom. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand why she doesn\u2019t come home. And he cries for his sister Lacie. He comes to me many times during the week and asks me, Grandmamma, do you miss my Lacie. And I tell him yes. He says, I\u2019m worried about my Lacie.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Payne, supra, </em>501 U.S. 808, 814-815.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Upholding the introduction of this evidence and the prosecutor\u2019s subsequent argument based upon it, the high court in <em>Payne </em>reasoned that, just as a jury must be allowed to consider mitigating evidence introduced by a defendant, the prosecution \u201c \u2018has a legitimate interest in counteracting\u2019 \u201d that mitigating evidence, and hence a jury also should be allowed to consider in aggravation \u201cthe specific harm caused by the crime in question.\u201d <em>(Payne, supra, </em>501 U.S. 808, 825.) The court rejected the view that such evidence often or even generally \u201cleads to the arbitrary imposition of the death penalty,\u201d but observed that if, in a given case, such evidence \u201cis so unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair,\u201d such a sentence will be overturned on constitutional due process grounds. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Addressing this point shortly after <em>Payne </em>was decided, we concluded in <em>Edwards, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 787, that photographs of crime victims while they were alive properly had been admitted under <em>Payne </em>and as \u201ccircumstances of the crime\u201d under section 190.3, factor (a). We explained that the quoted phrase (\u201ccircumstances of the crime\u201d) \u201cdoes not mean merely the immediate temporal and spatial circumstances of the crime,\u201d but \u201c[rjather . . . extends to \u2018[t]hat which surrounds materially, morally, or logically\u2019 the crime.\u201d <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 833.) We also cautioned, however, that allowing such evidence under factor (a) \u201cdoes not mean that there are no limits on emotional evidence and argument,\u201d and we quoted with approval our <em>pre-Payne </em>observations that (1) \u201c \u2018the jury must face its obligation soberly and rationally, and should not be given the impression that emotion may reign over reason,\u2019 \u201d and that (2) although a court should \u201c \u2018allow evidence and argument on emotional though relevant subjects that could provide legitimate reasons to sway the jury to show mercy or to impose the ultimate sanction,\u2019 \u201d still, \u201c \u2018irrelevant information or inflammatory rhetoric that diverts the jury\u2019s attention from its proper role or invites an irrational, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>purely subjective response should be curtailed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 787, 836, quoting <em>People v. Haskett </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 841, 864 [180 Cal.Rptr. 640, 640 P.2d 776].)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In this vein, defendant relies upon the decision of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in <em>Cargle v. State </em>(1996) 1995 OKCR 77 [909 P.2d 806], which stated: \u201cThe more a jury is exposed to the emotional aspects of a victim\u2019s death, the less likely [its] verdict will be a \u2018reasoned moral response\u2019 to the question whether a defendant deserves to die; and the greater the risk a defendant will be deprived of Due Process.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 830.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">One extreme example of such a due process infirmity is <em>Salazar </em>v. <em>State </em>(Tex.Crim.App. 2002) 90 S.W.3d 330. In that murder trial, the court admitted a 17-minute \u201cvideo montage\u201d tribute to the murder victim\u2014approximately 140 photographs set to emotional music, including \u201cMy Heart Will Go On,\u201d sung by Celine Dion and featured prominently in the film Titanic (20th Century Fox 1997). <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 333-334.) Reversing a lower appellate court decision finding the presentation admissible, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals remanded for an assessment of prejudice. In so ruling, the state high court observed, among other things, that \u201cthe punishment phase of a criminal trial is not a memorial service for the victim. What may be entirely appropriate eulogies to celebrate the life and accomplishments of a unique individual are not necessarily admissible in a criminal trial\u201d <em>(id., </em>at pp. 335-336), and that <em>\u201cwe caution that victim impact and character evidence may become unfairly prejudicial through sheer volume. </em>Even if not technically cumulative, an undue amount of this type of evidence can result in unfair prejudice .... Hence, <em>we encourage trial courts to place appropriate limits upon the amount, kind, and source of victim impact and character </em>evidence.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 336, italics in original.)<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">We need not, and do not, decide in this case whether evidence of the nature and extent presented below properly was admitted at the penalty phase of this capital trial. Defense counsel knew that most of this same evidence had been received at the first trial (see fns. 27 &amp; 30, <em>ante), </em>and hence easily could have brought an in limine motion to restrict the admission of this evidence. By failing to do so, or to object when the testimony and the photographs were offered at the retried penalty proceedings, defendant has waived the issue on appeal. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353, subd.

In denying this request, the trial court observed that defense counsel would not be precluded from \u201carguing lingering doubt.\u201d Subsequently, in closing arguments, the prosecutor asserted that the jury should have no lingering doubt concerning defendant\u2019s guilt, and urged the jury to \u201cignore\u201d any argument that defense counsel might make to the contrary. Defense counsel thereafter argued forcefully (without objection, and contrary to what the prosecutor had urged) that the jury could and should have a lingering doubt about defendant\u2019s guilt. Indeed, counsel spent half of his argument reviewing the guilt phase evidence in an attempt to raise doubts regarding the earlier determination of guilt and strongly asserted that the jury should act upon such doubt by viewing it as an important factor that weighed against a punishment of death. Subsequently, the court instructed the jury, pursuant to section 190.3, factor (k), to consider in determining the appropriate penalty \u201cany other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime and any sympathetic or other aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or record as a basis for [a] sentence less than death</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">We repeatedly have rejected claims that, under either state or federal law, a trial court must instruct concerning lingering doubt, whether on the court\u2019s own motion or in response to a specific request. (E.g., <em>People v. Slaughter </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1187, 1219 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 477, 47 P.3d 262] [failure to instruct on own motion]; <em>People v.

Moreover, we observe that, consistent with defense counsel\u2019s closing arguments, the jury was allowed under the section 190.3 factor (k) instruction to consider in mitigation any lingering doubt it may have had. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Brown, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at pp. 567-568; <em>People v. Lawley, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 166; <em>People v.

Defendant concedes that we repeatedly have considered, rejected, and declined to reconsider these and related claims in numerous prior decisions (e.g., <em>Millwee, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 96, 164 [declining the defendant\u2019s request to reconsider our \u201cprior decisions\u2014too numerous to cite here\u201d upholding the statutory scheme against the same challenges]), but argues that the high court\u2019s decision in <em>Ring </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(2002) 536 U.S. 584 [153 L.Ed.2d 556, 122 S.Ct. 2428], viewed together with its earlier decision in <em>Apprendi v.

In his reply brief, defendant acknowledges that we declined to do precisely that in post-<em>Apprendi </em>decisions (e.g., <em>People v.

First, section 190.3 adequately narrows the class of death-eligible offenders. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Griffin </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 536, 596 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 743, 93 P.3d 344]; <em>Prieto, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th 226, 276; <em>People v. Samayoa </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 795, 863 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 400, 938 P.2d 2].) Second, section 190.3, factor (a) is not impermissibly overbroad facially or as applied. (E.g., <em>Brown II, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th 382, 401; <em>Lewis, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th 334, 394; <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th 900, 1050-1053.) Finally, the statute is not unconstitutional because (with the exception of evidence of other crimes) it lacks a requirement that the jury make written findings or be given \u201cburden of proof\u2019 or \u201cstandard of proof\u2019 instructions concerning aggravating and mitigating circumstances in reaching a penalty determination; nor is the statute infirm for failing to require that all aggravating factors be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, that such factors must outweigh factors in mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt, or that death must be found to be an appropriate penalty beyond a reasonable doubt. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Kraft </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 978, 1078-1079 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 5 P.3d 68]; <em>People v. Welch </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 701, 767 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 203, 976 P.2d 754].)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">6. <em>Asserted cumulative error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Defendant contends that alleged cumulative error at each trial requires reversal of the penalty judgment. We previously have rejected a similar contention insofar as the guilt and special circumstances phase of the trial is concerned. We have not found any error at the penalty phase of the proceedings, but even assuming error (and, indeed, cumulative error), any such improprieties would have been harmless under the \u201creasonable possibility\u201d test of <em>Brown, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d 432, 448, and under the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d test of <em>Chapman, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23-24. The record reflects that defendant received a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">III.

Defendant asserts that Aldridge <em>\u201clater </em>corrected himself, stating that he had meant to say \u2018James\u2019 [that is, defendant].\u201d (Italics added.) In fact, as the record discloses, the witness <em>immediately </em>corrected himself, saying, \u201cI mean, excuse me, turn James [defendant] in.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b643-9\"> Various other witnesses commented that at the time of trial, defendant appeared slimmer than he had earlier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\"> For example, the following exchange occurred concerning statements made by defendant at the time of his arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">\u201cQ. . . .

Defendant\u2019s criticisms lack merit. Indeed, defendant\u2019s own accounting of the guilt phase facts is itself improper: in both his opening brief and reply brief, defendant repeatedly augments his description of the facts with numerous citations to the record of the penalty phase retrial\u2014 testimony that was not before the jury that heard and tried the guilt phase issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b648-16\"> The nature of the conflict was as follows: In early June 1993, Hill had commenced representing another inmate, Anders. Subsequently, Anders informed Hill that, in May 1993, while defendant was awaiting the jury\u2019s verdict in the first penalty trial, defendant confessed to Anders that he had killed the two victims and Anders had so informed the prosecution. Numerous proceedings ensued, during which it became clear that, among other things, the prosecution might call Anders as a witness at defendant\u2019s penalty phase retrial. Hill eventually moved to be relieved in both matters. Upon granting Hill\u2019s motion in the present case, the trial court commented that it did so \u201c[w]ith great reluctance.

Would this in any way affect your judgment or the weight and credibility you would give to their testimony?\u201d In any event, it does not appear that any juror in the present case was confused by the language used.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b661-6\"> We also reject defendant\u2019s claim that it was error for the prosecution to use its peremptory challenges to excuse prospective jurors who expressed reservations concerning imposition of the death penalty. Assuming the prosecution so acted, it was entitled to do so <em>(People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number><em>Champion </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 879, 907 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 547, 891 P.2d 93]) and did not thereby deny defendant the right to a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pinholster </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 865, 913 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 765, 824 P.2d 571].) We also reject defendant\u2019s similar claim that the exposure of prospective jurors to the questioning of other jurors concerning their ability to impose the death penalty, combined with the dismissal of some of those prospective jurors for cause or pursuant to peremptory challenges, produced a more conviction-prone and death-prone jury, in violation of defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to an impartial tribunal. (See <em>People v. Carrera </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 291, 331 [261 Cal.Rptr. 348, <em>777 </em>P.2d 121], and cases cited.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b663-9\"> Evidence Code, section 352 provides; \u201cThe court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create the substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b665-6\"> At oral argument, counsel for defendant suggested that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent grant of certiorari in <em>State v. Holmes </em>(2004) 361 S.C. 333 [605 S.E.2d 19] (see <em>Holmes v. South Carolina </em>(2005) _ U.S. _ [162 L. Ed.2d 932, 126 S.Ct. 34]) assists him. We disagree. In <em>Holmes </em>the prosecution offered forensic evidence that linked the defendant to the rape and murder of an elderly woman. The evidence included DNA samples found on the defendant\u2019s underwear, and a palm print found on the inside of the victim\u2019s front door. The trial court denied admission of extensive third party culpability evidence from numerous witnesses. Some of those witnesses would have testified that another person, \u201cJimmy,\u201d was close to the crime scene at the time of the crime. Other witnesses would have testified that Jimmy had acknowledged to them the defendant\u2019s innocence and his own guilt in the crime. A final witness would have testified that Jimmy had confessed to the crimes, that the witness had been pressured to testify falsely against the defendant at the defendant\u2019s trial, and that the authorities had \u201cmanufactured\u201d the DNA and palm print forensic evidence described <em>ante. </em>The South Carolina Supreme Court (with one justice dissenting) explained that under South Carolina law \u201cwhere there is strong evidence of an appellant\u2019s guilt, especially when there is strong forensic evidence, the proffered evidence about a third party\u2019s alleged guilt does not raise a reasonable inference as to the appellant\u2019s own innocence\u201d <em>(State v. Holmes, supra, </em>605 S.E.2d at p. 24), and went on to conclude that because of the strong evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt in that case, the exclusion of third party culpability evidence was proper. Hence, as reflected in <em>Holmes, </em>South Carolina law apparently precludes a criminal defendant from introducing evidence of a third party\u2019s culpability whenever other evidence, especially forensic evidence, strongly supports the defendant\u2019s guilt. This very restrictive rule concerning a defendant\u2019s ability to present evidence of third party culpability\u2014described as \u201cunique\u201d in the petition for certiorari in Holmes\u2014does not apply in California, and the high court\u2019s grant of certiorari in <em>Holmes </em>does not affect our analysis of the claims presented in the current appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b667-9\"> In his reply brief, defendant claims, without citation to the record, that \u201cRalph Dudley is identified in a police report provided to the defense in discovery.

Aldridge further testified that defendant, speaking of the Subway victims, bragged that he had \u201cblown them away\u201d by shooting them in the head. Ostrander testified that defendant bragged he had \u201cpopped those two kids\u201d in the head even though they had pleaded, \u201c \u2018Please don\u2019t shoot me.

Such a scenario, defendant observes, \u201cclearly does not match the cold \u2018execution style\u2019 killings described by the prosecution witnesses and supported by the coroner\u2019s opinion . . . .\u201d But, as noted <em>ante, </em>James testified that she heard \u201cthe noise\u201d (that is, apparently, the first shot) and <em>thereafter </em>\u201cimmediately saw the customer either run around the counter or jump on the counter and over.\u201d Contrary to defendant\u2019s suggestion, this testimony does not support the theory that the shooter fired while standing on the counter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b674-5\"> We reject defendant\u2019s additional claim that any error was structural in nature and requires reversal per se. <em>(See Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 279, 307-308, 309 [113 L.Ed.2d 302, 111 S.Ct. 1246] [regular \u201c <em>\u2018trial </em>error\u2019 \u201d can be \u201cqualitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d; by contrast, \u201cstructural\u201d error is a \u201cdefect]] in the constitution of the trial mechanism, which deifies] analysis by \u2018harmless-error\u2019 standards\u201d (italics added)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\"><em>Riley </em>v. <em>Deeds </em>(9th Cir. 1995) 56 F.3d 1117 <em>(Riley), </em>upon which defendant relies for the contrary conclusion, is distinguishable. In that case, at a time when the state (Nevada) trial judge was absent from the court, a deliberating jury asked for readback of the crime victim\u2019s testimony. The judge\u2019s law clerk convened the court, explained that the reporter would read back the victim\u2019s testimony, and instructed the jury foreman to raise his hand when the jury had heard enough. The testimony was read back and, at the conclusion of the readback of the direct examination, the foreman raised his hand and the readback ended. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1119.) The appellate court observed: \u201cIn this case, the judge was not present when the jury requested that the testimony be read back, nor does the record reflect he was consulted about the matter. From what we can tell from the record, the judge\u2019s law clerk made the decision to grant the jury\u2019s request to read back the testimony. The jury was then given effective control of what testimony and how much of it would be read. The victim\u2019s testimony was read until the jury foreman decided the jury had heard enough.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1120.) In this setting, the appellate court found \u201ca complete abdication of judicial control over the process\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 1121) and reversed without an assessment of prejudice. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">In the present case, by contrast, the trial judge was present when the jury requested that the testimony be read back, and was consulted concerning that matter. The trial court made the decision to grant the jury\u2019s request to read back the testimony; the jury was not given control of what testimony would be read back or how much of it would be read back, and by no means can it reasonably be said that the record reflects \u201ca complete abdication of judicial control over the process.\u201d <em>(Riley, supra, 56 </em>F.3d 1117, 1121.) <em>Riley, </em>therefore, is distinguishable.

Of the six prospective jurors to whom the comment was directly made, one ultimately was selected to serve on the jury. In its subsequent admonishments the court properly and repeatedly advised, as it had earlier, that race had <em>no </em>place in the decisionmaking process. Trial counsel for defendant apparently either overlooked the court\u2019s misstatement or thought it unworthy of mention, and appellate counsel likewise did not raise the issue.

Defendant asserts in his opening brief that the appellate court in <em>Smith </em>\u201cfound <em>reversible error </em>when the trial court had allowed the victim\u2019s sister and one of the victim\u2019s friends to testify about the victim\u2019s good qualities, her education and ambitions and the effect her death had on her students.\u201d (Citing <em>Smith, supra, </em>at p. 97, italics added.) In his reply brief, defendant repeats the same assertion concerning the <em>Smith </em>case. This characterization of the <em>Smith </em>decision is misleading. Although the court in <em>Smith </em>found introduction of such evidence to be error under the applicable state statute <em>(id., </em>at p. 102), it did <em>not </em>find that the error warranted reversal, but instead that the error was harmless. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 103.) Moreover, two years later, the Texas court reconsidered <em>Smith </em>and reversed that decision on the question of error, stating in <em>Mosley </em>v. <em>State </em>(Tex.Crim.App. 1998) 983 S.W.2d 249, 262: \u201cWe take this opportunity to announce a consistent, if not always clear-cut rule to be followed in future cases: Both victim impact and victim character evidence are admissible, in the context of the mitigation special issue, to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>the uniqueness of the victim, the harm caused by the defendant, and as rebuttal to the defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b690-8\"> After remand, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found the error prejudicial and ordered a new sentencing trial. <em>(Salazar v. State </em>(Tex.Crim.App. 2003) 118 S.W.3d 880.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b690-9\"> Defendant also contends that, because the family members were not physically present at the scene when the crimes were committed, their resulting testimony did not constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>evidence of the circumstances of the crimes under section 190.3, factor (a). This claim also was not raised below and similarly is forfeited on appeal. In any event, we never have required such a nexus. (See <em>Brown II, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th 382, 398 [\u201cWe find no authority for such a rule, which would eliminate the vast majority of victim impact evidence in murder cases\u2014a result inconsistent with the underlying rationale of <em>Payne . . </em>. .\u201d]; see also <em>Pollock, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th 1153, 1183.) Defendant further suggests that victim impact evidence must be limited to facts or circumstances known to the defendant at the time of the crimes. Again, this claim, not raised below, is forfeited on appeal. In any event, we have approved the admission of such evidence in circumstances in which the defendant had no prior knowledge of the victim. <em>(Brown II, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at pp. 389, 397-398.) As the People observe, although defendant may not have known the precise dimensions of the tragedy his actions would leave behind, the profound harm to surviving family members and friends was \u201cso foreseeable as to be virtually inevitable.\u201d <em>(Payne, supra, </em>501 U.S. 808, 838 (conc. opn. of Souter, J.).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b693-11\">Associate Justice, Court of Appeal, First Appellate District, Division Three, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>MORENO, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"A9t\">I concur in the majority opinion. The majority correctly concludes that defendant has waived the issue of whether the nature and extent of the victim impact evidence presented was properly admitted, because defense counsel failed to bring an in limine motion to restrict admission of the evidence. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 652; see <em>People v. Pollock </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1153, 1180 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 34, 89 P.3d 353] [trial counsel successfully moved to limit the scope of the victim impact testimony before the commencement of such testimony].) Although the majority does not decide the merits of defendant\u2019s claim, I write separately to express my view that a certain type of testimony by the victims\u2019 families in this case was not properly admissible as victim impact evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The proper purpose of victim impact evidence was set forth in <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Tennessee </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 808 [115 L.Ed.2d 720, 111 S.Ct. 2597] <em>(Payne). </em>In approving the very brief victim impact testimony in that case, the court stated: \u201c \u2018[T]he State has a legitimate interest in counteracting the mitigating evidence which the defendant is entitled to put in, by reminding the sentencer that just as the murderer should be considered as an individual, so too the victim is an individual whose death represents a unique loss to society and in particular to his family.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 825.)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The court in <em>Payne, </em>although overruling <em>Booth v. Maryland </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 496 [96 L.Ed.2d 440, 107 S.Ct. 2529] <em>(Booth) </em>to the extent that it mandated exclusion of victim impact evidence, left intact <em>Booth\u2019s </em>holding that \u201cthe admission of a victim\u2019s family members\u2019 characterizations and opinions about the crime, the defendant, and the appropriate sentence violates the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Payne, supra, </em>501 U.S. at p. 830, fn. 2; see also <em>People v. Pollock, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at p. 1180.) <em>Booth, </em>in explaining why the admission of such characterization and opinion evidence was unconstitutional, stated: \u201cOne can understand the grief and anger of the family caused by the brutal murders in this case, and there is no doubt that jurors generally are aware of these feelings. But the formal presentation of this information by the State can serve no other purpose than to inflame the jury and divert it from deciding the case on the relevant evidence concerning the crime and the defendant.\u201d <em>(Booth, supra, </em>482 U.S. at p. 508.)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">In the present case, I find parts of the victim impact testimony crossed the line between proper victim impact testimony and improper characterization and opinion by the victim\u2019s family. The prime example was that of Brian Berry\u2019s father, Jan Stephan Berry, who testified: \u201c \u2018Even though [Brian] was 18 years old and now an adult, as a father you always feel that you are there to protect your children and it is very difficult to think that at the time when he most needed somebody I couldn\u2019t be there to help him. <em>How can I ever </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number><em>escape the image of my son\u2019s terror as he defenselessly pleaded for his life and not by accident, not in anger, not in fear, but for a few hundred dollars someone could look my son in the eye, and without feeling or mercy, in a point-blank range shoot him in the face, then put the gun against the side of his head and shoot him again.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 646, fn. omitted, italics added.) The above passage is only minimally related to the valid purpose of reminding the jury \u201c \u2018that the victim is an individual whose death represents a unique loss to society and in particular to his family.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Payne, supra, </em>501 U.S. at p. 825.) Rather, it is quite plainly \u201cthe admission of a victim\u2019s family members\u2019 characterizations and opinions about the crime [and] the defendant,\u201d which violates the Eighth Amendment. <em>(Payne, supra, </em>501 U.S. at p. 830, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">A similar statement was made by James White\u2019s mother, Kristine White. As she stated: \u201c \u2018All of these things that you have heard about replay in our minds like videotape, the events of what happened at Subway. <em>I can see James and what his terror must have been like in seeing his best friend shot. How afraid he must have been on his knees asking for his life. I can feel the gun to his head. </em>To this day I don\u2019t understand how I slept so soundly and didn\u2019t know. You\u2019d think that you would, [f] <em>I don\u2019t understand anybody being able to do that, </em>[f] <em>I can hear him moaning as he lay on the ground and bled from his wound and there wasn\u2019t anybody there to help him.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 649, fn. omitted, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The above statement, again, is only minimally related to the purpose of victim impact evidence discussed <em>ante. </em>Rather, it allowed the parent of the victim to invoke an imagined version of the crime, the version that was the most horrific, and that was in alignment with the prosecutor\u2019s theory of the murders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the above statement may have been couched in the language of victim impact testimony, i.e., in terms of a \u201cvideotape\u201d running in the mind of the victim\u2019s mother, that \u201cvideotape\u201d was in fact a simile for a series of recurrent thoughts she had based on things she had \u201cheard about.\u201d Those thoughts in turn were essentially characterizations of and opinions about the crime and defendant, the primary effect of which would be to \u201cinflame the jury\u201d <em>(Booth, supra, </em>482 U.S. at p. 508) in order to elicit from it the maximum penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">In fact, I would hold as a general rule that testimony of victims\u2019 friends and family regarding their imagined reenactments of the crime be excluded. Such testimony is too far removed from victim impact evidence\u2019s central <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>purpose of explaining the loss to the family and society that resulted from the victim\u2019s death, and can too easily lend itself to improper characterization and opinion of the crime and defendant, to pass muster under the Eighth Amendment. Of course, if the victim impact witness actually witnessed the crime occurring, such testimony would be admissible. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Fierro </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 173, 234-235 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 426, 821 P.2d 1302].)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Because defendant has waived the issue on appeal, there is no occasion to decide whether the above erroneous admissions were prejudicial, nor whether there are other parts of the victim impact testimony in this case that should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Kennard, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied February 22, 2006.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\"> Although the majority is correct that White\u2019s statement is not inconsistent with the evidence at trial, neither does that evidence, chiefly Dennis Ostrander\u2019s account of what defendant told him about the crimes, compel the conclusion that the murders occurred in the manner that White, and the prosecutor during closing argument, described them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
