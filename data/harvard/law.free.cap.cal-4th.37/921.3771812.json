Resources Code, \u00a74511 et seq.) and its implementing regulations provide the exclusive mechanism through which the Regional Water Quality Control Boards and the State Water Resources Control Board (collectively, Water Boards) may address water quality concerns implicated by logging operations associated with a timber harvesting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">The present dispute arose following the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection\u2019s (Department of Forestry) approval of a timber harvesting plan amendment submitted by Scotia Pacific Company LLC and Pacific Lumber Company (collectively, Pacific Lumber). The North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board had objected to the amendment, asserting that it contained insufficient safeguards to protect nearby waters potentially affected by the proposed logging activity. This objection was overruled by the Department of Forestry. The Regional Water Quality Control Board and the State Water Resources Control Board then issued orders directing Pacific Lumber to adopt a water quality monitoring program that had not been required by the Department of Forestry. Pacific Lumber asserts that these orders are invalid because the Z\u2019berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act of 1973 prevents the Water Boards from compelling water quality monitoring related to logging already subject to an approved timber harvesting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Pacific Lumber\u2019s construction of the Z\u2019berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act of 1973 (Forest Practice Act) as providing the exclusive means of regulating timber harvesting is based on public policy, i.e., on a view that the Legislature could not have endorsed an allegedly duplicative and overtaxing regulatory scheme. While it may be the case that a streamlined process would claim certain advantages (and possible disadvantages) relative to a scheme contemplating overlapping jurisdiction, the Forest Practice Act\u2019s plain language dictates the result here. Specifically, the Forest Practice Act\u2019s savings clause provides that \u201c[n]o provision of this chapter or any ruling, requirement, or policy of the [State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection] is a limitation on ... PH] ... [1] .. . the power of any state agency in the enforcement or administration of any provision of law which it is specifically authorized or required to enforce or administer.\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 4514, subd. (c).) The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (Wat. Code, \u00a7 13000 et seq.) specifically authorizes the water quality monitoring ordered by the Water Boards. (See Wat. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13267, subd. (b)(1), 13320, subd. (c).) In light of the Forest Practice Act\u2019s <em>express </em>disclaimer of any interference with agency responsibilities, and the absence of any irreconcilable conflict between the savings clause and other provisions of the Forest Practice Act, we cannot accept Pacific Lumber\u2019s argument that the act <em>implicitly </em>allocates to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>Department of Forestry exclusive responsibility for protecting state waters affected by timber harvesting, in derogation of the Water Boards\u2019 statutory prerogatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">As the Court of Appeal reached the same conclusion, we affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">This case involves proposed logging activity on approximately 700 wooded acres in Humboldt County\u2019s Elk River watershed. Until 1999, this land was owned by the Elk River Timber Company (Elk River). In 1997, Elk River submitted a timber harvesting plan (THP) as a precursor to logging this area. Under California law, an approved THP is a prerequisite to all nonexempt logging operations. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 4581.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Department of Forestry must review THP\u2019s to determine whether they comport with the Forest Practice Act and the rules and regulations of the State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection (Board of Forestry). (\u00a7 4582.7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Elk River\u2019s THP underwent the multidisciplinary review spelled out in the Forest Practice Act and its associated regulations. (See \u00a7 4582.6, subds. (a), (b); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 1037.5.) The North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board participated in this process, recommending that Elk River develop a sediment monitoring program along potentially affected waters. Elk River\u2019s forester agreed to the concept of a rigorous, cooperative monitoring program. But no mandatory monitoring program was ever written into the THP. The THP provided only that \u201c[mjonitoring protocols, techniques and monitoring locations shall be chosen at the discretion of the landowner or representative.\u201d On August 24, 1998, Elk River\u2019s THP, known as THP 520, was approved by the Department of Forestry without any objection from the Regional Water Quality Control Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">THP 520 and the land it encompassed were transferred to Pacific Lumber in 1999. This transaction occurred as part of the \u201cHeadwaters Agreement,\u201d through which the state gained control of the Headwaters Forest Preserve. (See Stats. 1998, ch. 615.) On August 30, 1999, Pacific Lumber submitted the first of several amendments to THP 520 designed to facilitate logging operations at the site. This proceeding concerns amendment No. 5, which was submitted by Pacific Lumber on September 14, 2000. Amendment No. 5 proposed certain modifications to THP 520, including provisions allowing for wintertime operations, \u201cyarding\u201d (removal of felled timber) by helicopter, and other changes made necessary by the Headwaters Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>Under the Forest Practice Act, substantial amendments to THP\u2019s also are subject to Department of Forestry approval. (\u00a7 4591.) As part of the review process for amendment No. 5, a representative of the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board participated in on-site inspections of the THP 520 logging site on November 6, 2000 and November 29, 2000. In January 2001, the chairman of the review team for amendment No. 5 recommended that the Director of the Department of Forestry (Director) approve the amendment. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 1037.5, subd. (c).) Shortly thereafter, as allowed by the California Code of Regulations <em>(id., </em>subd. (e)), the Regional Water Quality Control Board submitted a \u201cnon-concurrence\u201d disagreeing with the chairman\u2019s recommendation. The Regional Water Quality Control Board\u2019s nonconcurrence letter voiced several concerns with the timber harvesting contemplated by the amended THP. Most relevant here, the letter stated that Pacific Lumber had not yet proposed a program that would adequately monitor the effects the harvesting would have on water quality. Without such monitoring, the Regional Water Quality Control Board argued, a chance existed that the timber harvesting authorized by THP 520 would violate state water quality law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">The Department of Forestry rejected the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board\u2019s concerns regarding inadequate monitoring, stating that the proposed amendment \u201cis anticipated to reduce water quality issues below those in the existing unamended plan. That plan, as noted by [the Regional Water Quality Control Board], is in place and operable without the monitoring program being proposed in this non-concurrence.\u201d The Regional Water Quality Control Board\u2019s objections having been overruled, the Director approved amendment No. 5 on March 6, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">On March 13, 2001, the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board asked the State Water Resources Control Board to invoke the Forest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>Practice Act\u2019s \u201chead of agency appeal process,\u201d which would have allowed the Board of Forestry to review the amendment\u2019s approval. (\u00a7 4582.9.) Two days later, the State Water Resources Control Board received a letter from the Director advising the agency that \u201cthe amendment and its proposed operations have been sufficiently restricted and mitigated to the point that there is minimal risk to water quality.\u201d The State Water Resources Control Board ultimately did not invoke the head of agency appeal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">Undeterred, the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board issued monitoring and reporting order No. Rl-2001-19 on March 28, 2001. This order required Pacific Lumber to adopt a comprehensive water quality monitoring program that would include five new monitoring stations along the South Fork of the Elk River. The Regional Water Quality Control Board advised Pacific Lumber that the program was necessary \u201cto assure that discharges from [logging contemplated by THP 520] comply with Basin Plan objectives and prohibitions, to assure that discharges do not impede recovery of the watershed, and to identify and address discharges of sediments to receiving waters in a timely manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Pacific Lumber filed a petition (see Wat. Code, \u00a7 13320, subd. (a)) with the State Water Resources Control Board, asking it to rescind the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board\u2019s order. In its petition, Pacific Lumber argued that the Forest Practice Act\u2019s provisions relating to THP approval precluded the Regional Water Quality Control Board from imposing monitoring requirements more stringent than those found within the applicable THP. The State Water Resources Control Board disagreed and upheld the Regional Water Quality Control Board\u2019s authority to require monitoring. However, the State Water Resources Control Board\u2019s final order required only two new monitoring stations, as opposed to the five demanded by the Regional Water Quality Control Board. The State Water Resources Control Board\u2019s order also imposed inspection, recordkeeping, reporting, and planning requirements associated with the monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Pacific Lumber then filed a petition for writ of mandamus in Humboldt County Superior Court. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.) In its writ petition, Pacific Lumber argued that the State Water Resources Control Board lacked \u201cauthority to unilaterally impose monitoring requirements as a condition to the conduct of timber operations pursuant to an approved THP.\u201d Pacific Lumber asserted that the Forest Practice Act conferred upon the Department of Forestry ultimate and exclusive authority to determine whether or not proposed timber operations complied with state water law. Pacific Lumber also contended that the Water Boards were collaterally estopped from revisiting the Department of Forestry\u2019s determinations concerning the need for water quality monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>The superior court granted Pacific Lumber\u2019s petition. The court concluded that \u201c[t]he legislative history and expressed intent [of the Forest Practice Act] indicates the adoption of a plan to deal with timber harvesting in [a] way that will allow the timberland owner to have finality, once the plan is approved, and appeals exhausted, and yet allow protection of the environment through public input, as well as input from state agencies involved in the timber harvest plan process. Such intent would be vitiated should involved agencies, unhappy with the final plan, ignore the appeal process, and simply issue their own orders to the timberland owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">The Court of Appeal reversed, relying in great measure on the Forest Practice Act\u2019s savings clause, which in relevant part provides that \u201c[n]o provision of this chapter or any ruling, requirement, or policy of the board is a limitation on ... [][]... [f] .. . the power of any state agency in the enforcement or administration of any provision of law which it is specifically authorized or required to enforce or administer.\u201d (\u00a74514, subd. (c).) The Court of Appeal determined that \u201c[o]n its face, Public Resource Code section 4514, subdivision (c) directly addresses the interagency issue. It provides that notwithstanding orders of the Department of Forestry (such as the approval of a THP or THP amendment), other state agencies may continue to enforce the laws entrusted to them.\u201d The Court of Appeal also rejected Pacific Lumber\u2019s collateral estoppel argument and concluded that Pacific Lumber had forfeited, by failing to raise this argument before the superior court, its contention that the monitoring requirements effected a taking of its property without just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">We granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">Pacific Lumber contends that the Water Boards\u2019 unilateral imposition of monitoring requirements subverted the procedures for THP approval incorporated within the Forest Practice Act, which Pacific Lumber characterizes as creating a \u201cone-stop\u201d regulatory process for proposed logging activity that already incorporates detailed consideration of water quality impacts. This \u201cone-stop\u201d process, Pacific Lumber argues, cannot be reconciled with the after-the-fact imposition of additional water quality monitoring requirements by the Water Boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">The Forest Practice Act promotes a state policy of \u201cencouraging] prudent and responsible forest resource management calculated to serve the public\u2019s need for timber and other forest products, while giving consideration to the public\u2019s need for watershed protection, fisheries and wildlife, and recreational opportunities alike in this and future generations.\u201d (\u00a74512, subd. (c).) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>Forest Practice Act is designed to \u201ccreate and maintain an effective and comprehensive system of regulation and use of all timberlands so as to assure that: HQ (a) Where feasible, the productivity of timberlands is restored, enhanced, and maintained[, and] [|] (b) The goal of maximum sustained production of high-quality timber products is achieved while giving consideration to values relating to recreation, watershed, wildlife, range and forage, fisheries, regional economic vitality, employment, and aesthetic enjoyment.\u201d (\u00a7 4513.)</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\">Toward these goals, the Forest Practice Act requires the Board of Forestry to adopt rules pertaining to the effects of timber operations on water quality and watershed control (\u00a7 4551.5), and rules controlling timber operations that will result or threaten to result in unreasonable effects on the beneficial uses of state waters (\u00a7 4562.7). (See also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7\u00a7 916-916.12.) The Forest Practice Act also contains detailed procedures relating to the submission and approval of THP\u2019s. Subject to certain exemptions not implicated here, the Forest Practice Act requires parties who plan on harvesting timber to first submit a THP to the Department of Forestry for approval. (\u00a7\u00a7 4581-4582.) The THP must contain information including \u201c[a] description of the land on which the work is proposed to be done,\u201d \u201c[a] description of the silvicultural methods to be applied, including the type of logging equipment to be used,\u201d \u201c[a]n outline of the methods to be used to avoid excessive accelerated erosion from timber operations to be conducted within the proximity of a stream,\u201d \u201c[s]pecial provisions, if any, to protect any unique area within the area of timber operations,\u201d \u201c[t]he expected dates of commencement and completion of timber operations,\u201d \u201c[a] certification by the registered professional forester preparing the plan that he or she or a designee has personally inspected the plan area,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny other information the [Board of Forestry] provides by regulation to meet its rules and the standards of this chapter.\u201d (\u00a7 4582, subds. (c)-(i); see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 1034.)</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Once submitted, the THP is made available for public inspection and comment. (\u00a7 4582.6, subd. (a).) The Department of Forestry transmits copies of the THP to other agencies, including the Department of Fish and Game and the appropriate Regional Water Quality Control Board, for their review. <em>(Ibid.) A </em>representative of the local Regional Water Quality Control Board participates in an interagency team that reviews the THP and assists the Director in evaluating the planned timber operations and their environmental impacts. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 1037.5.) The review team may perform a preharvest inspection of the proposed logging site. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (g)(1).) The review team\u2019s chairperson makes a recommendation to the Director regarding whether the plan should be approved or rejected. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (h).) Any member of the review team may submit a nonconcurrence letter to the Director disagreeing with the chairperson\u2019s recommendation to approve a plan and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>offering advice on measures or actions that should be taken to address the asserted deficiency. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">The Director then determines whether the THP conforms to the Forest Practice Act and the Board of Forestry\u2019s rules and regulations, taking into account the comments and recommendations that he or she has received. (\u00a7 4582.7, subds. (a), (b); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7\u00a7 1037.6-1037.7.) In this respect, the Director, or his or her designee, \u201cshall have the final authority to determine whether a timber harvesting plan is in conformance with the rules and regulations of the [Board of Forestry] and with [the Forest Practice Act] for purposes of approval by the [Department.\u201d (\u00a7 4582.7, subd. (e).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pertinent here, a THP may be rejected if \u201c[implementation of the plan as proposed would cause a violation of any requirement of an applicable water quality control plan adopted or approved by the State Water Resources Control Board.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 898.2, subd. (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">An applicant whose THP has been disapproved by the Director may request a public hearing before the Board of Forestry, which then determines for itself whether the THP comports with the Forest Practice Act and related regulations. (\u00a7 4582.7, subd. (c).) Conversely, at its option either the State Water Resources Control Board or the Director of Fish and Game may appeal to the Board of Forestry a decision to approve a THP. (\u00a7 4582.9, subd. (a).) Any such appeal must be brought within 10 days of the THP\u2019s approval <em>(ibid.), </em>and requires prior agency participation in the multidisciplinary THP review process <em>(id., </em>subd. (b)). A hearing on an appeal shall be granted upon a Board of Forestry determination that the appeal raises substantial issues \u201cwith respect to the environment or to public safety.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Pacific Lumber contends that the foregoing provisions signal an intent to make the THP approval process the exclusive forum for evaluating a proposed timber harvest\u2019s effects on water quality. This being the case, Pacific Lumber argues, the Water Boards cannot go outside of this process and unilaterally impose water quality requirements above and beyond those incorporated within an approved THP.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">There is no dispute that, generally speaking, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (Wat. Code, \u00a7 13000 et seq.) (Porter-Cologne Act) vests the Water Boards with the authority to require water quality monitoring of the type at issue here. The Porter-Cologne Act seeks \u201cto attain the highest water quality which is reasonable, considering all demands being made and to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>made on [state] waters and the total values involved, beneficial and detrimental, economic and social, tangible and intangible.\u201d (Wat. Code, \u00a7 13000.) The Water Boards are \u201cthe principal state agencies with primary responsibility for the coordination and control of water quality.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 13001.) Under the Porter-Cologne Act, \u201c[a] regional board, in establishing or reviewing any water quality control plan or waste discharge requirements, or in connection with any action relating to any plan or requirement authorized by this division, may investigate the quality of any waters of the state within its region.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 13267, subd. (a).) In conducting an investigation, a \u201cregional board may require that any person who has discharged, discharges, or is suspected of having discharged or discharging, or who proposes to discharge waste within its region . . . shall furnish, under penalty of perjury, technical or monitoring program reports which the regional board requires.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 13267, subd. (b)(1).) When reviewing an order issued by a Regional Water Quality Control Board, the State Water Resources Control Board is \u201cvested with all the powers of the regional boards.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 13320, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">Pacific Lumber\u2019s argument is that while the Water Boards may require water quality monitoring as a general matter, the Forest Practice Act displaces their authority in this respect if the monitoring relates to logging activity pursuant to an approved THP. It would be more efficient and sensible, Pacific Lumber contends, to construe the Forest Practice Act\u2019s THP approval process as implicitly excluding other means of regulation. If other agencies were allowed to subsequently impose additional requirements on top of those compelled by the Department of Forestry, the argument goes, these agencies will have no incentive to participate in what the Legislature intended to be a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d process. Instead, the agencies will subject timber companies to repetitive regulatory review that will increase the costs associated with timber harvesting.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">This argument suffers from a fundamental flaw, in that it runs headlong into the Forest Practice Act\u2019s savings clause, which provides: \u201cNo provision of this chapter or any ruling, requirement, or policy of the [Board of Forestry] is a limitation on any of the following: [j[] (a) On the power of any city or county or city and county to declare, prohibit, and abate nuisances, [f] (b) On the power of the Attorney General, at the request of the [Board of Forestry], or upon his own motion, to bring an action in the name of the people of the State of California to enjoin any pollution or nuisance. [j[] (c) <em>On the power of any state agency in the enforcement or administration of any provision of law which it is specifically authorized or required to enforce or administer. </em>[f] (d) On the right of any person to maintain at any time any appropriate action for relief against any private nuisance as defined in Part 3 (commencing with Section 3479) of Division 4 of the Civil Code or for any other private relief.\u201d (\u00a7 4514, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>As the Court of Appeal ascertained, section 4514, subdivision (c)\u2019s proviso that \u201c[n]o provision of this chapter or any ruling, requirement, or policy of the [Board of Forestry] is a limitation on ... [][]... [][].. . the power of any state agency in the enforcement or administration of any provision of law which it is specifically authorized or required to enforce or administer\u201d is fatal to Pacific Lumber\u2019s argument. Pacific Lumber\u2019s position boils down to the view that the Forest Practice Act <em>implicitly </em>precludes the Water Boards from exercising their authority under the Porter-Cologne Act to impose monitoring requirements, where those requirements relate to timber harvesting undertaken pursuant to an approved THP. Section 4514, subdivision (c) <em>expressly </em>provides that the contrary is true, that the Forest Practice Act in no way limits the Water Boards\u2019 authority in this respect. As a direct and pellucid expression of legislative intent regarding the precise issue before us, section 4514, subdivision (c) controls the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Before the superior court, Pacific Lumber\u2019s attorneys contended that section 4514, subdivision (c) applies only in situations where the Forest Practice Act is vague or silent. This interpretation makes no sense; the very purpose of the savings clause is to preserve state agencies\u2019 authority as to matters implicated by the Forest Practice Act. Pacific Lumber\u2019s construction also ignores the obvious meaning of the directive that <em>\u201c[n]o provision </em>of this chapter\u201d will limit the power of a \u201cstate agency in the enforcement or administration of any provision of law which it is specifically authorized or required to enforce or administer.\u201d (\u00a7 4514, subd. (c), italics added.) We take the phrase \u201cno provision\u201d to mean what it says, that nothing within the Forest Practice Act\u2014including the THP approval and appeal process\u2014implicitly bars the Water Boards from fulfilling their independent obligations. \u201cIf there is no ambiguity in the language\u201d of a statute, \u201cwe presume the Legislature meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the statute governs.\u201d <em>(Hunt </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 984, 1000 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 236, 987 P.2d 705].)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Before this court, Pacific Lumber cites three federal decisions that declined to apply generic savings clauses. <em>(Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc. </em>(1992) 504 U.S. 374, 384-385 [119 L.Ed.2d 157, 112 S.Ct. 2031]; <em>International Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Ouellette </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 481, 493 [93 L.Ed.2d 883, 107 S.Ct. 805]; <em>Matter of Lifschultz Fast Freight Corp. </em>(7th Cir. 1995) 63 F.3d 621, 625-629.) These decisions are not binding upon our interpretation of the Forest Practice Act, and each is distinguishable. The pertinent savings clause in <em>International Paper Co. v. Ouellette, supra, </em>479 U.S. 481, by its own terms, did not preclude preemption of the supposedly \u201csaved\u201d claims. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 493.) Moreover, there the Supreme Court concluded that the savings clause manifested no \u201c \u2018considered judgment about what other remedies were previously available or continue to be available under any particular statute.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 494, fn. 14.) In <em>Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., supra, </em>504 U.S. 374, the savings clause could not be reconciled with another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>provision of the same law that expressly preempted certain claims. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 384-385.) <em>Matter of Lifschultz Fast Freight Corp., supra, </em>63 F.3d 621, addressed an ambiguous savings clause, one interpretation of which would have rendered other provisions of the same law superfluous; in interpreting the clause, the court observed that \u201cwhen we are forced to choose between specific statutory provisions and a general savings clause, we err on the side of the specific provisions in the belief that they reflect congressional intent more clearly. [Citation.] Absent a clearly expressed intention contrary to those more specific provisions, [citation], we simply cannot \u2018believe Congress intended to undermine this carefully drawn statute through a general savings clause,\u2019 [citation], consistent with our duty to \u2018make sense rather than nonsense of the corpus juris.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 629.)</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\">This case, of course, does not implicate the full spectrum of considerations that may be present where federal legislation contains a savings clause. Moreover, as pertinent here the cases cited by Pacific Lumber and other decisions addressing savings clauses in federal legislation (see, e.g., <em>Geier </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., Inc. </em>(2000) 529 U.S. 861, 867-874 [146 L.Ed.2d 914, 120 S.Ct. 1913]; <em>American Telephone and Telegraph Co. v. Central Office Telephone, Inc. </em>(1998) 524 U.S. 214, 227-228 [141 L.Ed.2d 222, 118 S.Ct. 1956]) merely establish a reluctance to construe a savings clause such that it conflicts with other, more specific provisions of a law or \u201c \u2018upset[s] [a] careful regulatory scheme established by federal law\u2019 \u201d <em>(Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., supra, </em>529 U.S. at p. 870; see also <em>Dowhal v. SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 910, 924\u2014926 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 262, 88 P.3d 1] [discussing <em>Geier]). </em>This principle is both unexceptional and inapplicable, for section 4514, subdivision (c) can be harmonized with the other provisions of the Forest Practice Act. (See <em>Wells v. Marina City Properties, Inc. </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 781, 788 [176 Cal.Rptr. 104, 632 P.2d 217] [wherever possible, legislation should be construed so as to harmonize and give meaning to its various elements].) The savings clause can be read as consistent with\u2014and indeed, a vital part of\u2014a regulatory scheme that encourages interagency teamwork in the THP approval process by providing forums for collaboration and the airing of any disagreements that may arise, but not at the cost of stripping state agencies of their respective authority to protect resources that may be affected by logging.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">None of the terms of the Forest Practice Act that Pacific Lumber relies upon compels a contrary conclusion, for we perceive no irreconcilable conflict between any of these provisions and the Forest Practice Act\u2019s savings clause. While Pacific Lumber stresses that under the Forest Practice Act the Director \u201cshall have the final authority to determine whether a timber harvesting plan is in conformance with the rules and regulations of the [Board of Forestry] and with [the Forest Practice Act]\u201d (\u00a7 4582.7, subd. (e)), this provision does not necessarily disturb the authority of <em>other </em>agencies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>enforce laws <em>other </em>than the Forest Practice Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is no inherent conflict between giving the Director final authority over the approval of THP\u2019s while at the same time preserving other state agencies\u2019 jurisdiction over the effects of timber harvesting on state resources under their purview. This approach simply creates a system of overlapping jurisdiction, an uncontroversial concept under our law even absent a savings clause like the one implicated here. (See, e.g., <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 422, 439-441 [217 Cal.Rptr. 16, 703 P.2d 354] [concluding that the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Fair Employment and Housing Commission, and the State Personnel Board shared concurrent jurisdiction over disciplinary actions and examinations involving state civil service employees]; <em>Orange County Air Pollution Control Dist. </em>v. <em>Public Util. Com. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 945, 953-954 [95 Cal.Rptr. 17, 484 P.2d 1361] [recognizing the concurrent jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission and air pollution control districts]; cf. <em>Resource Inv., Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 151 F.3d 1162, 1169 [finding no concurrent jurisdiction between federal agencies in a situation where no interagency savings clause was involved].) Being subject to regulation by both the Department of Forestry (to the extent Pacific Lumber proposed timber harvesting) and the Water Boards (to the extent this harvesting implicated the state\u2019s water resources' and the Water Boards\u2019 authority under the Porter-Cologne Act), Pacific Lumber was bound to comply with the more stringent monitoring requirements imposed by the State Water Resources Control Board. (See <em>Orange County Air Pollution Control Dist. </em>v. <em>Public Util. Com., supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 953-954; 37 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 31, 36 (1961).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>Likewise, we perceive no inherent inconsistency between a system allowing for concurrent jurisdiction and the Legislature\u2019s avowed desire to \u201ccreate and maintain an effective and comprehensive system of regulation and use of all timberlands.\u201d (\u00a74513.) \u201cComprehensive\u201d means, among other things, \u201c[including much; comprising many things; having a wide scope; inclusive.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Intemat. Diet. (2d ed. 1941) p. 550.) The creation of an \u201cinclusive\u201d means of timber management does not necessarily mandate the abolition of other methods of regulation. At oral argument, counsel for Pacific Lumber effectively conceded as much, acknowledging that the Water Boards <em>could </em>regulate the effects of timber harvesting on water resources if \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d following approval of a THP so required.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">Pacific Lumber also urges reversal on the ground that if the Water Boards are free to unilaterally impose monitoring requirements not included in a THP, they will have no incentive to participate in the head of agency appeal procedure authorized by section 4582.9. Pacific Lumber\u2019s position presumes an irrationally antagonistic relationship among the agencies participating in THP reviews. From the State Water Resources Control Board\u2019s perspective, a head of agency appeal oftentimes may be preferable to issuing orders under the agency\u2019s independent authority. The appeal process provides for prompt review of a THP approval<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, if the Board of Forestry agrees with the objector, allows the appealing agency to avoid the effort and expense that would be associated with issuing its own orders on the subject. A voluntary appeal process therefore can be understood as consistent with a policy of calling upon agencies to cooperatively evaluate the environmental impacts of a proposed timber harvest, while allowing these agencies to act on their own in situations where they cannot agree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>The Forest Practice Act\u2019s legislative history also distinguishes this case from those in which savings clauses were trumped by inconsistent provisions of a statute. (See, e.g., <em>International Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Ouellette, supra, </em>479 U.S. at p. 494, fn. 14.) Assembly member Edwin Z\u2019berg, the author of Assembly Bill No. 227 (1973-1974 Reg. Sess.), which would become the Forest Practice Act, wrote the Legislative Counsel for an opinion in advance of the bill\u2019s passage. The State Water Resources Control Board and the Department of Fish and Game had voiced concerns regarding Assembly Bill No. 227\u2019s proposed section 4562.7, which confers upon the Board of Forestry authority to promulgate rules regarding, among other subjects, the control of timber operations that result or threaten to result in unreasonable effects on the beneficial uses of state waters. The agencies feared that this provision, and rules promulgated thereunder, might be construed as superseding their own authority. Assembly member Z\u2019berg wrote the Legislative Counsel with his view that the language of proposed section 4514, subdivision (c) \u201cwould seem to allow the [State Water Resources Control Board] and the Regional Water Quality Control Boards to continue regulation of waste discharges from logging activities, including soil, bark, and other debris, whenever they affect water quality.\u201d (Assembly Member Edwin L. Z\u2019Berg, letter to Legislative Counsel regarding Assem. Bill No. 227 (1973-1974 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 6, 1973.) However, out of concern that \u201cthe specific language of Section 4562.7 might be considered by the courts to be such a clear expression of the Legislature as to the scope of regulations to be applied to logging that the State Board of Forestry rules would be considered paramount,\u201d he requested an opinion answering the following question: \u201cWill AB 227 in any way limit the jurisdiction or restrict the enforcement activities of the [State Water Resources Control Board], the Regional Water Quality Control Boards or the Department of Fish and Game?\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">The Legislative Counsel responded in the negative: \u201cAlthough the conduct of a timber operation may be subject also to the rules, regulations, and orders of other state agencies, there is nothing in the provisions of proposed Section 4562.7 which would provide that the rules adopted pursuant to that section are to supersede, be paramount to, or control over applicable rules, regulations, or orders of other state agencies. On the contrary, subdivision (c) of proposed Section 4514 specifically declares that no provision of proposed Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 4511) of Part 2 of Division 4, of which proposed Section 4562.7 is a part, or any ruling, requirement, or policy of the new State Board of Forestry, is a limitation on the power of any state agency in the enforcement or administration of any provision of law which it is specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>authorized or required to enforce or administer.\u201d (Ops. Cal. Legis. Counsel, No. 16456 (Aug. 10, 1973) Forestry (Assem. Bill No. 227) p. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\">Opinions of the Legislative Counsel, though not binding, are entitled to great weight when courts attempt to discern legislative intent. <em>(California Assn, of Psychology Providers </em>v. <em>Rank </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1, 17 [270 Cal.Rptr. 796, 793 P.2d 2].) Here, the Legislative Counsel\u2019s opinion recognized that the Forest Practice Act allows for overlapping agency jurisdiction in situations where timber harvesting also affects water resources. The legislative record thus establishes that the implications of section 4514, subdivision (c) were fully appreciated at the outset, and further demonstrates that the savings clause\u2019s plain language controls this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Pacific Lumber\u2019s other arguments also fail to persuade. The company purports to find support for its position in the Porter-Cologne Act\u2019s savings clause, Water Code section 13002. In certain respects, the language of Water Code section 13002 resembles that of section 4514. Water Code section 13002, subdivision (d) provides that \u201c[n]o provision of this division or any ruling of the state board or a regional board is a limitation . . . [][] ...[!]... [o]n the power of a state agency in the enforcement or administration of any provision of law which it is specifically permitted or required to enforce or administer.\u201d Pacific Lumber argues that the Water Boards\u2019 actions here have limited the Department of Forestry\u2019s ability to regulate timber harvesting under the Forest Practice Act, contrary to the language quoted <em>ante.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Like Pacific Lumber\u2019s other arguments, this contention takes the untenable position that the \u201cpower\u201d delegated by the Forest Practice Act to the Department of Forestry includes the <em>exclusive </em>authority to determine whether and how various environmental laws should apply to proposed timber harvesting activities. On the contrary, as relevant here, the Department of Forestry\u2019s power relates to the decision whether or not to approve a THP. The Water Board\u2019s orders did not limit the Department of Forestry\u2019s authority in this respect. At the same time, the Forest Practice Act\u2019s savings clause establishes that while THP approval is an essential step in the timber harvesting process, it is not necessarily the only regulatory hurdle a harvester must overcome. The Water Boards\u2019 orders signify their considered judgment that, regardless of whether a THP has been approved under the Forest Practice Act, under the Porter-Cologne Act a monitoring program also is appropriate. As previously established, the Department of Forestry\u2019s powers do not extend so far as to preclude sister agencies from regulating conduct that intrudes into their own spheres of authority. There was no violation of the Porter-Cologne Act\u2019s savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">Pacific Lumber also points to the Legislature\u2019s 2003 enactment of section 4582.71, which provides that a THP \u201cmay not be approved if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>appropriate regional water quality control board finds, based on substantial evidence, that the timber operations proposed in the plan will result in a discharge into a watercourse that has been classified as impaired due to sediment pursuant to subsection (d) of Section 303 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, that causes or contributes, to a violation of the regional water quality control plan.\u201d (\u00a7 4582.71, subd. (a).) Section 4582.71 does not apply directly to this case; both THP 520 and amendment No. 5 were approved long before the passage of Senate Bill No. 810, which added this section to the Forest Practice Act. Rather, Pacific Lumber ascribes significance to section 4582.71 as a reiteration of the Legislature\u2019s purported long-standing desire to have water quality issues addressed exclusively within the THP approval process. (Cf. <em>West Pico Furniture Co. v. Pacific Finance Loans </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 594, 610 [86 Cal.Rptr. 793, 469 P.2d 665] [later enactments may offer some insight into the legislative intent behind previously enacted laws].) We have already determined that no such intent informed the Forest Practice Act, and section 4582.71 does not alter this conclusion. \u201c[A]n expression of legislative intent in a later enactment is not binding upon a court in its construction of an earlier enacted statute, [although] it is a factor that may be considered.\u201d <em>(Cummins, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 478, 492 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 823, 115 P.3d 98].) Here, even if we were to assume for purposes of argument that, in allowing Regional Water Quality Control Boards to command the rejection of THP\u2019s, section 4582.71 also opaquely expresses a preference that the THP approval process be exhaustive,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> any insight into the enacting Legislature\u2019s intent gleaned from this assumption would pale before the evident purport of section 4514, subdivision (c). (See <em>County of Sonoma v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 982, 992 [241 Cal.Rptr. 215]; <em>Honey Springs Homeowners Assn. v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 1122, 1137 [203 Cal.Rptr. 886].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>Contrary to Pacific Lumber\u2019s argument that amendments to the Forest Practice Act have robbed the savings clause of its evident meaning, at least one such amendment has implicitly reaffirmed that the Department of Forestry and the Water Boards possess overlapping jurisdiction in situations where timber harvesting affects water resources. In 1979 the Legislature added section 4514.3, subdivision (a) to the Forest Practice Act. Section 4514.3, subdivision (a) exempts \u201c[tjimber operations conducted pursuant to [the Forest Practice Act] . . . from the waste discharge requirements of Article 4 (commencing with Section 13260) of Chapter 4 of Division 7 of the Water Code\u201d if \u201cboth [the Environmental Protection Agency] and the State Water Resources Control Board certify . . . that the provisions of [the Forest Practice Act] constitute best management practices for silviculture pursuant to Section 208 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.\u201d As the Court of Appeal noted, section 4514.3 \u201cdemonstrates that the Legislature knows how to specify that timber operations are exempt from other laws when it so intends.\u201d Moreover, this exemption would be unnecessary if, as Pacific Lumber argues, THP approval prevents the Water Boards from subsequently regulating the effects of timber operations on water quality.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">The legislative history of section 4514.3 also works against Pacific Lumber\u2019s position. In explaining the statute, the Legislative Counsel reiterated the earlier-expressed view that rules and regulations promulgated under the Forest Practice Act \u201cdo not supersede or control over any mies, regulations, or orders of the State Water Resources Control Board or of a regional board.\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Sen. Bill No. 667 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) 4 Stats 1979, Summary Dig., p. 203.) Similarly, an enrolled bill report relating to this measure explained: \u201c[The] mies and regulations [promulgated under the Forest Practice Act] do not supersede mies or regulations established by the State Water Resources Control Board or of a regional board. In effect, timber operations are subject to the provisions of regulations administered by both the State Board of Forestry and the State and regional water quality control boards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>although the two departments work closely together to avoid duplication.\u201d (Dept, of Finance, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 667 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 13, 1979, p. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">Section 4514.3, subdivision (a) also helps defeat Pacific Lumber\u2019s more nuanced contention, emphasized at oral argument, that while the Forest Practice Act might allow the Water Boards to regulate the effects of timber harvesting on water resources when circumstances change after the commencement of logging (as when it becomes clear that the protective provisions within a THP are inadequate), the Water Boards cannot impose additional requirements <em>before </em>any logging has begun, as they did here. The provisions of the Porter-Cologne Act referenced by section 4514.3 include sections contemplating the Water Boards\u2019 regulation of both existing and <em>proposed </em>discharges of waste. (See, e.g., Wat. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13260, subd. (a), 13263, subd. (a).) By implicitly recognizing the applicability of these provisions to timber operations (absent an exemption), section 4514.3, subdivision (a) also acknowledges the Water Boards\u2019 authority to regulate timber harvesting outside of the THP approval process even before logging has commenced. Furthermore, Pacific Lumber\u2019s position finds no support in the Forest Practice Act\u2019s savings clause, which contains no language limiting its applicability to situations when \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d force an agency\u2019s hand. Nor does Pacific Lumber\u2019s argument provide any guidance regarding when circumstances would have \u201cchanged\u201d sufficiently to allow for agency intervention. Also, to the extent that Pacific Lumber\u2019s various contentions seek to minimize the cost and expense of logging, it would seem counterproductive to delay agencies from acting, or imposing prophylactic measures, until such time as logging has begun, at which point a timber harvester already may have made a significant investment of time and money.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Finally, Pacific Lumber invokes two canons of statutory construction. First, \u201c[a]s a principle of construction, it is well established that a specific provision prevails over a general one relating to the same subject.\u201d <em>(Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1518, 1524 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 621].) The second canon invoked by Pacific Lumber, the doctrine of implied repeal, applies \u201c \u2018[w]hen two or more statutes . . . concern the same subject matter and are in irreconcilable conflict. . . .\u2019 [Citation.] In such cases, \u2018the doctrine of implied repeal provides that the most recently enacted statute expresses the will of the Legislature, and thus to the extent of the conflict impliedly repeals the other enactment.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lucky Stores, Inc. </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 553, 568 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 731, 950 P.2d 1086].) Neither interpretive rule assists Pacific Lumber here. The former doctrine only applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>when an irreconcilable conflict exists between the general and specific provisions <em>(People v. Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 385 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610]; <em>Medical Board v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1013-1014 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 381]); the latter, when the two acts are \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018irreconcilable, clearly repugnant, and so inconsistent that the two cannot have concurrent operation. The courts are bound, if possible, to maintain the integrity of both statutes if the two may stand together.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 569.) As previously discussed, there are no irreconcilable conflicts here, either within the Forest Practice Act as originally enacted, or between the savings clause and later amendments to the law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">All in all, Pacific Lumber makes several reasonable arguments suggesting that a \u201cone stop\u201d process for THP approval might have some beneficial aspects, at least from the timber harvester\u2019s point of view. But there are also valid reasons to allow for concurrent jurisdiction among various regulatory agencies. The Forest Practice Act\u2019s savings clause, read in context, expresses a clear preference for the latter approach, and we are not free to substitute a contrary judgment for the Legislature\u2019s considered conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">In a variation on the theme developed by the foregoing arguments, Pacific Lumber asserts that, in this particular matter, the Water Boards were collaterally estopped from imposing water quality monitoring requirements not included within THP 520, because the Department of Forestry already had determined that mandatory water quality monitoring was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">\u201cCollateral estoppel precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.\u201d <em>(Lucido v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 335, 341 [272 Cal.Rptr. 767, 795 P.2d 1223].) The doctrine applies \u201conly if several threshold requirements are fulfilled. First, the issue sought to be precluded from relitigation must be identical to that decided in a former proceeding. Second, this issue must have been actually litigated in the former proceeding. Third, it must have been necessarily decided in the former proceeding. Fourth, the decision in the former proceeding must be final and on the merits. Finally, the party against whom preclusion is sought must be the same as, or in privity with, the party to the former proceeding. [Citations.] The party asserting collateral estoppel bears the burden of establishing these requirements.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 341.) \u201cEven assuming all the threshold requirements are satisfied, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>our analysis is not at an end. We have repeatedly looked to the public policies underlying the doctrine before concluding that collateral estoppel should be applied in a particular setting.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 342-343.)</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">We have recognized that \u201c[collateral estoppel may be applied to decisions made by administrative agencies.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sims </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 468, 479 [186 Cal.Rptr. 77, 651 P.2d 321].) For an administrative decision to have collateral estoppel effect, it and its prior proceedings must possess a judicial character. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Indicia of proceedings undertaken in a judicial capacity include a hearing before an impartial decision maker; testimony given under oath or affirmation; a party\u2019s ability to subpoena, call, examine, and cross-examine witnesses, to introduce documentary evidence, and to make oral and written argument; the taking of a record of the proceeding; and a written statement of reasons for the decision. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 480.)</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Collateral estoppel does not apply here. As it pertains to the Water Boards, the interagency THP review and approval process does not possess a judicial character.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court of Appeal accurately observed that the process lacks many of the indicia of proceedings imbued with a judicial character, such as an opportunity to call and cross-examine witnesses. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Sims, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 480.) More fundamentally, the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board\u2019s principal role in the review of THP 520 and amendment No. 5 was to provide input on significant issues relating to water quality. We are unaware of any California decisions finding a basis for collateral estoppel in similarly consultative participation in an essentially collaborative process, and Pacific Lumber cites to none. The Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>Forestry\u2019s decision to approve amendment No. 5 therefore did not bar the Water Boards\u2019 monitoring orders under collateral estoppel principles.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\">Our decision not to apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel also rests on a second, related ground. \u201c[A] court may not give preclusive effect to the decision in a prior proceeding if doing so is contrary to the intent of the legislative body that established the proceeding in which res judicata or collateral estoppel is urged.\u201d <em>(Brosterhous </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 315, 326 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 87, 906 P.2d 1242].) Such is the case here. Granting collateral estoppel effect to the Department of Forestry\u2019s decisions, to the extent it would allow the Department of Forestry\u2019s conclusions to prevail over the contrary views of other agencies acting within the scope of their respective statutory authority, essentially would read section 4514, subdivision (c) out of the Forest Practice Act. The THP process is designed to give the Department of Forestry the benefit of the Regional Water Quality Control Boards\u2019 expertise through nonadversarial consultation. Section 4514, subdivision (c) establishes that participation in this process will not prevent the Water Boards from taking additional measures deemed necessary to protect water quality. Finding collateral estoppel applicable would undermine the intended nature of the THP review process by compelling agencies such as the Water Boards to sharply contest every disputed matter, or attempt to withdraw entirely from the process, for fear of having subsequent enforcement efforts blocked by a Department of Forestry finding. These considerations provide an additional basis upon which to conclude that collateral estoppel does not apply here.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>III.

The basin plan involved here, excerpts of which we judicially notice upon the State Water Resources Control Board\u2019s request (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 452, subd. (c), 459), provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he discharge of soil, silt, slash, sawdust, or other organic and earthen material from any logging, construction, or associated activity of whatever nature into any stream or watercourse in the basin in quantities deleterious to fish, wildlife, or other beneficial uses is prohibited,\u201d and \u201c[t]he placing or disposal of soil, silt, bark, slash, sawdust, or other organic and earthen material from any logging, construction, or associated activity of whatever nature at locations where such material could pass into any stream or watercourse in the basin in quantities which could be deleterious to fish, wildlife, or other beneficial uses is prohibited.\u201d (North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, Water Quality Control Plan for the North Coast Region, p. 4-32.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b970-8\"> The phrase \u201cfor purposes of approval by the [Department\u201d was added to section 4582.7, subdivision (e) in 2003, in connection with other changes to the Forest Practice Act that allowed Regional Water Quality Control Boards to instruct the Director to disapprove THP\u2019s in certain situations. (See \u00a7 4582.71, added by Stats. 2003, ch. 900, \u00a7 3.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b974-4\"> Section 4582.7\u2019s language regarding the Director\u2019s \u201cfinal authority\u201d was added to the statute in 1995. (Stats. 1995, ch. 612, \u00a7 3, p. 4590.) Just five days prior to oral argument in this matter, and several months after the completion of briefing, Pacific Lumber filed a request asking this court to take judicial notice of several legislative and executive analyses and reports pertaining to this amendment. Pacific Lumber did not adequately explain why the request was filed so late, and we deny the request. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 453, subd. (a).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b974-5\"> We are not faced here with a situation in which it would be literally impossible for a timber harvester to simultaneously comply with conflicting directives issued by the Department of Forestry and the Water Boards. We trust that agencies strive to avoid such conflicts, and express no opinion here regarding the appropriate outcome in a case involving irreconcilable orders. (Cf. <em>State Personnel Bd. v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 442, fn. 20 [noting that \u201cany conflicts which may arise in this area can be resolved either by administrative accommodation between the two agencies themselves or, failing that, by sensitive application of evolving judicial principles\u201d].) On this topic, the State Water Resources Control Board has requested judicial notice, as an official act by executive agencies (Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (c)), of a memorandum of understanding between Regional Water Quality Control Boards, the Department of Forestry, and itself executed in 2003. This memorandum sets forth procedures aimed at resolving interagency conflicts within the THP review process, and additionally provides that where the Department of Forestry and the Water Boards disagree, the Water Boards \u201cmay proceed to take whatever action they believe is appropriate under their independent statutory authority.\u201d (Mem. Between State Water Resources Control Board, Designated Regional Water Quality Control Boards, and Cal. Dept, of Forestry and Fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>Protection, p. 10.) We grant this request. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 452, subd.

City of Los Angeles </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 155, 172, fn. 10 [125 Cal.Rptr.2d 474]; <em>Dunn-Edwards Corp. </em>v. <em>South Coast Air Quality Management Dist. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 536, 543, fn. 3 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 99].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b975-9\"><em> </em>The Board of Forestry must conduct a public hearing on a head of agency appeal within 30 days after an appeal is filed, or a longer period mutually agreed upon by the Board of Forestry, the appealing agency, and the THP submitter.

(d).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b975-10\"> Pacific Lumber also relies upon a passage from an enrolled bill report for Senate Bill No. 1568, the measure that added the head of agency appeal to the Forest Practice Act. The report states, \u201cIn recent court cases involving THPs the agencies have been pitted against each other to the disadvantage of the state. An administrative hearing on an appeal would forestall such tactics.\u201d (Dept, of Forestry, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 1568 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 1, 1989, p. 1.) Pacific Lumber suggests that this language reflects an intent to channel all interagency disputes through the THP process. Even assuming that the report affords some insight into the Legislature\u2019s intent (see <em>Elsner v. Uveges </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 915, 934, fn. 19 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 530, 102 P.3d 915]), the excerpted language appears only to reflect a desire to lessen the need for court action by providing aggrieved agencies with the option of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>an administrative appeal. It does not suggest that the Legislature intended for the THP approval process to provide the exclusive means of addressing the environmental impacts of timber harvesting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b978-4\"> However, a legislative analysis of Senate Bill No. 810 remarked upon the Water Boards\u2019 authority over water quality issues relating to timber harvesting, observing that \u201c[Regional boards have various enforcement possibilities under Porter-Cologne as violations of basin plans become evident, but this bill would enhance their role at the beginning of the approval process.\u201d (Sen. Rules Com., Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 810 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) May 6, 2003, p. 2.) Another analysis of Senate Bill No. 810 commented, \u201c[the State Water Resources Control Board] contends that there are no costs to either [the State Water Resources Control Board] or [the Regional Water Quality Control Boards] because the bill codifies current practices and does not explicitly require a [Regional Water Quality Control Board] to participate in the THP approval process to any greater extent than it does now.\u201d (Sen. Rules Com., Analysis of Sen. Bill. No. 810 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 9, 2003, p. 4.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b978-5\"> Pacific Lumber also asserts that provisions of the Timberland Productivity Act of 1982, Government Code section 51100 et seq., support its view that the Water Boards lack authority to impose monitoring requirements exceeding those incorporated within a THP. Pacific Lumber specifically points to the Timberland Productivity Act\u2019s declaration that the state\u2019s policy is to \u201c[ejncourage investment in timberlands based on reasonable expectation of harvest\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 51102, subd. (a)(4)), and provisions relating to local or nuisance-related restrictions on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>timber operations <em>(id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 51102, subd. (b), 51115.5). We do not perceive in any of these provisions meaningful support for the position that the Forest Practice Act, notwithstanding its savings clause, prohibits state agencies specifically entrusted with the coordination and control of water quality from fulfilling their statutory obligations insofar as they relate to timber operations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b979-6\"> Of similar import is Water Code, section 13269, subdivision (a) (as amended by Stats. 2003, ch. 801, \u00a7 1), which allows the Water Boards to issue waivers from certain waste discharge requirements. Subdivision (a)(4)(D) of Water Code section 13269 specifically recognizes that silviculture operations are eligible for these waivers. If the Legislature had intended for the Forest Practice Act\u2019s THP approval procedures to trump the Water Boards\u2019 authority to regulate timber harvesting, there would be no reason for the Porter-Cologne Act to discuss these waivers for logging operations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b981-7\"> Pacific Lumber also argues that the State Water Resources Control Board\u2019s actions raise \u201cserious constitutional concerns\u201d because they \u201cwould allow timberland owners to be deprived of the only use they can make of their lands.\u201d This assertion references and relies upon Pacific Lumber\u2019s argument that the Water Boards\u2019 actions resulted in an uncompensated taking of their property. (See U.S. Const., 5th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 19.) As discussed <em>post, </em>Pacific Lumber has forfeited this claim by failing to develop it before the trial court. There are no \u201cserious constitutional concerns\u201d involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b982-6\"> Pacific Lumber claims that opinions concluding that the Director\u2019s decision whether to approve a THP is subject to writ review under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 (see, e.g., <em>Friends of the Old Trees </em>v. <em>Department of Forestry &amp; Fire Protection </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1392 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 297]) demonstrate that this approval decision is quasi-judicial for collateral estoppel purposes. The discussions Pacific Lumber draws upon were concerned with whether section 1085 or section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure provided the appropriate avenue of writ review following the approval of a THP. As the Court of Appeal below concluded, these decisions provide little guidance in the instant context. As pertinent here, that an administrative decision is deemed amenable to review under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, by itself, establishes only that the decision \u201cinvolved the application of \u2018a rule ... to a specific set of existing facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Sims, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 480; see also <em>Patterson v. Central Coast Regional Com. </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 833, 840-841 [130 Cal.Rptr. 169].) Though this is a factor to be considered in determining whether an administrative decision was quasi-judicial for collateral estoppel purposes <em>(People v. Sims, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 480), it is not conclusive (see <em>Mahon v. Safeco Title Ins. Co. </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 616, 622 [245 Cal.Rptr. 103]), and to the extent it applies here it is outweighed by the countervailing considerations discussed <em>ante.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b983-5\"> Pacific Lumber asserts that in deciding whether the Water Boards are collaterally estopped, we must take into account the procedures, including the right to call witnesses, that are implicated when (he State Water Resources Control Board appeals the approval of a THP to the Board of Forestry. (See \u00a7 4582.9, subd. (d) [discussing appeal procedures].) No such appeal was taken here. Pacific Lumber refers to only one decision for the proposition that a reviewing court must consider procedures available in appeal proceedings that were not utilized when determining whether an administrative determination was quasi-judicial for collateral estoppel purposes. This decision, <em>Plaine </em>v. <em>McCabe </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 797 F.2d 713, does not support Pacific Lumber\u2019s position, for it addressed whether a quasi-judicial administrative decision <em>loses </em>its collateral estoppel effect when a party fails to seek judicial review\u2014an issue that arises from almost the precise opposite of the situation involved here. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 719, fn. 12.) In any event, even if the procedures involved with a head of agency appeal had to be taken into account, and assuming further that these additional procedures imbued the THP approval proceedings and decision with a quasi-judicial import, as stated in the text <em>ante, </em>we would still decline to afford collateral estoppel effect to the Department of Forestry\u2019s decision because doing so would deviate from the aims and terms of the Forest Practice Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b983-6\"> Because we reject Pacific Lumber\u2019s collateral estoppel argument on the above two grounds, we need not determine whether Pacific Lumber has satisfied its burden of establishing the other elements of collateral estoppel. We also decline to entertain Pacific Lumber\u2019s takings claim. (See U.S. Const., 5th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 19.) We agree with the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that Pacific Lumber has forfeited this claim by failing to develop it before the trial court. Competent evaluation of this argument would require consideration of numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>contested facts, making it inappropriate for an appellate court to take up the issue in the first instance.
