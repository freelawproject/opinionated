There is nothing in the record to establish a basis for financial damages as claimed by appellee. The testimony only touches on the fact that there were certain construction defects in the roof and sewer lines and inconvenience to the shopkeeper appellee, but totally failed to set a monetary damage figure from which the court could make an award certain. For that reason the ruling in favor of appellee on the counterclaim is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART with instructions for the court below to issue a Final Judgment in conformity with this ruling.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
