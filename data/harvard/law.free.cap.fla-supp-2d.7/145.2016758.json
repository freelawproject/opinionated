FLORIDA BUDGET LOAN PLAN, INC.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b163-4\">Case No. 83-269-AP</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b163-5\">Eleventh Judicial Circuit, Appellate Division, Dade County</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ALi\">October 3, 1984</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-11\">APPEARANCES OF COUNSEL</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A7k\">Craig Talesman for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-12\">Carl L.

The only question is the validity of the service since a Default was entered against the Garnishee.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-17\">Florida Statute 48.081 carefully delineates the order of preference of service on a foreign corporation, and it must be strictly construed. The reason for setting forth this order of preference for service of process is to constitutionally and fairly balance the rights of a foreign corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>to receive <em>actual </em>notice in sufficient time to raise legal defenses against the corresponding rights of Florida citizens to seek and obtain legal redress against foreign corporations doing business in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\">(*3) of F.S. 48.081 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">\u201cAs an alternative to all foregoing, process may be served on the agent designated by the corporation under Section 48.091. <em>However, if service cannot be made on a registered agent because of failure to comply with Section 48.091, service of process shall be permitted on any employee at the corporation\u2019s place of </em>business.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">There is no dispute in the record that Baker Concrete complied with Florida Statute 48.091.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Herein, the Writ of Garnishment was defective in that the directions to the Sheriff for service of said Writ were directed to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">\u201cBaker Concrete Construction, Inc., Attn: Personnel, 4647 Orange Drive Fort Lauderdale, Florida\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Since \u201cpersonnel\u201d is neither of the categories listed in paragraph (*1) or (2) and a resident agent was available for service of process as set forth in paragraph (3), Appellee was not entitled to serve an employee until <em>after </em>exhausting attempts at service on any of the higher categories. For this reason the Final Judgment against Garnishee-Appellant must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">PER CURIAM is hereby reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
