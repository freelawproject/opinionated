The Defendant plead not guilty and waived trial by jury. Thereafter, the Defendant filed a Motion to Suppress roadside sobriety tests. The Appellee contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the sobriety tests were obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. More particularly, Defendant argues that the roadside tests constituted custodial interrogation and should have been preceded by <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>warnings and that since <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not given the tests had to be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\">A hearing was held on Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress, at which time the following testimony was elicited: the arresting officer stopped Defendant\u2019s vehicle while he was proceeding in the wrong direction on a one-way street. He approached Defendant\u2019s vehicle and asked for identification. The Defendant produced his license from his wallet. The officer observed the Defendant had bloodshot eyes and slurred speech. He requested Defendant to exit his vehicle. After Defendant exited his vehicle the officer offered the Defendant to perform roadside sobriety tests. The officer did not advise the Defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. After the Defendant performed the roadside tests, he was placed under arrest for driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The State position was that roadside tests are not of a testimonial or communicative nature that would require that <em>Miranda </em>warnings be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Thereafter, the trial court granted the Motion to Suppress on the grounds that the Defendant was entitled to be advised of his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda, </em>prior to the roadside test being performed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The primary issue before us involves the Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Presented with a fact situation similar to the one before us, the Supreme Court reviewed the scope of the Fifth Amendment in <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 86 S. Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966), and reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">\u201cIt is clear that the protection of the privilege reaches an accused\u2019s communications, whatever form they might take, and the compulsion of responses which are also communications, for example, compliance with a subpoena to produce one\u2019s paper .... On the other hand, both federal and state courts have usually held that it offers no protection against compulsion to submit to fingerprinting, photographing, or measurements, to write or speak for identification, to appear in court, to stand, to assume a stance, to walk, or to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>a particular gesture. The distinction which has emerged, often expressed in different ways, is that the privilege is a bar against compelling \u2018communications\u2019 or \u2018testimony\u2019, but the compulsion which makes a suspect or accused the source of \u2018real or physical evidence\u2019 does not violate it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Following <em>Schmerber, </em>the Supreme Court further clarified the meaning of the phrase testimonial or communicative nature in: <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967); <em>Gilbert v. California, </em>388 U.S. 263, 87 SCt. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967); and <em>United States v. Dionisio, </em>410 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 764, 35 L.Ed.2d 7 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Schmerber </em>and <em>Miranda, </em>we must now determine whether the roadside sobriety test is of such a nature that it effectively compels a confession from its subject, or instead, whether it acts merely to compel the exhibition of physical characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">We adopt the reasoning contained in <em>State v. Arsenault, </em>115 N.H. 109, 336 A.2s 244 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">\u201c[Field sobriety tests] are premised upon the relationship between intoxication and the externally manifested loss of coordination which it causes. These tests do not seek to compel from the defendant any knowledge he might have; nor do they involve the defendant\u2019s communicative faculties in any way. They only compel him to exhibit his physical characteristics of coordination Thus, the field sobriety tests do not constitute testimonial compulsion but are merely a source of real or physical evidence and are not within the privilege against self-incrimination. (Citations omitted.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">We reject this Defendant\u2019s claim that a sobriety test violates his Fifth Amendment Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Field sobriety tests are physical and real evidence and do not activate the protections afforded by the Fifth Amendment. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s Order granting the Motion to Suppress was in error, we therefore REVERSE AND REMAND FOR TRIAL.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-9\"> <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 437, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b120-10\"> The trial court did not feel bound by <em>State v.
