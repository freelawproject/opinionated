(See <em>Holl v. Talcott, </em>191 So.2d 40 (Fla. 1966); <em>Guy v. Kight, </em>397 So.2d 402 (Fla. 5th DCA 1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-16\">In the instant case two insurance companies provided coverage for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>the accident although each policy was for a different insured. One insurance company paid the entire amount to its claimant, and then the company that paid sought a proration of the amount paid from the second insurance company. We find that <em>Allstate Insurance Co. v. Dairyland Insurance Co., </em>271 So.2d 457 (Fla. 1972) is on all fours and is dispositive of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\">In view of our findings the matter is reversed \u00e1nd remanded to the trial court for a trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED with directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">WETHERINGTON and LANTZ concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
