J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACsB\">J.C. and Anna C. appeal orders denying a petition to transfer dependency jurisdiction to the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa in Minnesota under title 25 United States Code section 1911(b) and Welfare and Institutions Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 305.5, subdivision (b). We reverse the orders with directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">J.C. and Anna C. (the parents) have four children, Jackie R, Elizabeth R, Andrew P. and Jack C., Ill (Jack). Jackie is now 18 years old and is not the subject of these proceedings. Elizabeth, Andrew and Jack (the children) are ages 16, 15 and 4 years, respectively. The family\u2019s history was detailed in a previous appeal. <em>(In re Jack C. Ill </em>(Jun. 11, 2008, D052156) [nonpub. opn.].) Here, because the issues on appeal concern compliance with the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, title 25 United States Code section 1901 et seq. (ICWA), we only briefly discuss the underlying circumstances of the dependency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The parents have a history of child welfare referrals due to substance abuse, domestic violence and Anna\u2019s mental health condition, which was diagnosed as schizophrenia. In 2005, to avoid dependency proceedings, the maternal grandparents became the legal guardians of Jackie, Elizabeth and Andrew. Jack was bom in June 2006. In September 2007, after Anna was arrested for assaulting and injuring Jackie, Jack became a dependent of the juvenile court and was placed with his maternal grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">When Jack\u2019s dependency proceedings began, J.C. informed the social worker his paternal grandmother, Dorothy Ann B., was a registered Chippewa Indian. J.C. did not know whether he or his siblings were registered tribal members. They had lived on the Nett Lake Chippewa reservation for one to two years in the late 1960\u2019s. J.C. did not have contact information for his siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">In October 2007 the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (the Agency) sent notice to the six bands of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The bands indicated Jack was not eligible for enrollment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In January 2008 the court found that ICWA did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">In April 2009 the court terminated reunification services in Jack\u2019s case and set a section 366.26 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>In May 2009 the Agency initiated dependency proceedings on behalf of Elizabeth and Andrew (the siblings). The grandparents could not manage the siblings\u2019 out-of-control behaviors and decided to terminate the guardianship. The siblings were living with the parents, whose chaotic circumstances had not changed since Jack was detained in protective custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">When the siblings\u2019 dependency proceedings began, J.C. reported that his maternal great-grandparents were members of the Nett Lake Indian tribe and his brothers and sisters were registered members of the tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">In September 2009 the social worker contacted the children\u2019s paternal uncle, who said he was a member of the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa (Band). The social worker sent notice to the Band with more information about the family than had it provided to the Band in 2007. On receipt of notice, the Band stated the children were eligible for enrollment and notified the trial court of its intent to intervene in the children\u2019s dependency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">On October 7, 2009, J.C. petitioned to transfer jurisdiction of the children\u2019s dependency cases to the Band (the transfer petition). On October 15, the Band notified the trial court it was exercising its right to intervene in the children\u2019s cases under title 25 United States Code section 1911(c). On October 19, Angela Wright, the Indian child welfare supervisor for the Band, averred the children\u2019s dependency proceedings were governed by ICWA because the minor children were eligible or enrolled members of the Band.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">The Agency opposed J.C.\u2019s petition to transfer jurisdiction to the Band. The court continued the hearings in the children\u2019s cases to allow the Band to respond to the transfer petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">In Jack\u2019s case, the court considered the transfer petition at his section 366.26 hearing, which began on March 5, 2010. The court admitted the Agency\u2019s reports in evidence. Angela Wright appeared telephonically on behalf of the Band. She testified the Band was in agreement with termination of parental rights and Jack\u2019s adoption by his maternal grandparents. Wright was not aware of the tribal court\u2019s position on accepting jurisdiction; however, the Bois Forte Commissioner of Judicial Services was scheduled to meet with the Band\u2019s prosecuting attorney, Thomas Sjogren, to determine the Band\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">On March 19, 2010, the court admitted a letter it had received from Sjogren in evidence. Sjogren stated he represented the Band in all child protection proceedings in its tribal court. The Band did not join the father\u2019s petition to transfer jurisdiction; however, it formally intervened in the children\u2019s cases on October 15, 2009, under title 25 United States Code section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>1911(c). The Band did not automatically accept transfers. The tribal court considered each case on its merits and assessed the effect transfer may have on the child, the parent seeking transfer and the Band. The tribal court did not issue advisory opinions and would not determine whether to accept or decline jurisdiction until the state court transferred the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Sjogren stated that according to the tribal enrollment coordinator for the Band, J.C. was not currently a member of the Band. J.C.\u2019s enrollment application was incomplete pending receipt of a certified copy of his birth certificate. The children \u201cpossess[ed] a Bois Forte degree of Indian blood of 1/4\u201d and were eligible for enrollment. However, their applications for enrollment could not be completed until J.C.\u2019s application was processed.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">With respect to the children\u2019s status, Sjogren wrote, \u201cThere is no question in my mind that these are Indian children who will ultimately be enrolled in the Bois Forte Band of Lake Superior Chippewa upon completion by someone of the necessary paperwork.\u201d Sjogren stated the \u201cbureaucratic\u201d requirements were necessary because in addition to ICWA protections, there were substantial other benefits associated with tribal membership, including hunting, fishing, trapping and gathering privileges, annual per capita distributions from the Band, and eligibility for tribal, state and federal programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Wright testified that the tribal court was able to take custody over children before they were enrolled in the Band. The Band could then complete the enrollment process. Jack\u2019s adoptive parent would also be able to enroll him in the Band.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">The trial court denied the motion to transfer jurisdiction in Jack\u2019s case. The court stated it was not satisfied Jack was \u201can Indian child as defined by the law, notwithstanding that he may later become an Indian child and notwithstanding there\u2019s no doubt he may later become an Indian child.\u201d The court said even if Jack was an Indian child, the petition to transfer jurisdiction to the Band was not filed within a reasonable time after notice of the entirety of the proceedings. The court incorporated the arguments of the Agency and minor\u2019s counsel in its findings. Counsel had argued transferring jurisdiction to the Band would create an undue hardship for the parties and impede the presentation of evidence on Jack\u2019s behalf. The trial court found that Jack was adoptable and terminated parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">On June 2, 2010, at the conclusion of the contested disposition hearing in the siblings\u2019 cases, the court stated Elizabeth and Andrew were not currently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>members of the Band and therefore were not Indian children within the meaning of ICWA. Without further hearing, the court took judicial notice of Jack\u2019s file, and incorporated by reference its findings and orders with respect to the transfer petition. The court bypassed reunification services and ordered alternative permanent placement plans of long-term foster care for the siblings. Wright appeared telephonically and concurred with the recommended disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The Agency informed the court it had a certified copy of J.C.\u2019s birth certificate in its possession. The court ordered the Agency to send J.C.\u2019s birth certificate to the Band.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">APPELLATE MOTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">In <em>In re Elizabeth R, </em>the Agency asks this court to augment the record with a status review report dated November 18, 2010, to show that the siblings are enrolled members of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. (Cal. Rules of Court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rule 8.155(a)(1)(A) [on the motion of any party, the reviewing court may augment the record to include any document filed or lodged in the case in superior court].) In <em>In re Jack C. Ill, </em>J.C. asks this court to take judicial notice of the same report for the same purpose. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 909; Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 452, 459.)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">We grant the motion to augment the record with the Agency\u2019s November 18, 2010 report and the request to take judicial notice that the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe enrolled Elizabeth and Andrew as tribal members on November 4, 2010. Minor\u2019s counsel also informs this court the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe enrolled Jack as a tribal member on November 17, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">ICWA</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">The United States Congress enacted ICWA to respond to a crisis in which large numbers of Indian children were being removed from their families for placement in non-Indian homes. <em>(Mississippi Choctaw Indian Band v. Holyfield </em>(1989) 490 U.S. 30, 32 [104 L.Ed.2d 29, 109 S.Ct. 1597] <em>(Holyfield).) </em>ICWA was designed to protect the best interests of Indian children and promote the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>stability and security of Indian tribes and families by establishing minimum federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families by state courts and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902; <em>In re Kahlen </em>W. (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1414, 1421 [285 Cal.Rptr. 507].)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">At the heart of ICWA are its jurisdictional provisions over child custody proceedings<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> involving Indian children domiciled both on and off the reservation. <em>(Doe v. Mann </em>(9th Cir. 2005) 415 F.3d 1038, 1049, citing <em>Holyfield, supra, </em>490 U.S. at p. 36.) ICWA clearly establishes a preference for tribal court jurisdiction in child custody proceedings involving Indian children. <em>(In re M.M. </em>(2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 897, 907 [65 Cal.Rptr.3d 273]; accord, <em>In the Interest of J.W. </em>(Iowa Ct.App. 1995) 528 N.W.2d 657, 660; <em>In re J.L.P. </em>(Colo.App. 1994) 870 P.2d 1252, 1256.) The tribal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over any child custody proceeding involving an Indian child who resides or is domiciled within the tribal reservation. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(a); Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 305.5, subd. (a).) When a child custody proceeding involves an Indian child who is not domiciled on the reservation, ICWA creates <em>concurrent but presumptively tribal jurisdiction, </em>which requires the state court to transfer jurisdiction to the tribal court unless good cause exists to deny the transfer. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(b); Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 305.5, subd. (b); <em>Holyfield, supra, </em>490 U.S. at p. 36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Before we turn to the discussion whether the court erred when it found that there was good cause to deny the petition to transfer jurisdiction of the children\u2019s cases to the Band, we address the parents\u2019 contention the court erred when it denied the transfer on the ground the children were not yet Indian children within the meaning of ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">THE CHILDREN WERE INDIAN CHILDREN</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">The parents argue the court erred when it found that the children were not Indian children and denied the transfer petition on the ground ICWA did not apply. They contend the children were Indian children within California\u2019s definition of \u201cIndian child.\u201d The parents further state in the event the children did not meet the definition of an \u201cIndian child\u201d under title 25 United States Code section 1903(4), the court was required to proceed as if the children were Indian children under rule 5.482(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>The Agency contends the definition of \u201cIndian child\u201d under federal law is jurisdictional. It argues California law cannot be interpreted to authorize broader or expanded protection for a child who is not an Indian child under the plain terms of the federal statute. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">(D Issues of law are reviewed de novo. <em>(Imperial Merchant Services, Inc. v. Hunt </em>(2009) 47 Cal.4th 381, 387 [97 Cal.Rptr.3d 464, 212 P.3d 736] <em>(Hunt).) </em>ICWA, federal guidelines implementing ICWA, and any state statutes, regulations or rules promulgated to implement ICWA shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purpose and preferences. (Bureau of Indian Affairs; Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, 44 Fed.Reg. 67584, A.l. (Nov. 26, 1979) (Guidelines).)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">ICWA sets forth minimum substantive and procedural standards to protect the interests of Indian children, Indian families and Indian tribes. <em>(In re Kahlen W., supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 1421; 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1921; accord, Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 224, subd. (d).) To fully effectuate ICWA in state Indian child custody proceedings, the California Legislature enacted a comprehensive reorganization of statutes related to the application of ICWA, effective January 1, 2007. (\u00a7 224 et seq.; <em>In re Damian C. </em>(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 192, 197 [100 Cal.Rptr.3d 110] [\u201c \u2018[Although ICWA was enacted more than 25 years ago, state courts and county agencies in California continue to violate not only the spirit and intent of ICWA, but also its express provisions.\u2019 \u201d].) The reorganization of statutes and codification into state law of various provisions of ICWA, the Guidelines and state court rules affirmed the state\u2019s interest in \u201c \u2018protecting Indian children and the child\u2019s interest in having tribal membership and a connection to the tribal community.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Damian C., </em>at p. 197.)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">In certain respects, California\u2019s Indian child custody framework sets forth greater protections for Indian children, their tribes and parents than ICWA. <em>(In re Damian C., supra, </em>178 Cal.App.4th at p. 197 [legislative purpose was to broaden the interpretation of current laws]; see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 224, subd. (d), 224.3, subd. (e)(1), 305.5.) Both federal and state law expressly provide that if a state or federal law provides a higher level of protection to the rights of the parent or Indian guardian of an Indian child, the higher standard shall prevail. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1921; Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 224, subd. (d) [the higher standard of protection also applies to the rights of the child\u2019s Indian tribe].)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Although the children were not enrolled members of the Band at the time of the proceedings, we conclude they were Indian children within the meaning of the federal and state definitions of \u201cIndian child.\u201d Title 25 United States Code section 1903 states, <em>\u201c[Ejxcept as may be specifically provided </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number><em>otherwise, </em>the term\u2014[f] . . . [f] \u2018Indian child\u2019 means any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe . . . .\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(4), italics added.) Similarly, under California law, section 224.1, subdivision (a) provides that <em>\u201cunless the context requires </em>otherwise,\u201d the term \u201cIndian child\u201d is defined as provided in section 1903 of ICWA. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 224.1, subd. (a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The United States Supreme Court noted that \u201c[a] tribe\u2019s right to define its own membership for tribal purposes has long been recognized as central to its existence as an independent political community,\u201d and cautioned against intrusion into tribal traditions by the courts. <em>(Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez </em>(1978) 436 U.S. 49, 72, fn. 32 [56 L.Ed.2d 106, 98 S.Ct. 1670].) ICWA applies to children who are \u201cmembers\u201d of a tribe, but does not constrain how membership is to be defined. <em>(In re Adoption of C.D.K. </em>(D. Utah 2009) 629 F.Supp.2d 1258, 1261, 1264; <em>In re R.R., Jr. </em>(Tex.App. 2009) 294 S.W.3d 213, 218 [ICWA does not provide a statutory definition of the terms \u201c \u2018member of an Indian tribe\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018eligible for membership\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">\u201cIt is the tribe\u2019s prerogative to determine membership criteria.\u201d (Guidelines,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 B.I., Commentary; see Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 224.3, subd. (c).) \u201cEnrollment is the common evidentiary means of establishing Indian status, but it is not the only means nor is it necessarily determinative.\u201d (Guidelines, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 B.I., Commentary.) Congress considered and rejected proposed language that would have limited the application of ICWA protections to enrolled members of Indian tribes. <em>(Nelson </em>v. <em>Hunter </em>(1995) 132 Or.App. 361 [888 P.2d 124, 126, fn. 4], citing 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 7530, 7538-7539, 7558-7563.) Thus enrollment in a tribe is not always required to be a member of a tribe. <em>(U.S. v. Broncheau </em>(9th Cir. 1979) 597 F.2d 1260, 1263; <em>In re Jose C. </em>(2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 844, 849 [66 Cal.Rptr.3d 355] [children did not meet federal definition of \u201cIndian child\u201d because enrollment was required under tribal law and neither the children nor their mother were enrolled in the tribe]; <em>In re Kahlen W., supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 1425 [a roll number is not crucial to a determination of the child\u2019s Indian status]; <em>In re Arianna R.G. </em>(2003) 259 Wis.2d 563, 575-576 &amp; fn. 13 [657 N.W.2d 363] [the absence of enrollment alone may not necessarily be determinative of whether a person is a member of a tribe]; <em>In re Baby Boy Doe </em>(1993) 123 Idaho 464 [849 P.2d 925, 931] [enrollment and membership are not synonymous].)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>Thus we are not persuaded by the Agency\u2019s argument the children were not Indian children within the meaning of ICWA because neither they nor their father were enrolled members of the Band. As we have discussed, the United States Supreme Court, the Guidelines and other federal and state case law indicate the definition of tribal membership under ICWA is not as limited as the Agency contends, and the determination whether the child is an Indian child within the meaning of ICWA depends in large part on the tribe\u2019s membership criteria. Because of differences in tribal membership criteria and enrollment procedures, whether a child is an Indian child is dependent on the singular facts of each case. (See, e.g., <em>Application of Angus </em>(1982) 60 Or.App. 546 [655 P.2d 208, 212] [formal membership requirements and methods of proof of membership differ from tribe to tribe].)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Here, notwithstanding J.C.\u2019s lack of membership in the Band, the record shows the Band considered the children to be Indian children within the meaning of ICWA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Sjogren, whom the court considered the Band\u2019s legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>expert, stated there was <em>\u201cno doubt the children were Indian children </em>who would be enrolled in the Band\u201d on the completion of \u201cbureaucratic\u201d requirements. (Italics added.) Wright, the Band\u2019s Indian child welfare supervisor, averred the proceedings were controlled by ICWA because <em>the children were eligible or enrolled members of the Band. </em>Wright testified the tribal court was able to take custody over children before they were enrolled in the Band, and the Band could then complete the enrollment process.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The Band\u2019s actions also indicated it considered the children to be Indian children within the meaning of ICWA. The Band promptly intervened in the case as of right. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(c).) Its tribal representative appeared telephonically and testified at the children\u2019s hearings. Further, the Band\u2019s rules of court state \u201c[t]he Court may, after a hearing upon a written motion or petition filed by the Band or by a parent, guardian or custodian of <em>a minor child who is either a Band member, eligible for membership, or the child of a Band member, </em>accept a transfer of jurisdiction of a child protection case from any federal, state or other tribal court, including cases arising under the Indian Child Welfare Act. . . when it is in the best interest of the Band and of the child to accept such a transfer of jurisdiction.\u201d (Bois Forte Children\u2019s Court Rules, ch. VII, pt. A, \u00a7 768, italics added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The decision whether a child is a member of, or eligible for membership in, the tribe is the sole province of the tribe. (\u00a7 224.3, subd. (c).) A tribe\u2019s determination that a child is a member or is eligible for membership in the tribe, or testimony attesting to that status by a person authorized by the tribe to provide that determination, is conclusive. (\u00a7 224.3, subd. (e)(1).)  Thus, when considering the transfer petition, the court should have deferred to the Band\u2019s determination of the Indian status of the children, which was conclusive under the Guidelines and state law. (Guidelines, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 B.1(b)(1); Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 224.3, subd. (e)(1); cf. <em>Montana </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1981) 450 U.S. 544, 546 [67 L.Ed.2d 493, 101 S.Ct. 1245] [because of the Indian tribes\u2019 inherent power to determine tribal membership, their membership determinations are entitled to great deference].) We conclude the court erred when it determined the children were not Indian children as defined in title 25 United States Code section 1903(4) because they were not yet enrolled members of the Band. (Guidelines, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 B.l; Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 224, subd. (c), 224.1, subd. (a), 224.3, subd. (e)(1); rule 5.482(c); <em>U.S. v.

Section 224.3, subdivision (e)(1) provides \u201c[information that the child is not enrolled or eligible for enrollment in the tribe is not determinative of the child\u2019s membership status unless the tribe also confirms in writing that enrollment is a prerequisite for membership under tribal law or custom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The Band did not confirm in writing that enrollment was a prerequisite for membership under tribal law or custom. To the contrary, Sjogren\u2019s letter stated there was \u201cno doubt the children were Indian children who would be enrolled in the Band\u201d when their father\u2019s birth certificate was sent to the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. Wright stated ICWA applied because the children were eligible for membership in the Band. Further, rule 5.482(c)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> directs the court to proceed as if the child is an Indian child when notice has been provided as required by federal and state law and a tribe responds indicating that the child is eligible for membership if certain steps are followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Rule 5.482(c) does not, as the Agency contends, impermissibly expand ICWA beyond its jurisdictional limits. ICWA expressly permits state or federal law to provide a higher standard of protection to the rights of the Indian child and his or her parent or Indian guardian than the protection of rights provided under ICWA. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1921.) Thus ICWA does not preempt such higher state standards. <em>(In re S.B., supra, </em>130 Cal.App.4th at p. 1158.) Rather, rule 5.482(c) promotes the timely resolution of dependency matters by avoiding protracted litigation concerning the applicability of ICWA. (See <em>In re Kahlen W, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 1425 [\u201c[ICWA] is intended, as is state law, to protect the best interests of the child, and thus timely disposition is paramount.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">Here the record indicates the court was aware the children would be enrolled in the Band after J.C.\u2019s certified birth certificate was sent to the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. Thus, to the extent the children\u2019s status as Indian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>children was not yet clear to the juvenile court, the court should have proceeded as if the children were Indian children when it considered whether to transfer jurisdiction to the tribal court. (Rule 5.482(c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">We now discuss the parents\u2019 contention the court erred when it determined there was good cause to deny the petition to transfer jurisdiction of Jack\u2019s custody proceeding to the tribal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">TRANSFER OF JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">The court found that even if Jack was an Indian child, reunification services had been terminated and therefore the transfer petition was not filed within a reasonable time after notice of \u201cthe entirety of the proceedings.\u201d The court stated \u201c. . . I don\u2019t believe that given where we\u2019re at the best interests of the child would ignore the passage of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">A. <em>The Legal Framework for Transferring Jurisdiction to the Child\u2019s Indian Tribe</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">ICWA \u201ccreates concurrent but presumptively tribal jurisdiction in the case of children not domiciled on the reservation.\u201d <em>(Holyfield, supra, </em>490 U.S. at p. 36; see <em>In re M.M., supra, </em>154 Cal.App.4th at p. 907 [ICWA clearly establishes a preference for tribal court jurisdiction in custody proceedings involving Indian children].) In any state court proceeding for foster care or termination of parental rights to an Indian child who is not domiciled or residing within the reservation of his or her tribe, the state court, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, is required to transfer the proceeding to the jurisdiction of the tribe, absent objection by either parent, upon the petition of either parent or the Indian custodian or the Indian child\u2019s tribe. The transfer is subject to declination by the tribal court of the Indian child\u2019s tribe. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(b); Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 305.5, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">The California Legislature has specifically defined the circumstances that constitute or may constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d to deny transferring jurisdiction to the tribal court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court is required to find good cause to deny a transfer petition if one or both of the child\u2019s parents object to the transfer, the child\u2019s tribe does not have a \u201ctribal court\u201d as defined in title 25 United States Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>section 1903, or the tribal court declines the transfer. (\u00a7 305.5, subd. (c)(1); rule 5.483(b).) The court <em>may </em>find good cause not to transfer the proceeding if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-5\">\u201c(A) The evidence necessary to decide the case cannot be presented in the tribal court without undue hardship to the parties or the witnesses, and the tribal court is unable to mitigate the hardship by making arrangements to receive and consider the evidence or testimony by use of remote communication, by hearing the evidence or testimony at a location convenient to the parties or witnesses, or by use of other means permitted in the tribal court\u2019s rules of evidence or discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-6\">\u201c(B) The proceeding was at an advanced stage when the petition to transfer was received and the petitioner did not file the petition within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the proceeding, provided the notice complied with Section 224.2. It shall not, in and of itself, be considered an unreasonable delay for a party to wait until reunification efforts have failed and reunification services have been terminated before filing a petition to transfer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-7\">\u201c(C) The Indian child is over 12 years of age and objects to the transfer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-8\">\u201c(D) The parents of the child over five years of age are not available and the child has had little or no contact with the child\u2019s tribe or members of the child\u2019s tribe.\u201d (\u00a7 305.5, subd. (c)(2); see rule 5.483(d).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">If it appears there is good cause to deny a transfer, the court must hold an evidentiary hearing on the transfer and make its findings on the record. (Rule 5.483(d)(3).) The court may not consider socioeconomic conditions and the perceived adequacy of tribal social services, tribal probation, or the tribal judicial system in its determination that good cause exists to deny a request to transfer to a tribal court with concurrent state and tribal jurisdiction. (Rule 5.483(e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">The burden of establishing good cause to deny a request to transfer is on the party opposing the transfer. (\u00a7 305.5, subd. (c)(4); rule 5.483(f)(1).) If the court believes, or any party asserts, that good cause to deny the request exists, the reasons for that belief or assertion must be stated in writing, in advance of the hearing, and made available to all parties who are requesting the transfer, and the petitioner must have the opportunity to provide information or evidence in rebuttal of the belief or assertion. (\u00a7 305.5, subd. (c)(4); rule 5.483(f)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">A transfer of jurisdiction to the Indian child\u2019s tribe by the state court is subject to declination by the tribe. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(b); \u00a7 305.5, subd. (b).) Here, the Bois Forte Children\u2019s Court Rules state the tribal court may, after a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>hearing, accept a transfer of jurisdiction of a child protection case from any federal, state or other tribal court when it is in the best interest<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the Band and the child to accept such a transfer of jurisdiction. (Bois Forte Children\u2019s Court Rules, ch. VII, pt. H, \u00a7 762.)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">B. <em>The Transfer Petition Was Timely Filed</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">The court denied the transfer on the ground the petition was not filed within a reasonable time after \u201cnotice of the entirety of these proceedings.\u201d The court said it could not ignore the passage of time considering the best interests of the child, and the law did not require the court to wait until reunification services had been terminated to file the petition to transfer. In making these findings, the court disregarded the plain language of section 305.5, subdivision (c)(2)(B) and thus abused its discretion. <em>(Upland Police Officers Assn. v. City of Upland </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1301 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 629] [abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court misinterprets the law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">Section 305.5, subdivision (c)(2)(B) allows the court to find good cause to deny the transfer when (1) the child custody proceeding was at an advanced stage when the petition to transfer was received <em>and </em>(2) the petitioner did not file the petition within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the proceeding, provided the notice complied with state notice requirements under section 224.2. Section 305.5 explicitly states it is not unreasonable, in and of itself, for a party to delay filing a transfer petition until reunification efforts have failed and reunification services have been terminated. (\u00a7 305.5, subd. (c)(2)(B).)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Contrary to the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the statute, the time of filing a transfer petition is not tolled from notice of the \u201centirety of the proceedings,\u201d but from notice made in compliance with section 224.2. Such notice includes the right of the child\u2019s parents, Indian custodians and tribe to petition the court to transfer the proceeding to the tribal court of the Indian child\u2019s tribe. (\u00a7 224.2, subd. (a)(5)(G)(ii).) Thus we conclude the trial court erred when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>found that the petition was not timely filed because of the length of time of the dependency proceedings and the fact reunification services had been terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Here, the record shows the Band received notice of the children\u2019s dependency proceedings in compliance with section 224.2 on August 10, 2009. The Band determined the children were eligible for enrollment and notified the court of its intent to intervene in the proceedings. J.C. filed the transfer petition approximately one month later. Thus the transfer petition was timely filed. There was no evidence J.C. delayed filing the petition to disrupt the proceedings. (See Guidelines, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 C.l [timeliness exception to transfer may be used to prevent disruption caused by negligence or obstructionist tactics by counsel].) As we have discussed, the fact reunification services had been terminated in Jack\u2019s case did not, in and of itself, constitute good cause to deny the transfer petition. (\u00a7 305.5, subd. (c)(2)(B); rule 5.483(d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The Agency argues the court properly considered Jack\u2019s best interest in determining whether there was good cause to deny the transfer petition. We need not address this issue here. The trial court found that it was in Jack\u2019s best interest to deny transfer because of \u201cthe passage of time.\u201d As discussed, section 305.5, subdivision (c)(2)(B) states that the postreunification status of a child custody proceeding does not, in and of itself, establish good cause to deny transfer. Thus, to the extent transfer of jurisdiction under California\u2019s dependency framework includes a determination by the state court of the child\u2019s best interest, a determination based merely on the passage of time would impermissibly contravene an express statutory provision to the contrary. (See <em>Tonya M. v. Superior Court </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 836, 844 [69 Cal.Rptr.3d 96, 172 P.3d 402] [the text of the statute is the best indicator of legislative intent]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Western Air Lines, Inc. </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 621, 638 [268 P.2d 723]; <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp.

(\u00a7 305.5, subd. (c)(2)(A).)</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Although there is substantial evidence to support a finding under the first prong of section 305.5, subdivision (c)(2)(A),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the parties opposing transfer did not present any evidence to show the tribal court was unable to mitigate the hardship by mating other arrangements to hear evidence. Further, the record does not contain any evidence from which we could reasonably infer the tribal court was unable to \u201c[make] arrangements to receive and consider the evidence or testimony by use of remote communication, by hearing the evidence or testimony at a location convenient to the parties or witnesses, or by use of other means permitted in the tribal court\u2019s rules of evidence or discovery.\u201d (\u00a7 305.5, subd. (c)(2)(A).) Thus we cannot sustain the finding there is good cause to deny transfer to the tribal court under the inconvenient forum exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">THE COURT ERRED WHEN IT DID NOT HOLD A HEARING ON THE TRANSFER PETITION IN ELIZABETH\u2019S AND ANDREW\u2019S CASES</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">The parents argue the court was required to grant them a hearing on the transfer petition in the siblings\u2019 cases. (Rule 5.483(d)(3) [\u201cIf it appears that there is good cause to deny a transfer, the court must hold an evidentiary hearing on the transfer and make its findings on the record.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">The Agency acknowledges the court did not hold a transfer hearing in the siblings\u2019 cases. It contends the court denied the transfer petition for all three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>children at Jack\u2019s hearing on March 19, 2010, and argues the parents have lost their right to appeal because they did not file timely notices of appeal in the siblings\u2019 cases after the March 19 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The record does not support the Agency\u2019s contention. The March 19 hearing was a section 366.26 hearing in Jack\u2019s case and the court made findings on the transfer petition only as to Jack. Further, even if the court denied the transfer petition as to all three children on March 19, 2010, the parents\u2019 appeals were timely filed. The disposition hearing is the first hearing from which a party may appeal. (\u00a7 395; <em>In re Sheila B. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 187, 196 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 482] [the dispositional order is the first appealable order in the dependency process].) The siblings\u2019 disposition hearings were held on June 2. The parents filed timely notices of appeal from the orders made at those hearings on June 8 and July 21, respectively. (Rule 5.585 [notice of appeal must be filed within 60 days after the making of an appealable order].)</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Rule 5.483(d)(3) provides if it appears there is good cause to deny a transfer, the court must hold an evidentiary hearing. The reasons for any belief or assertion there is good cause to deny transfer must be stated in writing and provided to all parties who are petitioning for the transfer. (\u00a7 305.5, subd. (c)(4).) These requirements were not met in the siblings\u2019 cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">THE ERROR IS JURISDICTONAL</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">The Agency argues because the tribal representative concurred in the children\u2019s placements, any error is harmless. We disagree. The issues raised on appeal concern the jurisdictional heart of ICWA\u2014the tribal court\u2019s presumptive jurisdiction over custody proceedings involving Indian children. <em>(Holyfield, supra, </em>490 U.S. at p. 36.) The issue is not the outcome of the custody decision but who makes that decision. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 53; <em>In re A.B. </em>(2003) 2003 ND 98 [663 N.W.2d 625, 633-634] [the threshold question is the proper forum for the child custody decision].) Thus, in the absence of good cause to deny a petition to transfer jurisdiction to the Indian tribe, subject to the tribe\u2019s right of declination, the court acted in excess of its jurisdiction when it terminated parental rights to Jack,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> violating a comprehensive state and federal statutory scheme and offending public policy. <em>(In re Andres G., supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at p. 482.)</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">In <em>In re Jack C., III, </em>D057034, the order terminating parental rights is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial court with directions to transfer jurisdiction to the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa, subject to the Band\u2019s right of declination. If the Band declines jurisdiction, the juvenile court shall then reinstate the order terminating parental rights.

Courts interpreting this provision, which mirrors the first prong of section 305.5, subdivision (c)(2)(A), have held that sheer distance from the tribal court creates undue hardship to the parties and witnesses. <em>(In re Guardianship of J.C.D. </em>(2004) 2004 SD 96 [686 N.W.2d 647, 650] [under ICWA, generally courts have denied transfer where very long distances exist between the parties and the tribal court]; <em>In Interest of J.R.H. </em>(Iowa 1984) 358 N.W.2d 311, 317 [good cause to deny transfer of the proceedings may arise from geographical obstacles]; <em>In the Interest of J.W., supra, </em>528 N.W.2d at p. 661 [good cause to deny transfer to out-of-state tribe exists where bulk of evidence was located in state and majority of the witnesses and parties lived in state].)</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">Here the tribal court was located in northern Minnesota. Most of the parties and witnesses lived in San Diego. We infer from the distance alone the evidence necessary to decide the case could not be presented in the tribal court without undue hardship to the parties or the witnesses. (\u00a7 305.5, subd.
