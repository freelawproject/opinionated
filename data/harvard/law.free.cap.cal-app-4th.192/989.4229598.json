Code, \u00a7 186.22, subd. (d)). They contend that neither the substantive violations nor the gang allegations are supported by substantial evidence. Cesar and Antonio also assert, and the Attorney General concedes, that a remand is required because the juvenile court neglected to declare whether the offenses are misdemeanors or felonies. We hold that a violation of Penal Code section 415, subdivision (1) is not a specific intent offense. We find that substantial evidence supports the juvenile court\u2019s findings, but we remand for declarations of the felony or misdemeanor status of each of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">I. Evidence Presented at the Jurisdictional Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">The only witnesses at the contested jurisdictional hearing were Santa Cruz Police Sergeant Loran Baker and the prosecution\u2019s gang expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">Baker testified that on November 19, 2009, at 12:30 p.m., he was driving east on Laurel Street just past Center Street near downtown Santa Cruz. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>was in plain clothes and driving an unmarked car. The traffic was \u201cstop-and-go,\u201d so he was proceeding at just \u201ca few miles per hour.\u201d Baker saw 16-year-old Cesar and 17-year-old Antonio walking westbound along the sidewalk on the other side of Laurel Street. Cesar and Antonio had \u201ctheir attention directed towards the traffic and [were] making some hand signs.\u201d Baker was particularly attentive to this activity because a 16-year-old boy had been stabbed to death \u201cwhere the same kind of exchange was occurring\u201d just a month earlier, a block away from this location.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Baker \u201ccouldn\u2019t tell if\u2019 the hand signs being made by Cesar and Antonio were directed at \u201ca car or somebody on the [other side of the] street,\u201d but he saw that \u201ctheir gestures . . . seemed to be getting more aggressive and [they were] moving towards them like they were challenging them to fight, I realized then, hey, this is for real, and they are challenging somebody.\u201d Since their behavior was \u201caggressive,\u201d Baker could tell that they were not \u201cfooling around.\u201d Cesar and Antonio \u201cchanged directions\u201d and \u201cwere moving towards the street.\u201d Cesar and Antonio put their hands up in the air while taking \u201ca few steps towards the cars like, hey, let\u2019s go,\u201d a gesture that Baker \u201ctook that as a challenge, let\u2019s go.\u201d They \u201cheld their arms up in an inviting manner\u201d which was \u201clike, hey, it\u2019s on, you\u2019re open to somebody approaching you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Because Cesar and Antonio had moved to the edge of the sidewalk, and Baker was concerned that violence would ensue, he \u201cdid a U-turn in traffic,\u201d drove up behind Cesar and Antonio, activated his lights, called for backup, and told Cesar and Antonio to \u201cwait right there.\u201d When a uniformed officer arrived to assist Baker less than two minutes later, Baker and the other officer separated Cesar and Antonio and spoke with them individually.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Antonio told Baker that he had \u201cbeen using hand signals to display a gang slogan . . . towards a car.\u201d Antonio described the car as a white Cadillac and \u201cwanted to know why I wasn\u2019t stopping it. . . .\u201d He told Baker that \u201cone of the occupants in the rear seat [of the Cadillac] had actually thrown him a four, meaning Norte\u00f1o sign\u201d which would identify that person as a Norte\u00f1o gang member. Antonio told Baker that he had made signs for P, S, and C to signify the Poor Side Chicos gang, a Watsonville Sure\u00f1o gang.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Antonio asserted that he \u201ctook it [the occupant\u2019s alleged sign] as being a challenge, a form of disrespect.\u201d He said he was \u201cnot really afraid because . . . there was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>girl in the car.\u201d Antonio told Baker that he thought a fight was unlikely to occur because \u201ctypically there won\u2019t be a gang fight when the girl was present.\u201d Antonio also said that any fight would have been \u201cfair\u201d because there were two people in the Cadillac. Antonio denied being a gang member, but he admitted that he associated with Poor Side Chicos gang members. He said that he \u201chad to . . . kind of like stand up for his friends.\u201d Antonio acknowledged that he was aware that his conduct had occurred in an area \u201cwhere Norte\u00f1os and Sure\u00f1os would actually cross paths and it would be not good.\u201d Antonio also admitted that the blue \u201cswoosh\u201d on the Nike shoes he was wearing was intended to \u201csignify\u201d his Sure\u00f1o affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Baker then spoke to Cesar. Like Antonio, Cesar admitted making a \u201chand gesture\u201d of \u201ca P an S and a C for Poor Side Chicos\u201d and claimed that an occupant of a white Cadillac had made a gesture. Cesar maintained that he \u201cwas just holding his ground and not trying to challenge the occupants\u201d of the Cadillac. Cesar said he was not a gang member but admitted he associated with members of the Poor Side Chicos gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Cesar and Antonio had been stopped previously by police in the company of a Poor Side Chicos gang member. On another occasion, they were stopped by police with Sure\u00f1o gang members, and Antonio was wearing attire associated with the Poor Side Chicos gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">Baker testified that he was not \u201coperating under any assumption\u201d as to whether there actually was a white Cadillac with an occupant who made a gang gesture. He thought it was \u201ca possibility\u201d that Cesar and Antonio were responding to such a gesture, but he did not think it mattered.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">The prosecution\u2019s gang expert testified that a gesture of putting one\u2019s hands up in the air would be seen as \u201cchallenging the other person.\u201d He also opined that the \u201ccommon response\u201d to someone making a gang sign is violence. The expert testified that there was \u201cno other reason\u201d for a person to make a gang sign besides \u201cchallenging them to fight.\u201d The presence of a girl would not eliminate the risk of violence in such a situation. The gang expert testified that the Poor Side Chicos gang would benefit from a challenge such as that made by Cesar and Antonio because \u201c[i]t would further the violent reputation\u201d of the gang \u201cwithin the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">II. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 petitions were filed alleging that Cesar and Antonio had violated Penal Code section 415, subdivision (1) and that their offenses could be treated as either felonies or misdemeanors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>because the offenses had been committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang (Pen. Code, \u00a7 186.22, subd. (d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The prosecutor argued that a gang sign \u201cthrown at someone that is perceived as a rival, is an invitation to a fight, a challenge to a fight.\u201d Cesar\u2019s trial counsel argued that Cesar and Antonio \u201cwere in fact not challenging someone to fight. They were responding to something that turned out to be not a challenge at all.\u201d Antonio\u2019s trial counsel joined in Cesar\u2019s counsel\u2019s arguments and also argued that Antonio \u201cdidn\u2019t think a fight was going to happen, so clearly in his mind he is not challenging someone to fight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The court found that Cesar and Antonio had violated Penal Code section 415, subdivision (1) by making gang signs in an \u201caggressive\u201d manner and using a gesture to indicate \u201c[l]et\u2019s go.\u201d It also found true the gang allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Antonio, who had previously been declared a ward, was continued as a ward and placed in his parents\u2019 home on probation. Cesar was placed on probation without wardship in the custody of his parents. Cesar and Antonio timely filed notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"ATj\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"AH9\">1. Penal Code Section 415, Subdivision (1) Violations</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Cesar and Antonio contend that the juvenile court\u2019s findings that they-violated Penal Code section 415, subdivision (1) are not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">\u201cThe standard of proof in juvenile proceedings involving criminal acts is the same as the standard in adult criminal trials.\u201d <em>(In re Jose R. </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 269, 275 [186 Cal.Rptr. 898].) Thus, \u201cwe must apply the same standard of review applicable to any claim by a criminal defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support a judgment of conviction on appeal. Under this standard, the critical inquiry is \u2018whether, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citation.] An appellate court \u2018must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citations.] [f] In reviewing the evidence adduced at trial, our perspective must favor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>judgment. [Citations.] \u2018This court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to respondent and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence. [Citation.] If the circumstances reasonably justify the trial court\u2019s findings, reversal is not warranted merely because the circumstances might also be reasonably reconciled with a contrary finding. [Citations.] The test on appeal is whether there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact; it is not whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.] [f] Before the judgment of the trial court can be set aside for insufficiency of the evidence . . . , it must clearly appear that upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to support it. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Ryan N. </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1371-1372 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 620] <em>(Ryan).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Penal Code section 415, subdivision (1) provides; \u201cAny person who unlawfully fights in a public place or challenges another person in a public place to fight\u201d commits a misdemeanor. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 415, subd. (1).) Antonio and Cesar assert that their conduct was not a \u201cchallenge[] ... to fight\u201d because they were merely <em>responding </em>to a gang sign displayed by an occupant of a white Cadillac. This assertion assumes that the juvenile court was required to accept the truth of their statements to Baker. Cesar claims that \u201cthe arresting officer, the district attorney and the juvenile court all treated appellant and his brother\u2019s version of the incident as true.\u201d He provides no record citations to support this claim, and our review of the record discloses no support for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Baker, the arresting officer, testified that he did not accept or \u201cassum[e]\u201d the truth of the claim that Cesar- and Antonio were responding to a gesture from a white Cadillac; he simply investigated that \u201cpossibility.\u201d Neither the prosecutor nor the court ever expressed any opinion on the truth of the claim that Antonio and Cesar were responding to a gesture by an occupant of a white Cadillac. It is irrelevant that, as Cesar notes, \u201cthe juvenile court itself gave no indication that it disbelieved appellant\u2019s interpretation of the events.\u201d The juvenile court had no obligation to make an express statement identifying the evidence that it believed and the evidence it disbelieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Our standard of review requires us to \u201c <em>\u2018presume </em>in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier <em>could reasonably deduce </em>from the evidence\u2019 \u201d and precludes us from reversing unless \u201c \u2018upon no hypothesis whatever\u2019 \u201d does substantial evidence support the order. <em>(Ryan, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at p. 1372, italics added.) Since the juvenile court could reasonably discredit the self-serving statements of Cesar and Antonio that they were merely <em>responding </em>to a gang sign from an occupant of a white Cadillac rather than <em>initiating </em>a challenge, we must presume that the court did so. But for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>statements of Cesar and Antonio, no evidence was presented that a white Cadillac was within sight of Cesar and Antonio when they were observed by Baker, or that any occupant of any car or any other person made a gang sign that instigated the conduct of Cesar and Antonio observed by Baker. While the evidence before the juvenile court indicated that Cesar and Antonio were probably reacting to <em>something </em>they observed, the precise nature of their observations was unknown. They may have been reacting to a person, either in a vehicle or on the other side of the street, who was wearing red or whom one or both of them recognized as a Norte\u00f1o gang member. Or they may have simply been trying to intimidate someone to whom they took a dislike. As the juvenile court was not obligated to credit the statements by Cesar and Antonio to Baker that they were merely <em>responding </em>to a gang sign made by another person, the evidence did not preclude the court from finding that Cesar and Antonio were not reacting to the instigation of another but were themselves the initiators of a challenge to fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Cesar maintains that his conduct did not violate Penal Code section 415, subdivision (1) because he was \u201cwithin his legally permissible right under the laws of self-defense to stand one\u2019s ground and respond to an attack in equal manner.\u201d He also argues that the evidence established \u201cat most\u201d that he \u201caccepted another\u2019s challenge\u201d to fight, rather than himself challenging another to fight. Cesar claims: \u201cThe occupants of the white car instigated the interaction by challenging appellant and his brother; it was only after the initial act of aggression that appellant and Antonio theoretically <em>accepted </em>the challenge . . . .\u201d Cesar\u2019s \u201cself-defense\u201d claim and his contention that he merely \u201caccepted\u201d a challenge cannot succeed because the juvenile court was not obligated to credit the statements of Antonio and Cesar that they were responding to a gang sign made by an occupant of a white Cadillac. We must presume in support of the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdictional findings that it discredited those statements, which eliminates the factual premise for Cesar\u2019s \u201cself-defense\u201d and \u201caccepted the challenge\u201d contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Antonio and Cesar claim that a violation of Penal Code section 415, subdivision (1) requires proof of a specific intent \u201cto cause a fight,\u201d and they assert that the juvenile court\u2019s findings that they violated this statute are not supported by proof that they harbored such a specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">To determine whether an offense requires specific intent, we \u201cbegin with an examination of the statutory language describing the proscribed conduct, including any express or implied reference to a mental state.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hering </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 440, 445 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 839, 976 P.2d 210].) The statutory language here applies to a \u201cperson who unlawfully . . . challenges another person in a public place to fight.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 415, subd. (1).) Penal Code section 415, subdivision (1) contains no express or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>implied reference to a mental state.  \u201cWhen the definition of a crime consists of only the description of a particular act, without reference to intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence, we ask whether the defendant intended to do the proscribed act. This intention is deemed to be a general criminal intent. When the definition refers to defendant\u2019s intent to do some further act or achieve some additional consequence, the crime is deemed to be one of specific intent.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hood </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 444, 456-157 [82 Cal.Rptr. 618, 462 P.2d 370].)  Here, the definition of the crime is simply a description of the prohibited act, and there is no reference to an intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence. Thus, a violation of Penal Code section 415, subdivision (1) would appear to require no more than general criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The legislative history of this criminal prohibition confirms that no specific intent is required. \u201c[Challenging to fight\u201d was first criminalized in this state in 1850. The 1850 statute provided: \u201cIf any person, at late and unusual hours of the night time, shall maliciously and wilfully disturb the peace or quiet of any neighborhood or family by . . . <em>challenging to fight, </em>or fighting, every person convicted thereof shall be fined ... or imprisoned . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1850, ch. 99, \u00a7 112, p. 243, italics added.) That prohibition remained in force until 1974. In 1974, that statute was repealed, and the current version of Penal Code section 415 was enacted. The \u201cchallenges ... to fight\u201d language has not been altered since then.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The purpose of the 1974 legislative act was to respond to decisions of the United States Supreme Court invalidating portions of the previous version of Penal Code section 415. (Assem. Com. on Crim. Justice, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 2294 (1974 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 20, 1974, p. 2.) In <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 15 [29 L.Ed.2d 284, 91 S.Ct. 1780] <em>(Cohen), </em>the United States Supreme Court reversed the judgment in a case in which the defendant had been convicted under the prior version of Penal Code section 415. The ground for the reversal was that the conviction was based solely on speech protected by the First Amendment. <em>(Cohen, </em>at pp. 19, 26.) The court noted that the speech at issue (a jacket bearing the words \u201c \u2018 \u201cFuck the Draft\u201d \u2019 \u201d) did not fall within any of the established exceptions to First Amendment protection, which included obscenity, \u201cso-called \u2018fighting words,\u2019 those personally abusive epithets which, when addressed to the ordinary citizen, are, as a matter of common knowledge, inherently likely to provoke violent reaction,\u201d and a speaker\u2019s communications \u201cintentionally provoking a given group to hostile reaction.\u201d <em>(Cohen, </em>at pp. 16, 20, 24.) In 1974, the United States Supreme Court, citing <em>Cohen, </em>reversed a Louisiana criminal conviction for \u201cbreach of the peace\u201d due to First Amendment concerns. <em>(Lewis </em>v. <em>City of New Orleans </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 130, 132, 134 [39 L.Ed.2d 214, 94 S.Ct. 970].) The United States Supreme Court thereafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>vacated the judgment in a second California Penal Code section 415 case and remanded that case for reconsideration in light of <em>Lewis. (Rosen v. California </em>(1974) 416 U.S. 924 [40 L.Ed.2d 280, 94 S.Ct. 1922].)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The Legislature responded to these decisions by repealing the old version of Penal Code section 415 and enacting a new version of Penal Code section 415. The new version was intended to \u201cregulate pure speech (without the necessity of any other conduct) when the communication would tend to result in a violent reaction.\u201d (Legis. Counsel, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 2294 (1974 Reg. Sess.) p. 1.) The old version of Penal Code section 415 had no subdivisions and prohibited a variety of speech and conduct in a single sentence. In contrast, the new version contained three subdivisions, each of which covered a distinct type of offense. Penal Code section 415, subdivision (1) contained no reference to any mental state whatsoever, and applied only to \u201cfights\u201d and \u201cchallenges ... to fight\u201d that occurred in a public place. Subdivision (2) explicitly required that the perpetrator act \u201cmaliciously and willfully,\u201d applied only to \u201cdisturb[ing] another person by loud and unreasonable noise,\u201d and was not limited to events that occurred in public places. Subdivision (3) did not refer to any mental state .and applied to the use of \u201coffensive words in a public place,\u201d but was restricted to words \u201cinherently likely to provoke an immediate violent reaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">The Legislature\u2019s use of three separate subdivisions was part of a carefully calibrated scheme designed to prohibit communications that \u201cwould tend to result in a violent reaction.\u201d Because a fight or challenge to fight in a public place <em>necessarily </em>tends to result in a violent reaction, the Legislature found no need to delimit the application of Penal Code section 415, subdivision (1). On the other hand, because \u201coffensive words\u201d and \u201cloud and unreasonable noise\u201d do not necessarily tend to result in a violent reaction, the Legislature imposed additional requirements designed to limit these prohibitions to those words and noises which \u201cwould tend to result in a violent reaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">The Legislature\u2019s calibration of the mental states and other elements required under each subdivision of Penal Code section 415 was inherently reasonable. A <em>challenge </em>to fight is prohibited because such a challenge may provoke a violent response that endangers not only the challenger but any other persons who may be in the public place where the challenge occurs. Because the statute is aimed at the inherent danger that a challenge will result in violence, it is irrelevant whether the challenger intended to actually cause a fight. The mere fact that the challenger may naively believe that his challenge will go unanswered does not reduce the danger that the challenge poses to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>both the challenger and the public.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since the danger that a challenge to fight creates, and that the Legislature intended to prohibit, is unaffected by the challenger\u2019s subjective intent to actually cause a fight or his subjective belief that a fight will not occur or is unlikely to occur, no specific intent is required.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If a person challenges another person to fight in a public place, he or she violates Penal Code section 415, subdivision (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Since no specific intent was required, the alleged absence of evidence of such an intent is irrelevant. Baker\u2019s testimony was sufficient to support a finding that the gestures that Cesar and Antonio made toward someone in a car or on the other side of the street were a challenge to fight. It was undisputed that these gestures were made in a public place. Thus, substantial evidence supports the juvenile court\u2019s findings that Cesar and Antonio violated Penal Code section 415, subdivision (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">2. Gang Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">Antonio and Cesar attack the sufficiency of the evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s findings on the Penal Code section 186.22, subdivision (d) gang allegations that they harbored the required specific intent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">\u201cAny person who is convicted of a public offense punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor, which is committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members, shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year, or by imprisonment in the state prison for one, two, or three years ....\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 186.22, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">Antonio and Cesar claim that (1) the prosecution\u2019s proof was inadequate because the evidence established that they merely intended \u201cto stand their ground\u201d and \u201cthat they didn\u2019t intend to fight and didn\u2019t expect a fight,\u201d and (2) the prosecution failed to prove <em>\u201cwhat criminal conduct </em>of the gang\u201d they were seeking to promote.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>The specific intent element did not depend on whether Cesar and Antonio intended to merely \u201cstand their ground\u201d or \u201cto fight.\u201d Both Cesar and Antonio admitted to Baker that the purpose of their conduct was to signal their association with the Poor Side Chicos gang, and Antonio further admitted that he was motivated by his desire to \u201cstand up for\u201d his Poor Side Chicos gang member friends. The gang expert testified that the Poor Side Chicos gang would benefit from a challenge such as that made by Cesar and Antonio because \u201c[i]t would further the violent reputation\u201d of the gang \u201cwithin the community.\u201d There was no reason for Cesar and Antonio to make a gang challenge except to promote further criminal activity by Poor Side Chicos gang members. The juvenile court could have drawn the reasonable inference from this evidence that Cesar and Antonio made a gang challenge that identified them with the Poor Side Chicos gang because they wanted to enhance that gang\u2019s violent reputation and thereby further future criminal conduct by their Poor Side Chicos gang member friends. Their second claim also fails. The prosecution was not required to prove \u201cwhat criminal conduct\u201d Cesar and Antonio were seeking to promote by their conduct. \u201c \u2018There is no statutory requirement . . . that the evidence establish specific crimes the defendant intended to assist his fellow gang members in committing.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Albillar, supra, </em>51 Cal.4th at p. 66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Substantial evidence supports the juvenile court\u2019s findings on the gang allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">B. Failure to Declare That Offenses Are Felonies or Misdemeanors</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Antonio and Cesar request a remand for the juvenile court to make a declaration of the felony or misdemeanor status of their offenses. \u201cIf the minor is found to have committed an offense which would in the case of an adult be punishable alternatively as a felony or a misdemeanor, <em>the court shall declare </em>the offense to be a misdemeanor or felony.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 702, italics added.) The true findings on the gang allegations made the offenses alternatively punishable as felonies or misdemeanors, but the juvenile court failed to make the required declaration of the felony or misdemeanor status of each of the offenses. In <em>In re Manzy W. </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1199 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 889, 930 P.2d 1255], the California Supreme Court held that a remand was required where the juvenile court had failed to make an express declaration as to whether the offense was a felony or a misdemeanor. The Attorney General concedes that a remand is required, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>IV.
