Brown and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>defendant Milton C. Grimes\u2014arising out of cases they handled in Texas: Brown had not performed his contractual responsibility to pay Paul Ross, a third party; Brown had unclean hands because he had unethically agreed to share his fees with Ross, a former lawyer who had resigned from the bar; and the fee-sharing agreement violated applicable Texas law because the clients did not consent to the arrangement at the outset of the litigation. The trial court also ordered Brown to return fees he had already received from Grimes under the fee-sharing agreement less an amount for the reasonable value of Brown\u2019s services. Brown does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s factual conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">We hold as follows: the trial court did not commit legal error in excusing Grimes from any further obligation to Brown under a fee-sharing agreement because of Brown\u2019s failure to perform one of his contractual obligations; the trial court erred in requiring Brown to repay monies already paid to him because there was not a total failure of consideration; the trial court erred in denying enforcement of the fee-sharing agreement under the unclean hands doctrine because Brown\u2019s offending conduct did not affect the fee-sharing agreement, was not inequitable as to Grimes, and did not prejudice Grimes; even if unclean hands applied, Grimes was not entitled to any affirmative relief; and a violation of the laws of either California or Texas governing fee-sharing agreements did not require Brown to repay money received from Grimes under the fee-sharing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Ross, a former California attorney (who resigned as a result of State Bar proceedings against him), had been doing investigative work for a California attorney, Brown. Ross referred Brown cases of individuals injured by the 2005 British Petroleum (BP) refinery explosion in Texas City, Texas. As a result, Brown obtained signed retainer agreements with some of those individuals. But Brown told Ross that he, Brown, could not handle those cases as lead counsel because of other responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Ross and Brown ultimately contacted Grimes, a California attorney, who agreed to act as lead counsel on the cases referred by Ross arising out of the BP explosion. Brown and Grimes entered into a written fee-sharing agreement, which provided as follows: \u201cTHIS CONSTITUTES THE AGREEMENT OF THE UNDERSIGNED REGARDING ASSOCIATION OF ATTORNEYS AND DIVISION OF ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES pertaining to the British Petroleum (\u2018BP\u2019) explosion cases, arising from the March 23, 2005 explosion at the BP facilities at or near Texas City, Texas. [Grimes], the lead litigation Attorney will receive fifty percent (50%) of all net attorneys\u2019 fees, and [Brown], the referring and associate attorney, will receive fifty percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>(50%) of all net attorneys\u2019 fees. This fee division will not in any way increase the total fees agreed upon by Clients in the Retainer Agreement and full disclosure of the attorney fee division has been made to Clients.\u201d There were spaces in the agreement for the clients to sign their consents, but no indication that they acknowledged or signed the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Brown referred a group of nine clients to Grimes. Ross referred the other clients directly to Grimes. Grimes ended up with a total of 53 BP explosion clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Brown testified at one point he was being compensated for his referrals and did not have.to perform any legal services, but later added he was also to perform legal services. After first testifying that he was to be compensated for all the cases as the referring attorney, Brown later claimed he was the referring attorney on the first nine cases and was an associated attorney on the rest of them. Grimes testified he agreed to the 50/50 split with Brown of the contingent fee instead of agreeing to the customary 25 or 30 percent referral fee, because as part of the fee-sharing agreement, Brown orally agreed to pay Ross, the \u201cproject coordinator,\u201d out of Brown\u2019s 50 percent of the fees. Brown denied Grimes\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Grimes and Brown both were admitted to practice law in Texas <em>pro hac vice </em>as to the BP cases. Grimes promptly began working on the cases, and filed actions in Texas prior to obtaining from the clients signed consents to the fee-sharing agreement. Grimes had the clients sign a contingent fee agreement providing that he was to be paid a percentage of the recovery. Thereafter, clients signed an addendum acknowledging that Grimes was the lead attorney and that there would be a fee division with Brown, but the percentages of the division were not specified. Grimes said he did not consider the application of Texas requirements in connection with the fee-sharing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Grimes, with Brown\u2019s consent, brought in a Texas law firm, The Ammons Law Firm (Ammons firm), to act as local counsel in the cases. Grimes and Brown then agreed to modify the fee-sharing agreement to provide that Brown and Grimes would each be entitled to 40 percent of the fees and that the Ammons firm would be entitled to 20 percent of the fees. This modification did not purport to affect Brown\u2019s obligation to pay Ross. Grimes advised the clients of the involvement of the Ammons firm, and at some point, the clients signed documents reflecting that association and that the Ammons firm would receive 20 percent of the fee. Again, there was no breakdown as to the percentages of the contingency fee between Brown and Grimes. Brown did not participate in obtaining these consents.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>As the arrangement developed, it was contemplated that Grimes would have the primary responsibility in dealing with the clients and trying the cases and would be paid the fees. Grimes would then pay certain expenses and have the contractual obligation to send Brown and the Ammons firm the amounts owed them. Brown was to compensate Ross out of the amount Brown received from Grimes. Brown\u2019s compensation was in large part for his referral of the clients, but also, in part, for whatever legal services he performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The relationship between Grimes and Ross deteriorated, precipitated in part by the association of the Ammons firm. In addition, according to Grimes, Ross was holding himself out as a lawyer. As a result, Grimes would no longer communicate with Ross. Grimes performed most of the legal services and considered Brown as essentially a referrer of clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Brown did perform what was described as some, but few, legal services and did not keep time records. According to Grimes, Ross acted as the \u201cproject coordinator,\u201d who performed \u201ca lot of hours in these cases\u201d in-obtaining treating doctors for the clients, interviewing witnesses, and retaining experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Ross believed at the outset that Brown was to act for him in collecting Ross\u2019s share of the fees from Grimes, but Brown denied this assertion. Ross ultimately alleged that both Brown and Grimes agreed to pay Ross\u2019s compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The BP cases began to settle. The first 13 settlements were funded, and Grimes, without Brown, met in Texas with each client whose case had settled to have the client sign papers reflecting the distributions to each of the attorneys and the client, and to give the settlement check to the client. As contemplated by the parties, Grimes, after receiving the distributions, sent Brown his 40 percent share of the fees\u2014$1,342,000\u2014for the cases then settled. Ultimately, Grimes had 27 of the 53 clients sign distribution breakdowns that showed the percentages received by each of the attorneys. At some point, after commencement of the Brown-Grimes dispute, Grimes had the remaining 26 clients sign consents and distribution sheets that did not include any reference to a distribution to Brown or even to Brown\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Grimes expected Brown to pay Ross out of the monies Brown received. Brown testified he thought Grimes was to pay Ross, and denied that he, Brown, had an agreement with Grimes to pay Ross. Grimes testified that notwithstanding his agreement with Brown that Brown pay Ross, Brown said he would not pay Ross. Grimes attempted to have Brown and Ross work out whatever amounts Brown should pay Ross. Ross rejected proposals from Grimes and Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Ross first looked to Brown for payment, and when Brown failed to pay him, Ross claimed against both Brown and Grimes. Although denying that he could share attorney fees with Ross, Brown indicated he would pay Ross amounts owing to him upon submission of detailed invoices. When attempting to resolve the dispute between Ross and Brown, Grimes was informed that Brown had an agreement with Ross to give Ross 90 percent of the fees Brown received. Brown adamantly denied that any such agreement existed. Ross confirmed that he had an agreement with Brown that he, Ross, would be entitled to 90 percent of whatever Brown received from Grimes, and further asserted that Brown was to act for Ross in collecting Ross\u2019s fees, keeping 10 percent of them; but Ross also claimed his compensation was based on hours worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Ultimately, the settlements of the BP cases resulted in recoveries totaling approximately $38 million. Grimes offered to put Brown\u2019s remaining share of the fees from the settlements in Grimes\u2019s security account until Brown and Ross resolved their differences. But Brown demanded immediate payment of his share of the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Ross had sent a letter to Grimes and Brown demanding $11,965,170, over twice the amount Grimes had received in fees at that point. Ross said that he had performed 8,785 hours of work and that Grimes agreed to pay him $850 per hour for his work as a consultant. Ross ultimately claimed an amount in quantum meruit based on an hourly rate of $1,362. Ross did not receive any monies from Brown. Grimes believed that Brown, by not paying Ross, breached the agreement Grimes had with Brown, and that explains why Grimes, for the second group of settlements, ceased including Brown\u2019s name on the list for distribution of fees and did not pay any further fees to Brown. Before litigation commenced, Brown had not satisfied or compensated Ross.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Brown sued Ross for declaratory relief seeking a declaration as to Brown\u2019s responsibilities to Ross. Brown later dismissed that action. Brown also sued Grimes for fees (with causes of action for breach of contract, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, and accounting). Grimes cross-complained against Brown for rescission of their agreement and for the money previously paid Brown. Brown filed a petition for a writ of attachment. Pursuant to a stipulation, Grimes agreed to deposit $3,791,605.69\u2014the 40 percent contingency amount claimed by Brown\u2014plus interest, in a segregated account, and the amount was to be subject to an agreed writ of attachment in favor of Brown pending resolution of the litigation. In a separate action, Ross sued both Grimes and Brown, for, inter alia, services at the rate of $850 per hour, and Grimes and Brown cross-complained against each other for indemnity for the claims by Ross. The trial court consolidated the pending cases. During the proceedings, Ross and Grimes entered into a settlement under which Grimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>would pay Ross an amount up to $2.5 million out of the segregated account established by Grimes; the amount to be paid Ross was dependent on the outcome of the action between Grimes and Brown. If it was determined in the action that Grimes owed nothing to Brown, Ross would be entitled to the entire $2.5 million. If Brown had a recovery, Ross would recover a lesser percentage\u2014or nothing at all\u2014of the $2.5 million, which percentage would be based upon Brown\u2019s recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In a pretrial in limine motion, the trial court ruled that Texas law governed the fee-sharing agreement between Grimes and Brown. Brown ultimately claimed $5,252,000 in damages for Grimes\u2019s alleged breach of contract. Following a bench trial, the trial court found Grimes\u2019s account of events more credible than Brown\u2019s and determined that the fee-sharing agreement between Grimes and Brown was unenforceable (and that Brown could not prevail on any of his claims) for three separate reasons. First, the trial court concluded that Grimes and Brown, as part of their fee-sharing agreement, agreed that Brown was obligated to pay Ross, that Brown and Ross had agreed Ross would receive 90 percent of whatever Brown received, and as Brown did not perform his obligation to Grimes to pay Ross, Brown could not enforce his fee-sharing agreement with Grimes. Second, the trial court found that Brown had unclean hands as a result of his fee-splitting agreement with Ross\u2014a nonlawyer\u2014which agreement the trial court said violated the California Rules of Professional Conduct and the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. Thus, because of the unclean hands doctrine, the trial court determined that Brown could not enforce his agreement with Grimes. Third, the trial court held the fee-sharing agreement between Brown and Grimes unenforceable under Texas law because the terms of the agreement had not been disclosed properly to the clients as required by the applicable rules. On Grimes\u2019s cross-complaint, the trial court ordered Brown to return to Grimes the $1.4 million Grimes had already paid Brown under the fee-sharing agreement, less $400,000 in quantum meruit\u2014the stipulated value of Brown\u2019s services. The trial court also concluded the settlement agreement between Ross and Grimes resolved Ross\u2019s claims against Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The trial court entered judgment in favor of Grimes against Brown on Brown\u2019s complaint and on Grimes\u2019s cross-complaint, and in favor of Brown against Ross on Ross\u2019s complaint. All the other claims were deemed moot. Ross filed a dismissal of his action. After the entry of a judgment in favor of Grimes on Brown\u2019s complaint and on Grimes\u2019s cross-complaint, Brown filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">On appeal, Brown expressly does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s findings of fact. He contends that the trial court erred for the following reasons: Brown was not required to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Ross and thus did not breach the fee-sharing agreement with Grimes, and in any event, any failure to pay Ross did not excuse Grimes from paying Brown; the unclean hands doctrine did not apply; Texas law did not govern the fee-sharing agreement with Grimes, and even if it did, the agreement complied with Texas law, as well as California law; and Brown was not obligated to repay Grimes the money he had received from Grimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Questions of law are reviewed de novo. <em>(Ghirardo v.

If the pertinent inquiry requires application of experience with human affairs, the question is predominantly factual and its determination is reviewed under the substantial-evidence test. If, by contrast, the inquiry requires a critical consideration, in a factual context, of legal principles and their underlying values, the question is predominantly legal and its determination is reviewed independently.

Exportadora de Sal, S.A. de C.V. </em>(9th Cir. 1991) 930 F.2d 777, 783; <em>White </em>v. <em>ABCO Engineering Corp. </em>(2d Cir. 2000) 221 F.3d 293, 300; <em>Townsend v.

Whether the unclean hands doctrine can be applied to a particular transaction is a legal issue reviewed de novo. (See <em>Jay Bharat Developers, Inc. v. Minidis </em>(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 437, 445-446 [84 Cal.Rptr.3d 267] [\u201c \u2018Whether the particular misconduct is a bar to the alleged claim for relief depends on (1) analogous case law, (2) the nature of the misconduct, and (3) the relationship of the misconduct to the claimed injuries.\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Peregrine Funding, Inc. v.

Because we hold that the unclean hands doctrine is legally inapplicable, we do not have to decide the standard of review of an unclean hands determination if the doctrine could be applied. (Compare <em>Dickson, Carlson &amp; Campillo </em>v. <em>Pole </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 436, 447 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 678] [abuse of discretion] and <em>Lovett v. Carrasco </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 48, 55 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 496] [abuse of discretion] with <em>California School Employees Assn., Tustin Chapter No. 450 v.

Co. </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 297, 306 [180 Cal.Rptr. 244] [\u201cAs a general rule, the application of the doctrine of unclean hands is primarily a question of fact.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">B. <em>Choice of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The parties and the trial court assumed that California law applies to the issues of the discharge of Grimes\u2019s contractual performance obligation, the application of the unclean hands doctrine, and restitution. This being so, we may apply California law to a determination of these issues. (See <em>Washington Mutual Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 906, 919 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 320, 15 P.3d 1071] [\u201c \u2018 \u201c[Generally speaking the forum will apply its own rule of decision unless a party litigant timely invokes the law of a foreign state.\u201d \u2019 \u201d].) Thus, even if Texas law applied to the issue of the validity of the Brown-Grimes fee-sharing agreement, the parties agreed to the applicability of depecage\u2014i.e., the process of analyzing issues separately for choice-of-law purposes. (See <em>Washington Mutual Bank v. Superior Court, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 920 [\u201ca separate conflict of laws inquiry must be made with respect to each issue in the case . . .\u201d]; see also <em>Beech Aircraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 501, 519 [132 Cal.Rptr. 541].) Moreover, there does not appear to be any difference in the laws of Texas and California on the issues raised, other than the application of state attorney disciplinary provisions to the determination of the validity and enforceability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>of the fee-sharing agreement and the effect of any such invalidity of the agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As we discuss, we need not reach some of these latter choice-of-law issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">C. <em>Effect of Brown\u2019s Breach of Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">(1) <em>Discharge of Grimes\u2019s Duty to Perform Based on Brown\u2019s Failure to Pay Ross</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Brown alleges that he is entitled to damages for Grimes\u2019s breach of contract in failing to pay Brown his share of the contingency fee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court found that the fee-sharing agreement between Grimes and Brown included as a \u201ckey term\u201d Brown\u2019s oral promise to compensate Ross.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Brown\u2019s promise was a condition of Grimes\u2019s agreement to give Brown a higher percentage than is normally given to a referring attorney. The trial court further found that Brown breached his promise by not compensating Ross or acknowledging that he would compensate Ross, even after Grimes had sent to Brown $1,342,000 from fees received. The trial court therefore found that Brown\u2019s breach excused Grimes from further performance under the fee-sharing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Brown contends he did not breach any obligation to pay Ross because there was no showing as to the amount that was owed Ross, and any fee-sharing agreement between Brown and Ross, a nonlawyer, would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>invalid. Brown gave a number of other reasons why he felt he was justified in not paying Ross: he had no obligation to do so; Ross did not submit invoices; and Ross later demanded almost $12 million, more than Grimes had received. Regardless of the justification Brown gave for his acts or omissions, the trial court was unpersuaded. It found that Brown had an obligation to compensate Ross and did not pay anything or tender any amount to Ross. According to the trial court, Brown had the obligation to deal with and resolve any claim by Ross. In not doing so, Brown failed to fulfill his contractual obligations to Grimes. These are factual issues that the trial court resolved against Brown, and Brown does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">When a party\u2019s failure to perform a contractual obligation constitutes a material breach of the contract, the other party may be discharged from its duty to perform under the contract.

Normally the question of whether a breach of an obligation is a material breach, so as to excuse performance by the other party, is a question of fact.

Ross asserted he was entitled to substantial compensation. Grimes said that he agreed to provide Brown with a much higher percentage of the fees on the condition that Brown compensate Ross. The trial court found that Brown\u2019s promise to compensate Ross was a \u201ckey\u201d term of the fee-sharing agreement. Brown refused to pay Ross and denied that he, Brown, had a 90/10 fee-splitting agreement with Ross. When Grimes suggested putting fees in an account, Brown demanded immediate payment. Grimes\u2019s efforts to have Brown and Ross reach an agreement on compensation were to no avail. By the time Ross sued Grimes, Brown had not paid anything to Ross. If Grimes paid Brown money and Brown did not satisfy Ross, Grimes risked that Ross would claim a portion of that money from Grimes. And with the advent of litigation, Grimes faced legal expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Brown contends that his failure to compensate Ross, even if a breach of the fee-sharing agreement, should only result in his paying damages to Grimes and not in excusing Grimes from Grimes\u2019s obligation to pay Brown. Otherwise, Brown argues, he would be subjected to a forfeiture. Brown\u2019s argument assumes, inter alia, that his obligation is based on a promise or covenant independent of Grimes\u2019s promise to Brown. (See <em>Fresno Canal &amp; Irrigation Co. v. Perrin </em>(1915) 170 Cal. 411, 415-416 [149 P. 805]; <em>Verdier </em>v. <em>Verdier </em>(1955) 133 Cal.App.2d 325, 334 [284 P.2d 94]; 1 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>Contracts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 810-812, pp. 902-906; 15 Williston, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 44:6, pp. 92-94.) Brown did not make such a contention before the trial court. He argued he made no such promise at all. Although during the trial court proceedings, Grimes entered into a settlement agreement with Ross, the terms of that settlement are not determinative of Grimes\u2019s damages for Brown\u2019s breach of the agreement, for Grimes had to expend attorney fees in connection with Ross\u2019s claims, and the amount payable to Ross was subject to the outcome of Brown\u2019s claim against Grimes. Moreover, the issue was whether Brown\u2019s breach relieved Grimes of his obligation, not what occurred during litigation. (See Rest.2d Contracts, \u00a7 237, com. a, pp. 215-216, \u00a7 242.)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The determination of whether a promise is an independent covenant, so that breach of that promise by one party does not excuse performance by the other party, is based on the intention of the parties as deduced from the agreement. (15 Williston, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 44:7, pp. 94\u201496.) The trial court relied upon parol evidence to determine the content and interpretation of the fee-sharing agreement between the parties. Accordingly, that determination is a question of fact that must be upheld if based on substantial evidence. (See <em>Winet v. Price </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1165-1166 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554].) By excusing Grimes\u2019s performance, the trial court found that the promises by Brown and Grimes were not independent, and Brown does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support this finding. Moreover, it would seem unlikely that the parties intended that Grimes would have to continue to pay Brown if Grimes remained vulnerable to claims of Ross that Brown was obligated to satisfy. Brown would necessarily be required to fulfill his promise to pay Ross each time Grimes had to pay Brown based on fees Grimes periodically received. Brown, in effect, had repudiated his obligation to pay Ross at the time he was demanding payment from Grimes. Whether Brown\u2019s promise to compensate Ross is viewed as a condition or a dependent covenant or promise (see Witkin, <em>supra, </em>Contracts, \u00a7 778, pp. 867-868 &amp; \u00a7 811, pp. 903-905; 8 Corbin on Contracts (rev. ed. 1999) \u00a7 30.12, pp. 22-27; Rest.2d Contracts, \u00a7 237 &amp; com. b, pp. 217-218), the trial court did not err in finding that the breach of that promise excused Grimes from further performance of the fee-sharing agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In a related argument, Brown cites <em>Ferelli v. Weaver </em>(1962) 210 Cal.App.2d 108, 114 [26 Cal.Rptr. 439], which dealt with a claim by a contractor against an owner for completed construction work and the cross-complaint by the owner against the contractor for admittedly failing to pay subcontractors and not having subcontractor liens removed from the owner\u2019s property. In that case, the trial court deferred judgment until the contractor paid the subcontractors. The Court of Appeal affirmed, saying that the contractor\u2019s failure to pay the subcontractors gave the owner a right to offset those amounts, but did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>not result in a forfeiture of all payments owing to the contractor. The court cited Code of Civil Procedure section 1186.1 (since repealed) that dealt with a situation in which a general contractor hired by a property owner failed to pay subcontractors on the job and the subcontractors thereafter filed liens on the owner\u2019s property. Moreover, the owner did not argue that the contractor\u2019s breach excused the owner\u2019s performance. The owner asserted other defenses. Thus, that case is distinguishable from the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Brown also invokes Restatement Second of Contracts, section 240, which provides, \u201cIf the performances to be exchanged under an exchange of promises can be apportioned into corresponding pairs of part performances so that the parts of each pair are properly regarded as agreed equivalents, a party\u2019s performance on his part of such a pair has the same effect on the other\u2019s duties to render performance of the agreed equivalent as it would have if only that pair of performances had been promised.\u201d (See 13 Corbin on Contracts (rev. ed. 2003) \u00a7 68.4(3)(b), pp. 198-201.)  Section 240, comment a of the Restatement Second of Contracts on page 229 provides, \u201ca party\u2019s failure to perform may cause him to lose his right to the agreed exchange after he has relied substantially on the expectation of that exchange, as by either preparation or performance. The risk of forfeiture is similar to that which arises on the non-occurrence of a condition stated in the agreement. . . . But because the failure must be material in order to have this effect . . . courts can temper the application of those sections in appropriate cases to avoid forfeiture in a way that is not possible where the agreement itself states the condition. ... In addition, forfeiture may sometimes be reduced or avoided by allowing a party whose failure has been material to have restitution in accordance with the policy favoring avoidance of unjust enrichment.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">This is not a case of \u201cagreed equivalents,\u201d \u201cas if the parties had made a separate contract with regard to that pair of corresponding parts.\u201d (Rest.2d Contracts, \u00a7 240, com. a, p. 229.) Moreover, in effect, Brown is receiving what exceeds what would be analogous to restitution, for he will end up with $1,342,000, substantially more than the $400,000 quantum meruit that the trial court awarded him for his services. The trial court noted that Brown did not present any evidence that the value of his services exceeded $400,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">(2) <em>Brown Has No Obligation to Repay Grimes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">That Brown cannot enforce the fee-sharing agreement because of his failure to perform all of his contractual obligations does not mean that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>must repay the monies he received from Grimes under the agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A party is entitled to restitution when the contract has failed, such as when it is void, or has been rescinded or <em>\u201cthe consideration has wholly </em>failed.\u201d (1 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>Contracts, \u00a7 1042, pp. 1132-1133.) Thus, a failure of performance generally gives rise to a claim for restitution of money had and received only when there has been a total breach\u2014i.e., total failure of consideration or repudiation. <em>(Gaffey v. Welk </em>(1920) 46 Cal.App. 385, 389-390 [189 P. 300]; see <em>Richter v. Union Land &amp; Stock Co. </em>(1900) 129 Cal. 367, 373 [62 P. 39]; 3 Dobbs, Law of Remedies (2d ed. 1993) \u00a7 12.7(1), fn. 18(1), p. 794 [\u201cMore commonly, a restitutionary recovery is merely an alternative remedy for total or substantial breach of contract .... A partial breach will not normally suffice\u201d]; Calamari &amp; Perillo on Contracts (6th ed. 2009) \u00a7 15.3, p. 542 [\u201cRestitution is available as a remedy for total breach only, not for a partial breach ... the non-breaching party must elect to cancel the contract\u201d]; Rest.2d Contracts, \u00a7 373; 13 Corbin on Contracts, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 68.5(2), p. 216.)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Grimes has received consideration\u2014the referral of cases from which he has earned millions of dollars. Brown partially breached the agreement by not paying Ross; the trial court did not find that Brown breached the agreement in connection with the referral of clients or legal services rendered by Brown. Although Brown\u2019s breach is material, there is no finding that Brown\u2019s failure to pay Ross constituted a total or even substantial breach of the fee-sharing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The fee-sharing agreement has not been rescinded. Although Grimes pleaded a claim for rescission, he did not plead or prove that he offered to restore that which he had received. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1691, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The trial court\u2019s theory that Brown\u2019s breach of agreement excused performance does not result in restitution on any other ground. The trial court\u2019s breach of contract theory does not involve invalidity of the agreement. Also, Brown\u2019s nonperformance, although material, does not go to the essence of the contract\u2014the referral of cases. Restitution would bear no relationship to restoring Grimes to his position before the contract was made (see <em>Crofoot Lumber, Inc. v. Thompson </em>(1958) 163 Cal.App.2d 324 [329 P.2d 302]) and would provide Grimes with an added windfall. He would receive substantially more than he bargained for. Although the fees came from the clients, Brown, who had fee agreements with clients, referred his clients to Grimes, and provided the contingent fee opportunity to Grimes. Brown bestowed upon Grimes consideration that cannot be restored to Brown. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>there is no basis to conclude that Brown completely or substantially failed to perform the contract so that Grimes could recover the amount he already paid Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In addition, Grimes has not cross-claimed for damages for breach of contract or sought to prove actual damages. His claim for money had and received is likewise to no avail. An action for money had and received will only lie when there is \u201ca total failure of consideration .... Assuming that an action for money had and received will also lie in case of a partial failure of consideration, this would be true only where the partial failure is as to a precise and definite part which is capable of being ascertained by computation.\u201d <em>(Mauss v. Kato </em>(1931) 117 Cal.App. 663, 665 [4 P.2d 179]; see <em>Melicharek v. Colkins </em>(1919) 42 Cal.App. 148, 150 [183 P. 457] [no right to money had and received because not total failure of consideration]; see also <em>Hayes v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1893) 99 Cal. 74, 79 [33 P. 766] [\u201cconsideration wholly fails . . .\u201d]; <em>De Bakcsy </em>v. <em>Strain </em>(1923) 61 Cal.App. 518, 522 [215 P. 105] [claim for money had and received when total failure of consideration for executory contract].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Here, the amount Grimes paid Brown bears no relationship to any damage Grimes suffered by Brown\u2019s failure to perform his obligation to pay Ross, and any damage suffered by Grimes is not sufficiently precise or definite. Thus, there is no basis for a recovery under a common count claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">D. <em>Unclean Hands</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The trial court found that Brown\u2019s hands were unclean because of his fee-sharing agreement with Ross, a nonlawyer,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and therefore that Brown could not enforce his agreement with Grimes. \u201cThe [unclean hands] doctrine demands that a plaintiff act fairly in the matter for which he seeks a remedy. He must come into court with clean hands, and keep them clean, or he will be denied relief, regardless of the merits of his claim.\u201d <em>(Kendall-Jackson Winery, Ltd. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th at p. 978.)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The unclean hands doctrine is inapplicable for a number of reasons. To deny relief to a party under the unclean hands doctrine, the improper conduct must be \u201cin the particular transaction or connected with the subject matter of the litigation that is a defense.\u201d (13 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>Equity, \u00a7 13, pp. 297-298, citing <em>Soon </em>v. <em>Beckman </em>(1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 33 [44 CaLRptr. 190]; see <em>O\u2019Flaherty v. Belgum </em>(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 1044, 1060 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 286] [The unclean hands doctrine does not apply if the inequitable conduct did not occur in the transaction to which the relief sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>relates.]; <em>Blain </em>v. <em>Doctor\u2019s Co. </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1048, 1060 [272 Cal.Rptr. 250]; 2 Schwing, Cal. Affirmative Defenses (2010) \u00a7 45:3, p. 1259 (Schwing) [\u201cThe party against whom the unclean hands doctrine is invoked must have \u2018directly infected\u2019 the actual cause of action before the court . . . .\u201d].) \u201cIf he [the wrongdoer] is not guilty of inequitable conduct toward the defendant in that transaction, his hands are as clean as the court can require.\u201d (2 Pomeroy, A Treatise on Equity Jurisprudence (5th ed. 1941) \u00a7 399, p. 97; see <em>Bradley Co. v. Bradley </em>(1913) 165 Cal. 237, 242 [131 P. 750] [citing <em>Pomeroy </em>and stating, \u201cHis misconduct must be so intimately connected to the injury of another with the matter for which he seeks relief, as to make it inequitable to accord him such relief.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Although Brown\u2019s agreement with Ross to pay Ross from Brown\u2019s share of the fees is related to the transaction in issue, such a relationship is attenuated. The amount of compensation under the Grimes-Brown fee-sharing agreement is unaffected by the offending agreement between Brown and Ross. The unclean hands emanating from the Brown-Ross agreement did not directly affect or infect the relationship between Grimes and Brown and, most importantly, was not inequitable conduct towards Grimes. (See <em>Unilogic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burroughs Corp., supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at p. 621 [unclean hands applicable if it \u201c \u2018affects the equitable relationship between the litigants\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Moriarty v. Carlson </em>(1960) 184 Cal.App.2d 51, 57 [7 Cal.Rptr. 282] [\u201cThe misconduct must infect the cause of action before the court.\u201d].) Grimes had no interest in how Brown fulfilled his promise to compensate Ross. Brown had an obligation to take care of Ross\u2019s claims for compensation, and that obligation did not have to be fulfilled by the alleged fee-splitting arrangement. Thus, there is no connection between the offending Brown-Ross agreement and the amount Brown claims from Grimes. The unenforceability of the Brown-Ross agreement affects only the relationship between Brown and Ross. <em>(Kendall-Jackson Winery, Ltd. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th at p. 985.)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Brown may be seeking a benefit as a result of his improper fee-splitting agreement with Ross (Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1-320(A); Tex. Disciplinary Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 5.04(a)) or by the way Ross obtained clients (see Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6152 [prohibits person from acting \u201cas a runner or capper for any attorneys\u201d]), but the illegality of the Brown-Ross agreement or of Ross\u2019s activities did not directly affect the Grimes-Brown agreement or make it illegal or otherwise unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Even if there is a relationship between the agreements, it would not be inequitable to enforce the Grimes-Brown agreement notwithstanding the Brown-Ross agreement. Grimes knew of Ross\u2019s activities and that Ross was to be compensated, and Grimes knew about the 90/10 fee split between Ross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>and Brown before he received much of his compensation. He was not adversely affected by the nature of the Brown-Ross agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">No action constituting unclean hands was directed at Grimes or prejudiced Grimes. (See <em>Jay Bharat Developers, Inc. v. MiniDis, supra, </em>167 Cal.App.4th at p. 445, quoting <em>Kendall-Jackson Winery, Ltd. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th at p. 979 [\u201c \u2018The misconduct must \u201c \u2018 \u201cprejudicially affect . . . the rights of the person against whom the relief is sought so that it would be inequitable to grant such relief.\u201d \u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d]; 2 Schwing, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 45:3, p. 1260 [\u201ccourts have ruled that the party seeking to invoke the unclean hands doctrine must have been injured by the alleged wrongful conduct\u201d].) Indeed, Grimes is a beneficiary of whatever arrangement existed between Brown and Ross, because, but for the Ross-Brown relationship, Grimes likely would not have had the opportunity to handle the referred cases and reap millions of dollars in contingent fees. Accordingly, for all the reasons stated, the trial court erred in refusing to enforce the Grimes-Brown fee-sharing agreement on the basis of the unclean hands doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Even if the unclean hands doctrine did bar Brown\u2019s action against Grimes, the doctrine cannot be used affirmatively by Grimes to recover on his cross-complaint, for unclean hands is a defense. (See <em>Stein v. Simpson </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 79, 82-83 [230 P.2d 816]; <em>DeGarmo v. Goldman </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 755, 764-765 [123 P.2d 1].) Moreover, Grimes\u2019s awareness of Ross\u2019s activities may also preclude Grimes from any recovery on his cross-complaint.  (See <em>Colby v. Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1911) 160 Cal. 632, 640 [117 P. 913] [\u201cas a general rule, equity will not aid one party or another to an illegal transaction where they stand <em>in pari delicto, </em>but will leave them just where it finds them, to settle these questions without the aid of the court\u201d]; <em>Jacobs v.

(See Tex. Disciplinary Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.04; see also Schuwerk &amp; Hardwick, Handbook of Texas Lawyer and Judicial Ethics: Attorney Tort Standards, Attorney Ethics Standards, Judicial Ethics Standards, Recusal and Disqualification of Judges (2010-2011 ed.) \u00a7 1:18, p. 105, \u00a7 3:4, pp. 281-283.) Even though the trial court suggested that California law also rendered the agreement unenforceable, if California law applied, the fee-sharing agreement would be valid to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the extent disclosures to the clients were made prior to payment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 2-200; see <em>Huskinson &amp; Brown v.

We have held that the trial court did not err in finding that Brown could not enforce the fee-sharing agreement against Grimes because of Brown\u2019s breach of that agreement. Under both California and Texas law, if the fee-sharing agreement is invalid under state disciplinary laws for enforcement purposes, Grimes cannot recover monies he paid to Brown. The Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct provide: \u201cThese rules do not undertake to define standards of civil liability of lawyers for professional conduct. Violation of a rule does not give rise to a private cause of action . . . .\u201d (Tex. Disciplinary Rules Prof. Conduct, Preamble: A Lawyer\u2019s Responsibilities, No. 15.) California has a similar provision. (Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1-100(A), par. 4 [\u201cThese rules are not intended to create new civil causes of action. Nothing in these rules shall be deemed to create, augment, diminish, or eliminate any substantive legal duty of lawyers or the non-disciplinary consequences of violating such a duty.\u201d].) In <em>Chambers v. Kay, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at page 161, the California Supreme Court, in holding that the plaintiff could not enforce a fee-sharing agreement because the client\u2019s consent was not obtained, said that rule 1-100 \u201cdoes not apply here because no one is attempting to assert a civil cause of action against [the plaintiff] for failure to obtain the requisite written client consent. Nor does anyone contend that the consent requirement creates a substantive legal duty, a breach of which might give rise to recovery. . . . [I]t would be absurd for this or any other court to aid [the plaintiff] in accomplishing a fee division that would violate the rule\u2019s explicit requirement of written client consent and would subject [the plaintiff] to professional discipline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">We are not aware of any Texas authority inconsistent with the above quoted reasoning of the California Supreme Court in <em>Chambers v. Kay, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at page 161. Thus, under both California and Texas law, Grimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>cannot, by virtue of the illegality of his fee-sharing agreement with Brown, recover under the cross-complaint amounts already paid to Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">F. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Grimes retains more monies than he bargained for and at the expense of Brown, who made the opportunity available to him. This result legally is dictated by the trial court\u2019s findings of fact that are basically unchallenged on appeal. Grimes did render the bulk of the legal services that resulted in significant recoveries by the clients and had to incur fees and costs in connection with claims by Ross. Brown will retain substantially more than he would have if he just were awarded his quantum meruit. To the extent the arrangements by the parties violated applicable state attorney disciplinary rules, those rules provide financial and administrative consequences for such violations.

Grimes did not allege specifically the promise in the cross-complaint. Grimes, in his opening statement, asserted that Brown\u2019s failure to pay Ross excused Grimes\u2019s further performance. Under these circumstances, the lack of further specificity in the pleaded affirmative defense, even if that were a pleading defect, does not preclude the assertion of the defense.

J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"ALA\">I concur in all of my colleagues\u2019 analysis except for the conclusion that James L. Brown\u2019s breach of a condition not found in the written fee-sharing agreement to pay Ross for services rendered discharged Milton C. Grimes from his duty to perform under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">The problem with my colleagues\u2019 argument is that Grimes, not Brown, is guilty of breaching the fee-sharing agreement. Grimes was obligated to handle and settle the cases and collect the fees. The clients paid Grimes, and Grimes was then to pay Brown an amount equivalent to 40 percent of the fees less expenses: \u201cGrimes would then pay certain expenses and have the contractual obligation to send Brown and the Ammons firm the amounts owed them.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 271.) This is what Grimes did with the first 13 cases that settled. He negotiated the settlements, collected the fees and \u201cAs contemplated by the parties, Grimes, after receiving the distributions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>sent Brown his 40 percent share of the fees\u2014$1,342,000\u2014for the cases then settled.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 271.) By paying this sum to Brown, Grimes discharged his contractual obligation to Brown insofar as the 13 settlements were concerned. Grimes did not distribute any part of the $1,342,000 fees to Ross or insist that Brown was obligated to pay some of the fees to Ross under an implied term of the fee-sharing agreement. (Ross was not a p\u00e1rty to the agreement and his name was not included in the agreement.)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">For the subsequent 40 cases that settled, Grimes, as he did with the first 13 settlements, collected the fees generated by the settlements and divided the fees according to the fee-sharing agreement. Grimes kept his 40 percent share but withheld Brown\u2019s 40 percent share, which was approximately $3,791,605.69. Failure to distribute Brown\u2019s share was a breach of the fee-sharing agreement. Grimes\u2019s excuse for this breach of the agreement was Ross\u2019s threatening demand for a share of the settlement fees as a reward for presenting the cases to Brown and Grimes and for working on the cases as an administrator. Grimes believed that it was Brown\u2019s obligation to pay Ross, but Brown was adamant he had not agreed to pay Ross a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The situation among Grimes, Brown and Ross became tense and Ross threatened suit. Because of the threatened suit by Ross, and potential liabilities and fees connected with it, Grimes deposited in his trust account, over Brown\u2019s objections, Brown\u2019s share of the fees as calculated by Grimes. Grimes deposited $3,791,605.69 into the trust account to be paid to Brown when the Ross dispute was settled. Brown did not settle with Ross, and as long as Brown did not settle with Ross, Grimes would not release the fees to Brown, although the money belonged to Brown. Depositing Brown\u2019s share of the fees into the trust was also a breach of the fee-sharing agreement. The money belonging to Brown remained in Grimes\u2019s trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Subsequently, Ross sued Grimes and Brown. Grimes settled with Ross on the eve of trial. Grimes did not contribute any of his funds to the settlement. Instead, in breach of the fee-sharing agreement and without obtaining Brown\u2019s consent, he used $2 million of Brown\u2019s funds held in Grimes\u2019s trust account to fund the settlement. Judgment in favor of Brown was entered on a complaint filed by Ross. As stated in paragraph 7 of the judgment: \u201cAll claims previously asserted by Mr. Ross against defendant Milton C. Grimes are dismissed with prejudice pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement reached between Mr. Grimes and Mr. Ross.\u201d After the payment to Ross, approximately $1,791,605 remained in the trust account. Although Grimes had no legal claim to the balance, he appropriated without Brown\u2019s consent all that remained in the trust account, thereby receiving considerably more of the total settlements than he bargained for.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Ross, as part of the Grimes-Ross settlement, accepted the $2 million in full payment of his claims against Grimes and Brown. Since the settlement and judgment extinguished Ross\u2019s claim against Brown, the implied \u201ccontract\u201d condition that Brown pay Ross for his services was satisfied and the remaining balance, under the breach of contract analysis, should have been distributed to Brown.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
