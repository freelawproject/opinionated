Unable to practice law, he sought employment as a teacher. When the Canutillo Independent School District declined to hire him based on its policy against employing felons in permanent teaching positions, Crook filed a lawsuit against the district, its school board, and its superintendent. The district court dismissed the lawsuit. Finding that Crook\u2019s constitutional claims fail and that Texas law immunizes the defendants from his common law claims, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-18\">In 2002, a jury in El Paso County, Texas convicted Crook of thirteen counts of felony barratry. In the wake of his convictions, Crook\u2019s license to practice law in Texas was permanently suspended. <em>See In the Matter of James Jeffery Crook, </em>Board of Disciplinary Appeals Cause No. 27195 (Aug. 26, 2008) (final judgment of disbarment). Crook has spent the years following his disbarment pursuing employment as a teacher in the El Paso area, an unsuccessful venture which has resulted in two different lawsuits winding their way to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-19\">Crook first applied for a teaching position with the El Paso Independent School District. His application was denied. In response, Crook filed a lawsuit challenging, in relevant part, the constitutionality of -El Paso ISD\u2019s policy against hiring felons in permanent classroom teaching positions. In 2008, we affirmed the district court\u2019s 12(b)(6) dismissal of Crook\u2019s lawsuit, holding that the hiring policy survived rational basis review under the Equal Protection Clause. <em>See Crook v. El Paso Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>277 Fed.Appx. 477, 480-82 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Crook\u2019s next attempt at obtaining work as a teacher forms the basis of this case. In light of its procedural posture, we construe all facts in Crook\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the spring of 2012, Crook filed a job application with another school district in the El Paso area, Canutillo Independent School District. Canutillo ISD also had a policy against hiring individuals with felony convictions for classroom teaching positions. Crook contends this led to his application being \u201cwillfully erased\u201d from the district\u2019s computer system after he initially applied in 2012. Having never heard back, Crook reapplied in 2014. At some point, Superintendent Pedro Galaviz promised to hire Crook as a high school economics teacher beginning in the fall of 2014. Crook later discovered that Galaviz had no intention of hiring .him and had instead instructed the district\u2019s administrative staff to ignore Crook\u2019s application due to his felony convictions. In reliance upon Galaviz\u2019s representations, Crook ceased interviewing with other school districts for over a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In May 2014, Crook filed-this lawsuit against the district, its school board, and Galaviz. Crook asserted- section 1983 claims arguing that the no-felon policy violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the Constitution\u2019s proscription against bills of attainder. Crook also contended that Galaviz\u2019s promise estopped the district from enforcing its hiring policy under Texas common law. Finally, Crook sought a declaratory judgment that the Texas barratry statute violates the Equal Protection Clause, as well as a broad injunction \u201cuniversally sealing all criminal records from access by the general public nationwide, except for the most egregious offenses\u201d and prohibiting employers from inquiring into an applicant\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On appeal, Crook argues that: (1) his prior case does not preclude his Equal Protection challenge to the policy of not hiring felons; (2) that policy also constitutes double jeopardy, cruel and unusual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>punishment, and an ex post facto law; (3) the Texas barratry statute violates the Equal Protection Clause; (4) his promissory estoppel claim is not barred by immunity doctrines; and (5) the district court should have granted' his requests for in: junctive relief as a matter of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">This court reviews \u201ca district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) de novo, accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and viewing those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Doe ex rel. Magee v. Covington Cnty. Sch. Dist. ex rel. Keys, </em>675 F.3d 849, 854 (5th Cir.2012) (citation and quotation marks omitted). To survive a 12(b)(6) motion, the plaintiffs complaint \u201cmust contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Alt. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">We first consider Crook\u2019s constitutional claims. The district court held that Crook\u2019s equal protection challenge to Ca-nutillo ISD\u2019s no-felon policy was barred by collateral estoppel. Crook concedes that the equal protection argument he raises was previously litigated and finally decided in <em>Crook I. </em>Nonetheless, he argues that collateral estoppel is not appropriate in this case. While we do not find error in the district court\u2019s issue preclusion ruling,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the more straightforward approach is to reiterate our substantive ruling from seven years ago that a school district\u2019s policy of not hiring felons as permanent teachers survives rational basis review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">The same body of jurisprudence that guided this court\u2019s decision in <em>Crook I </em>is applicable today. When the challenged government classification \u201cneither trammels fundamental rights or interests nor burdens an inherently suspect class, equal protection analysis requires that the classification be rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\u201d <em>Cornerstone Christian Schs. v. Univ. Interscholastic League, </em>563 F.3d 127, 139 (5th Cir.2009). Under rational basis review, the \u201cregulation is accorded a strong presumption of validity and must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Heller v. Doe, </em>509 U.S. 312, 319-20, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>(1993)). It remains the case under our precedent that felons are not a suspect or quasi-suspect class, <em>Hilliard v. Ferguson, </em>30 F.3d 649, 652 (5th Cir.1994), and that public employment is not a fundamental right, <em>Arceneaux v. Treen, </em>671 F.2d 128, 133 (5th Cir.1982). <em>See also Crook, </em>277 Fed.Appx. at 480-81. Rational basis review therefore applies to the hiring policy. Under that scrutiny, we credit Canutillo ISD\u2019s argument that it has a legitimate interest in protecting its students from physical harm and corrupt influences that it could reasonably believe the no-felon policy furthers. <em>See also Crook, </em>277 Fed.Appx. at 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Turning to Crook\u2019s other constitutional claims, we can first readily dispose of his double jeopardy claim. A refusal to hire is not punishment for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, as courts have read that provision to require an \u201cessentially criminal sanction.\u201d <em>See United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, </em>317 U.S. 537, 548-49, 63 S.Ct. 379, 87 L.Ed. 443 (1943) (stating that only \u201cactions intended to authorize criminal punishment to vindicate public justice ... subject the defendant to \u2018jeopardy1 within the constitutional meaning\u201d); <em>United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, </em>465 U.S. 354, 362, 104 S.Ct. 1099, 79 L.Ed.2d 361 (1984) (\u201cUnless the [civil] forfeiture sanction was intended as punishment, so that the proceeding is essentially criminal in character, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not applicable.\u201d); <em>see also Emory v. Texas State Bd. of Med. Examiners, </em>748 F.2d 1023, 1026 (5th Cir.1984) (rejecting contention that \u201csuspension of [Appellant\u2019s] medical license because of his felony conviction, after he had already served a prison term for that offense, amounted to double punishment\u201d because the suspension was not axi \u201cessentially criminal sanction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Similar reasoning dooms Crook\u2019s contention that a refusal to hire a felon constitutes punishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Ingraham v. Wright, </em>430 U.S. 651, 667-68, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977) (holding the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause inapplicable to corporal punishment in public schools and observing that \u201c[i]n the few cases where the Court has had occasion to confront claims that impositions outside the criminal process constituted cruel and unusual punishment, it has had no difficulty finding the Eighth Amendment inapplicable\u201d (collecting cases)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>Crook\u2019s final constitutional argument is that the district court should have issued a declaratory judgment stating that the Texas barratry statute violates the Equal Protection Clause. But Crook cannot collaterally attack his state convictions under the guise of a section 1983 claim. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (\u201cWe think the hoary principle that civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments applies to \u00a7 1983 damages actions that necessarily require the plaintiff to prove the unlawfulness of his conviction or confinement^]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">In sum, the district court did not err in dismissing the constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">We next turn to the claims Crook brings under Texas law. Crook alleges that in reliance on Galaviz\u2019s promise to hire him as an economics teacher in the fall of 2014, he ceased interviewing with other school districts. As a result, Cook contends that Canutillo ISD is estopped from enforcing its no-felon policy against him. The district court exercised its supplemental jurisdiction over this state claim and dismissed it as barred by immunity doctrines. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">In Texas, \u201c[sovereign immunity protects the State, its agencies, and its officials\u201d from both liability and from suit. <em>Ben Bolt-Palito Blanco Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Texas Political Subdivisions Prop./Cas. Joint Self-Ins. Fund, 212 </em>S.W.3d 320, 323-24 (Tex.2006). \u201cThe appurtenant common-law doctrine of governmental immunity similarly protects political subdivisions of the State, including counties, cities, and school districts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324. A political subdivision, like CISD, \u201cenjoys governmental immunity from suit to the extent that immunity has not been abrogated by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Texas courts \u201chave deferred to the legislature to waive sovereign immunity.\u201d <em>Lamesa In-dep. Sch. Dist. v. Booe, </em>251 S.W.3d 831, 833 (Tex.App.-Eastland 2008, no pet.).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">With respect to Canutillo ISD, the district court correctly held that governmental immunity bars promissory estoppel claims against school districts. <em>See S.W. ex rel. A.W. v. Arlington Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>435 S.W.3d 414, 421-22 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2014, no pet.) (collecting state and federal cases articulating principle that \u201cTexas school districts never perform proprietary acts\u201d and thus holding that promissory estoppel could not be asserted against school district); <em>Donna Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Gracia, </em>286 S.W.3d 392, 395-96 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 2008, no pet.) (holding that trial court erred in not dismissing plaintiffs promissory estoppel claim against school district, which employed plaintiff as a teacher, on grounds that claim was \u201cbarred by sovereign immunity because the legislature has not provided a clear and unambiguous waiver of such claims\u201d); <em>Somerset Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Casias, </em>2008 WL 1805533, at *2-3 (Tex. App.-San Antonio Apr. 23, 2008, pet. denied) <em>(mem. </em>op.) (holding that plaintiffs \u201cpromissory estoppel and quantum meruit claims sound in equity and are simply not included in [Texas Local Government Code] section 271.152\u2019s limited waiver of governmental immunity\u201d and thus dismissing these claims for lack of jurisdiction); <em>Lamesa, </em>251 S.W.3d at 834 (\u201c[E]ven when an equitable remedy such as estoppel or quantum meruit is asserted, the doctrine of sovereign immunity from suit applies as long as monetary damages are sought.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AhOQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>As for Crook\u2019s claim against Galav-iz and the school board members, the district court correctly held that these employees are entitled to statutory immunity because personnel decisions are_ discretionary professional duties. <em>See </em>Tex. Educ.Code Ann. \u00a7 22.0511(a) (providing that a school district employee is not personally liable for an act within the scope of his duties \u201cthat involves the exercise of judgment or discretion on the part of the employee\u201d); <em>see also, e.g., Robinson v. Brannon, </em>313 S.W.3d 860, 866 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.) (holding that \u201cthe acts of investigating and administratively suspending [a teacher] were incident to or within the scope of [the defendant\u2019s] duties as the director of human resources\u201d and that \u201cbecause these acts were incident to [the defendant\u2019s] duties, the fact that he may not have followed [school district] policy does not affect the protective shield of professional immunity under [section 22.0511(a) of] the Education Code\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"ALm\">We therefore hold that the district court did not err when it dismissed Crook\u2019s promissoryestoppel claims.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AOL\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"Aon\">Lastly, we consider Crook\u2019s argument that the district court should have granted injunctive relief \u201cas a matter of public policy.\u201d The injunction Crook desires would require: 1) sealing all criminal records from the general public, except for the most egregious offenses; and 2) barring employers from inquiring as to a job applicant\u2019s criminal record. Apparently this injunction would benefit not just Crook but everyone with a criminal record. As an injunction is a remedy that must be supported by an underlying cause of action, the failure of Crook\u2019s constitutional and common law claims also warrants dismissal of this claim. <em>See Klay v. United Healthgroup, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1092, 1097 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201c[A]ny motion or suit for a traditional injunction must be predicated upon a eause of action.... There is no such thing as a suit for a traditional injunction in the abstract.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Av8\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"AM2\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b778-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir, R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-15\">. As is discussed in more detail, <em>infra, </em>Crook brought a similar lawsuit several years ago against a different school district. Throughout that litigation, he used the name \"James J. Crook.\u201d Throughout the instant litigation, he has used the name \u201cJ. Jefferson Crook.\u201d . In his disbarment proceedings, he used the name \"James Jeffery Crook.\u201d All names refer to the same individual.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b779-6\">. Crook filed his original complaint in May 2014. He then amended his original complaint on six separate occasions. In granting Crook leave to file the sixth of these amendments, the district court admonished Crook that it would not entertain additional motions for leave to amend absent extraordinary circumstances. Nevertheless, one month later, Crook filed a \"Motion for Leave to File Addendum to Fourth Amended Original Petition,\u201d which the district court denied. Therefore, the operative complaint from which we take our recitation of the facts is Crook's \"Fourth Amended Original Complaint.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b779-7\">. These constitutional provisions apply to state and local governmental entities through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969) (double jeopardy); <em>Robinson v. California, </em>370 U.S. 660, 667, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962) (cruel and unusual punishment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b779-10\">.The district court also considered and dismissed a claim that Crook advanced, not in his operative complaint but in a responsive pleading, that two provisions of the Texas Education Code are unconstitutional. Moreover, the district court denied Crook\u2019s request for a declaratory judgment that individuals with criminal convictions are a suspect class under the Fourteenth Amendment and for an injunction requiring the defendants to hire him as a teacher. Finally, the district court denied Crook\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint a seventh time. While we grant Crook wide berth as a pro se appellant, he fails to even mention these aspects of the district court\u2019s order in his brief; thus, any challenge with respect to these rulings is forfeited. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993) (\"Although we liberally construe the briefs of pro se appellants, we also require that arguments must be briefed to be preserved.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b780-9\">. Under the principle of nonmutual collateral estoppel, \u201cif a litigant has fully and fairly litigated an issue and lost, then third parties unrelated to the original action can bar the litigant from re-litigating that same issue in a subsequent suit.\u201d <em>United States v. Mollier, </em>853 F.2d 1169, 1175 n. 7 (5th Cir.1988). Collateral estoppel is appropriate \"only if: (1) the issue at stake is identical to the one involved in the earlier action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action; and (3) the determination of the issue in the prior action was a necessary part of the judgment in that action.\u201d <em>Test Masters Educ, Servs., Inc. v. Robin Singh Educ. Servs., Inc., </em>428 F.3d 559, 572 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b780-12\">. The defendants\u2019 12(b)(6) motion argued both that collateral estoppel bars Crook\u2019s equal protection challenge and that the challenge fails on the merits. As this court can affirm on any ground raised below, we choose to reach the defendants\u2019 substantive argument. <em>Gilbert v. Donahoe, </em>751 F.3d 303, 311 (5th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 251, 190 L.Ed.2d 137 (2014) (\u201cUnder our precedent, we may affirm on any ground supported by the record, including one not reached by the district court. This is so even if neither the appellant nor the district court addressed the ground, so long as the argument was raised below.\u201d (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b781-6\">. Crook also argues that the no-felon policy is an ex post facto law. In his complaint, he challenged the policy as a.bill of attainder; the district court dismissed the claim, noting that absent a legislative act, a school district\u2019s hiring policy cannot constitute a bill of attainder. Although Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution prohibits the states from passing both bills of attainder and ex post facto laws, the two are distinct legal concepts. A bill of attainder is \"a law that legislatively determines guilt and inflicts punishment upon an identifiable individual without provision of the protections of a judicial trial,\u201d <em>Nixon v. Adm\u2019r of Gen. Servs., </em>433 U.S. 425, 468, 97 S.Ct. 2777, 53 L.Ed.2d 867 (1977), whereas an ex post facto law \"retroactively alter[s] the definition of crimes or increase[s] the punishment for criminal acts,\u201d <em>Collins v. Young-blood, </em>497 U.S. 37, 43, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 111 L.Ed.2d 30 (1990). Crook has therefore waived his ex post facto argument by not raising it before the district court. <em>See Le-Maire v. La. Dep\u2019t of Transp. &amp; Dev., </em>480 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.2007) (\"[A]rguments not raised before the district court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d). In any event, were this argument properly preserved, it would fail because the employment policy is not a penal statute. <em>See Youngblood, </em>497 U.S. at 41, 110 S.Ct. 2715 (\"Although the Latin phrase <em>'ex post facto \u2019 </em>literally encompasses any law passed \u2018after the fact,\u2019 it has long been recognized by [the Supreme Court] that the constitutional prohibition on <em>ex post facto </em>laws applies only to penal statutes which disadvantage the offender affected by them.\u201d (citing <em>Calder v. Bull, </em>3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>U.S. 386, 3 Dali. 386, 390-392, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798))).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"Avp\">. The district court observed that our general rule is that a district court should \u201cdismiss state claims when the federal claims to which they are pendent are dismissed.\u201d <em>Parker &amp; Parsley Petroleum. Co. v. Dresser Indus., </em>972 F.2d 580, 585 (5th Cir.1992). But the court elected to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction \u201cin the interests of judicial economy, efficiency, and fairness,\u201d and we find that under the circumstances of this case, this was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>(\"We review the decision to retain jurisdiction over the pendent state claims for abuse of discretion.\u201d). In any event, Crook does not appeal the district court\u2019s exercise of supplemental jurisdiction, so the issue is waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
