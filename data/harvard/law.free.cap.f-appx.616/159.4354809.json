Because Hidalgo did not object to his sentence in the district court, we review his challenge to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391 (5th Cir.2007). Hidalgo acknowledges that under our precedent review is limited to plain error, but he argues that no reasonableness objection is needed to preserve error. He asserts that the courts of appeals are currently divided on this matter and he wishes to preserve the issue for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-22\">To show plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-23\">Hidalgo contends that his sentence is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because his illegal reentry offense was essentially an international trespass and the illegal entry Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is problematic because it is not empirically based and results in a double counting of his criminal history. Additionally, he asserts that the sentence is greater than necessary to promote respect for the law and that it fails to adequately account for his personal history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Hidalgo contends the presumption should not be applied because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis, but he concedes the issue is foreclosed, and he raises it only to preserve it for further review. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">We have rejected challenges to the substantive reasonableness of a sentence based on the same international-trespass, lack-of-empirical-basis, and double-counting arguments raised in this appeal. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 530-31; <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008). Moreover, the record does not reflect that Hidalgo\u2019s sentence fails to \u201caccount for a factor that should receive significant weight, ... gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or ... represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Hidalgo\u2019s dissatisfaction with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). He has failed to demonstrate plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b189-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
