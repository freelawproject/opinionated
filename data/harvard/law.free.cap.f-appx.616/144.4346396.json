California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Ceniceros-Gonzalez has filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-21\">The record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to make a fair evaluation of Ceniceros-Gonzalez\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 123, 190 L.Ed.2d 94 (2014). Nor is the record sufficiently developed for us to address Cenice-ros-Gonzalez\u2019s contentions that his guilty plea was induced by force, threats, or an unfulfilled promise that does not appear in the record. <em>See United States v. Corbett, </em>742 F.2d 173, 176-78 (5th Cir.1984). We therefore decline to consider these claims without prejudice to Ceniceros-Gonzalez\u2019s right, if any, to seek collateral review. <em>See Isgar, </em>739 F.3d at 841; <em>Corbett, </em>742 F.2d at 178 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-25\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Ceniceros-Gon-zalez\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, Ceniceros-Gonzalez\u2019s request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>for appointment of new counsel is DENIED, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b174-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set-forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
