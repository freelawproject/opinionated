In their joint brief on appeal, Cardona and Chi make three arguments: (I) there was insufficient evidence to support four-level role enhancements under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) as they did not exercise authority or control over the patient recruiters; (II) their sentences were procedurally and substantively unreasonable; and (III) the district court clearly erred in imposing restitution based on the amount of money that they withdrew from Vista\u2019s bank account over the course of the conspiracy, rather than on Medicare\u2019s actual losses as a result of the conspiracy. We affirm as to issues (I) and (II), and vacate and remand as to issue (III).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense as it relates to a guidelines enhancement. <em>United States v. Jennings, </em>599 F.3d 1241, 1253 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cThe government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had an aggravating role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">Under \u00a7 3B1.1, a defendant\u2019s base offense level is increased by four levels if she \u201cwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved 'five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d Courts applying \u00a7 3B1.1 consider the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-12\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-13\"><em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n.4; <em>United States v. Njau, </em>386 F.3d 1039, 1041 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam)! Every factor need not be present; they \u201care merely considerations for the sentencing judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1026 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">The district court did not clearly err in applying four-level enhancements for Cardona and Chi\u2019s leadership roles. Evidence showed that they exercised decision-making authority within the conspiracy, participated in planning and organizing the conspiracy, and exerted control and authority over several participants in the conspiracy including the patient recruiters. <em>See id. </em>(holding that the enhancement is justified if there is \u201cevidence that the defendant exerted some control, influence or decision-making authority over another participant in the criminal activity\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Vallejo, </em>297 F.3d 1154, 1169 (11th Cir.2002) (concluding that evidence that the defendant gave orders to co-conspirators supported the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b983-16\">Cardona and Chi make four separate arguments for why their 120-month sentences of imprisonment, imposed well above their guidelines ranges, were unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We address each in turn, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>find no merit in any. We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first ensure that the court committed no significant procedural error, such as improperly calculating the guidelines range, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Once we determine that a sentence is procedurally sound, we then ask whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing [it] is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\"><em>First, </em>Cardona and Chi argue that their sentences are unreasonable because the court did not support their upward variances with sufficient justifications. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. The court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guidelines range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). The weight given to any single \u00a7 3553(a) factor is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). A court does not abuse its discretion by enhancing a defendant\u2019s sentence based on the same factors already accounted for by the guidelines. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833-34 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">When the court imposes a variance, it must have a sufficiently compelling justification to support the degree of the variance. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Although there is no \u201cproportionality\u201d principle in sentencing, a major variance does require a more significant justification than a minor one. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1196 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (holding that a 42% variance was major). Nonetheless, we must give \u201cdue deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1187 (quotation omitted). We will vacate a sentence only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1190 (quotation omitted). The fact that a sentence is imposed well below the statutory maximum penalty is indicative of its reasonableness. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">Cardona and Chi have not met their burden of establishing that their 120-month sentences were substantively unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In imposing an upward variance, the district court relied mainly on the nature and circumstances of the offense and on the need to punish Cardona and Chi and to afford adequate deterrence. Although the court may have given greater weight to these factors than others, that is a decision committed to the sound discretion of the district court. And contrary to Cardona and Chi\u2019s argument, the court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>not place unjustified reliance on the need for deterrence. Rather, the record shows that the court considered several other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the need to punish, the need to promote respect for the law, Cardona and Chi\u2019s leadership roles in the offense, and their lack of remorse and acknowledgment of the seriousness of the offense\u2014all of which the court noted or discussed at sentencing. To be sure, the court recognized (even emphasized) the importance of the need for deterrence, especially in white collar cases. Because this factor is neither improper nor irrelevant, the district court did not abuse its discretion by giving it significant weight. <em>See Ivey, </em>612 F.3d at 1189. Thus, while the variance was major, the district court provided sufficient justifications to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"A3Iv\"><em>Second, </em>Cardona and Chi argue that the court committed a procedural error by requiring them to make arguments for downward variances <em>before </em>it determined their guidelines ranges. We need not decide whether the court erred, because if it did, Cardona and Chi invited the error. At sentencing, the court asked if it could hear variance arguments before it determined their guidelines ranges. Cardo-na\u2019s counsel replied that the court was not prohibited from doing so and explicitly stated that, if the court wished to hear variance arguments first, he would proceed accordingly.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, any error regarding the order of the sentencing proceedings was invited and is waived on appeal. <em>See United States v. Ross, </em>131 F.3d 970, 988 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cIt is a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u201d (quotation omitted)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AHzM\"><em>Third, </em>Cardona and Chi insist that their above-guidelines sentences violated the guidelines\u2019 principle that courts should avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6). That includes disparities from the sentences of \u201ccriminal defendants in other cases who were convicted of similar crimes.\u201d <em>United States v. McQueen, </em>727 F.3d 1144, 1160 (11th Cir.2013). Car-dona and Chi point to two classes of defendants that they insist are valid comparators: (1) the recruiters who were their co-defendants in this case, and (2) defendants who committed similar crimes in other cases. Neither class of comparators is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"AOt\">Cardona and Chi\u2019s co-conspirators\u2014the recruiters\u2014are not valid comparators because they pleaded guilty and cooperated with the government, whereas Cardona and Chi went to a jury trial. <em>See United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1101 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that defendants who cooperate with the government and enter plea agreements are not similarly situated to defendants who do not assist the government and proceed to trial).</p>\n<p id=\"ACg\">Neither are Cardona and Chi\u2019s sentences disparate from those imposed in similar Medicare fraud cases. Their only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>argument on this score is that their sentences were above their respective guidelines ranges, whereas other, similarly situated healthcare fraud defendants were sentenced within their own guidelines ranges. But \u00a7 3553(a)(6) requires only that the district court prevent unwarranted disparities in the <em>actual sentences </em>imposed. It does not instruct the court to consider disparities as to whether the sentences are within or without the guidelines range. And many of the actual sentences to which Cardona and Chi point for similarly situated defendants are comparable to or greater than their own. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, </em>566 F.App\u2019x 898, 900, 903 (11th Cir.2014) (per curiam) (97-month sentence); <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>551 F.App\u2019x 508, 508, 511 (11th Cir.2014) (per curiam) (120 months); <em>United States v. Yanes, </em>542 Fed.Appx. 797, 803 (11th Cir.2013) (per curiam) (151 months); <em>United States v. Santos, </em>476 Fed.Appx. 694, 696-97 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (108 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\"><em>Fourth, </em>Cardona and Chi argue the court\u2019s factual finding that they were not remorseful was clearly erroneous. It was not. At trial, Cardona testified that the recruiters were legitimate employees, that she did not pay them any kickbacks, that she did not believe that she had done anything inappropriate by paying them for patient referrals, and that she never intended to violate the law. And at sentencing, she stated that \u201cit was never [her] intention to commit this wrongdoing.\u201d Likewise, Chi testified at trial that she did not pay any patient in exchange for any service and that she did not give any recruiters money to give to patients. In a post-arrest statement, Chi denied that she paid recruiters for patients, and she said Vista discouraged that practice. Finally, at sentencing, she stated that she wanted to express her remorse only for what \u201cmay have happened,\u201d and insisted that her actions were not done with the intent to violate the law. Based on this record, it was not clearly erroneous to find that neither Cardona nor Chi was remorseful.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">Finally, Cardona and Chi argue that the court\u2019s order of restitution is improper. The Mandatory Victim Restitution Act of 1996 requires district courts to order restitution for certain offenses. 18 'U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(1), (c)(1)(A)(ii). The district court \u201cshall order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim\u2019s losses as determined by the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A). A restitution order \u201cmust be based on the amount of loss actually caused by the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Liss, </em>265 F.3d 1220, 1231 (11th Cir.2001). The government must prove the amount of loss to the victim by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3664(e). The district court \u201cmust determine whether any value has been rendered to the victim[s] in the form of a service or product that should be offset against the restitution amount.\u201d <em>United States v. Huff, </em>609 F.3d 1240, 1249 (11th Cir.2010). In determining the proper restitution amount, \u201cthe district court must make specific factual findings of whether the victim suffered a loss and the amount of those <em>actual </em>losses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">Cardona and Chi contend that the restitution ordered by the court (approximately $370,000 and $360,000) was based on their total withdrawals from Vista\u2019s bank account during the indictment period, which exceeded any loss suffered by Medicare. They insist that their withdrawals include legitimate income and were not all losses to Medicare. The government admits that the restitution order must be vacated for this reason, but the parties disagree about whether Medicare suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>any losses at all, and whether the government should be permitted to introduce new evidence on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Because the parties agree that the district court erred by calculating restitution based on the amount of money that Cardona and Chi received from the conspiracy, rather than the amount that Medicare actually lost as a result of the conspiracy, we vacate their restitution orders and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But the question remains: may the government introduce new evidence on remand? We conclude that it may.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">This Court has broad discretion to determine the limits of a remand for resen-tencing. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106; <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>606 F.3d 1303, 1304 (11th Cir.2010). In <em>Martinez, </em>we held that the government had \u201cpowerful reasons\u201d to present additional evidence on remand for resentencing, where the defendant had made only a vague and unclear objection to an enhancement at sentencing and acknowledged that the bare facts in the PSR supported the enhancement. 606 F.3d at 1306. Similarly, in <em>United States v. Tampas, </em>493 F.3d 1291 (11th Cir.2007), we remanded the case for resentencing on the issue of restitution so that the government could prove that the defendant\u2019s embezzlement scheme caused an actual loss to the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 1305. In granting the government relief, we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that a remand would unfairly give the government \u201ctwo bites at the apple.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, a \u201cremand for further findings is inappropriate when the issue was before the court and the parties had an opportunity to introduce relevant evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Canty, </em>570 F.3d 1251, 1257 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Washington, </em>714 F.3d 1358, 1360-62 (11th Cir.2013) (prohibiting the government from presenting additional evidence on remand, where nothing had prevented the government from presenting the evidence at the initial sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">At the original sentencing, the parties\u2019 restitution arguments focused ' on the amount of kickbacks paid to the recruiters, the value of improper benefit conferred, and the amount of money that Cardona and Chi gained as a result of the conspiracy. The court did not consider, and the parties did not raise, arguments concerning the <em>actual losses </em>that Medicare suffered, discounted by the value of medically necessary home health services. Given that Cardona and Chi conceded that the proper amount of restitution was the amount of kickbacks paid to the recruiters, the government had a \u201cpowerful\u201d reason not to present evidence of the correct amount of restitution. <em>See Martinez, </em>606 F.3d at 1306. Because the government did not have the opportunity, to introduce the correct type of evidence at .the initial sentencing hearing, it should be permitted to do so at resentencing. <em>Cf. Washington, </em>714 F.3d at 1362; <em>Canty, </em>570 F.3d at 1257. On remand, the district court must subtract the amount of Medicare\u2019s payments for services to patients that were medically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>necessary, and the parties may present new evidence in support of their positions regarding that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Upon review of the entire record on appeal, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the defendants\u2019 total 120-month sentences, and vacate and remand their restitution orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-11\">. Their guidelines ranges were 63-78 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Axvq\">. At sentencing, Cardona\u2019s counsel advised the court that the arguments of either Cardo-na or Chi\u2019s counsel were applicable to both defendants, so the invited error of one is-the invited error of the other.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Ay0\">. Even if Cardona and Chi did not invite this error, they did not object to it in the district court, so we would review it only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vandergrift, </em>754 F.3d 1303, 1307 (11th Cir.2014). And they have not demonstrated that this alleged procedural error affected their sentences, and, thus, their substantial rights, as they must to show plain error. <em>See id. </em>at 1312; <em>see also id. </em>(explaining that a procedural error at sentencing did not affect a defendant's substantial rights where he \"failed to show that his sentence would have been different but for the\u201d error).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b987-7\">. To the extent the government suggests otherwise, Cardona and Chi\u2019s objection to restitution was properly preserved for appellate review. They objected to the obligation to pay restitution in their objections to the PSR. The district court clearly understood the objection. It opened the sentencing hearing by asking them for their position on restitution, \u2022engaged in a lengthy discussion about the legality and proper calculation of restitution, and ended the sentencing hearing by noting that the defendants\u2019 objection was \"preserved.\u201d While they did not object to the district court\u2019s restitution order after it was pronounced, Cardona and Chi\u2019s objection was raised in writing and at the hearing prior to the imposition of the sentence, and, thus, is preserved for appeal. <em>See United States v. Weir, </em>51 F.3d 1031, 1033 (11th Cir. 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
