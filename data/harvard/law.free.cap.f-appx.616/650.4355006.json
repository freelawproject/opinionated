Humphrey</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>bars his suit. Black, a former prisoner, argues that the favorable-termination rule does not apply because he can no longer bring a petition for writ of habeas corpus as he is no longer in custody. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">Black was convicted of the distribution of cocaine in Louisiana state court and was released from custody in 2013. While in custody, his conviction was affirmed on appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and he made numerous unsuccessful applications for state post-conviction<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and federal habeas corpus<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">After his release from custody, Black, pro se, filed the present case. Although the complaint is styled as making claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1985, the operative portion of the complaint alleges only \u00a7 1983 violations. In short, the complaint alleges numerous state and federal officials, as well as appointed counsel, violated Black\u2019s constitutional rights in connection with Black\u2019s arrest, trial, and efforts to obtain appellate and post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-17\">Black\u2019s case was referred to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636. The magistrate recommended that the case be dismissed with prejudice. The magistrate concluded that Black\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims were barred by the favorable-termination rule articulated in <em>Heck v. Humphrey. </em>Alternatively, the magistrate concluded that certain claims would be barred by prosecutorial and judicial immunity and that other claims failed because Black\u2019s appointed attorneys were not state actors within the meaning of \u00a7 1983. The district court agreed with the magistrate\u2019s recommendation, dismissed Black\u2019s suit with prejudice, and sanctioned Black.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-18\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b681-19\">In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the intersection between \u00a7 1983 and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>federal habeas corpus statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court established the favorable-termination rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-4\">in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 \u00cd988 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">However, <em>Heck\u2019s </em>favorable-termination rule does not bar a \u00a7 1983 suit when \u201cthe plaintiffs action, even if successful, will <em>not </em>demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment against the plaintiff.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\"><em>Heck </em>involved a- prisoner who was in custody when his \u00a7 1983 suit was filed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the prisoner in <em>Heck </em>had the ability to petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and if successful, use the writ to satisfy the favorable-termination requirement. However, the Court stated that the favorable-termination rule also applied to \u201cformer state prisoners who, because they are no longer in custody, cannot bring postconviction challenges.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">Black\u2019s argument is narrow. He does not contend that his \u00a7 1983 claims are the type that ordinarily fall outside of <em>Heck\u2019s </em>ambit,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> i.e., claims, that \u201cwill <em>not </em>demonstrate the invalidity\u201d of a plaintiffs conviction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rather, because he is no longer in custody and therefore cannot seek habeas relief to satisfy the favorable-termination rule, Black contends that the rule does not apply to his \u00a7 1983 claims. He contends' that in <em>Spencer v. Kemna,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court retreated from applying the favorable-termination rule to plaintiffs who are no longer in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">In <em>Spencer, </em>the Court concluded that a petition for writ of habeas corpus challenging a revocation of parole was moot because the petitioner had \u201ccompleted the entire term of imprisonment underlying the parole revocation.\u201d,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Spencer argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that <em>Heck\u2019s </em>requirement that he prevail in habeas to bring a \u00a7 1983 claim prevented his federal habeas petition from being moot.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court rejected this argument, noting that <em>Heck </em>would not apply to bar a \u00a7 1983 claim by Spencer that \u201cdid not \u2018necessarily imply the invalidity of the [parole] revocation.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-15\">The majority opinion did not address the application of <em>Heck\u2019s </em>favorable-termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>nation rule to an individual, like Spencer, who had been released from custody.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, in a concurring opinion joined by four Justices, Justice Souter stated that <em>\u201cHeck </em>did not hold that a released prisoner [must satisfy the favorable-termination rule to bring] a \u00a7 1983 claim,\u201d noting that <em>\u201cHeck </em>did not present such facts.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Further, in a dissent, Justice Stevens stated that \u201cgiven the Court\u2019s holding that petitioner does not have a remedy under the habeas statute, it is perfectly clear, as [the concurrence] explains, that he may bring an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Therefore, five members of the Court, in dicta, indicated that <em>Heck\u2019s </em>favorable-termination rule never applies to former prisoners who are no longer in custody. Subsequently, in <em>Muhammad v. Close, </em>the Court stated that this issue is unsettled.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Several circuit courts have concluded that <em>Spencer </em>compels the conclusion that <em>Heck\u2019s </em>favorable-termination rule does not apply to a \u00a7 1983 suit by a plaintiff who is no longer in custody.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> However, in <em>Randell v. Johnson, </em>this court disagreed, concluding that in <em>Heck, </em>the court reached an \u201cunequivocal ]\u201d holding.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We acknowledged the \u201cdicta from concurring and dissenting opinions in <em>Spencer\u201d </em>but \u201cdecline[d] to announce for the Supreme Court that it has overruled one of its decisions.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">Black acknowledges that we rejected his argument in <em>Randell, </em>but nonetheless encourages us to allow his \u00a7 1983 suit to proceed. Under the well-settled Fifth Circuit rule of orderliness, \u201cone panel of our court may not overturn another panel\u2019s decision, absent an intervening change in the law, such as by a statutory amendment, or the Supreme Court, or our <em>en banc court.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em>Spencer </em>preceded this court\u2019s decision in Randell,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> so <em>Spencer </em>is not an intervening change in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">On the other hand, <em>Muhammad, </em>was decided after Randell,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We recognize that <em>Muhammad </em>comes into tension with our decision in <em>Randell. Muhammad </em>indicates that <em>Heck\u2019s </em>statement that the favorable-termination rule applies to former prisoners is dicta; <em>Randell, </em>in contrast, relied on the fact that the <em>Heck </em>court reached an \u201cunequivocal ]\u201d holding to conclude that the rule that extended to former prisoners.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> But <em>Muhammad </em>only stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>that the application of the favorable-termination rule after a prisoner\u2019s release remains unsettled,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>Muhammad </em>failed to effect a change in the law that would allow this panel to revisit the court\u2019s decision in Randell,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Therefore, Black\u2019s argument that <em>Heck </em>does not bar his \u00a7 1988 suit is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">\u2022Black also argues that the courts below erred in concluding that certain defendants were immune from suit under \u00a7 1983 or could not be sued under \u00a7 1988 because they were not state actors. Because Black\u2019s argument that he can surmount <em>Heck\u2019s </em>favorable-termination rule fails, we do not reach these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">\u2756 \u2756 *</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b681-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
