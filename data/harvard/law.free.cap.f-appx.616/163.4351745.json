The district court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment in a succinct but sufficiently thorough opinion dated March 17, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">The court carefully explained, <em>inter alia, </em>that Molina made no showing of a suspect county policy that resulted in the alleged violations and that any retaliation was not in response to any speech that involved a matter of public concern rather than in regard to her official duties as a public employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">This case reflects a number of local squabbles but no indication of an infringement of federally protected rights. The summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b194-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
