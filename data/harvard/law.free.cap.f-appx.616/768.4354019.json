California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Echeverria has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-21\">During the pendency of this appeal, Echeverr\u00eda completed his six-month term of imprisonment. His release from custody renders moot any challenge to the term of imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 382 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-15\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED in part as frivolous, <em>see </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2, and in part as moot, <em>see Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d at 383.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b798-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
