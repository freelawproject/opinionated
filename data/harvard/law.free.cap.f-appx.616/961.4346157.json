Hodges asserts several issues on appeal, and we address each one in turn. After review, we affirm Hodges\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-14\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AWsV\">\n<em>A. Motion to Suppress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b994-15\">Hodges asserts the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. He asserts evidence obtained pursuant to two search warrants should have been suppressed because the affidavits presented in support of the warrants contained intentional or reckless misrepresentations and omissions. According to Hodges, the affidavits omitted facts relevant to the confidential informant\u2019s (Cl\u2019s) veracity and made conclusory claims about the contents of two audio recordings of the Cl\u2019s controlled purchases of marijuana at Hodges\u2019 house, which did not offer reliable support to verify the Cl\u2019s accounts of the two controlled purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-16\">The district court did not err in denying Hodges\u2019 motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Lindsey, </em>482 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.2007) (stating we review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress as a mixed question of law and fact, reviewing rulings of law <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact for clear error). Even assuming the affiant intentionally or recklessly omitted information about the Cl and misrepresented the content of the audio tapes, the affidavits established probable cause absent the alleged errors. The circumstances of the two controlled purchases of marijuana provided sufficient independent corroboration of the Cl\u2019s account such that there was no need to establish his veracity. As the affidavits stated, officers searched the Cl and his car both before and after the purchases and only discovered mari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>juana after the Cl left Hodges\u2019 house, which supports the Cl\u2019s statement he purchased the marijuana while inside the house. Further, references on the audio recordings to a \u201cdime sack\u201d and \u201csomething to smoke\u201d also corroborate the Cl\u2019s reports that he purchased marijuana while inside the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">\n<em>B. Prior Conviction Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Hodges contends the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of his prior convictions under Rule 404(b) as his defense strategy did not put intent or lack of accident at issue, and the Government used his prior convictions to show propensity. He next asserts the district court abused its discretion in refusing to bifurcate his trial because introducing evidence of his past crimes to support a conviction for possession of firearms by a convicted felon created a high risk of unfair prejudice. Finally, Hodges asserts the district court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of third parties\u2019 prior convictions because those convictions were relevant to Hodges\u2019 defense theory that someone else was responsible for the drugs and guns police found in and outside the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">\n<em>1. m(b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of Hodges\u2019 prior conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. See <em>United States v. Chavez, </em>204 F.3d 1305, 1316 (11th Cir.2000) (stating we review eviden-tiary decisions for abuse of discretion). By pleading not guilty to the instant charge of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and failing to stipulate as to intent, Hodges made intent an issue in the case even though his defense was focused on whether he possessed the marijuana found outside the house. <em>See United States v. Sterling, </em>738 F.3d 228, 238 (11th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 2682, 189 L.Ed.2d 224 (2014) (stating a defendant who enters a not guilty plea and does not take affirmative steps to remove intent as an issue makes intent a material issue the government must prove). Hodges\u2019 prior conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute was relevant to the issue of intent because both the extrinsic offense and the charged offense involved the same mental state \u2014 intent to distribute marijuana\u2014 which the Government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See id. </em>(explaining when the state of mind required for the charged and extrinsic offenses is identical, the evidence is relevant to an enumerated issue rather than solely to the defendant\u2019s character). Because the extrinsic and charged offenses were identical in nature and separated by less than two years, the similarity between the offenses weighs in favor of admissibility. <em>See United States v. Dorsey, </em>819 F.2d 1055, 1061 (11th Cir.1987) (stating when the extrinsic offenses were similar in time and nature to the crimes charged, those factors weigh in favor of admissibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of Hodges\u2019 prior conviction for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. To sustain a conviction for possession of firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, the Government had to prove that Hodges knowingly possessed firearms. <em>See United States v. Howard, </em>742 F.3d 1334, 1341 (11th Cir.2014). By focusing his defense of this charge on whether he had any connection to the guns found in the backpack, Hodges put both his knowledge of the guns and whether he actually or constructively possessed the guns at issue. Although his prior conviction did not require the same mental state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>required in this case, the fact Hodges previously possessed a gun in connection with a felony makes it more likely he knew about the guns found on property he was renting and in close proximity to marijuana distribution implements. The prior conviction also makes it more likely Hodges intended to exercise control over those guns. Finally, the extrinsic offense was similar in both time and nature to the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">\n<em>2. Bifurcation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to bifurcate Hodges\u2019 trial. <em>See United States v. Walser, </em>3 F.3d 380, 385 (11th Cir.1993) (stating we review denials of motions to sever for abuse of discretion). First, trying the offenses together did not create compelling prejudice. As discussed above, evidence of his prior convictions would have been admissible in both stages of the trial had it been bifurcated. <em>See United States v. Gabay, </em>923 F.2d 1536, 1540 (11th Cir.1991) (stating when evidence admissible to prove each charge is also admissible to prove the other charge, joining the offenses does not create compelling prejudice). Second, the district court gave limiting instructions that cured any potential prejudice created by trying the charges together. <em>See Wal-ser, </em>3 F.3d at 386-87 (explaining severance is not required when a limiting instruction may cure any potential prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">\n<em>3. Prior Convictions of Others</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit evidence of the prior convictions of Deun-dre Carter and Ronnie Moore, two persons who also had access to the house Hodges rented but who were neither defendants nor witnesses at Hodges\u2019 trial. While Moore\u2019s and Carter\u2019s prior convictions were arguably relevant, Hodges presented ample evidence to ply his theory the drugs and guns belonged to someone else (such as evidence other people stayed at the house and marijuana was found there well after Hodges was arrested). Admitting the prior convictions might have created a risk of confusing the issues because doing so would inject into the trial the issue of the potential guilt of third parties not standing trial when the only relevant issue was whether Hodges was guilty, regardless of whether others may have been complicit. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">\n<em>C. Admission of Videos and Photographs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">Hodges contends the district court abused its discretion by admitting videos found on a computer as well as photographs produced from them because the evidence was neither authenticated nor relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the videos and photographs produced from the videos. First, the Government properly authenticated the videos and photographs. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Evid. 901(a) (explaining before being admitted, evidentiary items must be properly authenticated by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is). The Government presented evidence sufficient to establish that the videos and photographs were what the Government claimed they were: videos retrieved from the seized computer or external hard drive founds in Hodges\u2019 house and photographs produced from the videos. Two witnesses with knowledge testified as to the contents and the circumstances of discovery of the videos and photographs. The contents of the videos and photographs also support a finding they were taken from a computer or external hard .drive found in Hodges\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>house. Second, the evidence was admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). The video showing Hodges sitting beside what appears to be marijuana and a digital scale and the video showing marijuana displayed alongside cash, a digital scale, and guns were relevant to Hodges\u2019 intent to distribute the marijuana found in the house. The remaining video was relevant to Hodges\u2019 intent to exercise control.- over the guns found outside. The photographs produced from the videos were relevant for the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">\n<em>D. Closing Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Hodges contends that during closing arguments, the Government made an improper propensity argument and suggested Hodges needed further punishment for his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">By leading its closing argument with a reference to Hodges\u2019 prior crimes and \u201cjail sentence [that] was on paper,\u201d the Government arguably made an improper remark during the trial. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>590 F.3d 1238, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (describing improper remarks as including suggestions, insinuations, and assertions calculated to mislead the jury or appeal to the jury\u2019s passion or prejudice). However, the error did not affect Hodges\u2019 substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Eclchardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947 (11th Cir.2006) (stating to establish prosecutorial misconduct, the defendant must show the improper remarks prejudi-cially affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights). The Government\u2019s improper remark was a brief, isolated comment and the district court <em>sua sponte </em>instructed the Government to proceed to the evidence in the case. The evidence of Hodges\u2019 guilt was strong, and does not suggest there is a reasonable probability that, but for the Government\u2019s remark, the outcome of the trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">\n<em>E. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b997-13\">Hodges contends the district court erred in denying his renewed motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to convict him with respect to each count. We review the evidence presented on each Count <em>de novo. See United States v. Browne, </em>505 F.3d 1229, 1253 (11th Cir.2007) (reviewing <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal on sufficiency of the evidence grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-14\">\n<em>1. Count One</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b997-15\">First, Hodges asserts he should have been acquitted of Count One because the Government failed to prove the substance at issue was Cannabis sativa L., as opposed to another species of marijuana. Marijuana is statutorily defined as \u201call parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(16). We have rejected the argument the government must prove the marijuana was Cannabis sativa L. <em>United States v. Henley, </em>502 F.2d 585 (5th Cir. 1974).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-18\">Second, Hodges contends the Government failed to link him to the marijuana found in a backpack outside his house and therefore did not prove Hodges possessed the marijuana or had intent to distribute it. In order to convict a defendant of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, the government must prove knowledge, actual or constructive possession, and intent to distribute. <em>United States v. Poole, </em>878 F.2d 1389, 1391-92 (11th Cir.1989). As discussed more fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>below, the items found in the bedroom, such' as the .38 caliber bullets and .22 caliber ammunition, were sufficient to link Hodges to the backpack, which contained a substantial quantity of marijuana and a set of digital scales. Additionally, a reasonable jury could have inferred intent to distribute from the items found in the bedroom and in Hodges\u2019 car, which included marijuana; a grinder; a digital scale; vacuum sealed bags, mason jars, and Ziploc bags containing suspected marijuana residue; and small plastic bags commonly used to distribute marijuana. <em>See id. </em>(stating intent to distribute can be proven circumstantially by the quantity of drugs or by the existence of implements commonly used to distribute drugs). In sum, the district court did not err in denying Hodges\u2019 renewed motion for judgment of acquittal as to Count One.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">\n<em>2. Count Two</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">Hodges argues he should have been acquitted of Count Two because the Government did not prove a nexus between Hodges and the guns found in the backpack. To convict a defendant for possession of firearms by a convicted felon, the government must prove (1) the defendant was a convicted -felon (2) who knowingly actually or constructively possessed a firearm (3) that was in or affected interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Howard, </em>742 F.3d 1334, 1341 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">Because he was renting and living on the premises, Hodges had the power and intent to exercise control over the premises on which the guns were located. <em>See id. </em>(explaining to establish constructive possession, the government must show that the defendant exercised ownership, dominion, or control over the firearm, or that the defendant had the power and intent to exercise dominion or control over it). Officers also found .38 caliber bullets and an ammunition box for .22 caliber bullets inside the same room in which they found Hodges\u2019 wallet and a dollar bill marked with Hodges\u2019 alias, \u201cGator.\u201d In Hodges\u2019 backyard, police found two .38 caliber revolvers and one .22 caliber handgun. Because the bullets and ammunition box found in the bedroom matched the calibers of three of the four guns found in Hodges\u2019 backyard, a reasonable jury could infer Hodges had the power and intent to exercise control over those guns and therefore constructively possessed the guns. Additionally, in one of the videos admitted during trial, Hodges waved around an apparently loaded revolver similar to one of the revolvers. found outside, further suggesting he had the power and intent to exercise control over at least one of the guns found outside. The district court did not err in denying Hodges\u2019 renewed motion for judgment of acquittal as to Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">\n<em>3. Count Three</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">Finally, Hodges contends he should have been acquitted of Count Three because the Government did not present any evidence suggesting the guns furthered a drug trafficking crime. To support a conviction for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, the government must show the firearm helped, furthered, promoted, or advanced the drug trafficking. <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1252 (11th Cir.2002). The government must establish a nexus between the firearm and the drug trafficking. <em>Id. </em>at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">The Government\u2019s evidenc\u00e9 supported a finding there was an ongoing marijuana distribution operation at Hodges\u2019 house and that Hodges had constructive possession of the guns. The guns were found in the same backpack as several mason jars full of marijuana and a large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>digital scale. Officers also found .38 caliber bullets and a .22 caliber ammunition box next to marijuana and a digital scale in the same room as other implements commonly used in marijuana distribution, such as vacuum sealed bags and small plastic bags. While the guns were not immediately accessible to anyone in the house given that the backpack was found near the property line, they were just as accessible as the drugs, and a reasonable jury could find a sufficient nexus between the guns and the drug trafficking offense. The' district court did not err in denying Hodges\u2019 renewed motion for judgment of acquittal as to Count Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">The district court did not err in denying Hodges\u2019 renewed motion for acquittal, motion to suppress, or motion to bifurcate. The district court also did not abuse its discretion by admitting Hodges\u2019 prior convictions and videos and photographs obtained from a computer or in the exclusion of third parties\u2019 prior convictions. Finally, although the Government arguably made an improper remark during closing arguments, the remark did not affect Hodges\u2019 substantial rights. Accordingly, we affirm Hodges\u2019 convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b994-12\">.
