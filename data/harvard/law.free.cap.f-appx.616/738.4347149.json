Appellant challenges this award. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">On September 1, 2012, Appellant Bodin Concrete, L.P. (Debtor or Bodin) filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. Over a year later, on October 30, 2013, after the Debtor sold most of its assets, it filed a plan of reorganization (Original Plan) proposing to pay fifty percent of the unsecured claims within thirty days of the effective date of the plan and the remainder over the next five years. On November 20, 2013, two creditors who did not intend to vote in favor of the Original Plan, Blue Star Materials LLC and Buzzi Unicem USA, filed a motion to convert the Debtor\u2019s case to a chapter 7 or dismiss the case under. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b). After becoming a creditor in this case by purchasing a small claim, on December 6, 2013, Appellee Concrete Opportunity Fund II, LLC (Concrete) filed an objection to the Debtor\u2019s disclosure statement. On December 9, 2013, Concrete proposed its own plan of reorganization that would pay seventy-five percent of unsecured claims within ten days of the effective date and the remaining balance seventy-five days later. This plan also included a cash infusion of $750,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Also on December 9, 2013, the Debtor filed an amended plan that would pay sixty-five percent of the unsecured claims within ten days of the effective date and the remainder over five years. On December 18, 2013, the Debtor again filed an amended plan, this time proposing to pay 100 percent of unsecured claims within one day of the effective date and included a $660,000 cash infusion. Finally, on January 22, 2014, the Debtor filed a third amended plan (Final Plan), which proposed to pay 100 percent of unsecured claims within one day of the effective date but also included a cash infusion of $750,000, matching Concrete\u2019s competing plan. The Final Plan was confirmed on March 7, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">On January 17, 2014, Concrete filed an application for reimbursement of legal fees and expenses for substantial contribution under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503(b)(4), Bodin objected, and an evidentiary hearing was held on February 25, 2014. Finding that Concrete substantially contributed to the case, the Bankruptcy Court overruled the objection and awarded Concrete an allowed administrative expense claim of $50,000, roughly two-thirds of the requested amount. The District Court affirmed this award, and Bodin timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">On appeal, Bodin argues that the Bankruptcy Court erred by: (1) allowing Concrete\u2019s attorney to testify at the evidentia-ry hearing, and (2) finding that Concrete substantially contributed to the case. We review appeals from the bankruptcy court in the same manner as the district court: \u201cFact findings of the bankruptcy court are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard and issues of law are reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d In re Soileau, </em>488 F.3d 302, 305 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-13\">Debtor argues that the Bankruptcy Court erred by allowing Trey Monsour, Concrete\u2019s attorney, to testify at the evi-dentiary hearing on substantial contribution because he lacked sufficient personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>knowledge of this issue and was not qualified as an expert. We review evidentiary determinations for abuse of discretion and we will only \u201cvacate a judgment based on an error in an evidentiary ruling ... [if] the substantial rights of the parties were affected.\u201d <em>Seatrax, Inc. v. Sonbeck Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>200 F.3d 358, 370 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Fed.R.Evid. 103(a); <em>see also In re Pequeno, </em>223 Fed.Appx. 307, 308 (5th Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (\u201cIn an appeal based on an evidentiary ruling of the Bankruptcy Court, an appellant must prove both: (1) that the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion; and (2) that the appellant\u2019s substantial rights were prejudiced.\u201d (citation omitted)). While Monsour did not have personal knowledge of events that transpired in the case before Concrete purchased a claim and retained Monsour, Monsour testified concerning Concrete\u2019s actions in the case after his retention, such as efforts by Concrete via Rule 2004 examination <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to obtain documentation from the Debtor, the various plans proposed by Concrete and the Debtor, and the amount and reasonableness of Concrete\u2019s fees. Even though Monsour was not designated as an expert, his testimony related to his personal knowledge of the contributions of Concrete to the case after his retention, and the Bankruptcy Court was within its discretion in allowing this testimony from Monsour.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Bodin next argues that the Bankruptcy Court erred m awardmg a substantial contribution fee to Concrete. \u201cThe inquiry regarding a substantial contribution is one of fact.\u201d <em>In re Consol. Bancshares, Inc., </em>785 F.2d 1249, 1253 (5th Cir.1986). As such, we review this determination for clear error. <em>Soileau, </em>488 F.3d at 305; <em>see also In re DP Partners Ltd., </em>106 F.3d 667, 673-74 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201cNecessarily, the bankruptcy court enjoys broad discretion in making these determinations.\u201d (citation omitted)). We cannot say the Bankruptcy Court clearly erred in determining that Concrete substantially contributed to the case. While substantial contribution is not statutorily defined, we have stated that \u201cservices which make a substantial contribution are those which foster and enhance, rather than retard or interrupt the progress of reorganization.\u201d <em>DP Partners, </em>106 F.3d at 672 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Further, a substantial 'contribution must be \u201cconsiderable in amount, value or worth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). While the determination of \u201csubstantial contribution is best left on a case-by-case basis, ... [a]t a minimum ... the [bankruptcy] court should weigh the cost of the claimed fees and expenses against the benefits conferred upon the estate which flow directly from those actions\u201d when the \u201c[b]enefits flow[ ] to only a portion of the estate or to limited classes of creditors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When this is the case, the benefits should be \u201cnecessarily diminished in weight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, \u201cto aid the district and appellate courts in the review process, bankruptcy judges should make specific and detailed findings on the substantial contribution issue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">The Bankruptcy Court, which presided over the Debtor\u2019s entire case, found that Concrete \u201cprovided direct and demonstrable benefits to th[e] estate.\u201d By its actions in the case, chiefly proposing an alternate .plan, the Bankruptcy Court found that Concrete \u201cput[ ] pressure on the debtor to get its plan approved and fulfill its promises under the plan.\u201d Otherwise, Concrete\u2019s proposed plan could have replaced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>the Debtor\u2019s. The Bankruptcy Court found the timeline of events probative of Concrete\u2019s contribution. More specifically, the timeline indicated that the Debtor was unable to propose a satisfactory plan during the exclusivity period. Concrete\u2019s actions in the case motivated the Debtor to amend its plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">In making the substantial contribution determination, the Bankruptcy Court considered evidence regarding the value to the creditors under the Original and Final Plans, but Bodin argues that the Bankruptcy Court was required to quantify the precise benefit created by Concrete\u2019s involvement in the case by looking at the present value to creditors of each plan and weighing this against the costs. Essentially, Bodin claims the Bankruptcy Court erred by not determining the exact dollar value of the benefit created by Concrete\u2019s involvement using a present value comparison of the two plans. However, the court considered the differences in the two plans and concluded that the Final Plan provided cash to the unsecured creditors on the effective date of the plan, eliminating the need for a five-year payout. The court stated that it was unquestionable that cash today was more valuable to the creditors than the payout proposed by the Original Plan. While the Bankruptcy Court did not make a finding of the specific dollar value difference in the two plans, its consideration of the differing natures of the two plans was sufficient \u201cspecific and detailed findings\u201d to support its award of a substantial contribution. <em>DP Partners, </em>106 F.3d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Further, we have recognized that while some actions may result in \u201cbenefits] that often can be measured by the actual cost of necessary goods or services supplied,\u201d there may be \u201cless readily calculable benefits\u201d conferred to the estate, \u201csuch as the ability to continue to conduct business as usual.\u201d <em>In re TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp., </em>978 F.2d 1409, 1420 (5th Cir.1992). Here, after the expiration of exclusivity, Concrete\u2019s involvement in the case put pressure on the Debtor to propose a more favorable plan that was confirmable and provided a greater return for the estate. Concrete\u2019s actions benefitted all unsecured creditors in the case, and the Bankruptcy Court was not required to trace the benefit to limited classes of creditors in order to accord it diminished weight. <em>Cf. DP Partners, </em>106 F.3d at 673. Thus, the Bankruptcy Court did not clearly err in awarding Concrete $50,000 in fees for substantially contributing to the Debt- or\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b769-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
