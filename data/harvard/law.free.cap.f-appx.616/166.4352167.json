Petitioner conceded he was removable and applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Tortee (CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-23\">Border Patrol Agents apprehended petitioner in 2008, shortly after he entered the United States illegally, and about three years after his marriage in India to a woman of the Jatt Sikh caste \u2014 a higher caste than petitioner\u2019s Ramdasia Sikh caste \u2014 without her father\u2019s consent. Petitioner maintains inclusion in his caste subjected him and his family to persecution in India, and forms the basis of his asylum claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-24\">Although the immigration judge (IJ) determined petitioner was credible, the IJ concluded he was not entitled to asylum relief or withholding of removal or CAT protection. \u2022 The IJ concluded that, although petitioner\u2019s Ramdasia Sikh caste constituted a particular social group, he failed to demonstrate he was persecuted based on his group membership, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>persecuted at all, or he had a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">In dismissing petitioner\u2019s claims on appeal, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) agreed with the IJ that petitioner had not established his membership in the Ramdasia Sikh caste was one central reason for his alleged persecution. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i); <em>Shaikh v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 861, 864 (5th Cir.2009). The BIA also noted petitioner had abandoned his CAT claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In' seeking review of the BIA\u2019s decision, petitioner has abandoned his claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, at issue are only his claims supporting asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Despite petitioner\u2019s suggestion we review the issue <em>de novo, </em>the determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum is reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard. <em>See Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005). Under this standard, the BIA\u2019s conclusion must be substantially reasonable and based on evidence presented, and relief is only, appropriate where the evidence is \u201cso compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution\u201d. <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 350-51 (5th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). The underlying decision of the IJ is reviewed only if it influenced the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Gomez-Palados v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that petitioner\u2019s failure to ask for permission to marry was the motivation for his father-in-law\u2019s threats and beating of petitioner. His father-in-law personally told him he was displeased because he had not asked for permission to marry his daughter. Relatives of the bride were absent from the wedding because petitioner did not have her father\u2019s approval of the marriage. That there is also evidence suggesting caste-based vindictiveness does not compel a conclusion contrary to the BIA\u2019s.. <em>See Shaikh, </em>588 F.3d at 864. In short, petitioner has not met the difficult requirement that he set forth evidence \u201cso compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find\u201d his membership in the Ramdasia Sikh caste was one central reason for his father-in-law\u2019s actions and threats. <em>Ontunez-Tursios, </em>303 F.3d at 351; <em>see </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Because the petition is denied for the foregoing reasons, we need not consider petitioner\u2019s other bases for maintaining asylum relief is proper. <em>See Mwembie v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 414 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b196-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
