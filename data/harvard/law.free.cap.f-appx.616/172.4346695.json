The district court imposed a within-guidelines sentence of 41 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-17\">Initially, Rios argues that the district court\u2019s application of the 16-level offense enhancement provision under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) violates the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection because the Guideline: (1) uses prior convictions to enhance the offense level; (2) lacks an empirical basis; (3) results in excessive sentences as compared to sentences for more egregious crimes; and (4) double-counts the prior conviction. However, the enhancement of Rios\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) did not violate his right to equal protection of the law. <em>See United States v. Cardenas-Alvarez, </em>987 F.2d 1129, 1134 (5th Cir.1993). We have emphasized that the Sentencing Commission intended, in singling out certain offenses under \u00a7 2L1.2 for significant enhancement, to identify and to penalize those crimes that are violent or forceful, or risk violence and the application of force. <em>United States v. Zavala-Montoya, </em>71 Fed.Appx. 358, 361 (5th Cir.2003). Moreover, we have consistently rejected \u201cdouble counting\u201d arguments and arguments that \u00a7 2L1.2 results in excessive sentences because it is not empirically based. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-22\">In addition, Rios maintains that he should have been sentenced under \u00a7 1326(a) and that his sentence is unconstitutional because the conviction used to enhance his sentence was not alleged in his indictment. As Rios acknowledges, his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Tor-res v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See United States v. Pinedas-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007).'</p>\n<p id=\"b202-23\">Finally, Rios argues that the enhancement provision of \u00a7 2L1.2 violates his Eighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment. However, his within-guidelines sentence is not grossly disproportionate to his offense such that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>violates the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Cardenas-Alvarez, </em>987 F.2d at 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b202-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
