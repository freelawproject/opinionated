Oxner, federal prisoner # 05874-003, who stands convicted of interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle and felony possession of a firearm, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. Relying on <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), Oxner argues that the sentencing court erroneously determined that one of his prior convictions was a violent felony pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act. The district court determined that Oxner had not met the criteria for proceeding under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which allows a federal prisoner to attack the legality of his conviction in a \u00a7 2241 petition if he can show that the remedies provided under \u00a7 2255 are \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">A prisoner seeking to establish that his \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective must make a claim (i) \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d that (ii) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). As <em>Descamps </em>addresses sentencing issues and has no effect on whether the facts of Oxner\u2019s case would support his convictions for the substantive offenses, it is not a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision indicating that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2282-84, 2293; <em>In re Bradford, </em>660 F.3d 226, 230 (5th Cir.2011); <em>Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, </em>305 F.3d 343, 348 (5th Cir.2002). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b221-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
