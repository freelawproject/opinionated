HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b203-25\">John Dale Berry appeals the 60-month sentence imposed following his guilty plea conviction for theft of government funds. He argues that this above-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-26\">. In reviewing a non-guidelines sentence for substantive reasonableness, we consider \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the guidelines range, to determine whether as a matter of substance, the sentencing factors in section 3553(a) support the sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Gerezano-Rosales, </em>692 F.3d 393, 400 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A sentence is unreasonable if it \u201c(1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401 (quoting <em>United States v. Broussard, </em>669 F.3d 537, 551 (5th Cir.2012)). Where \u2014 as here \u2014 the district court \u201cproperly calculated the applicable Guideline range and carefully articulated permissible reasons for its variance,\u201d its sentence \u201cmust be given great deference.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 710 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-27\">The record establishes that the district court considered Berry\u2019s arguments for a lighter sentence but concluded that an above-guidelines sentence was warranted under \u00a7 3553(a) to provide just punishment, promote respect for the law, deter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>future thefts, and protect the public. The district court justified its upward variance with factors including Berry\u2019s prior theft offenses, lack of remorse, and failure to reimburse prior victims, as well as the thirty-year period over which he unlawfully collected his mother\u2019s Social Security benefits. Under the totality of the circumstances, Berry has not shown that the district court imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 707-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b203-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
