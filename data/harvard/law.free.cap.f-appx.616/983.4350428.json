Caceres-Gonzales argues that he was entitled to a continuance of his removal proceedings to apply for an adjustment of status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i). Caceres-Gonzales also argues, for the first time, that the Board of Immigration Appeals and immigration judge failed to follow precedent when disposing of the motion to continue. We deny in part, and dismiss in part, Caceres-Gonzales\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-23\">The immigration judge did not abuse her discretion by denying Caceres-Gon-zales\u2019s motion to continue. An alien may obtain a continuance to pursue an adjustment of status for \u201cgood cause shown,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29, but that standard requires the alien to prove there is more than a \u201cspeculative possibility that at some point in the future\u201d he may be eligible for that relief. <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1363-64 (11th Cir.2006); <em>accord Chacku v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>555 F.3d 1281, 1285 (11th Cir.2008). Caceres-Gonzales wanted to adjust his status as a derivative of his wife, Sandra Damien, based on an approved petition filed by her father, a United States citizen. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i). To attain his wife\u2019s more favorable preference status, Caceres-Gonzales had to be \u201caccompanying or following to join\u201d Damien, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 l\u00cd53(d), but her priority date, as a citizen of Mexico, was two years in the future. Because she did not have a visa \u201cimmediately available,\u201d Caceres-Gonzales suggested that he could confer on his wife the more favorable visa chargeability of his native country, Honduras, which was current. <em>See id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>\u00a7 1152(b)(2); 9 Foreign Affairs Manual \u00a7 42.12 n. 3.8. But to use each other\u2019s derivative eligibility, Caceres-Gonzales and his wife had to apply for an adjustment of status simultaneously, <em>see </em>9 Foreign Affairs Manual \u00a7\u00a7 40.1 n. 8(c), 42.12 n. 3.8, which they had failed to do. Because the prospect of Caceres-Gonzales becoming eligible for an adjustment of status as a derivative of his wife was, as stated by the immigration judge, \u201ctotally speculative,\u201d it was not an abuse of discretion to deny Caceres-Gonzales\u2019s motion to continue. We deny Caceres-Gonzales\u2019s petition to the extent that he challenges the denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">We lack jurisdiction to consider. Ca-ceres-Gonzales\u2019s arguments that the Board and the immigration judge failed to follow precedent that required the immigration judge to \u201carticulate, balance, and explain\u201d the factors it deemed relevant in deciding whether to grant or to deny a continuance. <em>See Matter of Hashmi, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 785, 794 (B.I.A.2009). \u201c\u2018[A] court may review a final order of removal pnly if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to [him] as of right.\u2019\u201d <em>Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1)). Exhaustion provides the Board \u201cthe opportunity to discover and correct [its] own error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1325 (alteration in original and internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Caceres-Gonzales failed to present this issue to the Board on appeal or in a motion for reconsideration. Because, \u201cabsent a cognizable excuse or exception,\u201d we \u201clack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review [when] the petitioner has [failed to] exhaust[ ] his administrative remedies,\u201d <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006), we dismiss this part of Caceres-Gonzales\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
