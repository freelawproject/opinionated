United States, </em>579 Fed.Appx. 833 (11th Cir.2014) (unpublished). Beckles argued that he was sentenced improperly as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1; he contends his conviction for unlawful possession of a sawed-off shotgun was no \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling, concluding that Beckles\u2019s argument was foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Hall, </em>714 F.3d 1270 (11th Cir.2013). <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court has now vacated our decision and remanded the case to us for additional consideration in the light of <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). After additional review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-26\">Beckles was sentenced properly as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Beckles had at least two prior felony convictions for drug offenses. And Beckles\u2019s offense of conviction \u2014 unlawful possession of a sawed-off shotgun \u2014 constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under section 4B1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 cmt. n. 1 (providing expressly that the unlawful possession of \u201ca firearm described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a) (e.g., a sawed-off shotgun or sawed-off rifle, silencer, bomb, or machine gun) is a \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Hall, </em>714 F.3d at 1274 (concluding that the Guidelines commentary in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 is binding and, thus, that the possession of a sawed-off shotgun qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson </em>\u2014 in which the Supreme Court struck down, as unconstitutionally vague, the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) \u2014 does not control this appeal. Beckles was sentenced as a career offender based <em>not </em>on the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, but based on express language in the Sentencing Guidelines classifying Beckles\u2019s offense as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>says and decided nothing about career-offender enhancements under the Sentencing Guidelines or about the Guidelines commentary underlying Beckles\u2019s status as a career-offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Our decision in <em>Hall </em>remains good law and continues to control in this appeal. <em>See Atl. Sounding Co., Inc. v. Townsend, </em>496 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cUnder pur prior panel precedent rule, a later panel may depart from an earlier panel\u2019s decision only when the intervening Supreme Court decision is \u2018clearly on point.\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
