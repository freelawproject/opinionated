In his complaint, Wallace challenged the defendants\u2019 allegedly wrongful failure to issue him a notice to appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) on the ground that this inaction deprived him of his only procedural opportunity to renew his previously denied application for adjustment of status. On appeal, Wallace argues that the district court erred by concluding that \u00a7 1252(g) deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction to hear his claims. Specifically, he contends that \u00a7 1252(g)\u2019s plain language and the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of that statutory provision indicate that it applies only to a government\u2019s affirmative decision to commence removal proceedings, not the inverse decision not to commence such proceedings. Moreover, Wallace asserts that he has an enforceable legal right to be placed in removal proceedings in order to renew his adjustment-of-status application under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(5)(h), and that the district court in its order erroneously failed to address the merits of his due-process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">We have jurisdiction over appeals from all final orders of the district courts within our geographic bounds. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review a district court\u2019s determination of its subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Sweet Pea Marine, Ltd. v. APJ Marine, Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1242, 1247 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require the dismissal of a claim if a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over it. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), (h)(3). The party bringing the underlying claim bears the burden of establishing federal subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Sweet Pea Marine, Ltd., </em>411 F.3d at 1247 (examining diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">The Mandamus Act, which provides a private cause of action for parties related to certain governmental agents and entities\u2019 failure to perform prescribed duties, states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-10\">The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or em-' ployee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. The APA\u2019s provisions concerning the extent of its applicability vis-a-vis other laws state, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-12\">(a) This chapter applies, according to the provisions thereof, except to the extent-that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-13\">(1) statutes preclude judicial review; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-14\">(2) agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-15\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-16\">Section 1252(g) of Title 8 of the U.S.Code pertaining to federal courts\u2019 subject matter jurisdiction to hear certain immigration claims provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-17\">Except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or non-statutory), including section 2241 of Title 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-18\">INA \u00a7 242(g), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g). Section 245.2 of Title 8 of the Code of Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>Regulations pertaining to applications for adjustment of status provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-4\">No appeal lies from the denial of an application by the director, but the applicant, if not an arriving alien, retains the right to renew his or her application in proceedings under 8 CFR part 240..;.

Certain kinds of immigration cases require the issuance of a NTA. <em>See, e.g., </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 216.3(a) (concerning termination of conditional resident status); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 207.9 (concerning termination of refugee status). Cases involving adjustment-of-status applications, however, do not require such issuance. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 245, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">In <em>Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. (\u201cAADC\u201d), </em>525 U.S. 471, 472-73, 119 S.Ct. 936, 938, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999), the Supreme Court considered whether \u00a7 1252(g) deprived a district court of jurisdiction to consider aliens\u2019 challenge to the initiation of removal proceedings against them on the basis that the immigration agency had discrimi-natorily initiated such proceedings in a selective manner based on their political affiliations. The Court held that \u00a7 1252(g) is not to be construed broadly as a \u201czipper\u201d clause applying to the full universe of deportation-related claims, but instead as applying narrowly to only the three \u201cdiscrete\u201d governmental actions enumerated in that subsection. <em>Id. </em>at 482, 119 S.Ct. at 943. The Court observed that \u00a7 1252(g)\u2019s enumerated discrete acts \u2014 commencing proceedings, adjudicating cases, and executing removal orders \u2014 were those that the government had been engaging in as regular practice and for which it had the discretion to abandon its endeavors on such grounds as humanitarianism and its own convenience. <em>Id. </em>at 483-84, 119 S.Ct. at 943. The Court noted that the legislative intent underlying \u00a7 1252(g) was to streamline immigration proceedings by insulating from judicial review certain governmental decisions that were the product of prosecutorial discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 485-87, 119 S.Ct. at 944-45. In particular, it observed that \u00a7 1252(g) was a \u201cdiscretion-protecting provision\u201d that applied even to pending cases, as it was specifically directed at ameliorating \u201cthe deconstruction, fragmentation, and hence prolongation\u201d of pre-existing removal proceedings. <em>Id </em>at 487,119 S.Ct. at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">In <em>Gupta v. McGahey, </em>709 F.3d 1062, 1063-64 (11th Cir.2013), we considered whether a district court lacked jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(g) to consider an alien\u2019s challenge under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), to the constitutionality of his arrest and detention by immigration agents, and the agents\u2019 search and seizure of his personal property, related to the initiation of removal proceedings against him. We concluded that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(g) to consider those claims, as they pertained to actions taken to secure him and prevent the perceived threat that he posed pending a final removal determination. <em>Id. </em>at' 1065. As such, we determined that Gupta\u2019s challenge to the governmental actions at issue necessarily qualified as a claim \u201carising from\u201d a \u201cdecision ... to commence proceedings\u201d under \u00a7 1252(g), and affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 1065-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">In <em>De La Teja v. United States, </em>321 F.3d 1357, 1359 (11th Cir.2003), we considered whether a district court lacked jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(g) to consider an alien\u2019s habeas corpus challenge under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 to the immigration agency\u2019s initiation of removal proceedings against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>him on the basis that his removal would violate a prior vacated judicial removal order. We concluded that the district court lacked jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(g) to consider that claim, as it challenged the agency\u2019s \u201cdecision\u201d to \u201ccommence proceedings\u201d pursuant to <em>AADC. Id. </em>at 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Here, the district court did not err by dismissing Wallace\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Wallace\u2019s asserted claims were jurisdictionally barred under \u00a7 1252(g), based on that statutory provision\u2019s plain language, its interpretation by the Supreme Court and our sister circuits, and this Court\u2019s application of \u00a7 1252(g) to bar analogous challenges to the government\u2019s initiation of removal proceedings. <em>See AADC, </em>525 U.S. at 484-85, 119 S.Ct. at 944 (After referring to the \u201ccommendable exercise in administrative discretion\u201d known as \u201cdeferred action\u201d \u2014 ' meaning that for humanitarian reasons no action will be taken to proceed against an apparently deportable alien \u2014 the Court held: \u201cSection 1252(g) seems clearly designed to give some measure, of protection to \u2018no deferred action\u2019 .decisions and similar- discretionary determinations, providing that if they are reviewable at all, they at least will not be made the basis fo.r separate rounds of judicial intervention outside the streamlined process that Congress has designed.\u201d). <em>See also Alvidres-Reyes v. Reno, </em>180 F.3d 199, 204-06 (5th Cir.1999) (construing Section 1252(g) and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>AADC </em>as authority for its holding that \u201cfederal courts lack jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs-aliens\u2019 challenge to the\u2019Attorney General\u2019s decision to decline to commence [deportation] proceedings\u201d). <em>Accord, Chapinski v. Zig-lar, </em>278 F.3d 718, 720-21 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
