Vieux appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">A. 1995 Convictions and 1996 Sentences in the Middle District of Florida</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">In 1995, iii the Middle District of Florida, a jury convicted Vieux of two counts of carjacking with intent to cause death or serious bodily harm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2119 and 2 (Counts 2 and 6); three counts of use of a firearm during three robberies, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (Counts 3, 7 and 9); three counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (Counts 5, 10 and 12); possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count 11); obstruction of commerce by robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (Count 8); and conspiracy to commit the charged substantive offenses, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (Count 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">After grouping multiple offenses, the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) showed Vieux had a combined adjusted offense level of 43 and a criminal history category of III, yielding a guidelines range sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-13\">The district court imposed a total sentence of life, plus 45 years. The 45 years represented the statutorily required consecutive sentences on Vieux\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) firearm offenses consisting of: a five-year consecutive sentence on Count 3, a twenty-year sentence on Count 7 to be served consecutive to the Count 3 sentence, and a twenty-year sentence on Count 9, to be served consecutive to Count 7 sentence. The judgment does not separate all of the counts, but at a minimum the district court imposed a life sentence on Count 6, the carjacking offense that resulted in death.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-14\">At the time of Vieux\u2019s 1996 sentencing, the federal carjacking statute, in \u00a7 2119(2), increased the statutory maximum prison term from 15 years to 25 years \u201cif serious bodily injury ... results.\u201d And, if \u201cdeath results,\u201d \u00a7 2119(3) increased the statutory maximum prison term to \u201cany number of years up to life\u201d or a death sentence. In 1995, this Court held that the \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d or \u201cdeath\u201d enhancements were sentencing factors that could be found by the district court at sentencing, not elements of the offense that must be proven to the jury. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>51 F.3d 1004, 1009 (11th Cir.1995), abrogated by <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119(2) <em>&amp; </em>(3) (and, \u201cif death results,\u201d providing for a prison term of).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-15\">Consistent with <em>Williams, </em>the sentencing court found that the carjacking in Count 2 occurred on April 13, 1995, and resulted in serious bodily injury to the victim driver. The sentencing court found the carjacking in Count 6 occurred on April 22,1995, and resulted in the death of the victim driver. As a result, the sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>tencing court imposed prison sentences of 25 years on Count 2 and a life sentence on Count 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">On direct appeal, Vieux did not raise any issue with respect to his enhanced sentences under \u00a7 2119(2) and (3) or argue that the facts supporting his enhanced sentences should have been charged in the indictment and found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 3, 1998, this Court affirmed Vieux\u2019s convictions and sentences. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>138 F.3d 955 (11th Cir.1998) (table).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">B. First \u00a7 2255 Motion in the Middle District of Florida</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">On March 5, 1999, Vieux filed his initial 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion in the Middle District of Florida. Vieux\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion did not raise any claims particular to his two carjacking convictions. He did not challenge the sentencing court\u2019s finding that his carjackings involved death and serious bodily injury to his victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">Around the time Vieux filed his \u00a7 2255 motion, the United States Supreme Court issued two decisions implicating the federal carjacking statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119. On March 2, 1999, the Supreme Court decided <em>Holloway v. United States, </em>which concluded that the intent element of \u00a7 2119 required proof only that at the moment that the defendant demanded or took control of the car, he possessed the intent to seriously harm or ldll the driver if necessary in order to steal the car. 526 U.S. 1, 3, 12, 119 S.Ct. 966, 968, 972, 143 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999). A few weeks later, on March 24, 1999, the Supreme Court decided <em>Jones v. United States, </em>which concluded that the enhanced penalties in subsections (2) and (3) of \u00a7 2119, when serious bodily injury or death resulted, were separate elements of the offense, not sentencing factors that could be found by the sentencing court. 526 U.S. 227, 251-52, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 1228, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">On March 19,1999, Vieux filed a motion to amend his \u00a7 2255 motion, but did not explain what claims Vieux wanted to add to his motion, did not refer to his carjacking convictions, and did not cite <em>Holloway, </em>which was just decided. The motion merely asked the district court to allow him to amend his \u00a7 2255 motion, given that the court had denied his request to adopt a codefendant\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. On March 29, 1999, the district court denied the motion to amend because Vieux failed to submit a proposed amended \u00a7 2255 motion along with the motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-12\">On April 19, 1999, Vieux filed a second motion to amend, this time stating, \u201cIn the waking [sic] of <em>Jones v. U.S., </em>No. 97-6203 March 24, 1999, this amendment motion for Addendum to \u00a7 2255 is in good faith and not to delay the court.\u201d On April 26, 1999, the district court denied the motion again because Vieux \u201cdid not submit a proposed amended section 2255 motion in its entirety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-13\">Separately, on May 7, 1999, Vieux attempted to file an \u201cAddendum Motion Under 28 U.S.C., \u00a7 2255.\u201d On May 11, 1999, the district court struck this pleading because Vieux \u201cdid not obtain leave of court to file the amended section 2255 motion.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>On June 11, 1999, Vieux made a final attempt to amend his original \u00a7 2255 motion, again stating that the amendment was sought in the wake of <em>Jones. </em>On June 25, 1999, the district court denied the motion to amend, explaining that it had \u201cpreviously informed Defendant as to how the proposed section 2255 motion should be presented to the Court, and Defendant has failed to do so.\u201d The district court instructed the clerk \u201cto return the proposed pleadings to Defendant.\u201d The district court also directed the government to file a response to Vieux\u2019s original \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">On August 5, 1999, the district court denied Vieux\u2019s original \u00a7 2255 motion on the merits and dismissed his case with prejudice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Vieux filed a notice of appeal, which this Court construed as a motion for a certificate of appealability and denied. The United States Supreme Court denied Vieux\u2019s petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">C.2002 Second \u00a7 2255 Motion in the Middle District of Florida</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">On February 25, 2002, Vieux filed a second \u00a7 2255 motion in the Middle District of Florida. Vieux\u2019s second \u00a7 2255 motion raised three claims relating to Counts 2 and 6, the carjacking offenses, two based on <em>Jones </em>and one based on <em>Holloway. </em>The district court dismissed Vieux\u2019s second \u00a7 2255 motion without prejudice because Vieux had not first obtained authorization from this Court to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">The district court, and then this Court, denied Vieux\u2019s requests for a certificate of appealability. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Vieux\u2019s petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">D. 2005 Application for Leave to File Successive \u00a7 2255 Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">On February 18, 2005, Vieux filed with this Court an application for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. This Court denied Vieux\u2019s application because Vieux\u2019s claims did not rely on a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive or rely on newly discovered evidence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">E. Rule 60(b) Motion in Middle District of Florida</p>\n<p id=\"b924-14\">On December 13, 2005, Vieux returned to the Middle District of Florida and filed a motion for relief from the judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). Vieux complained that the district court \u201con four (4) different occasions, denied him his absolute right to amend his 1999 original \u00a7 2255,\u201d and that he was \u201csubsequently being subjected to the restrictive provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-15\">The district court filed Vieux\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion as a separate action under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>\u00a7 2255. In dismissing the action without prejudice, the district court noted that Vieux sought to challenge his carjacking convictions based on the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Jones v. United, States, </em>which was a claim of error in his federal conviction subject to the limitation on successive \u00a7 2255 motions. The district court explained that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain Vieux\u2019s successive \u00a7 2255 motion without authorization from this Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Vieux appealed the dismissal. Both the district court and this Court denied Vieux\u2019s' request for a certificate of appealability. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Vieux\u2019s petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">F. First \u00a7 2241 Petition in the Middle District of Pennsylvania in 2007</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">While incarcerated in Pennsylvania, Vieux filed his first \u00a7 2241 petition in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, seeking to invoke the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e). <em>See Vieux v. Williamson, </em>4:07-CV-0645, 2007 WL 1799712 (M.D.Pa. June 20, 2007). Vieux\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition challenged his carjacking convictions and sentences in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Jones </em>decision and argued that he could not \u201cchallenge the legality of his sentence in a \u00a7 2255 motion because he has diligently tried to raise his claims via \u00a7 2255, but to no avail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *3, *7. The district court in Pennsylvania dismissed Vieux\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction because his claims needed to be brought in a \u00a7 2255 motion, which must be filed in the sentencing court after obtaining permission from this Court to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court further concluded that the denials of Vieux\u2019s previous \u00a7 2255 motions were \u201cinsufficient to show that \u00a7 2255.remedy is inadequate or ineffective,\u201d as required by \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Id. </em>at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">On appeal, the Third Circuit affirmed, \u201cagree[ing] with the District Court\u2019s determination that Vieux\u2019s situation does not render section 2255 inadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>Vieux v. Williamson, </em>250 F.App\u2019x 519, 521 (3rd Cir.2007). The Third Circuit stressed that the fact that \u201cVieux was denied leave to amend the [original] section 2255 in the sentencing court\u201d and \u201chas failed thus far in obtaining authorization from the Eleventh Circuit to file another \u00a7 2255 motion does not show the inadequacy of that remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521-22. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Vieux\u2019s petition for certiorari. <em>Vieux v. Williamson, </em>553 U.S. 1012, 128 S.Ct. 2071, 170 L.Ed.2d 808 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">G. 2008 Motion for Writ of Coram No-bis in the Middle District of Florida</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">On June 12, 2008, Vieux filed a \u201cWrit of Error Coram Nobis\u201d in the Middle District of Florida, again challenging his carjacking convictions and sentences citing <em>Holloway </em>and <em>Jones. </em>The district court denied Vieux\u2019s motion, stating that Vieux was \u201cattempting to collaterally attack his conviction and sentence which can only be brought on a Section 2255 motion not by a motion for writ of coram nobis.\u201d The district court concluded that it was \u201cwithout jurisdiction to consider a 5th such motion.\u201d The district court denied Vieux\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability. Later on, this Court dismissed Vieux\u2019s appeal for lack of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">With this background,' we turn to the instant \u00a7 2241 petition before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">II. SECOND \u00a7 2241 PETITION IN THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA</p>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">By mid-2009, Vieux was housed at Tal-ladega FCI in Alabama. On June 24, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>2011, Vieux filed the instant \u00a7 2241 petition in \u2018the Northern District of Alabama, again seeking to challenge his carjacking convictions and sentences through the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e). Vieux\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition argued that the repeated denials of his motions to amend his original \u00a7 2255 motion \u2014 filed in the Middle District of Florida \u2014 to add claims based on <em>Jones </em>and <em>Holloway </em>rendered \u00a7 2255 \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his \u201cdetention\u201d and that he met the requirements of the \u201csavings clause\u201d in \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">The magistrate judge\u2019s report (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) concluded that Vieux\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause because: (1) <em>Holloway </em>and <em>Jones </em>were not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; (2) <em>Holloway </em>and <em>Jones </em>did not establish that Vieux was convicted of a nonexistent offense; and (3) in any event, Vieux had not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying Vieux leave to amend his original \u00a7 2255 motion. Because Vieux could not establish that the \u00a7 2255 remedy was \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d the district court was not authorized under \u00a7 2255(e) to entertain his claims via a \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Over Vieux\u2019s objection, the district court adopted the R &amp; R and dismissed Vieux\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition with prejudice for lack of jurisdiction. The district court denied Vieux\u2019s subsequent motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) to alter or amend the judgment. Vieux filed this appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">A. General Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">Section 2241 habeas petitions \u201care generally reserved for challenges to the execution of a sentence or the nature of confinement, not the validity of the sentence itself or the fact of confinement.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1288 (11th Cir.2013) (emphasis omitted). Typically, once a conviction becomes final, a prisoner collaterally attacks the validity of his federal conviction or sentence by filing a \u00a7 2255 motion in the district of conviction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1256; <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). Once the prisoner has filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, he must apply for and receive authorization from this Court before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2255(h), 2244(b)(3); <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">However, under our precedent, the \u201csavings clause\u201d in \u00a7 2255(e) permits a prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition if the prisoner establishes that \u00a7 2255\u2019s remedy was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. The savings clause is a jurisdictional provision, such that a petitioner must show \u00a7 2255\u2019s remedy is \u201cinadequate and ineffective\u201d before the district court has jurisdiction to review the \u00a7 2241 petition on the merits. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1262; <em>Williams v. Warden, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 52, 190 L.Ed.2d 29 (2014).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>To open the \u00a7 2255(e) portal to an actual-innocence conviction claim, the \u00a7 2241 petitioner must show that: (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of which establishes the petitioner was convicted of a non-existent offense; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed the petitioner from raising the conviction claim at \u201c\u2018trial, direct appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1264 (quoting. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">To open the \u00a7 2255(e) portal to a sentencing claim, the \u00a7 2241 petitioner must establish that: (1) binding circuit precedent squarely foreclosed the claim \u201cthroughout his sentence, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding\u201d; (2) \u201csubsequent to his first 2255 proceeding,\u201d a U.S. Supreme Court decision overturned that circuit precedent; (3) the rule announced in that Supreme Court decision applies retroactively on collateral review; (4) as a result of the new rule, the petitioner\u2019s current sentence exceeds the statutory maximum penalty authorized by Congress; and (5) the savings clause reaches the petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>Bryant, </em>738' F.3d at 1274 (involving the violent felony enhancement in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)); <em>see also Jeanty v. Warden, </em>757 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2014) (involving the prior felony drug offense enhancement in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">B. Vieux\u2019s \u00a7 2241 Claims</p>\n<p id=\"A-AM\">Here, the district court did not err in dismissing Vieux\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of-jurisdiction. Vieux\u2019s attack on his carjacking convictions needs to be viewed as two separate claims. The first, based on <em>Jones, </em>is a sentencing claim. The second, based on <em>Holloway, </em>is a claim of actual innocence of the carjacking offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\"><em>Jones </em>held that the facts necessary to impose the enhanced prison penalties in either subsections (2) or (3) of \u00a7 2119\u2014 that the carjacking resulted in either serious bodily injury or death \u2014 were elements of the carjacking offense that needed to be charged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jones, </em>526 U.S. at 251-52, 119 S.Ct. at 1228. <em>Jones </em>is merely a specific application to the federal carjacking statute of the general rule announced one year later in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey. See Apprendi </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>see also United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 237, 125 S.Ct. 738, 752, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (explaining that the general rule applied in <em>Booker </em>was \u201cfirst considered in <em>Jones </em>and developed <em>Apprendi </em>and subsequent cases\u201d). Because the <em>Apprendi </em>rule does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review, neither does <em>Jones, </em>a decision applying that rule. <em>See Dohrm-ann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279,1281-82 (11th Cir.2006); <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201c[W]e hold that the new constitutional rule of criminal procedure announced in <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review.\u201d)'.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">Because <em>Jones </em>is not retroactively applicable on collateral review, Vieux has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>satisfied <em>Bryant\u2019s </em>test, and the \u00a7 2255(e) portal is not opened as to the sentencing claims in his \u00a7 2241 petition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Vieux\u2019s second claim, based on <em>Holloway, </em>is an actual-innocence claim. In <em>Holloway, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that \u00a7 2119 did not require proof of an unconditional intent to kill or injure in all events, but instead required proof only that at the moment the defendant demanded or took control over the driver\u2019s car the defendant possessed conditional intent to kill or injure if necessary to steal the car. <em>Holloway, </em>526 U.S. at 3, 12, 119 S.Ct. at 968, 972. Setting aside the fact that the Supreme Court in <em>Holloway </em>adopted a broader reading of the intent requirement that likely would have been detrimental to Vieux, at the time that <em>Holloway </em>was decided, this Court had not addressed the proper interpretation of \u00a7 2119\u2019s intent requirement. As such, this Circuit precedent did not foreclose Vieux from raising a claim as to the intent requirement at trial, on direct appeal, or in his initial \u00a7 2255 motion, and <em>Holloway </em>did not overturn this Circuit\u2019s precedent. Thus, Vieux\u2019s <em>Holloway </em>claim also fails to open the savings clause portal.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Vieux\u2019s argument that the district court violated the Suspension Clause by dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition lacks merit, too. <em>See Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1316-17 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc) (citing <em>Felker v. Turpin, </em>518 U.S. 651, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996)). Furthermore, because Vieux has not successfully opened \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause portal to \u00a7 2241 jurisdiction, we cannot reach Vieux\u2019s argument based on <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925 (11th Cir.1992). <em>See Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1338-40 (explaining that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction if the savings clause does not apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">For all these reasons, Vieux has not shown the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of \u00a7 2255\u2019s remedy, and the district court did not err in dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We deny Vieux\u2019s request to recall the mandate in his 1998 direct criminal appeal because he has not shown extraordinary circumstances warranting such action. <em>See Calderon v. Thompson, </em>523 U.S. 538, 550, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 1498, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-9\">. The issues Vieux raised on direct appeal were: (1) whether the district judge was required to disqualify herself because one of the investigating agents in Vieux\u2019s case was married to the district judge\u2019s recent law clerk; (2) whether the district court erred in denying his motions for severance and for a mistrial; and (3) whether the trial evidence was insufficient to support his carjacking convictions. On the direct appeal, this Court held that \"[t]he evidence of guilt in this case is overwhelming, such that a recital of the Government\u2019s proof is altogether unnecessary.\u201d Vieux did not testify at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b923-15\">. It appears the \"Addendum\u201d originally was attached to Vieux\u2019s April 19, 1999 motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>amend, as the district court\u2019s order instructed the clerk \"to return to Defendant the proposed addendum which is attached to the 04/19/99 motion to amend.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b924-8\">. Vieux\u2019s original \u00a7 2255 motion raised claims of (1) denial of his right of self-representation at trial; (2) constructive amendment of the indictment as to Counts 7 and 9; (3) ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failing to raise his right of self-representation claim on direct appeal; and (4) ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failing to file a motion to suppress evidence seized during a traffic stop, failing to object to the jury instruction on Counts 7 and 9, and failing to object to the submission to the jury of an unredacted copy of the. indictment that described Vieux\u2019s prior convictions. In denying Vieux's \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court concluded that Vieux had procedurally defaulted the first two claims because he did not raise them on direct appeal and that Vieux failed to satisfy either prong of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), with respect to his ineffective assistance claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b925-8\">. The district court instructed the clerk to send Vieux a form application for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion and close the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b926-6\">. Vieux\u2019s second \u00a7 2241 petition also raised claims with respect to his firearm convictions in Counts 9 and 12 and his controlled substance conviction in Count 11. The district court dismissed those claims as not cognizable. In his appeal brief, Vieux does not challenge the dismissal of those claims or the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 59(e) motion. Accordingly, those claims are abandoned. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b926-14\">. Whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under \u00a7 2255(e)'s savings clause is \u00e1 question of law reviewed <em>de novo. Williams </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b927-7\">. Vieux\u2019s argument that <em>Jones </em>announced a new substantive rule that automatically applies retroactively, rather than a procedural rule that does not, lacles merit also. <em>See Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 351-52, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 2522-23, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004) (explaining that a substantive rule that is retroactive alters the range of conduct or the class of persons the law punishes, while a procedural rule that is not retroactive regulates only the manner of determining the defendant's culpability); <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 866-67 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that Supreme Court decisions, such as <em>Ring, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker, </em>applying <em>Appren-di\u2019s </em>\"prototypical procedural rule\u201d in various contexts are not retroactive).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b928-5\">. We point out to Vieux that his <em>Jones </em>claim would fail on the merits because at trial the government presented uncontroverted evidence that the victim driver (Mr. Hanson) in Count 2 was shot (by Vieux) and seriously injured and the victim driver (Mr. Medina) in Count 6 was shot and lulled (by Vieux\u2019s co-conspirator). Thus, any failure to submit the sentencing factors of serious bodily injury and death to the jury was harmless error. <em>See United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1307-08 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that <em>Appren-di/Jones-based </em>errors are subject to harmless error review, under which the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if there is \"uncontroverted evidence\u201d to support the facts omitted from the indictment that increase the statutory maximum penalty); <em>United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 829-30 (11th Cir.2000) (concluding that <em>Apprendi </em>error is harmless \"if the record does not contain evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding\u201d with respect to the omitted sentencing fact).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b928-10\">. Because the district court did not address it, and the parties do not raise it on appeal, we do not consider whether Vieux's current \u00a7 2241 petition was due to be dismissed as successive under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a); <em>Antonelli v. Warden, 542 </em>F.3d 1348, 1350, 1352 (11th Cir.2008) (affirming district court's dismissal of \u00a7 2241 petition pursuant to \u00a7 2244(a) upon a finding that the claims in the \u00a7 2241 petition previously was adjudicated on the merits in a first \u00a7 2241 petition filed in a district court in Arkansas and affirmed by the Eighth Circuit). We also need not address whether this alternative ground is jurisdictional or not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>WILLIAM PRYOR, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AKGa\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">I concur in the panel opinion. I write separately to reiterate that our precedent in <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir.2013), is wrong, wrong, wrong. Because Richard Vieux\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenges the validity of his sentence, not the execution of it, the savings clause of section 2255(e), properly interpreted, affords him no relief. <em>See Samak v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>766 F.3d 1271, 1276 (11th Cir.2014) (Pryor, J., concurring). Perhaps someday, the United States, in a proper case, will petition this Court to reconsider our precedent in <em>Bryant </em>en banc. If we were to overrule <em>Bryant </em>and its five-step rigmarole, we could dispose of this frivolous appeal and others like it in an opinion of two pages, instead of 18 pages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
