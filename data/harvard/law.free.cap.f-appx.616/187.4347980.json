The district court sentenced him to 36 months of imprisonment and a two-year term of supervised release. He argues that the district court erroneously applied an eight-level offense enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) on the ground that his 1998 Texas felony conviction for theft was an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). Santos asserts that Texas\u2019s theft statute encompasses conduct broader than the generic theft offense because the Texas statute defines theft to include the appropriation of property when it is with consent from the owner that has been induced through deception or coercion, and we have defined generic theft as the taking of property without the owner\u2019s consent. He concedes that this issue is foreclosed by our decision <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>768 F.3d 437, 438 (5th Cir.2014), in which we held that the Texas theft statute, Texas Penal Code \u00a7 31.03, does not deviate from the generic crime of theft. However, Santos contends that this decision conflicts with our earlier decision in <em>Martinez v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 532, 541-42 (5th Cir.2008), in which we held that the federal offense of bank fraud does not meet the generic definition of theft. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Therefore, under the rule of orderliness, Santos asserts that <em>Martinez </em>provides the governing rule for this matter. In the alternative, Santos requests an en banc hearing in this matter.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">In our decision in <em>Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>we specifically addressed any possible conflicts with our earlier decision in <em>Martinez. </em>We reiterated our holding in <em>Martinez </em>and emphasized that the question of a charged theft offense was not before the court and therefore, <em>Martinez </em>was not controlling precedent. <em>Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>768 F.3d at 438. In light of this distinction and our analysis of consent in <em>Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>Santos has failed to establish we violated the rule of orderliness by not adhering to our previous holding in <em>Martinez. See Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>768 F.3d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b217-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
