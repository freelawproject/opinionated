The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found that Atha suffered from several severe impairments \u2014 status post fractures to his left knee and leg, mild degenerative disc disease, depression, alcohol dependence, a history of substance abuse, and low average to borderline intellectual functioning \u2014 that made him unable to perform his past relevant work installing vinyl siding, hanging sheet rock, and assembling trailers. The ALJ, however, also found that Atha was not disabled because there were a significant number of other, sedentary jobs he could still perform despite his impairments. On appeal, Atha argues that: (1) substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that there were a significant number of jobs he could perform; and (2) the Appeals Council did not adequately review his new evidence when it denied his request for review. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">I. THE FIVE-STEP EVALUATION</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">A claimant for SSI benefits must prove he is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.912; <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). Under the five-step sequential evaluation used to determine whether a claimant is disabled, the ALJ considers: (1) whether the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) if not, whether the claimant has a severe impairment or combination of impairments; (3) if so, whether these impairments meet or equal an impairment listed in the Listing of Impairments; (4) if not, whether the claimant has the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform his past relevant work; and (5) if not, whether, in light of his age, education, and work experience, the claimant can perform other work that exists in \u201csignificant numbers in the national economy.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.920(a)(4), (c)-(g), 416.960(c)(2); <em>see also Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">The claimant bears the burden to prove the first four steps. If the claimant does so, the burden shifts temporarily to the Commissioner to prove the fifth step. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(v) &amp; (g); <em>see also Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">At the fifth step, the Commissioner can carry her burden through the testimony of a vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d). <em>Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1229; <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.912(f), 416.966(e). If the Commissioner presents evidence that other work exists in significant numbers in the national economy, \u201cto be considered disabled, the claimant must then prove that he is unable to perform the jobs that the Commissioner lists.\u201d <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 n. 2 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-13\">II. SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS IN THE NATIONAL ECONOMY</p>\n<p id=\"b963-14\">Further, under the statutory provisions governing SSI benefits, a person is. not disabled unless he cannot \u201cengage in any other kind of substantial gainful work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>which exists in the national economy, regardless of whether such work exists in the immediate area in which he lives, or whether a specific job vacancy exists for him, or whether he would be hired if he applied for work.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(B). These provisions make clear that \u201c \u2018work which exists in the national economy\u2019 means work which exists in significant numbers <em>either </em>in the region where such individual lives <em>or </em>in several regions of the country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Likewise, the implementing regulations state that work exists in the national economy when the work \u201cexists in significant numbers either in the region where [the claimant] live[s] or in several other regions of the country.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.966(a). The regulations clarify that \u201c[i]t does not matter whether ... [w]ork exists in the immediate area in which [the claimant] live[s],\u201d whether a \u201cspecific job vacancy exists,\u201d or if the claimant \u201cwould be hired if [he] applied for work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, a claimant is considered \u201cnot disabled\u201d if he \u201cremain[s] unemployed because of ... [la]ck of work in [his] local area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.966(c). On the other hand, \u201c[i]solat-ed jobs that exist only in very limited numbers in relatively few locations outside of the region where [the claimant] live[s] are not considered work which exists in the national economy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.966(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">This Court has never held that a minimum numerical count of jobs must be identified in order to constitute work that \u201cexists in significant numbers\u201d under the statute and regulations. We have concluded, however, that the \u201cappropriate focus under the regulation is the national economy,\u201d not the local economy in which the claimant lives. <em>Allen v. Bowen, </em>816 F.2d 600, 603 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">In <em>Allen v. Bowen, </em>this Court upheld the ALJ\u2019s finding that work existed in significant numbers were the VE testified that there were 174 small appliance repairman positions in the area of Georgia where the claimant lived. The VE also testified that there were 1,600 general appliance repair jobs in the entire state, and 80,000 such jobs nationally, of which \u201c[a] considerable number ... [were] in the small appliance field.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602. This Court stressed in <em>Allen </em>that, because an ALJ\u2019s finding as to the existence of a sufficient quantity of jobs is a finding of fact reviewed under the substantial evidence standard, we could not reweigh the evidence or \u201csubstitute our judgment for that of the Secretary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In light of the VE\u2019s testimony, this Court concluded in <em>Allen </em>that the Secretary had \u201cclearly achieved\u201d his burden by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>The claimant\u2019s additional evidence submitted to the Appeals Council was immaterial because it tended only to disprove the existence of jobs in the claimant\u2019s local economy, when the proper focus was on \u201cthe existence of such jobs on a national scale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">III. ATHA\u2019S APPEAL OF ALJ\u2019S FIFTH-STEP FINDING</p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">On appeal, Atha does not challenge the ALJ\u2019s findings as to the first four steps. Atha argues only that the ALJ erred in relying on the VE\u2019s testimony to find, at the fifth step, that a significant number of jobs existed in the national economy that Atha could perform despite his RFC, age, education, and work experience.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In particular, Atha does not dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>pute the VE\u2019s job numbers or contend that these are jobs he could not perform. He argues only that the number of jobs to which the VE testified does not constitute a \u201csignificant number\u201d and thus he is disabled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Here, the ALJ\u2019s fact finding that work existed in significant numbers in the national economy was based on the VE\u2019s testimony that there were 440 jobs in Alabama and 23,800 jobs nationally that Atha could perform. In particular, the VE testified that a person with Atha\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience could perform work as a surveillance system monitor, of which there were approximately 100 such jobs in Alabama and 7,600 nationally; as an inspector/sorter, of which there were approximately 240 such jobs in Alabama or 13,000 nationally; or as a machine tender, of which there were approximately 100 jobs in Alabama and 3,200 nationally.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Given that the proper focus is on the national economy, the ALJ\u2019s finding that there were a significant number of jobs Atha could perform, and thus Atha was not. disabled, is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">IV. APPEALS COUNCIL\u2019S CONSIDERATION OF NEW EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Atha argues the Appeals Council \u201cfailed to adequately consider\u201d additional medical records he submitted along with his request for review. In denying Atha\u2019s request for review, the Appeals Council stated that it had considered both Atha\u2019s reasons for disagreeing with the ALJ\u2019s decision and the additional evidence Atha included with his request, and that it \u201cfound that this information does not provide a basis for changing the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision.\u201d Citing <em>Epps v. Harris, </em>624 F.2d 1267 (5th Cir.1980),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Atha maintains that the Appeals Council was required to \u201cshow in its written denial [of the request for review] that it has adequately evaluated the new evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">In <em>Mitchell v. Commissioner, Social Security Administration, </em>this Court recently concluded that the Appeals Council is not required to provide a detailed explanation of a claimant\u2019s new evidence when it denies a petition for review. <em>Mitchell, </em>771 F.3d 780, 783-85 (11th Cir.2014). As in Atha\u2019s case, the Appeals Council in <em>Mitchell </em>denied review, stating simply that it had considered the additional evidence but \u201cthe information did not provide a basis for changing the ALJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 782. This Court determined that the Appeals Council\u2019s explanation was sufficient, emphasizing that the record did not provide a \u201cbasis for doubting the Appeals Council\u2019s statement that it considered Mitchell\u2019s additional evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 783-84. Moreover, we have clarified that <em>Mitchell\u2019s </em>holding is not limited \u201cto situations where the new evidence was \u2018cumulative\u2019 or \u2018not chronologically relevant.\u2019\u201d <em>Parks ex rel. D.P. v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>783 F.3d 847, 853 (11th Cir.2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>Thus, under <em>Mitchell, </em>the Appeals Council was not required to discuss any further Atha\u2019s new evidence or provide a more detailed explanation 'of its reasons for denying review.' Atha\u2019s reliance on <em>Epps </em>is misplaced. As we explained in <em>Mitchell, Epps </em>involved an Appeals Council\u2019s affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision, and thus <em>Epps </em>does not apply when, as here, the Appeals Council denies a petition for review. <em>Mitchell, </em>771 F.3d at 783; <em>see also Parks, </em>783 F.3d at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">We also reject Atha\u2019s argument that in light of the additional medical records he submitted, the Appeals Council should have granted his petition for review. The Appeals Council must grant a petition for review only if it finds that the ALJ\u2019s \u201caction, findings, or conclusion is contrary to the weight of the evidence,\u201d including the new and material evidence. <em>Ingram, v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1261 (11th Cir.2007); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1470(b). Evidence is material if \u201cthere is a reasonable possibility that the new evidence would change the administrative outcome.\u201d <em>Hyde v. Bowen, </em>823 F.2d 456, 459 (11th Cir.1987). On appeal, when the Appeals Council denies review based on new evidence, our review considers whether the claimant\u2019s new evidence \u201crenders the denial of benefits erroneous.\u201d <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Here, even considering the additional medical records Atha submitted, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s denial of Atha\u2019s SSI application. For example, Atha\u2019s new mental health records indicated that Atha\u2019s GAF score increased from 48 to 50 to as high as 60 as he continued his abstinence from drugs and mostly stayed sober. This evidence supports, rather than undermines, the ALJ\u2019s finding that Atha\u2019s past substance abuse was a material contributing factor to his disability, and that, in the absence of substance abuse, Atha had the RFC to perform some kinds of sedentary work. Although the new rec-. ords noted Atha\u2019s depression, none indicated that he was severely impaired as a result of his depression. Nor do any of the new records regarding Atha\u2019s physical impairments indicate that he is more limited than reflected in the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment, and, in fact, the records show that he continued to work in vinyl siding as late as December 2009. In short, we cannot say that Atha\u2019s new evidence rendered the Commissioner\u2019s denial of SSI benefits erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-9\">. Atha\u2019s application for benefits originally sought both supplemental security income and disability insurance benefits. Before the district court, however, Atha amended his disability onset date to October 13, 2008, and he acknowledged that this change rendered him ineligible for disability benefits. The district court adopted the new onset date, and thus we review only the denial of Atha\u2019s application for supplemental security income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b964-6\">. We review the Commissioner's findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence and the Commissioner\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. Ingram </em>v. <em>Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir.2007). \"Substantial evidence is less than a preponderance, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b965-10\">.
