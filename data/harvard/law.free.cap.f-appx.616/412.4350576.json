On appeal, Gaddy argues that he. can raise his illegal-sentence claim under \u00a7 2241 because \u00a7 2255 is an inadequate and ineffective remedy. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-22\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2013). The applicability of the savings clause is a threshold jurisdictional issue that must be decided before the court reaches the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claims. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-23\">Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Sawyer <em>v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). Challenges to the execution of a sentence, rather than the validity of the sentence itself, are properly brought under \u00a7 2241. <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1352 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-24\">The \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241 if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see also Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1262. The petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1262. In <em>Bryant, </em>we held that to show that a prior \u00a7 2255 motion was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>detention, a petitioner challenging his sentence must satisfy a five-part test: (1) throughout the petitioner\u2019s sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, this' Court\u2019s precedent squarely foreclosed the claim raised in the \u00a7 2241 petition so that the petitioner did not have a genuine procedural opportunity for review; (2) the Supreme Court overturned that binding precedent after the petitioner\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 proceeding; (3) that Supreme Court decision applies retroactively to cases on collateral review; (4) as a result of that Supreme Court decision, the petitioner\u2019s sentence exceeds the statutory maximum sentence; and (5) the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 reaches the petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Here, the district court did not err in concluding that Gaddy failed to satisfy the savings clause and that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the merits of his \u00a7 2241 claims. For starters, Gaddy did not point to any binding precedent that squarely foreclosed him from raising his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, or his claim that his sentence exceeded the mandatory guideline sentence, in prior proceedings. Nor did he argue, much less identify, any retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision that overturned any relevant precedent. While Gaddy argues that a \u00a7 2255 remedy was \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d because the district court had not converted his 2012 \u201cmotion to reopen\u201d into a \u00a7 2255 motion, this fact did not establish that he did not have a genuine procedural opportunity to raise his claims at sentencing, direct appeal, or in a timely filed \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
