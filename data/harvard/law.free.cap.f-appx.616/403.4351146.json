After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">A district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s prison term if the defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission and \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, provide that a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when the retroactive guideline amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Thus, a sentence reduction is not authorized by an amendment that changes one guideline if the defendant\u2019s sentence was based on a different guideline. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376-77 (11th Cir.2012) (concluding that no \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction was authorized by Amendment 750, which lowered offense levels in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), the Drug Quantity Table, because the defendant\u2019s offense level and resulting sentencing range were based on \u00a7 4B1.1, the career offender guideline). Moreover, a sentence reduction is not authorized where a defendant\u2019s guidelines range and sentence are. based on a statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1077-78 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Here, the district court did not err in denying Higginbottom\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 782. Amendment 782, like Amendment 750 before it, lowered the base offense level for many drug offenses by revising the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2D1.1(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C', amend. 782; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(d) (including Amendment 782 in the list of amendments that may serve as the basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction). The problem for Higginbottom is that the sentencing court did not use \u00a7 2D1.1(c) to calculate Higginbottom\u2019s advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Higginbottom was convicted of both drug and firearm offenses. Specifically, a jury convicted Higginbottom of unlawfully possessing a firearm and ammunition as a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (Count 1); knowingly possessing marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(D) (Count 2); and knowingly using and carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (Count 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">At sentencing, Counts 1 and 2 were grouped together for purposes of calculating an advisory guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c). For Counts 1 and 2, the sentencing court used \u00a7 2K2.1, the guideline applicable to firearm offenses, rather than \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), to calculate Hig-ginbottom\u2019s offense level because \u00a7 2K2.1 resulted in a higher offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.3(a) (providing that the offense level for counts grouped together under \u00a7 3D1.2(c) is the highest offense level of the counts in the group). With an adjusted offense level of 28 and a criminal history of VI, the advisory guidelines range for Counts 1 and 2 was 140 to 175. The sentence for Count 3 was imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>separately because it required a statutory mandatory minimum 60-month consecutive sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i). Ultimately, the district court imposed a total 200-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">In short, Higginbottom\u2019s sentencing range for Counts 1 and 2 was based on \u00a7 2K2.1 and his sentencing range for Count 3 was based on \u00a7 924(c). Thus, Amendment 782, which changed only the offense levels in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), had no effect on Higginbottom\u2019s sentencing range for any of his counts of conviction. The district court therefore did not have the authority to reduce Higginbottom\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 376-77; <em>Mills, </em>613 F.3d at 1077-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">To the extent Higginbottom challenges his original sentence, including arguing that it violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), these are not issues he can raise in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (limiting proceedings to cases in which a retroactive guideline amendment affects the applicable sentencing range); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000) (explaining that all original sentencing determinations other than the effect of the amended guideline provision remain unchanged in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Accordingly, because Higginbottom was not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief based on Amendment 782, the district court properly denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-7\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v.
