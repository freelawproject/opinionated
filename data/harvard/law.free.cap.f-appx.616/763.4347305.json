He argues that this court has jurisdiction because he raises questions of law. Marcos-Cardona contends that the BIA and IJ failed to aggregate the hardship factors he presented, which resulted in a violation of his due process rights and the right to present evidence. He also argues that the IJ and BIA failed to consider the impact of removal on his children\u2019s education. In addition, Marcos-Cardona contends that his son\u2019s speech impediment should have been given more consideration because his testimony in support of the speech impediment was credible. Finally, he argues that the IJ and BIA failed to render an individualized hardship determination as to each child.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, no court shall have jurisdiction to review any judgment relating to requests for relief under \u00a7 1229b. This provision does not, however, preclude review of constitutional claims or questions of law. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see Wilmore, v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 524, 526 (5th Cir.2006). But the alien\u2019s framing of an issue is not dispositive. We will decline to consider an abuse-of-discretion argument cloaked in constitutional or legal garb. <em>Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 801 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Delgado-Reynua v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 596, 599-600 (5th Cir.2006). That is the case here. Because Marcos-Cardona\u2019s arguments are nothing more than a disagreement with the weighing of the factors underlying the discretionary decision whether he merited cancellation of removal, we lack jurisdiction. <em>See Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Accordingly, the petition is DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
