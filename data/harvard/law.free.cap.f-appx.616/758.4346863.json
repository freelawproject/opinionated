Martinez argues that the district court erred in its drug quantity calculation and by applying a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(5) because the offense involved the importation of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-23\">We review factual findings of the quantity of drugs involved in a crime for clear error. <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005). The clear error standard of review \u201conly requires a factual finding to be plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>630 F.3d 377, 380 (5th Cir.2011). The record indicates that two weeks before her arrest, Martinez delivered two ounces of methamphetamine to a confidential informant in a transaction arranged by the operators of the stash house. Afterwards, she was observed entering the stash house. She led an undercover agent and a confidential informant to the location of their meeting with a codefendant; at that meeting, the specifics of the transaction here at issue were arranged. On the day of her arrest, Martinez was already present at the stash house when a codefendant, an undercover agent, and a confidential informant arrived there to conduct the transaction, and she watched as the informant tested the quality of the methamphetamine. In light of the record as a whole, it is certainly plausible that Martinez was directly involved in the transaction at the stash house or that the methamphetamine found there was reasonably foreseeable to her as a participant in a jointly undertaken criminal activity. . The district court therefore did not clearly err in determining that Martinez was responsible for the additional 11.14 kilograms. <em>See United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Carreon, </em>11 F.3d 1225, 1230 (5th Cir.1994); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).
