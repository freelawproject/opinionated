We have jurisdiction to decide whether Verdugo vwas statutorily eligible for an adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i). <em>See Sattani v. Holder, </em>749 F.3d 368, 370 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">When, as here, the BIA affirms the IJ, relying on the reasons set forth in the IJ\u2019s decision, we review both decisions. <em>Id. </em>We review legal questions de novo. <em>Id. </em>We review questions of fact under the substantial evidence standard, which means that we will not reverse unless we decide \u201cnot only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but [also] that the evidence compels it.\u201d <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis and alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">An alien physically present in the United States who entered without inspection may apply for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. \u00a7 1255(i). The Attorney General may grant the application if, among other things, the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence. \u00a7 1255(i)(2). An applicant for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(f) must establish that he is not inadmissible under any provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) or that he is eligible for a waiver of any applicable ground of inadmissibility. <em>Sattani, </em>749 F.3d at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">The INA provides that an alien is ineligible to receive an immigrant visa and is inadmissible if he was unlawfully in this country for more than one year and then \u201centers or attempts to reenter the United States without being admitted.\u201d INA \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I)). Such aliens are not entitled to an adjustment of status. <em>Mortera-Cruz v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 246, 256 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also In re Briones, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 355, 371 (BIA 2007) (holding that aliens inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a) (9)(C) (i) (I) are ineligible for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-15\">Verdugo\u2019s assertion that the IJ incorrectly denied his application based on a finding that Verdugo was convicted of illegal reentry when Verdugo was in fact convicted of illegal entry is not supported by the record and is otherwise unavailing because \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) speaks to an unlawful entry without respect to whether there was a conviction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-16\">Verdugo\u2019s argument that he was admissible because he did not leave the country after he was convicted of illegal entry is also unavailing. Verdugo testified that he was unlawfully in this country for 10 years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>prior to 2003, left the country for a week at the end of 2003, and returned unlawfully on January 12, 2004. These facts rendered him inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C) and, therefore, ineligible for an adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i).' <em>See Mortera-Cruz, </em>409 F.3d at 255-56. Consequently, the evidence does not compel a conclusion contrary to that reached by the IJ and the BIA regarding Verdugo\u2019s ineligibility for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b214-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
