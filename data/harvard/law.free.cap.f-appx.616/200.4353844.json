The district court determined that his suit was frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) because the named defendants, judges who had issued rulings in connection with Laws\u2019s federal habeas case, were absolutely immune from suit. On appeal, Laws argues that the defendants are immune only from his request for monetary damages and not from the equitable and declaratory relief that he is seeking in connection with the defendants\u2019 allegedly erroneous habeas rulings. He also asserts that he is actually innocent, and he details what he views as the numerous errors made by the district court in denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition and by this court in affirming the denial of his \u00a7 2254 petition. Laws\u2019s motion to amend his appellate brief is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of Laws\u2019s suit de novo. <em>See Morris v. McAllester, </em>702 F.3d 187, 189 (5th Cir. 2012). Laws is correct that judges are not entitled to absolute immunity from suit for injunctive or declaratory relief. <em>See Chrissy F. by Medley v. Miss. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, </em>925 F.2d 844, 849 (5th Cir.1991). We can affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal, however, on any basis, <em>see United States v. Ho, </em>311 F.3d 589, 602 n. 12 (5th Cir.2002), and we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Laws\u2019s suit pursuant to \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) because Laws\u2019s conelusory allegations that the defendants fraudulently conspired to violate his constitutional rights fail to state a nonfrivolous claim for relief under \u00a7 1985(3). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1985(3); <em>Samford v. Dretke, </em>562 F.3d 674, 678 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Fontenot v. Texas, </em>44 F.3d 1004 (5th Cir.1994); <em>McAfee v. 5th Circuit Judges, </em>884 F.2d 221, 222 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, The district court\u2019s dismissal of Laws\u2019s \u00a7 1985(3) suit counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996), Laws has at least two other strikes. <em>See Laws v. Texas, </em>4:14-CV-2223, 2014 WL 5325167 (S.D.Tex. Oct. 15, 2014); <em>Laws v. 179th District Court of Harris County, Tex., </em>4:05-CV-2969, 2006 WL 83483 (S.D.Tex. Jan. 11, 2006). As Laws has three strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g), he is BARRED from proceeding IFP in any civil action while he is incarcerated or detained, unless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. See \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">AFFIRMED; MOTION GRANTED; SANCTION IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b231-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
