For the first time on appeal, Galvan argues that, following <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), any fact that increases the range of reasonable sentences must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. He asserts that the district court\u2019s factual finding \u2014 that he had a serious criminal history, that his drinking posed a serious danger to others, and that he had undertaken inappropriate contact with a victim in a prior case \u2014 violated his constitutional rights because it likely affected the range of reasonable punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-24\">As Galvan did not raise this issue in the district court, we review it for plain error only. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). To show plain error, Galvan must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error, but should do so only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or' public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-25\">The Government has moved for summary affirmance on the ground that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>sole issue raised by Galvan is foreclosed. In <em>United States v. Tuma, </em>738 F.3d 681, 693 (5th Cir.2013), the defendant argued that <em>Alleyne </em>required that any fact that increased his minimum sentence, including facts that raised his guidelines range, must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. This court rejected the argument, holding that <em>Alleyne </em>applied \u201conly to facts that increase a statutory mandatory minimum sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the present case, Galvan\u2019s crime of conviction had no statutory minimum sentence of imprisonment, and no judicially found facts increased the statutory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C \u00a7 1326(b). Accordingly, as Galvan concedes, his argument is foreclosed. <em>See Tumo, </em>738 F.3d at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion to extend the time to file its brief is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b163-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
