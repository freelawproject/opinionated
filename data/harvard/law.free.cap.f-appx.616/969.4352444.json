After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-17\">Mr. Tucker filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in 2004, and the bankruptcy court appointed appellee Barry Mukamal as Trustee. Two years later, Mr. Tucker and the Trustee entered into a court-approved settlement agreement which set forth payments Mr. Tucker was required to make by November 20, 2007 to settle certain debts .against his estate in exchange for his discharge in bankruptcy. The agreement provided that, if Mr. Tucker defaulted on his obligations, the Trustee was entitled to exercise certain remedies, including (as relevant here) revocation of the bankruptcy discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-18\">Mr. Tucker subsequently defaulted on his obligations under the settlement agreement by failing to timely settle the debts against his estate, so the Trustee moved in 2011 to revoke the bankruptcy discharge. After a hearing, the bankruptcy court granted the motion. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Tucker filed a motion for recusal of the bankruptcy judge, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-19\">Almost two years later, the Trustee filed a \u201cMotion to Conclude Administration of Chapter 7 Case\u201d (the \u201cTrustee\u2019s Motion\u201d). The Trustee noted that one claim against the now insolvent bankruptcy estate remained outstanding and was the subject of an ongoing adversary proceeding between Mr. Tucker and a purported creditor (a proceeding to which the Trustee was not a party). Citing the near ten-year span of litigation and emphasizing that the adversary proceeding could continue for some time without a resolution, the Trustee requested that the bankruptcy court close the case subject to any distributions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>may later occur as a result of the resolution of the adversary proceeding and its impact on the single outstanding claim against the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Although Mr. Tucker \u00f1led a response in opposition to the Trustee\u2019s Motion, he stated in his response that his objection was to the Trustee\u2019s previous record of \u201csitting on his hands\u201d and neglecting \u201chis statutory duty to close the case in an expeditious manner.\u201d Response in Opposition to Trustee\u2019s Motion, Doc. 661 at 12, <em>In re Tucker, </em>No. 1:04-bk-13319-AJC (Bankr. S.D. Fla. Aug. 1, 2013). Mr. Tucker expressed frustration that the Trustee had \u201cdragg[ed] the case on for three years after the sole creditor and Jeff Tucker requested the case be closed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. He also stated that the Trustee \u201chad absolute statutory authority to close the case since September 15, 2010, when both the sole creditor and Jeff Tucker requested [that Trustee] Mukamal close the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. The bankruptcy court, noting the apparent agreement between the parties, granted the Trustee\u2019s Motion and directed the Trustee to close the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">Mr. Tucker appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of his motion to recuse and decision ordering closure of the case to the district court, which affirmed both orders. .With respect to the recusal motion, the district court found that the bankruptcy judge\u2019s expressions of his opinion of Mr. Tucker\u2019s credibility were influenced by Mr. Tucker\u2019s conduct, including his default on the settlement agreement. Because the bankruptcy judge\u2019s comments were grounded in his experience overseeing the proceedings, the district court reasoned, the denial of the motion to recuse did not amount to an abuse of discretion. With respect to the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to grant the Trustee\u2019s Motion, the district court found that Mr. Tucker lacked standing to challenge that order because, since the estate was deficient, he would not receive a distribution from it and therefore no longer had a financial stake in the outcome of the proceedings. Mr. Tucker now appeals from the district court\u2019s order affirming both decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">\u201cIn a bankruptcy case, this Court sits as a second court of review and thus examines independently the factual and legal determinations of the bankruptcy court and employs the same standards of review as the district court.\u201d <em>Brown v. Gore (In re Brown), </em>742 F.3d 1309, 1315 (11th Cir.2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). We review the denial of a motion for recu-sal for an abuse of discretion and will reverse only if the judge who decides not to recuse made \u201ca clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>888 F.2d 732, 744-45 (11th Cir.1989). We otherwise generally review a bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. Fisher-Island Ltd. v. Solby + Westbrae Partners (In re Fisher Island Invs., Inc.), </em>778 F.3d 1172, 1189 (11th Cir.2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">We first address whether the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in denying Mr. Tucker\u2019s motion to recuse. Federal law requires a judge to recuse when his \u201cimpartiality 'might reasonably be questioned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). A court ruling on a recusal motion under \u00a7 455(a) must decide \u201cwhether an objective, disinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which re-cusal was sought would entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Parker v. Connors Steel Co., </em>855 F.2d 1510, 1524 (11th Cir.1988). A judge is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>\u201crecusable for bias or prejudice [when] his knowledge and the opinion it produced were properly and necessarily acquired in the course of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 551, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">. Over the course of almost a decade of litigation in this case, the bankruptcy judge made half a dozen or so comments about Mr. Tucker\u2019s demeanor and litigation strategy that Mr. Tucker now argues illustrated personal bias. These few comments, made based on what the bankruptcy court observed in court, do not, however, reflect \u201ca deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555, 114 S.Ct., 1147. Indeed, \u201cexpressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and even anger,\u201d such as those the bankruptcy judge occasionally made in this case, \u201care within the bounds of what imperfect men and women, even after having been confirmed as federal judges, sometimes display.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">The bankruptcy judge\u2019s comments, although undoubtedly reflective of his annoyance with Mr. Tucker, were based on his interactions with Mr. Tucker, the Trustee, and counsel throughout the proceedings. Without more, these comments are insufficient to demonstrate to us the kind of favoritism or antagonism that would make recusal necessary. We therefore conclude that the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to deny Mr. Tucker\u2019s recusal motion was not a clear error of judgment and affirm the district court\u2019s decision to uphold the bankruptcy court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">We turn now to Mr. Tucker\u2019s contention that the bankruptcy court erroneously ordered his case closed. The district court found that Mr. Tucker was not aggrieved by the order granting the Trustee\u2019s Motion because he had no remaining financial stake in the proceedings and accordingly lacked standing to challenge the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. Mr. Tucker argues that the district court\u2019s conclusion regarding standing was wrong and that the bankruptcy court should not have ordered the case closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">We agree with the district court that the bankruptcy court did not err in granting the Trustee\u2019s Motion. Only a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d may appeal a bankruptcy order, and our precedent has limited persons aggrieved to those with \u201ca financial stake in the order being appealed,\u201d that is, those who are \u201cdirectly, adversely, and pecuniar-fly affect[ed]\u201d by the order. <em>Westwood Cmty. Two Ass\u2019n v. Barbee (In re West-wood Cmty. Two Ass\u2019n), </em>293 F.3d 1332, 1335, 1337-38 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cA person has a financial stake in the order when that order diminishes [his] property, increases [his] burdens[,] or impairs [his] rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1335 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">Here, Mr. Tucker does not dispute that the estate is deficient and as a result he will receive no distribution from the underlying bankruptcy proceeding. Thus, he was not directly pecuniarily affected by the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to order the administration of the estate\u2019s proceedings closed. As regards his contention that he has standing because his ongoing adversary proceeding ultimately might have affected his financial stake in the outcome of the underlying bankruptcy proceeding, this argument is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See Atkinson v. Ernie Haire Ford, Inc. (In re Ernie Haire Ford, Inc.), </em>764 F.3d 1321, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2014) (\u201c[A] party is not aggrieved, for the purposes of appealing from a bankruptcy court order, when the only interest allegedly harmed by that order is the interest in avoiding liability from an adversary proceeding.\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>Moreover, we reject Mr. Tucker\u2019s argument that other outstanding issues, such as whether the court might impose sanctions, gave him a financial stake in the outcome of the bankruptcy case\u2019s administration. Those interests\u2014which the Bankruptcy Code does not specifically \u201cseek[] to protect or regulate\u201d\u2014are insufficient to confer standing. <em>See id. </em>at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"AQNZ\">In any event, even if Mr. Tucker had standing to challenge the bankruptcy court\u2019s order on the Trustee\u2019s Motion, we note he conceded before the bankruptcy court that the Trustee had \u201cabsolute statutory authority\u201d to close the case and agreed that the case was due to be closed. He therefore has waived any argument to the contrary. <em>See Genesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1523, 1529, 185 L.Ed.2d 636 (2013) (emphasizing that, where a party concedes a point before a lower court that he does not genuinely contest on appeal, his waiver will \u201cprevent us from reaching it\u201d). The district court accordingly did not err in affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to grant the Trustee\u2019s Motion,</p>\n<p id=\"Ael\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq55\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s- order upholding the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of Mr. Tucker\u2019s motion to recuse and closure of the bankruptcy case.</p>\n<p id=\"AyFO\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
