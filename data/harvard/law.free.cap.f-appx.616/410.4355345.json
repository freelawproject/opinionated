On appeal, Pierce asserts that, a conflict between U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1) and 1B1.10(b)(2) creates an ambiguity that the district court should have resolved in his favor by applying the rule of lenity. Specifically, relying on <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. - 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), he contends that all downward departures and variances made by the district court during the original sentencing must remain unaffected when arriving at a new sentence for . purposes of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. In addition, he asserts that the language in \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B), which creates an exception to the limitation found in \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) for defendants who received a downward departure based on substantial assistance, is discriminatory in nature against defendants who did not cooperate and creates a disparity between classes of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">Pierce asserts that an ambiguity arises when \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) and (b)(2) are read together because the former creates a rule that guideline application decisions not affected by an amendment \u2014 including the downward variance he received at his original sentencing \u2014 are to be left unaffected, while the latter does not allow the prisoner to benefit from departures and variances from the original sentencing. In other words, according to Pierce, \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) here nullifies what \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1) requires to be left \u201cunaffected\u201d because he will not receive the benefit of a downward variance comparable to the one he received at his original sentencing. However, the variance from which Pierce seeks to benefit and application of which was barred by \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) was not a \u201cguideline application decision,\u201d as variances are imposed after the applicable guideline range is set. Thus, \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) only limits the district court\u2019s authority by prohibiting most variances to a sentence below the amended guidelines range, or lower the original sentence if it is already below the amended guidelines range. Because we can resolve the purported conflict, this case does not present us with a \u201cgrievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute\u201d that would compel us to invoke the rule of lenity. <em>See Muscarello v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 125, 138-39, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 1919, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">Pierce alternatively argues that the exception to the \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) limitation for substantial assistance to the authorities is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>discriminatory. He does not explain, however, why discriminating between defendants who are granted variances for substantial assistance and those who receive other variances is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Accordingly, upon review of the entire record on appeal, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-19\">. Pierce moved, unopposed, to file his reply brief out of time. We grant that motion, though it does not change this appeal\u2019s disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
