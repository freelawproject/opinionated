He argues that the appeal waiver and his guilty plea are both invol- \u2022 untary because he was not properly admonished during rearraignment as to the minimum sentence the court could impose in violation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules . of Criminal Procedure. Fed. R.Ceim.P. ll(b)(l)(I). After Ramirez filed his opening brief, however, the court reporter filed in the district court a revised rearraignment transcript, and we granted the government\u2019s unopposed motion to supplement the record with the. amended transcript, which corrects \u201ca scrivener\u2019s error.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(e)(2). Ramirez does not challenge the accuracy of the amended transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-16\">The record as supplemented by the amended transcript demonstrates that Ramirez was correctly admonished that he faced a term of imprisonment of not less than ten years. <em>See </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). As the record does not show a Rule 11 violation, Ramirez has not established that his guilty plea or the appeal waiver were involuntary, and the appeal waiver, which the government seeks to invoke, bars Ramirez from challenging the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. <em>United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 231 (5th Cir.2006) (holding that an appeal waiver is enforceable to the extent that the government invokes it).</p>\n<p id=\"Azx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b175-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
