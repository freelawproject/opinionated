Melendez pleaded guilty to conspiracy to export stolen motor vehicles and unlawfully transport stolen motor vehicles in foreign commerce and attempting to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine. The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion for a downward departure for providing substantial assistance, and it sentenced Melendez to 108 months of imprisonment on the cocaine count and the statutory maximum sentence of 60 months of imprisonment on the stolen vehicles count, the sentences to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-21\">Melendez argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. He maintains that his guidelines sentence range was based upon a sentencing range that was lowered by Amendment 782 because the modified Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, was considered'in his guidelines range calculation. He maintains that the cocaine count, which was assessed under \u00a7 2D1.1, clearly affected his guidelines range calculation because without the cocaine count his statutory maximum sentence would have been 60 months of imprisonment. The Government argues that Melendez\u2019s appeal is barred by the appeal waiver in his plea agreement and that Melendez\u2019s appeal is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-22\">As the Government acknowledges, a standard appeal waiver,' such as Melendez\u2019s, does not bar a defendant from filing a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion or an appeal from the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 296-97 (5th Cir.2009). The Government contends that Melendez\u2019s appeal is barred by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>appeal waiver because he is ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), making his appeal some other type of challenge to his sentence. Melendez, however, sought only relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in the district court and seeks only relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in this 6ourt. Just because an appeal from the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is unmeritorious does not make the appeal barred by a standard appeal waiver. <em>See Cooley, </em>590 F.3d at 296-298. Accordingly, Melendez\u2019s appeal waiver does not bar the present appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Melendez\u2019s guidelines sentence range was based upon the adjusted total offense level of the stolen vehicles count, and it was not modified by the adjusted total offense level of the cocaine count because the adjusted total offense level of the cocaine count was 10 levels lower than the adjusted total offense level of the stolen vehicles count. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4. Thus, applying Amendment 782 to Melendez\u2019s case does not change Melendez\u2019s guidelines sentence range. As Amendment 782 did \u201cnot have the effect of lowering [Melendez\u2019s] applicable guideline range,\u201d Melendez was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Melendez\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>'see United States v. Bowman, </em>632 F.3d 906, 910-11 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b206-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
