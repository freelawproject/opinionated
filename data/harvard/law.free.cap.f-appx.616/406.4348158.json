No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">In 2006, Shepherd pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), and 846. Based on the quantity of drugs involved, Shepherd\u2019s base offense level was first set at 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3) of the 2006 Guideline Manual. Then, because Shepherd qualified as a career offender under \u00a7 4B2.2(a) and because his offense carried a statutory maximum penalty of life imprisonment, Shepherd\u2019s offense level was set at 37, pursuant to \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Shepherd received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 34. Shepherd\u2019s advisory guideline range was then calculated as 262 to 327 months. The district court sentenced Shepherd to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">Shepherd moved to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 782, which lowered the base offense levels for most drug offenses. The district court denied the motion, concluding that Shepherd was ineligible for a reduction because of his career-offender status.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198, 1200 n. 1 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">A district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that was later lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A district court may not use a guideline amendment, however, to reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment unless the amendment actually lowers the defendant\u2019s guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>Liberse, </em>688 F.3d at 1199. In determining whether a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction, a district court may consider only the effect of the applicable guideline amendment; all other original sentencing determinations remain intact. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780- . 81 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-17\">The district court committed no error in denying Shepherd a sentence reduction based on Amendment 782. Amendment 782 reduced by two the base offense levels for most drug sentences calculated pursuant to the Drug Quantity Table, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c). U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 782. But Shepherd was sentenced using the offense level and guideline range for career offenders in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not the offense level for drug quantity in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). Amendment 782 resulted in no lowering of Shepherd\u2019s guideline range; Shepherd is ineligible for section 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-20\">Shepherd\u2019s reliance on <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), is misplaced. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>In <em>Freeman, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether defendants who entered into plea agreements recommending a particular sentence, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C), were eligible for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2). Here, Shepherd\u2019s plea agreement contained no agreed-upon sentence or guidelines range. Thus, <em>Freeman </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Because Shepherd\u2019s guideline range remained unchanged as a result of Amendment 782, no ex post facto violation occurred. <em>See United States v. Colon, </em>707 F.3d 1255, 1258-59.(11th Cir.2013) (no ex post facto problem exists \u201c[s]o long as the effect of post-conduct amendments to the guidelines is not to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment beyond what it would have been without those amendments.\u201d). The district court committed no error in treating U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 as binding. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
