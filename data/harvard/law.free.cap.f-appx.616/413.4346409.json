California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>veals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Richman\u2019s convictions and sentences are</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">However, we note that there is a clerical error in the judgment. The judgment lists Richman\u2019s statutes of conviction for Count 2 as 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 8419(b)(1)(C). The correct statutes, as reflected in the indictment, are 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C). Accordingly, the judgment is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for the limited purpose of correcting a clerical error in the judgment. <em>See United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 822 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
