A magistrate judge recommended affirming the agency decision, and the district court adopted that recommendation. Taylor contends that the district court\u2019s ruling was premature because the magistrate\u2019s report was mailed to him three days late and stated that he would have fourteen business days, rather than the normal fourteen calendar days, to file an objection. But Taylor\u2019s objections would have been untimely by 79 days even if the district court had known about the late mailing and used business days to determine the deadline. We therefore find no due process violation that would render the district court\u2019s judgement void.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Taylor filed this case in response to an administrative denial of disability benefits under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act. The district court referred the case to a magistrate judge. On April 28, 2014, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (R &amp; R) that recommended upholding the denial of benefits. The R &amp; R warned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">A PARTY\u2019S FAILURE TO FILE WRITTEN OBJECTIONS TO THE PROPOSED FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS CONTAINED HIS REPORT WITHIN fourteen(14) BUSINESS DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ITS SERVICE SHALL BAR AN AGGRIEVED PARTY, EXCEPT ON THE GROUND OF PLAIN ERROR, FROM ATTACKING ON APPEAL THE UNOBJECTED-TO PROPOSED FACTUAL FINDINGS AND LEGAL CONCLUSIONS ACCEPTED BY THE DISTRICT JUDGE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">ROA 1004. On May 15, 2014, having received no objections, the district court adopted the R <em>&amp; </em>R.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">Taylor did not file any objections to the R <em>&amp; </em>R until almost three months later, on August 8, 2014. That same day, he also filed a motion to vacate the district court\u2019s judgment as based on either a clerical mistake or void pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 60(b)(1) and (b)(4). Taylor claims that the R <em>&amp; </em>R was not mailed until May 1, 2014, so that is the date on which the fourteen day clock should have started running.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b); Fed.R.Civ.P. 5(b)(2)(C). Because the R &amp; R specified the distinct court\u2019s ruling could come after 14 \u201cbusiness days,\u201d Taylor contended that he should have had until at least May 21, 2014 to file his objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">The district court denied Taylor\u2019s motions, concluding that the judgment was not void and relief was unwarranted because of the lengthy gap between the judgment and his objections. In doing so, it noted that \u201c[tjhis court routinely grants reasonable extensions of time in which to file objections and this case is no exception. However, we find that the delay evident in the record is beyond what may be considered reasonable, particularly since no extension is sought.\u201d ROA 1062. Taylor appeals the denial of his Rul\u00e9 60(b)(4) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">Rule 60(b)(4) permits a party to seek relief from a final judgment that is void. <em>See N.Y. Life Ins. Co. v. Brown, </em>84 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>137, 142-43 (5th Cir.1996); <em>see generally </em>11 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2862 (3d ed.2015) (summarizing void judgments under Rule 60(b)(4)). Declaring a final judgment void is an \u201cextraordinary remedy.\u201d <em>See Carter v. Fenner, </em>136 F.3d 1000, 1007 (5th Cir.1998). A \u201cjudgment \u2018is void only if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.\u2019\u201d <em>Brovm, </em>84 F.3d at 143 (quoting <em>Williams v. New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc., </em>728 F.2d 730, 735 (5th Cir.1984)). Taylor does not dispute the district court\u2019s jurisdiction, but contends that the district court violated his due process rights when it adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation before the time had elapsed for filing objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Taylor has identified an inconsistency between the practices of the magistrate judge and district court. Whereas the magistrate judge set forth the deadline in business days, the district court apparently counted in calendar days as the statute permits. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636; Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a). This disconnect could result in a situation in which a party files an objection that is timely under the magistrate judge\u2019s warning but late under the statute\u2019s calendar-day approach that the district court used.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">But that is not the situation in this case, so there is no basis for finding that the judgment is void. For a judgment to be void, not only must the procedural deviation rise to the level of a \u201cfundamental infirmity,\u201d but the resulting judgment must also be \u201caffected by\u201d that infirmity. <em>See United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa, </em>559 U.S. 260, 270, 130 S.Ct. 1367, 176 L.Ed.2d 158 (2010); <em>cf. Kreimer-man v. Casa Veerkamp SA de CV, </em>22 F.3d 634, 646-47 (5th Cir.1994) (observing that premature adoption of a report and recommendation is usually subject to harmless error review). Even if the district court had waited the extra six days Taylor contends it should have, it would not have received any objections from Taylor to consider. <em>Compare Brown, </em>84 F.3d at 143 (vacating a judgment under Rule 60(b)(4) because \u201c[wjithout notice of an impending grant of summary judgment, a defendant has no opportunity to be heard\u201d); <em>Collins v. Stalder, </em>335 Fed.Appx. 450, 453 (5th Cir.2009) (reversing a judgment because the defendant was never served with the report and recommendation prior to the district court adopting it). Because Taylor waited nearly three months to file his objections, any error in adopting the recommendation six days early did not \u201caffect[ ]\u201d the judgment. <em>See Espinosa, </em>559 U.S. at 270, 130 S.Ct. 1367. Moreover, Taylor failed to make any contact with the court, which could have included pointing out the late mailing or requesting an extension, during those six days or even shortly thereafter. As the district court pointed out, doing so would have likely resolved the timeliness issue and allowed for consideration of the merits of Taylor\u2019s objections. <em>See, e.g., Younce v. Barnhart, </em>98 Fed. Appx. 305, 306 (5th Cir.2004) (pointing out that a district court may consider late-filed objections); <em>Kreimerman, </em>22 F.3d at 646-47 (5th Cir.1994) (pointing out that motions for reconsideration protect the litigant from hasty adoption of a recommendation).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is not void and is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b716-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-13\">. The district court accepted Taylor\u2019s factual allegations as true, and we will do the same because it does not affect the disposition of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\"><em>. </em>For example, even if the R &amp; R was mailed the same day it issued (April 28, 2014), the district court still would have adopted it after only 13 business days.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
