Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), when offered without a live witness\u2014the caller. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent <em>Michigan v. Bryant, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1143, 179 L.Ed.2d at 93 (2011), however, provides some clarity in what theretofore was a murky jurisprudential crystal ball. This case calls for a relatively straightforward application of <em>Bryant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">William Langley (\u201cLangley\u201d) appeals from the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the convictions entered against him in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Pertinent to the present posture of this case, the panel of the intermediate appellate court held that certain statements telephoned to police by an eye-witness to portions of events related to a murder-robbery (1) describing an individual alleged to be Langley exiting the crime scene; and (2) identifying features, such as color and license-plate number, of an automobile that another witness at trial testified that Langley had access to, were not \u201ctestimonial\u201d within the contemplation of Confrontation Clause jurisprudence, and thus admissible. For reasons to be explained more fully <em>infra, </em>we hold that applying <em>Bryant </em>to the facts of the present case leads us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>conclude that these statements were non-testimonial, and, therefore, Langley\u2019s confrontation rights were not impaired by their admission at his trial. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">EVIDENTIARY AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The State\u2019s case at trial demonstrated that, on the evening of 3 October 2005, Nae Chun Pak, the owner of the Cherry Hill Carry-Out on Cherry Hill Road in Baltimore City, was shot and killed in his store. An employee of the store, who testified that Langley was a regular customer of the store, identified Langley at trial as the assailant. The employee testified that he first saw Langley that evening at around 6:00 pm, when he was arguing with Pak at the security window in the store where customers order their food; apparently, Langley was demanding a refund for a cheesesteak sandwich he purchased that was not to his liking. Pak obliged, and Langley left the store. The employee testified further that Langley returned less than an hour later. Pak, with the store busy at the time, was taking orders from a line of customers. Langley pushed one customer aside, raised his arm, and fired one shot at Pak. The employee, having dove to the floor behind the counter, rose to assess the situation and noticed Pak laying on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">As Langley was leaving the store, one Herbert Stokes was waiting on the street in his tow-truck for an acquaintance to get him a bottle of water from a store across the street from the Cherry Hill Carry-Out. After hearing a gunshot, Stokes saw people streaming out of the Cherry Hill Carry-Out, one of whom he identified in the courtroom at trial as Langley. He witnessed Langley get in what he believed to be a white Oldsmobile and drive away. Subsequently, Stokes selected Langley\u2019s photograph from a photo array as the person who \u201clooked like the man\u201d who came out of the store and got in the white car.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Additional evidence about the presence of a white car and a description of the assailant were recounted to a 9-1-1 dispatcher by another person, apparently a female located outside the Carry-Out (who, for some unknown reason, was not produced to testify at trial). Over defense objection, a recording of the 9-1-1-tape recording was admitted into evidence and played for the jury. The following was heard on the recording:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">9-1-1 Operator: Baltimore City operator number 1316. What would you like, [police], fire or ambulance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">Caller: I just want to give some information on a shooting that just occurred at Cherry Hill Shopping Center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">9-1-1 Operator: Okay.

It just happening.]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">9-1-1 Operator: Are you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">Caller: I seen the guy get in the car. Will you give me the number or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-11\">9-1-1 Operator: Ma\u2019am, you can\u2014(phone rings)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-12\">Caller: Hello?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-13\">9-1-1 Operator: Ma\u2019am, you just told me that you had to give information not get information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-14\">Caller: I mean\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-15\">9-1-1 Operator: Where do you want to have the Officer sent to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Caller: I don\u2019t want them sent nowhere. They already going out to the store. But the guy, I seen him get in the car. Tag number MRG 908.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">9-1-1 Operator: Do you know what type of car it was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">Caller: No, I don\u2019t know the type of car. All I know it\u2019s white.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">9-1-1 Operator: Four door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">Caller: Look like it might have been a four door. I did look at the tag number and it looked like MRG 908.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">9-1-1 Operator: Do you know what he was wearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">Caller: No. Looked like jeans or something in a T-shirt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-11\">9-1-1 Operator: T-shirt, was it dark or light?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-12\">Caller: Kind of light. He didn\u2019t have no mask, he didn\u2019t have no hat, he didn\u2019t have nothing on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-13\">9-1-1 Operator: Was he a light-complected man?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-14\">Caller: Kind of brown skinned. I didn\u2019t know what kind of ear it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-15\">9-1-1 Operator: Now, he was wearing a light top and he was a brown complected man?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-16\">Caller: Don\u2019t quote me on the color.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-17\">9-1-1 Operator: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-18\">Caller: I just will tell you about the tag because I looked at it, MRG 908.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-19\">9-1-1 Operator: Maryland tag?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-20\">Caller: Yes, I believe so. I didn\u2019t even look at that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-21\">9-1-1 Operator: What hundred block is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-22\">Caller: It\u2019s in the Cherry Hill Shopping Center. I think that\u2019s the 600 block.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-23\">9-1-1 Operator: At Cherry Hill Road?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-24\">Caller: Yes, Cherry Hill Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-25\">9-1-1 Operator: Cherry Hill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-26\">Caller: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-27\">9-1-1 Operator: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>The trial court admitted this portion of the tape, explaining that \u201c[t]he whole tape from the beginning up until after the tag number was given is an excited utterance and admissible.\u201d Ultimately, the jury convicted Langley of first-degree murder, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and wearing or carrying a handgun. The trial judge imposed a sentence of life-imprisonment for murder, a consecutive twenty-year term for use of a handgun, and a concurrent three-year term for wearing or carrying a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Langley noted timely an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The panel of the intermediate appellate court, in an unreported opinion, relying on <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis, </em>held that the statements in the 9-1-1 tape were non-testimonial, explaining that the 9-1-1 call \u201cwas for precisely ... [the] purpose\u201d \u201cto describe current circumstances requiring police assistance.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals, in the alternative, explained that \u201c[e]ven if ... the admission of the 911 tape were in error, however, we would be persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that such error was harmless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Langley filed timely a petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted, <em>Langley v. State, </em>405 Md. 290, 950 A.2d 828 (2008), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">1. Did the admission of a recording of a 911 call violate Petitioner\u2019s right to confrontation where the call was placed after the offense had been completed and where the alleged perpetrator had left the scene and the caller indicated that she was aware that the police had been notified and were in the process of responding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">2. Was the admission of the recording of the 911 call harmless?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">We hold that the statements in the 9-1-1 tape are non-testimonial for Confrontation Clause purposes, and, thus, Langley\u2019s confrontation rights were not infringed by the admission of the statements. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The flagship question presented in the present case queries whether certain statements admitted at trial were admitted in violation of Respondent\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This is a question of law, which we review under a non-deferential standard of review. <em>See Snowden v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 139, 143 n. 4, 846 A.2d 36, 39 n. 4 (2004), <em>aff'd, </em>385 Md. 64, 867 A.2d 314 (2005) (\u201cWe ... apply the <em>de novo </em>standard of review to the issue of whether the Confrontation Clause was violated in this case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>see Brye v. State, </em>410 Md. 623, 634, 980 A.2d 435, 441 (2009), provides, in pertinent part, that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. CONST, amend. VI. This confrontation right \u201cseeks to protect a defendant from the complexities of the legal system and his or her lack of understanding of the law.\u201d <em>Brye, </em>410 Md. at 634, 980 A.2d at 441. Currently, regarding Confrontation Clause jurisprudence, \u201c[o]ne question attracting much attention is the status of statements made during 911 calls.\u201d Geetanjli Malhotra, <em>Resolving the Ambiguity Behind the Bright-Line Rule: The Effect of </em>Crawford v. Washington <em>on the Admissibility of 911 Calls in Evidence-Based Domestic Violence Prosecutions, </em>2006 U. Ill. L.Rev.205, 215 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">In order to understand properly the current state of Confrontation Clause jurisprudence as it relates to 9-1-1 calls, some context is required. In <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, 609 (1980), the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause does not bar the admission of statements of an unavailable witness where such statements \u201cbear adequate indicia of reliability,\u201d and that such reliability is established where the \u201cevidence falls within a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>firmly rooted hearsay exception,\u201d or where it bears \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Nearly twenty-five years later, in <em>Crawford, supra, </em>the Supreme Court overruled <em>Roberts. See Bullcoming v. New Mexico, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 2705, 2713, 180 L.Ed.2d 610, 636 (2011) (\u201cIn a pathmarking 2004 decision, <em>Crawford </em>..., we overruled <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>.... \u201d). In <em>Crawford, </em>Crawford was arrested for stabbing a man who tried allegedly to rape Crawford\u2019s wife. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 38, 124 S.Ct. at 1357, 158 L.Ed.2d at 184-85. At trial, because Crawford\u2019s wife invoked the spousal privilege, the prosecution sought to admit the wife\u2019s tape-recorded statement made to the police describing the stabbing. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 40, 124 S.Ct. at 1357-58, 158 L.Ed.2d at 185. Importantly, in this statement, contrary to Crawford\u2019s version of the events, she testified that the victim had not drawn a weapon before Crawford assaulted him. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 39, 124 S.Ct. at 1357, 158 L.Ed.2d at 185. The trial court, relying on <em>Roberts, supra, </em>admitted the wife\u2019s statement, offering several reasons why it bore adequate indicia of trustworthiness. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 40, 124 S.Ct. at 1358, 158 L.Ed.2d at 186. A jury convicted Crawford of assault. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 41, 124 S.Ct. at 1358, 158 L.Ed.2d at 186. Ultimately, the Washington Supreme Court upheld Crawford\u2019s conviction, agreeing with the trial court that the statement \u201cbore guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 41, 124 S.Ct. at 1358, 158 L.Ed.2d at 186. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine \u201cwhether the State\u2019s use of [Crawford\u2019s wifej\u2019s statement violated the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 42, 124 S.Ct. at 1359, 158 L.Ed.2d at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">Explaining that <em>Roberts\u2019s </em>reliability test was unpredictable and \u201cdemonstrated [a] capacity to admit core testimonial statements that the Confrontation Clause plainly meant to exclude\u201d and after exploring centuries of history relating to the use of ex parte statements as evidence against the accused, the Supreme Court held that only with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>\u201ctestimonial evidence\u201d does the \u201cSixth Amendment demand! ] what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 63, 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1371, 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 200, 203. Although \u201cleaving] for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial,\u2019 \u201d the Supreme Court enumerated nonetheless a number of \u201cvarious formulations of this core class of \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\"><em>\u201cex parte </em>in-court testimony or its functional equivalent\u2014 that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially\u201d; \u201cextrajudicial statements ... contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions\u201d; \u201cstatements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\"><em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 193 (internal citations omitted). Applying these formulations to the facts before it, the Supreme Court explained that \u201c[wjhatever else the term covers, it applies at a minimum to ... police interrogations,\u201d and, because Crawford did not have a prior opportunity to cross-examine his wife, reversed the judgment of the Washington Supreme Court. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Supplying the next piece of the puzzle, in <em>Davis v. Washington </em>(and its companion case, <em>Hammon v. </em>Indiana), 547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006), the Supreme Court undertook to \u201cdetermine more precisely which police interrogations produce testimony,\u201d within the contemplation of Confrontation Clause jurisprudence. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. at 2273, 165 L.Ed.2d at 237. In <em>Davis, </em>Davis\u2019s former girlfriend called 9-1-1 in the midst of a domestic disturbance with Davis. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 817, 126 S.Ct. at 2270-71, 165 L.Ed.2d at 234. During the call, she informed the dispatcher that \u201c[hje\u2019s here jumpin\u2019 on me again,\u201d and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>\u201c[h]e\u2019s usin\u2019 his fists,\u201d and that Davis was the assailant. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 817-18, 126 S.Ct. at 2271, 165 L.Ed.2d at 234. As the conversation continued, the dispatcher was advised that Davis had \u201cjust r[un] out the door,\u201d departing in a car with another individual. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 818, 126 S.Ct. at 2271, 165 L.Ed.2d at 234. Ultimately, the State charged Davis with felony violation of a domestic no-contact order. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 818, 126 S.Ct. at 2271, 165 L.Ed.2d at 235. Because the former girlfriend did not appear at trial to testify, the trial court admitted a recording of her conversation with the 9-1-1 dispatcher. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 819, 126 S.Ct. at 2271, 165 L.Ed.2d at 235. A jury convicted Davis of the charge, and the Supreme Court of Washington concluded that the portion of the tape in which the former girlfriend identified Davis was non-testimonial, and if other parts of the tape were testimonial, their admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 819, 126 S.Ct. at 2271-72, 165 L.Ed.2d at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In <em>Hammon, </em>police responded to the home of Amy and Hershel Hammon for a reported domestic disturbance. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 819, 126 S.Ct. at 2272, 165 L.Ed.2d at 235. Upon arrival, the police found Amy on the front porch appearing \u201csomewhat frightened.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Police went inside the residence to speak with Hershel, who explained to police that he and his wife had \u201cbeen in an argument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By that point, Amy returned inside and police interviewed her in a separate room regarding the incident. <em>See id. </em>She signed a \u201cbattery affidavit,\u201d on which she wrote that Hershel \u201cshoved [her] down on the floor into the broken glass,\u201d and that he \u201c[h]it [her] in the chest and threw [her] down.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 820, 126 S.Ct. at 2272, 165 L.Ed.2d at 235. Amy did not appear to testify at trial. The prosecution called the officer who questioned her at the scene, whereupon the officer authenticated the affidavit and recounted what Amy told him. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 820, 126 S.Ct. at 2272, 165 L.Ed.2d at 236. The trial judge found Hershel guilty of domestic battery and violating his probation. The Indiana Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, explaining that Amy\u2019s statement was not testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>monial and that, if the affidavit was deemed testimonial and thus admitted wrongly, its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 821, 126 S.Ct. at 2273, 165 L.Ed.2d at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In its opinion, the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">Statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-7\"><em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. at 2273-74, 165 L.Ed.2d at 237. Accordingly, <em>Davis </em>established what courts and commentators alike refer to as the \u201cprimary purpose test.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Bryant, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 1167, 179 L.Ed.2d at 120 (Thomas, J., concurring); <em>Seely v. State, </em>373 Ark. 141, 282 S.W.3d 778, 787 (2008); Gregory M. O\u2019Neil, Davis &amp; Hammon: <em>Redefining the Constitutional Right to Confrontation, </em>40 Conn. L.Rev. 511, 543 (2007). In distinguishing the statements in the consolidated <em>Davis </em>case\u2014held to be non-testimonial\u2014from those in Crawford\u2014held to be testimonial\u2014 the Supreme Court explained that, in <em>Da,vis, </em>the declarant was \u201cspeaking about events <em>as they were actually happening, </em>rather than describing] past events, that there was an ongoing emergency, [and] that the elicited statements were necessary to be able to <em>resolve </em>the present emergency....\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>Bryant, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at <em>1154, 179 </em>L.Ed.2d at 106 (some quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, <em>Davis </em>stands for the proposition that \u201cwhere ... the primary purpose of an interrogation is to respond to an \u2018ongoing emergency,\u2019 its purpose is not to create a record for trial and thus is not within the scope of the [Confrontation] Clause.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 1155, 179 L.Ed.2d at 107. Ultimately, in the consolidated <em>Davis </em>case, the Supreme Court held that the admitted statements were non-testimonial, explaining that the 9-1-1 \u201ccall was plainly a call for help against a bona fide physical threat\u201d \u201cnecessary ... to resolve the present emergency, rather than to learn (as in <em>Crawford) </em>what had happened in the past.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 827, 126 S.Ct. at 2276, 165 L.Ed.2d at 240 (emphasis omitted).

Further, the weapon employed in <em>Lucas </em>was the assailant\u2019s fists and feet, not a firearm, as in the present case and in <em>Bryant.

Importantly, in <em>Lucas, </em>we said that the circumstances in that case \u201care distinct from those in which officers encountered <em>victims with apparent severe injuries requiring immediate medical attention and/or where an assailant had not yet been located. </em>\u201d <em>Lucas, </em>407 Md. at 324, 965 A.2d at 86 (emphasis added).

Perhaps such identifying information is not associated with a call seeking police assistance <em>to help the shot victim, </em>but it is certainly information that is associated with a call seeking police assistance <em>to help capture the fleeing suspect </em>who remains a potential threat to responding authorities and the public at large.

The United States Supreme Court, in overturning <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), and establishing new guidelines for the admission of out-of-court statements, set forth in its opinions several criteria to be used to determine whether the primary purpose of those statements is testimonial or not. The majority opinion ignores most of these criteria and focuses almost exclusively on the single issue of whether the telephone call was made during an ongoing emergency. Because the shooter in this case had left the scene of the crime, and no longer posed an immediate threat to individuals in the vicinity or to police, there was not an ongoing emergency at the time the 911 call was made. Moreover, even if there was an ongoing emergency, the majority opinion fails to properly apply all of the criteria explained in the Supreme Court\u2019s evolving line of cases regarding testimonial statements. A correct analysis of all the criteria shows that the caller\u2019s statements in this case were clearly testimonial and should not have been admitted into evidence without allowing the defense to cross-examine the caller.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The main issue of contention in this case arose when the State sought to introduce into evidence a recorded 911 call that had been the subject of a pre-trial motion in limine by defense counsel. Defense counsel argued that admitting the 911 recording violated the Confrontation Clauses of the Sixth Amendment and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights because the caller was not present at the trial. As the caller\u2019s identity was unknown, defense counsel contended that the tape of the 911 call \u201cplaces [the defense] in an awkward position simply because [the caller] is not subject to any cross-examination.\u201d The State countered defense arguments by pointing out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>\u201c[T]he Confrontation Clause says that the defense should have an opportunity ... to cross-examine those who bear witness against them.... [T]he purpose of making a 911 call is not to bear witness, but to provide information ... through the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Over defense counsel objections, the 911 tape was held to be admissible. The trial judge decided that admitting the 911 recording did not trigger the protections of the Confrontation Clause because the call</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">\u201cwas simply an ordinary citizen giving information as to the suspect or suspects, or possible suspects, during a startling event and ... I find that the information was non-testimonial hearsay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">The information on the tape was used to link the license plate number of the getaway car to a vehicle driven by the defendant on the day of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">Langley was convicted of murder in the first degree, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, and wearing or carrying a handgun. He appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that his Sixth Amendment and Article 21 rights of confrontation had been violated by the admission of the recorded 911 call. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed, holding that the 911 recording was non-testimonial and was not subject to the restrictions of the Confrontation Clauses. Citing the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006), the intermediate appellate court decided that the statements made on the 911 recording were not \u201c \u2018designed primarily to establish or prove some past fact,\u2019 \u201d but, instead, that the call had been made \u201c \u2018to resolve the present emergency5 by catching the fleeing felon.\u201d Alternatively, the Court of Special Appeals held that, \u201cif, <em>arguendo, </em>the admission of the 911 tape were in error,\u201d the \u201cerror was harmless.\u201d The appellate court vacated the defendant\u2019s conviction for wearing or carrying a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>handgun, holding that it merged into the greater handgun offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Langley filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari which was granted. In his petition, Langley did not contest the ruling by the trial court and the Court of Special Appeals that the caller\u2019s statements in the 911 call constituted an \u201cexcited utterance\u201d and are therefore admissible under Maryland Rule 5\u2014803(b) (2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, Langley limited his question before this Court to whether the admission of the 911 call violated the Confrontation Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions. He also challenged the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 ruling on harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, applicable to state proceedings by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees that, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to ... be confronted with the witnesses against him.... \u201d Similarly, Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights mandates \u201c[t]hat in all criminal prosecutions, every man hath a right to ... be confronted with the witnesses against him; [and] ... to examine the witnesses for and against him on oath.... \u201d Langley contended that the admission of the recorded 911 call, without subjecting the caller to cross-examination, violated his rights to confront a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">As briefly explained in the majority opinion, the United States Supreme Court considered the permissibility of \u201c[testimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial\u201d in <em>Crawford </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number><em>v. Washington, supra, </em>541 U.S. at 59, 124 S.Ct. at 1369, 158 L.Ed.2d at 197. The Supreme Court traced the right to confront one\u2019s accusers back to Roman times and examined how that right had been shaped by English common law and practices in the early American Colonies. This historical review led to the following conclusion (541 U.S. at 59, 124 S.Ct. at 1369, 158 L.Ed.2d at 197):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\">\u201cOur cases have ... remained faithful to the Framers\u2019 understanding: Testimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial have been admitted only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The <em>Crawford </em>Court, however, distinguished between \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements, which are subject to the requirements of the Confrontation Clause, and \u201cnontestimonial\u201d statements, which may be admitted into evidence if they fall within one of the hearsay exceptions. The Court later explained that \u201cthe testimonial character of the statement ... separates it from other hearsay that, while subject to traditional limitations upon hearsay evidence, is not subject to the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Davis v. Washington, supra, </em>547 U.S. at 821, 126 S.Ct. at 2273, 165 L.Ed.2d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The Court declined to define comprehensively \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements, but explained that \u201c[a]n accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192. The Court offered a representative list of statements that exemplified the \u201ctestimonial\u201d class, stating (541 U.S. at 50-51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 193, internal quotation marks omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">\u201cVarious formulations of this core class of testimonial statements exist: <em>ex parte </em>in-court testimony or its functional equivalent\u2014that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially, ... [as well as] extrajudicial statements ... contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions ... [and] statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.... These formulations all share a common nucleus and then define the [Confrontation] Clause\u2019s coverage at various levels of abstraction around it. Regardless of the precise articulation, some statements qualify under any definition\u2014for example, <em>ex parte </em>testimony at a preliminary hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The Court in <em>Crawford </em>reviewed a recording of police officials interrogating a defendant\u2019s wife. The wife did not testify at her husband\u2019s trial due to the marital privilege, so the prosecution sought to introduce the tape of her interrogation instead. The Court held that the recording constituted a \u201ctestimonial\u201d statement and, therefore, could not be admitted into evidence without subjecting the wife to cross-examination. As this Court observed in <em>State v. Snowden, </em>385 Md. 64, 78, 867 A.2d 314, 322 (2005), the <em>Crawford </em>opinion \u201cfundamentally altered ... Confrontation Clause jurisprudence.\u201d The <em>Crawford </em>opinion commenced the Supreme Court\u2019s foray into distinguishing between testimonial and non-testimonial statements, but the case left many questions unanswered regarding the criteria used to determine if a statement is \u201ctestimonial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AQa\">The Supreme Court next addressed this distinction in <em>Davis v. Washington, supra, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. The Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>reviewed two trials where witnesses\u2019 out-of-court statements were admitted. One of those trials involved a recorded 911 call, and the Court considered whether the statements contained in the 911 recording qualified as nontestimonial statements that could be admitted without subjecting the caller to defense questioning. The Supreme Court examined the content of the call to determine its admissibility. The 911 call in <em>Davis </em>commenced with a woman telling the operator that she is being attacked by her boyfriend and that \u201c \u2018[h]e\u2019s here jumpin\u2019 on me again\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018usin\u2019 his fists.\u2019 \u201d After giving the 911 operator her attacker\u2019s name and answering a few questions, the caller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>stated that \u201c \u2018[h]e\u2019s runnin\u2019 now1 \u201d and explained that her attacker had \u201c \u2018just r[un] out the door\u2019 \u201d and was leaving in a car with someone else. The police arrived \u201cwithin four minutes of the 911 call\u201d and noted the \u201c \u2018fresh injuries on her forearm and her face\u2019 \u201d and her \u201c \u2018frantic efforts\u2019 \u201d to leave the residence. <em>Davis v. Washington, supra, </em>547 U.S. at 817-818, 126 S.Ct. at 2271, 165 L.Ed.2d at 234-235.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>held that the statements contained in the 911 recording were \u201cnontestimonial\u201d and therefore properly admitted as evidence, explaining (547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. at 2273-2274, 165 L.Ed.2d at 237):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnM\">\u201cStatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The Court acknowledged that the \u201cinquiries of a police operator in the course of a 911 call are an interrogation in one sense,\u201d but clarified that the interrogation aspect of the inquiries alone was not enough to mandate that all 911 recordings are testimonial. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 823, 126 S.Ct. at 2274, 165 L.Ed.2d at 238. The Court distinguished 911 calls from other sorts of interrogation because 911 calls are \u201cordinarily not designed primarily to \u2018establis[h] or prov[e]\u2019 some past fact, but to describe current circumstances requiring police assistance.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 827, 126 S.Ct. at 2276, 165 L.Ed.2d at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">To demonstrate the difference between testimonial and nontestimonial statements, the <em>Davis </em>opinion contrasted the police interrogation recording at issue in <em>Crawford </em>with the 911 call in <em>Davis, </em>explaining which aspects made the <em>Crawford </em>recording testimonial and the <em>Davis </em>911 call nontestimonial. The Court stated that, in <em>Davis, </em>the caller was \u201cspeaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>about events <em>as they were actually happening, </em>rather than \u2018describing] past events.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 827, 126 S.Ct. at 2276, 165 L.Ed.2d at 240 (emphasis in original). The testimonial statements in <em>Crawford </em>took place \u201chours after\u201d the criminal incident as compared to the 911 call, which dealt with an \u201congoing emergency.\u201d The Court pointed out that the 911 call in <em>Davis </em>was \u201ca call for help against a bona fide physical threat\u201d rather than a \u201cnarrative report of a crime absent any imminent danger.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, the 911 operator\u2019s questions sought \u201cto <em>resolve </em>the present emergency, rather than to learn (as in Crawford) what had happened in the past.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Finally, the Court compared the \u201clevel of formality\u201d between the two recordings, noting that the wife in <em>Crawford </em>calmly answered the police questions, while the 911 caller in <em>Davis </em>gave \u201cfrantic answers\u201d from a setting that was \u201cnot tranquil, or even (as far as any reasonable 911 operator could make out) safe.\u201d 547 U.S. at 827, 126 S.Ct. at 2277, 165 L.Ed.2d at 240. As indicated in <em>Davis, </em>and as later summarized by this Court in <em>State v. Lucas, </em>407 Md. 307, 323, 965 A.2d 75, 85 (2009), formality may also include details such as the interview\u2019s location, the declarant\u2019s spatial distance from the defendant, the police official\u2019s use of the declarant\u2019s replies, and whether the statements are deliberately recounted in response to interrogation. The Supreme Court captured the essence of these guidelines by noting: \u201cNo \u2018witness\u2019 goes into court to proclaim an emergency and seek help.\u201d 547 U.S. at 828, 126 S.Ct. at 2277, 165 L.Ed.2d at 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The <em>Davis </em>Court highlighted four factors in determining whether a statement is testimonial or nontestimonial. First, the timing of the statement in relation to the incident is important. Nontestimonial statements are made while events are actually happening, while testimonial statements occur after the incident. Nontestimonial statements relate to an ongoing emergency and are not a simple reporting of past incidents. Additionally, a nontestimonial statement seeks help to resolve a present crisis while a testimonial statement recounts or explains a past event or gives details regarding a crime that has occurred. The formality of the statement is also a factor in determining whether a statement is testimonial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>or not. A nontestimonial statement is often made in a frantic state lacking tranquility, while calm answers are more a hallmark of testimonial statements. Despite describing these criteria in great detail, the <em>Davis </em>Court asserted that it was not \u201cattempting to produce an exhaustive classification of all conceivable statements\u2014or even all conceivable statements in response to police interrogation\u2014as either testimonial or non-testimonial.\u201d <em>Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. at 2273, 165 L.Ed.2d at 237.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Michigan v. Bryant, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1143, 179 L.Ed.2d 93 (2011), recently clarified some of the criteria discussed in the <em>Davis </em>case. <em>Bryant </em>involved statements made by a fatally wounded gunshot victim in response to police questioning that occurred when the police first arrived at the scene of the crime. The Court held that the statements were nontestimonial. The Supreme Court in <em>Bryant </em>cautioned that courts should be careful not to construe <em>Davis </em>as having \u201cdecided more than it did\u201d and thus should be wary of \u201cemploying] an unduly narrow understanding of \u2018ongoing emergency\u2019 that <em>Davis </em>does not require.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. at 1158, 179 L.Ed.2d at 110. The <em>Bryant </em>Court observed that, \u201cwhether an emergency exists and is ongoing is a highly context-dependent inquiry.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Furthermore, a court\u2019s inquiry should be objective. The <em>Bryant </em>opinion explained that (562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. at 1156, 179 L.Ed.2d at 109)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-11\">\u201cthe relevant inquiry is not the subjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved in a particular encounter, but rather the purpose that reasonable participants would have had, as ascertained from the individuals\u2019 statements and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">The <em>Bryant </em>Court repeated the holding of <em>Davis </em>that \u201cthe ultimate inquiry is whether the \u2018primary purpose of the inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>rogation [was] to enable police assistance to meet [the] ongoing emergency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. at 1165, 179 L.Ed.2d at 117, quoting <em>Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. at 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d at 224.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The principal question before this Court is not, as the majority opinion portrays it, whether the statements made in the 911 call occurred during an ongoing emergency. If that were the test, recordings of all 911 calls would be admissible, as 911 is for emergencies only. Rather, the question is whether those statements are testimonial or not. Applying the factors utilized by the Supreme Court, I believe that the recording in the present case consisted of testimonial statements and, as such, should not have been admitted without making the caller available for questioning by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">This Court should first examine the amount of time between the reported incident and the recorded statements. The timing of the 911 call in the present case strongly suggests that the statements are testimonial. Although the record does not show the amount of time lapsed between the 911 call and the shooting, the caller begins by telling the 911 operator that she wants \u201cto give some information on a shooting that just occurred.\u201d In short, the caller is giving information about a past event. The caller urges the operator to \u201c[h]urry up\u201d because the incident is \u201cjust happening.\u201d The caller\u2019s urgency, however, does not relate to stopping the shooting or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>getting medical assistance, but instead relates to the fact that the caller has seen the apparent shooter get into his car and objectively believes that the perpetrator may successfully escape. The timing in <em>Davis </em>contrasts sharply with the present case. In <em>Davis, </em>the caller tells the operator that she is being beaten, her attacker is still in the home, and only after ten responses does she report that her attacker is leaving. It is clear that the caller in the case at bar is not describing the shooting as it is actually happening, and she is not facing the same immediacy of events faced by the speakers in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Bryant </em>The caller was describing past events.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The existence of an \u201congoing emergency\u201d is closely related to the timing of the statements. The Supreme Court in <em>Bryant </em>explained that \u201cwhether an emergency exists and is ongoing is a highly context-dependent inquiry.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct at 1158, 179 L.Ed.2d at 110. In <em>Bryant, </em>the statements were made by the victim while the victim was suffering from a gunshot wound. In <em>Davis, </em>the attacker was still in the home with the caller when she dialed 911 and reported that he was beating her. In the present case, the caller, notably not a victim of the shooting, called after the attack had occurred and reported that she had seen the apparent shooter get into a car. The alleged perpetrator had already fled the scene of the shooting, the police were on their way, and the caller contacted 911 only to report information about the flight of the apparent shooter. At the time of her 911 call, the emergency was not ongoing; it had concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The majority opinion, dramatically and without reason, expands the holding of <em>Bryant </em>to conclude that \u201cexcept in domestic disputes\u201d with facts similar to <em>Davis, </em>\u201ca court may not hold that an emergency is no longer ongoing\u201d because the alleged perpetrator has fled. No such language is found in <em>Bryant </em>The <em>Bryant </em>opinion does not limit the holding of <em>Davis </em>to domestic disputes and, in fact, declares that an emergency is <em>not </em>ongoing when, as in the present case, a perpetrator \u201cflees with little prospect of posing a threat to the public.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. at 1159, 179 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>at 112. Although the majority opinion attempts to portray the facts in this case as similar to <em>Bryant, </em>where the police did not know if the shooter remained in the area or continue to pose a threat, the police in this case knew that the shooter had left the scene and was no longer a threat to the police or the public at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Moreover, the majority opinion argues on the one hand that there is an ongoing emergency any time a shooter is at large, but, on the other hand, concedes in footnote <em>8 </em>that an emergency is not ongoing simply because a suspect has not yet been caught. According to the majority\u2019s reasoning, a witness could see a suspect the following day, call 911 \u201cseeking police assistance to help capture the fleeing suspect,\u201d and such a call would qualify as an \u201congoing emergency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Another element of a nontestimonial statement is that such statements seek help to resolve a present crisis. The caller in the present case did not call 911 to request police or any other assistance. The caller did not tell the operator any information concerning the shooting, such as the specific shop in which the shooting took place, how many people, if any, were shot, if there were any injuries, or what instigated the shooting. The only information the caller relates concerns the identification of the alleged shooter\u2014his car tag number and his physical appearance. All of this information is typically testimonial and is not associated with a call seeking police assistance. A starkly different situation was presented in <em>Bryant </em>where the police encountered a wounded victim in a parking lot and asked him \u201c \u201cwhat had happened, who had shot him, and where the shooting occured.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. at 1166, 179 L.Ed.2d at 118. Not only were these questions not asked by the 911 operator in the present case, but the information relayed by the caller barely touches on these topics and certainly does not hold the same importance in resolving an ongoing emergency. The majority opinion asserts that, in the present case, the caller said nothing to indicate that the \u201c \u2018threat from the shooter had ended.\u2019 \u201d I find it impossible to assume anything less from the caller\u2019s statements that she had seen the shooter get into a car and flee the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>scene. The operator did not even ask if medical assistance was required and merely asked questions later used to identify the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">When asked by the operator where the police should be sent, the caller replies that police are not needed and redirects the questioning by telling the operator that she is calling to report details of the getaway vehicle, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u201cI don\u2019t want [the police] sent nowhere. They already going out to the store. But the guy, I seen him get in the car. Tag number MRG 908.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">A hallmark of a testimonial statement is the declarant\u2019s desire to give details regarding a crime that has occurred in the past. Where statements are \u201c \u2018neither a cry for help nor the provision of information enabling officers immediately to end a threatening situation\u2019... they [are] testimonial.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. at 1155, 179 L.Ed.2d at 107. The caller in the present case continued to give a detailed description of the car that the apparent shooter left in, repeating three times the tag number she had noticed. The purpose of her 911 call was emphasized throughout the recording; she was calling to give information to assist the police in apprehending the suspect, not to request assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">The formality and tone of the call may denote whether the caller\u2019s intent is testimonial or not. The Supreme Court noted that the answers to the questions posed in <em>Crawford </em>were calmly given, but the tenor of the 911 call in <em>Davis </em>was \u201cfrantic,\u201d and the caller was in an environment that was \u201cnot tranquil\u201d and not even safe. In <em>Bryant, </em>nontestimonial statements were made by a victim suffering a mortal injury \u201cin an exposed, public area, before emergency medical services arrived, and in a disorganized fashion.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. at 1148, 179 L.Ed.2d at 100. While the transcript in the present case does not reveal the location of the caller, there is no evidence that she was present in the Carry-Out store at the time of the shooting or ever in an unsafe environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">Naturally, there is an excited tone to the 911 call in the case at bar, but objectively that excited tone is not as \u201cfrantic\u201d as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>woman calling 911 to request help because she is being attacked or a wounded victim telling police who shot him while waiting for medical assistance in a parking lot. The Court of Special Appeals attributed the caller\u2019s anxiety to the hope that the police would be able to catch a fleeing felon, and this is an appropriate assumption. The caller was not a victim of the shooting, did not request police assistance, and there are no objective indications that she was ever in danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Finally, the Supreme Court stated in <em>Bryant </em>(562 U.S. -, 181 S.Ct. at 1159, 179 L.Ed.2d at 111):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">\u201cThe medical condition of the victim is important to the primary purpose inquiry to the extent that it sheds light on the ability of the victim to have any purpose at all in responding to police questions and on the likelihood that any purpose formed would necessarily be a testimonial one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASW\">The nontestimonial statements in both <em>Davis </em>and <em>Bryant </em>were made by victims of an ongoing crime, while the statements in this case were made by a spectator, seemingly uninvolved with the crime except for her description of the vehicle used by the apparent shooter to leave the scene. This is not to say that only victims may make nontestimonial statements, but a review of those cases where 911 calls have been determined to be nontestimonial shows that many of them are calls made by the victims themselves, or at least individuals in some way seriously involved in the criminal incident. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Arnold, </em>486 F.3d 177 (6th Cir.2007); <em>Smith v. United States, </em>947 A.2d 1131 (D.C.2008); <em>Commonwealth v. Galicia, </em>447 Mass. 737, 857 N.E.2d 463 (2006); <em>State v. Kemp, </em>212 S.W.3d 135 (Mo.2007); <em>State v. Camarena, </em>344 Or. 28, 176 P.3d 380 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Recently, this Court employed criteria similar to the <em>Davis </em>factors in determining whether statements made to the police were testimonial or not. In <em>State v. Lucas, supra, </em>407 Md. 307, 965 A.2d 75, the Court considered statements made by a domestic violence victim when police officers encountered her at the entrance to her apartment. The Court determined that the \u201cemergency had ended\u201d by the time the police met the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>victim at the door of her apartment and that \u201c[a] reasonable listener would recognize that the [victim\u2019s] emergency had ceased.\u201d 407 Md. at 324, 965 A.2d at 85-86. The Court also took into consideration the fact that the victim \u201cspoke of past events\u201d and she was \u201cno longer under any apparent imminent danger when she spoke\u201d to the police. 407 Md. at 324, 965 A.2d at 85-86. As such, the victim\u2019s responses to the police officers were testimonial and could not be admitted without making her available for cross-examination. Despite the fact that the victim was \u201cvisibly upset and exhibited injuries,\u201d this Court noted that the police officers did not call for emergency medical assistance. The Court concluded that the \u201ccircumstances of [the police officer\u2019s] interrogation objectively indicate a primary purpose to \u2018establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution\u2019 and not to \u2018enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Lucas, </em>407 Md. at 325, 323-324, 965 A.2d at 86, 85. The same is true in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">When the criteria applied in <em>Davis, Bryant, </em>and <em>Lucas </em>are applied to the case at bar, it is clear that the 911 recording played to the jury at Langley\u2019s trial was testimonial. Unlike the 911 call the Supreme Court deemed nontestimonial in <em>Davis, </em>where the \u201cprimary purpose was to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency,\u201d the 911 recording in the instant case served only to provide a \u201c \u201cweaker substitute for live testimony\u2019 at trial.\u201d 547 U.S. at 828, 126 S.Ct. at 2277, 165 L.Ed.2d at 240-241. The State in this case virtually admitted as much, stating in pre-trial argument, against the defense\u2019s motion in limine, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">\u201cThe only reason the State would want to use it is to get in the license place number that someone who witnesses the shooting calls and gives to the Police as the event is taking place, as the Defendant is getting in his car and as he is leaving.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The call was not eliciting help, but rather was used by the State in place of live testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Moreover, the 911 caller\u2019s statements in the present case were intended to be a \u201c \u2018solemn declaration or affirmation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact\u2019 \u201d rather than a call for immediate assistance to the scene of a crime. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192 (internal quotation marks omitted). The caller herself evinced the knowledge that her statements would be used as an affirmation of fact in subsequent investigations, telling the operator, when she was unsure of her answer, \u201cdon\u2019t quote me ...\u201d on certain parts of her identification information. Objectively viewed, the primary purpose of the exchange between the caller and the 911 operator in the present case was not to enable police assistance in the midst of an ongoing emergency. The caller was simply a witness calling after the crime occurred to provide information for use in the shooter\u2019s apprehension and eventual trial. Her statements were therefore testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">This Court should reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and direct that court to remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge GREENE join in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-9\">. Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(2) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-10\">\u201cThe following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-11\">(b) Other exceptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-12\">(2) Excited utterance.

Reading the majority opinion could lead one to believe that the Court, in <em>Bryant, </em>moved away from the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test. The majority states that \u201c[ajfter <em>Bryant, </em>it is of little matter that the purpose of the call was not to stop the immediate shooting or get medical assistance. ...\u201d The majority opinion overlooks the simple fact that, as the name of the test suggests, the purpose of the 911 call is the <em>primary </em>concern and \u201cultimate inquiry\u201d of courts in determining whether the statements are testimonial or not. <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. at 1160, 179 L.Ed.2d at 112 (\u201cwhether an ongoing emergency exists is simply one factor\u201d).
