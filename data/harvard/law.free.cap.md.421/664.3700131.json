Before addressing these issues, however, it is necessary that we clear away a good deal of flotsam and jetsam produced by the two hundred seventy-five paragraph,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> fifty-one page Complaint in which the former employee asserted her sixteen claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">At this point in these needlessly complicated proceedings, there are four Petitioners/Cross Respondents (\u201cPetitioners\u201d): (1) Prince of Peace Lutheran Church (\u201cthe Church\u201d), (2) Rufus S. Lusk, III (\u201cLusk\u201d), (3) the Metropolitan Washington D.C. Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (\u201cthe Synod\u201d), and (4) Bishop Theodore Schneider (\u201cSchneider\u201d). Having ultimately prevailed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, they argue that the Court of Special Appeals has erroneously concluded that Respondent/Cross Petitioner, Mary Linklater (Respondent) is entitled to a new trial on four of the claims asserted in her Complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Respondent, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>was awarded compensatory and punitive damages by a jury, argues that the Court of Special Appeals has erroneously concluded that she is not entitled to the entry of a judgment that conforms to that verdict.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we hold that (1) the ministerial exception does not apply to two of the claims that Respondent has asserted, and (2) the \u201ccontinuing violation doctrine\u201d is applicable to those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">As the issues before us involve questions of law rather than questions of fact, there is no need to set forth each and every item of conflicting evidence in the record of this \u201cshe said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>they said\u201d case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Suffice it to say that the evidence was sufficient to establish that Respondent (1) was the victim of sexual harassment, (2) complained about the harassment, and (3) was the victim of additional harassment and retaliation as a result of her complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">On October 16, 2002, Respondent filed a Complaint against the Petitioners in which she asserted the following causes of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">COUNT I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">Sexual Harassment and Hostile Work Environment Against all Defendants</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">COUNT II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment Against all Defendants</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\">COUNT III</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Gender Discrimination Against all Defendants</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-4\">Count IV</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">Retaliatory Harassment and Constructive Discharge Against All Defendants</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">Count V</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Against All Defendants</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">Count VI</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">Invasion of Privacy and False Light Against all Defendants</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-10\">Count VII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWP\">Fraud Against All Defendants</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-12\">Count VIII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYJ\">Injurious Falsehood Against Defendants Lusk, Schneider and D.C.

On March 4, 2001, [Respondent] found a defaced picture of herself that had been horribly stabbed numerous times, stuck to a bulletin board on the wall of the church next to the music room where [Respondent] worked. [Respondent] was extremely distraught by this hateful act, and immediately fled the church.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-12\">161. Over the course of the next three days, [Respondent] suffered from disabling emotional and psychological distress.... [Respondent] continuously agonized over her circumstances, and the defaced photo, which symbolized a great hatred of her that was felt by others\u2014others who had previously been her friends and supporters....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-13\">162. By March 7, 2001, [Respondent] concluded that the environment at Prince of Peace had become so hostile and hateful and intimidating that, emotionally and psychologically, she simply could no longer bring herself to come in to work, unless there was a dramatic and fundamental improvement in the work environment....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Respondent\u2019s Complaint included the following <em>Prayer for Relief:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\">WHEREFORE, [Respondent] respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">A. declaring that the acts complained of herein are in violation of the laws of the State of Maryland and Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27-19;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">B. directing Defendants to make [Respondent] whole for all earnings and other job benefits she would have received but for Defendants\u2019 unlawful conduct, including but not limited to, wages, retirement benefits, bonuses, and other lost benefits, plus pre-judgment and post-judgment interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">C. directing Defendants to pay [Respondent] compensatory damages, including damages for her mental anguish and psychological treatment in an amount appropriate to the proof at trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">D. awarding [Respondent] punitive damages in an amount appropriate to the proof at trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-9\">E. awarding [Respondent] the costs of this action, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-10\">F. granting such other and further relief as this Court Deems necessary and proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">The first Circuit Court ruling of consequence occurred on March 10, 2003, when the pretrial motions hearing court resolved Petitioners\u2019 motions to dismiss in an on-the-record proceeding during which it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-12\">In deciding the motion to dismiss as to the first amendment issues that have been raised, I decided that what I needed to do was look at the allegations in each count of the complaint and determine on a claim-by-claim basis whether or not the issues raised constituted\u2014and I\u2019m quoting from which case is this, <em>McKelvey v. Pierce </em>[, 173 N.J. 26, 800 A.2d 840 (2002),] which, although none of these cases are technically binding, I felt that this language was instructive as to the analysis the Court needed to conduct. And that was requiring an assessment of every issue raised in terms of doctrinal and administrative intrusion and entanglement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>I thought that was a pretty good description for the process we were required to go through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">The Court is going to grant the motion to dismiss as to Counts 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and denying the motion to dismiss as to the remaining counts. I did also consider separately the statute of limitations arguments that have been raised with respect to the remaining counts and do not find that they are barred by the statute of limitations, at least for motions to dismiss purposes. So the counts remaining are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The second Circuit Court ruling of consequence occurred on January 19, 2005, when the trial court filed a Memorandum Opinion and Order that included the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">The issues presented [by the Petitioners in their Motions for Summary Judgment] were: (1) Whether the ecclesiastical exception bars Ms. Linklater\u2019s causes of actions against all of the Defendants; (2) Whether the Statute of Limitations has already run for Ms. Linklater\u2019s Montgomery County Code causes of actions (Counts I\u2014III); and (3) Whether Ms. Linklater has presented enough evidence to establish a claim on any of the counts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">A. The Ecclesiastical Exception</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyD\">1) Bishop Schneider and the Synod</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2u\">This Court finds that the ministerial exception bars Ms. Linklater\u2019s claims as they apply to the Defendants Bishop Schneider and Synod. Bishop Schneider became involved in this litigation matter only to help resolve ongoing conflicts in the Prince of Peace church between Pastor Lusk, Neil Howard, and Ms. Linklater. The Bishop and the Synod were not Ms. Linklater\u2019s employers and were never accused of sexually harassing her. Rather the Bishop worked with Ms. Linklater, Pastor Lusk, and Howard only to mend the rifts that had developed in Prince of Peace. Once Ms. Linklater elected to file a formal complaint with the Montgomery County Human Relations Commission, the Bishop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>was no longer involved in the matter. The Bishop was merely acting in his role as Bishop, and therefore this Court finds that the First Amendment prohibits Ms. Linklater from pursuing any of her claims against Bishop Schneider or the Metropolitan Washington, D.C. Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\">2) Pastor Lusk and Prince of Peace</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">In the case at bar, Ms. Linklater\u2019s claims derive from the alleged sexual harassment by [a fellow employee] and Pastor Lusk and the alleged statements that publicly discredited her. She is not challenging any employment decisions regarding her termination in March 2001. Numerous courts have recognized that tort claims based on harassment are not barred by the First Amendment.... In as much as Ms. Linklater\u2019s claims do not implicate any employment decisions or religious beliefs of Prince of Peace, the First Amendment\u2019s ecclesiastical exception will not bar her causes of action as they relate to Pastor Lusk and Prince of Peace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">B. Statute of Limitations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">Counts I\u2014III of Ms. Linklater\u2019s suit pertains to the Montgomery County Code and therefore are subject to the statute of limitations enunciated in the Maryland Code pertaining to discriminatory acts in violation of the Montgomery County Code. Pursuant to MD. CODE ANN. ART. 49B \u00a7 42 (1997), \u201c[a]n action ... of this section shall be commenced in the circuit court for the county in which the alleged discrimination took place not later than two years after the occurrence of the alleged discriminatory act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">Ms. Linklater filed suit on October 16, 2002. If the causes of action occurred before October 16, 2000, Ms. Linklater\u2019s claims are untenable. [The fellow employee\u2019s] inappropriate conduct could not have continued after he resigned on July 15, 2000. According to Ms. Linklater\u2019s deposition Pastor Lusk\u2019s alleged sexual harassment ended on March 18, 2000. Thus, the statute of limitations has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>already run as it pertains to [the fellow employee] and Pastor Lusk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-4\">Additionally, Ms. Linklater made her claims against [the fellow employee] and Lusk public on July 19, 2000. All of the actions taken by Pastor Lusk and the church which occurred after July 19, 2000 implicate the ministerial exception discussed above because they are not relevant to the harassment and abusive treatment alleged by Ms. Linklater, but rather with an employment decision of the church. A close reading of <em>National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101 [122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106] (2002), indicates that hostile work environment claims primarily focused on acts which occur beyond the statute of limitations can be filed as long as at least one event occurred within the statute of limitations period. This court finds <em>Morgan </em>has no bearing on the case at bar because any actions which occurred after October 16, 2000 were effectively barred by the ministerial exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">Therefore, since there is only a two year statute of limitations for Counts I\u2014III and the basis for the causes of action occurred before October 16, 2000 these counts will be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">IV. Conclusion</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">In light of the findings of this Court, the Defendants, Bishop Theodore Schneider, and the Metropolitan Washington, DC Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">The Defendants Prince of Peace Lutheran Church and Pastor Rufus Lusk\u2019s, Motion for Summary Judgment is granted in part reversed in part. Count I, Sexual Harassment and Hostile Work Environment in violation of the Montgomery County Code; Count II, Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, in violation of the Montgomery County Code; Count HI Gender Discrimination in violation of the Montgomery County Code; Count VII, Fraud; and Count XI, Respondeat Superior have all been dismissed for the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>sons stated above. As the motion pertains to Count V, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; Count VI, Invasion of Privacy and False Light; Count VIII, Injurious Falsehood, this Court denies the Motion for Summary Judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Prior to trial, Lusk and the Church filed a motion in limine to exclude any evidence of Lusk\u2019s net worth, but the Circuit Court made no pretrial ruling on that issue. At trial, Respondent introduced into evidence a financial statement that listed the income and marital property of both Lusk and his wife. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of Petitioners on Respondent\u2019s injurious falsehood claim, so only Count V (the IIED claim), and Count VI (the invasion of privacy and false light claim) were submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The jury returned its verdicts on a \u201cspecial\u201d <em>VERDICT SHEET </em>that includes the following questions and answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">1. Do you find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Plaintiff, Mary Linklater, suffered Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress by the Defendant, Prince of Peace Lutheran Church?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Yes <em>X_ </em>No _</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">\n<em>If \u201cyes\u201d proceed to question No. 2; if \u201cno\u201d proceed to Question No. 6.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\"><em>2. </em>Do you find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that compensatory damages should be awarded on this claim of Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">Yes J\u00a3_ No _</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-11\"><em>If \u201cyes\u201d proceed to question No. S; if \u201cno\u201d proceed to Question No. </em>A</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-12\">3.

(Note: Do not award any damages that may already have been awarded in Question No. 3 if you have answered Question No. 3.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-12\">\n<em>$300,000.00</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-13\">9. Do you find, by a clear and convincing evidence that punitive damages should be awarded on this claim of Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">Yes _X No _</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-15\">\n<em>If \u201cyes\u201d proceed to question No. 10; if \u201cno\u201d proceed to Question No. 11.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-16\">10. In what amount should punitive damages against Rufus Lusk be awarded for the claim of Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-17\">\n<em>$1,000,000.00</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-18\">11. Do you find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Plaintiff, Mary Linklater, suffered False Light, Invasion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>of Privacy by the Defendant, Prince of Peace Lutheran Church?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Yes No X_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">\n<em>If \u201cyes\u201d proceed to question No. 12; if \u201cno\u201d proceed to Question No. 16.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">16. Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Plaintiff, Mary Linklater, suffered False Light, Invasion of Privacy by the Defendant, Rufus Lusk?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Yes No <em>X_</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\"><em>If \u201cyes </em>\u201d <em>proceed to question No. 17; if \u201cno </em>\u201d <em>your deliberations are concluded.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">Numerous post-trial motions were filed by all parties. At the first post-trial motions hearing, the trial court concluded that it had made a \u201cfatal error\u201d by admitting the joint financial statement before the jury had made a finding that would entitle Respondent to argue for an award of punitive damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ultimately, after the trial court recused itself on its own motion, another member of the Circuit Court granted the Church and Lusk a new trial on the IIED count.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">The final Circuit Court rulings of consequence were made by a fourth member of the court, who (1) citing the ministerial exception, granted the Church\u2019s motion in limine to exclude all evidence of Respondent\u2019s job performance, and (2) thereafter granted renewed motions for summary judgment made by the Church and Lusk. Respondent noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and filed a brief that did not include argument that the Circuit Court erred in entering judgments on Counts VI, VII, and VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>In the \u201cCONCLUSION\u201d section of her brief, Respondent requested that the Court of Special Appeals provide the following relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\">1.

In other words, the church is not putting forth any religious justification for Lusk\u2019s conduct. In addition, deciding whether the harassment occurred would not involve the court in ecclesiastical matters. The jury would simply have to decide who was more credible in order to resolve a straightforward, \u201che said, she said\u201d kind of factual dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-10\">It is difficult to see how one could come up with a principled basis\u2014except for the severity of harm inflicted\u2014 for distinguishing between this suit and a parishioner\u2019s suit against a priest who sexually molested him, or the religious organization that continued to employ that priest.....Although the sexual harassment cause of action is considered part of employment law, while actions for molestation would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>likely be based on battery, the improper conduct is essentially the same. In either case, the perpetrator engages in inappropriate and non-consensual sexual advances. The court need not delve into ecclesiastical matters to find that this occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">\n<em>Count II-Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">Unlike the hostile work environment and gender discrimination claims, adjudicating the quid pro quo claim would require the court to assess whether Linklater was \u201cotherwise qualified to receive\u201d a \u201cjob benefit.\u201d This would necessitate an evaluation of Linklater\u2019s job performance, which would run afoul of the ministerial exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that, \u201cadjudicating the quid pro quo claim would require the court to assess whether Linklater was \u2018otherwise qualified to receive a job benefit,\u2019 \u201d and thus would \u201cnecessitate an evaluation of Linklater\u2019s job performance which would run afoul of the ministerial exception.\u201d We therefore hold that the ministerial exception prohibits Respondent from proceeding to trial on Count II of her Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Although Counts I and III stem from the harassment itself and would not involve the court in \u201cmatters of church governance,\u201d these counts were dismissed by the Circuit Court on the ground that they were barred by the statute of limitations. The Court of Special Appeals, however, held that because Respondent had \u201calleged at least one instance of retaliatory conduct that fell within the statute of limitations, [Count I and Count III] are saved by the continuing violation rule.\u201d While we agree that the continuing violation doctrine is applicable to Count I and Count III, our conclusion is based upon an incident that is alleged to have occurred within the period of limitations and has nothing whatsoever to do with church governance.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">In <em>Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc., </em>26 Cal.4th 798, 111 Cal.Rptr.2d 87, 29 P.3d 175 (2001), while holding that an employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>may be held liable for disability related harassment and discrimination actions occurring outside the limitations period,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Supreme Court of California noted that federal cases interpreting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) [ (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq.) have taken four different approaches to the continuing violation doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-4\">In the first approach, a continuing violation is found when a corporate policy is initiated before the limitations period but continues in effect within that period to the detriment of the employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">A second approach to the continuing violation doctrine is derived from the doctrine of equitable tolling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">A third approach is the multi-factored test first articulated in <em>Berry v. Board of Sup\u2019rs of L.S. U. </em>(5th Cir.1983) 715 F.2d 971 (Berry). Under this approach, equitable tolling is one of a number of considerations for determining when a violation is deemed to be continuing. The court formulated the three nonexclusive factors of its test as follows: \u201cThe first is subject matter. Do the alleged acts involve the same type of discrimination, tending to connect them in a continuing violation? The second is frequency. Are the alleged acts recurring (e.g., a biweekly paycheck) or more in the nature of an isolated work assignment or employment decision? The third factor, perhaps of most importance, is degree of permanence. Does the act have the degree of permanence which should trigger an employee\u2019s awareness of and duty to assert his or her rights, or which should indicate to the employee that the continued existence of the adverse consequences of the act is to be expected without being dependent on a continuing intent to discriminate? ...\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 981.) This third factor is akin to equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>tolling, focusing on when the employee was put on notice that his or her rights had been violated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-4\">A fourth approach to the continuing violation doctrine has dispensed with the permanence factor altogether. This approach is exemplified by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has adopted what may be termed a \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d test rather than the <em>Berry </em>test, as was recognized in <em>Counts v. Reno </em>(D.Hawai\u2019i 1996) 949 F.Supp. 1478, 1484-1486. The test employed is essentially whether the separate acts of discrimination are \u201c \u2018closely enough related\u2019 \u201d to form a continuing violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-5\"><em>Richards, </em>111 Cal.Rptr.2d 87, 29 P.3d at 183-185. (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The <em>Richards </em>Court also noted that \u201cthe <em>Berry </em>test has been widely adopted by the federal courts.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We are persuaded, however, that the \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d test is most compatible with <em>National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002), in which the United States Supreme Court held that Title VII</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsX\">precludes recovery for discrete acts of discrimination or retaliation that occur outside the statutory time period. We also hold that consideration of the entire scope of a hostile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>work environment claim, including behavior alleged outside the statutory time period, is permissible for the purposes of assessing liability, so long as any act contributing to that hostile environment takes place within the statutory time period. The application of equitable doctrines, however, may either limit or toll the time period within which an employee must file a charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 105, 122 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals were both correct in concluding that Respondent may not benefit from the continuing violation doctrine on the basis of conduct that is inadmissible under the ministerial exception. The Court of Special Appeals held that Lusk\u2019s February 4, 2001 speech, at the annual report to the congregation, was not barred by the ministerial exception and therefore could serve to \u201crescue\u201d her otherwise untimely claims. We do not agree with that holding. The ministerial exception is applicable to a speech in which a pastor (1) informs the congregation of a pending lawsuit that could affect the Church, and (2) proclaims that he or she is innocent of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">It is impossible, however, to hypothesize a religious justification for stabbing a photograph of Respondent with multiple holes through the head, eyes, and chest, and then posting that photograph in the hallway across from her office. This is clearly an act of retaliation to which the \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d test is applicable. Petitioners argue that any act of retaliation that occurred after October 16, 2002 cannot \u201crescue\u201d the claims asserted in Count I and Count III. In <em>Birschtein, supra, </em>the Court of Appeal of California, First Appellate District, rejected a similar argument, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">Defendant argued successfully below, and renews the same contentions here, that Bonillia\u2019s conduct did not amount to actionable sexual harassment or retaliation for two related reasons. First, the alleged conduct falling within the applicable limitations period was not actionable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>because it was not based on plaintiffs gender; that is, was not \u201charassment ... based on sex.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-4\">What began as [ ] overt acts of sexual harassment (asking for dates, the \u201ceat you\u201d remarks, his specifically sexual bathing fantasies) were later transmuted by plaintiffs reaction (her complaints to management about the offensive conduct) into an allegedly daily series of retaliatory acts\u2014 the prolonged campaign of staring at plaintiff\u2014acts that were directly related to, indeed assertedly grew out of, the antecedent unlawful harassment. The <em>Accardi [v. Superior Court, 17 </em>Cal.App.4th 341, 21 Cal.Rptr.2d 292 (1993) ] opinion put the matter convincingly when it characterized such a skein of harassment and complaint followed by retaliatory acts as a \u201ccontinuous manifestation of a sex-based animus.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 351-53. We agree with that analysis, and therefore hold that the continuing violation doctrine is applicable to Respondent\u2019s allegations of (1) sexual harassment that occurred more than two years before she filed her Complaint, and (2) retaliatory actions taken against her that occurred within the period of limitations. We therefore affirm the holding of the Court of Special Appeals that Count I and Count III of Respondent\u2019s Complaint are not barred by limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Counts IV, V, X, XIV and XV</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">We hold that the claims asserted in Counts TV, V, X, XIV and XV would necessarily involve judicial inquiry into church governance, and such an inquiry is prohibited by the First Amendment. The uniform line of cases that are consistent with this holding include <em>Black v. Snyder, supra. </em>In that ease, while holding that the plaintiff was entitled to proceed on her sexual harassment claim, the Minnesota Court of Appeals explained why she was not entitled to proceed on her breach of contract, reprisal, retaliation, and defamation claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-8\">Black\u2019s breach of contract, retaliation, and statutory \u201cwhistle blower\u201d claims relate specifically to factors of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>appointment as an associate pastor and discharge. These claims are fundamentally connected to issues of church doctrine and governance and would require court review of the church\u2019s motives for discharging Black.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-4\">Black\u2019s defamation claim is based on the church\u2019s stated reason for her discharge as \u201cinability to conduct her ministry efficiently.\u201d This claim would require a similar review of the church\u2019s reasons for discharging Black, an essentially ecclesiastical concern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">Black\u2019s discharge by congregational vote, rather than by the synod itself, does not undermine the doctrinal connection. The congregational vote was conducted according to church procedure established in its constitution. Although deference is traditionally afforded to decisions of a hierarchical church\u2019s highest authority, the prohibition against litigating matters at the core of a church\u2019s religious practice requires dismissal of Black\u2019s discharge-related claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">471 N.W.2d at 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">A trial on the merits of the claim asserted in Count IV would necessarily involve an inquiry into the various employment actions taken by the Church, and would therefore \u201cencroach on the ability of a church to manage its internal affairs.\u201d <em>EEOC v.

First they argue that because \u201cemployer\u201d was defined by the M.C.C. as an entity with six or more persons prior to August of 2001,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it would be inconsistent to impose individual liability on a \u201cperson.\u201d Furthermore, the M.C.C. was changed in August 2001 to define \u201cemployer\u201d as \u201canyone who has hired a single individual.\u201d Petitioners also argue that the M.C.C. does not apply to them because, at all times relevant to the case at bar, they did not have the requisite number of employees. Finally, they challenge the constitutionality of Article, 49B, \u00a7 42. None of these arguments were presented to the Circuit Court, so they have not been preserved for appellate review. Petitioners now argue that they are entitled to review of their challenge to the statute on the ground that \u201cthe constitutionality of the statute is jurisdictional in nature.\u201d It is clear, however, that Petitioners\u2019 argument does not involve an issue of \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d i.e., the power of the court to hear a case. They now argue that Article 49B, \u00a7 42 violates their \u201cconstitutional rights\u201d by permitting variation in county laws. In the words of their brief, \u201c[Prince of Peace] with only three employees find themselves subjected to claims and uncapped liability that would not have applied in a vast majority of jurisdictions.\u201d They have waived appellate review of this argument by failing to present it to the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the holding of the Court of Special Appeals that Count I and Count III be remanded for further proceedings against Lusk and the Church, and we reverse the holding that the Circuit Court conduct further proceedings on Counts IV, XIV and XV.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENTS ENTERED BY THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY ON COUNT I AND COUNT III OF RESPONDENT\u2019S COMPLAINT, AND REMAND TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; JUDGMENT OTHERWISE AFFIRMED; 65% OF THE COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONERS; 35% OF SAID COSTS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">BELL, C.J., BATTAGLIA and ADKINS, JJ., concur and dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-5\">.

Although the majority allows Counts I and III to survive after application of the ministerial exception, its broad reading of the exception leads to its rejection of Linklater\u2019s retaliatory firing claim and other counts of her complaint. The majority views the ministerial exception as barring judicial inquiry into any matter involving \u201cchurch governance,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and it defines church governance liberally. Applying this broad standard, it concludes that Linklater\u2019s other counts would \u201cnecessarily involve judicial inquiry into church governance, and such an inquiry is prohibited by the First Amendment.\u201d Maj. Op. at 696, 28 A.3d at 1189. I submit that, in doing so, the majority blazes an unduly broad trail for the ministerial exception, and that the retaliatory discharge count and others should survive its application.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>I disagree with the majority\u2019s rationale in one other significant respect.

Lusk\u2019s February 4, 2001, statements to the congregation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">I. The Ministerial Exception</p>\n<p id=\"AcF\">A. Scope</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The \u201cministerial exception\u201d to antidiscrimination laws typically prohibits state inquiry into religious-based employment decisions by churches and other religious organizations. <em>See Montrose Christian Sch. Corp. v. Walsh, </em>363 Md. 565, 593, 770 A.2d 111, 127 (2001) (holding that a church was entitled to employ only members of its faith). Religious-based employment decisions typically involve the hiring and firing of \u201cministers,\u201d which can also include nonclergy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>This case presents two conflicting values that the ministerial exception must reconcile: churches\u2019 ability to make spiritual decisions autonomously and the need for churches to abide by the \u201cprofound state interest\u201d in assuring equal employment opportunities for all, regardless of sex. <em>EEOC v. Roman Catholic Diocese, </em>213 F.3d 795, 801 (4th Cir.2000); <em>see also Rayburn v. General Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists, </em>772 F.2d 1164, 1169 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The cases upon which the majority relies support the general proposition that many of a church\u2019s employment decisions are insulated from judicial review. Such insulation exists to prevent excessive government intrusion into religious decision making. The majority cites favorably several federal appellate courts explaining, <em>e.g., </em>that \u201cthe constitutional guarantee of religious freedom cannot be construed to protect secular beliefs and behavior, even when they comprise part of an otherwise religious relationship....\u201d Maj. Op. at 687, 28 A.3d at 1184 (citing <em>Sanders v. Casa View Baptist Church, </em>134 F.3d 331, 335-36 (5th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">But the cases do not categorically prevent all government scrutiny of church employment decisions. Instead, they suggest a more nuanced approach, one that insulates decisions from judicial review only when they are rooted in spiritual matters. The majority recognizes this qualification to a degree, holding that the exception cannot preclude sexual harassment claims. Yet it declines to apply the same qualification when considering the retaliation claim. A quick review of the pertinent cases reveals that the limited contour of the ministerial exception does not warrant its application to Petitioner\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\"><em>Bollard v. The California Province of the Society of Jesus, </em>196 F.3d 940 (9th Cir.1999), stands for the principle that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>courts may not inquire into employment decisions if spiritual matters are the motivation behind those decisions. The <em>Bollard </em>court specifically limits its holding to employment decisions made \u201caccording to the dictates of faith and conscience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. The case also recognizes that sex discrimination is impermissible for a religious organization. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">As the majority indicates, <em>Sanders v. Casa View Baptist Church, supra, </em>instructs that the protection afforded to religious relationships has limitations. Protection from judicial inquiry is given to employment decisions \u201cprimarily by preventing the judicial resolution of ecclesiastical disputes turning on matters of \u2018religious doctrine or practice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336. Thus, <em>Sanders </em>makes clear that employment decisions should not be shielded from judicial scrutiny unless they involve spiritual matters, such as religious doctrine or practice. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\"><em>McKelvey v. Pierce, </em>173 N.J. 26, 800 A.2d 840 (2002), and <em>Black v. Snyder, </em>471 N.W.2d 715 (Minn.Ct.App.1991), also cited favorably by the majority, strongly support a limited scope for the ministerial exception. The former case held that to. \u201csweep away all of a minister\u2019s or seminarian\u2019s claims against the church out of fear of encroaching upon the First Amendment\u201d would actually run afoul of the Constitution\u2019s religion clauses. <em>McKelvey, </em>173 N.J. at 52, 800 A.2d 840. The latter case allowed a sexual harassment claim against a church to proceed because it was \u201cunrelated to pastoral qualifications or issues of church doctrine.\u201d <em>Black, </em>471 N.W.2d at 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The majority, in disharmonious fashion, both honors and rejects these precedents. To sustain the sexual harassment claim in Count I, the majority relies upon the rationale of these cases, <em>ie., </em>that religious insulation from the enforcement of antidiscrimination laws must be limited to instances in which the church\u2019s conduct is based on theology or doctrine. Yet when it comes to Linklater\u2019s retaliatory constructive discharge claim in Count IV, the majority reverses course, relying on <em>Black v. Snyder, supra, </em>for the categorical statement that such claims \u201cwould necessarily involve judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>inquiry into church governance, and such an inquiry is prohibited by the First Amendment.\u201d Maj. Op. at 696, 28 A.3d at 1189.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Black, </em>however, the court denied the retaliatory discharge claim because the church proffered as a reason for the discharge the plaintiffs \u201cinability to conduct the pastoral office efficiently in this congregation in view of local conditions\u201d\u2014and it was the church\u2019s proffered reason, not the nature of the claim in general, that would have \u201crequire[d] a similar review of ... an essentially ecclesiastical concern.\u201d 471 N.W.2d at 718-720. Although I am skeptical of the distinction drawn in <em>Black </em>between the sexual harassment claim (allowed) and the retaliatory discharge claim (disallowed), at least the church in <em>Black </em>offered up an arguably doctrinal rationale for her termination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">B. Application</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Here, the Church fired Linklater after she failed to show up for one week. Yet, she asserted that she did so only after the Pastor, in retaliation for her filing charges with the Montgomery County Human Relations Commission and in other formalized channels, refused to give her a job performance evaluation, took unfounded disciplinary actions against her, and conducted a campaign to lower her standing in the eyes of the congregation. The Church, in its argument before this Court, proffers no doctrinal or spiritual basis for these actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The majority also relies on <em>EEOC v. Catholic Univ. of Am., </em>83 F.3d 455, 460 (D.C.Cir.1996), for the proposition that the Free Exercise Clause prohibits governmental action that \u201cencroach[es] on the ability of a church to manage its internal affairs.\u201d Maj. Op. at 685, 28 A.3d at 1183. Notwithstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>its use of such broad language, that case actually applies a narrow version of the ministerial exception to resolve a case of \u201cpastoral appointment determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Furthermore, the majority\u2019s selective citation of <em>EEOC v. Catholic University of America, supra, </em>does not paint a complete picture. The majority states that the ministerial exception \u201cprecludes any inquiry whatsoever into the reasons behind a church\u2019s ministerial employment decision.\u201d Maj. Op. at 697, 28 A.3d at 1190 (citing <em>Roman Catholic Diocese, </em>213 F.3d at 801). But <em>Roman Catholic Diocese </em>also held that \u201cthe exception shelters certain employment decisions from the scrutiny of civil authorities so as to preserve the independence of religious institutions in performing their spiritual functions.\u201d <em>Roman Catholic Diocese, </em>213 F.3d at 801. Again, the finer language in that case demonstrates that the court engaged in a functional analysis, considering whether the church\u2019s decision involved spiritual or doctrinal concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">None of the majority\u2019s cases delineate a ministerial exception as broad as the one that the majority applies in rejecting Linklater\u2019s retaliatory discharge claim. A better approach, based on my study of the cases, is to hold that a court may examine employment claims against a church if they have nothing to do with the spiritual rationale of the ministerial exception. This includes a retaliatory constructive discharge claim if the church does not offer a reason for dismissal related to the \u201cspiritual function\u201d of the church.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Count IV of Respondent\u2019s Complaint, accordingly, survives application of the ministerial exception, as the Church does not assert that it had doctrinal or spiritual grounds for its alleged retaliatory actions. It only argues that the ministerial exception \u201capplies not just to matters of religious scriptures or dogma, but also more broadly to matters of church governance.\u201d Similarly, the Church offers no doctrinal or spiritual basis for the actions for the actions alleged in Count II (Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment), Count V (Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress), Count X (Negligent Retention and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Supervision), Count XIV (Breach of Contract) and Count XV (Breach of Implied Contract).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">If the church had offered a rationale for firing Linklater related to her spiritual functions, that is, her role as the church\u2019s music director, then the ministerial exception would certainly bar judicial review of that employment decision. By requiring a church to proffer that the decision was spiritual in nature, the underlying interests of both employment discrimination statutes and the ministerial exception are served. Here, the church does not argue that there was a doctrinal or spiritual basis for its decision to fire Linklater, and the majority does not even address whether religious doctrine or spiritual church operations were considered in her dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">II. Pastor Lusk\u2019s Speech To The Congregation</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The question of whether the comments contained in the pastor\u2019s speech to the congregation\u2014in which he mentioned the lawsuit, its impact on the congregation, its finances, etc.\u2014 has come into play on appeal because Linklater relied on the speech to bring her claim within the applicable period of limitations under the continuing violation doctrine, in response to the Church\u2019s defense that her claim was barred by limitations. The majority holds that the speech to the congregation is protected speech <em>in its entirety, </em>and therefore inadmissible, but that Linklater\u2019s claim is not barred by limitations (on its face) because she alleges other retaliatory actions that occurred with the two-year limitations period. I agree with the majority that Respondent\u2019s claims are not barred by limitations, but do not agree that the entire speech is protected under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The majority holds that the ministerial exception applies to speech in which a pastor (1) informs the congregation of a pending lawsuit that could affect the church, and (2) proclaims that he or she is innocent of misconduct. Maj. Op. at 695-96, 28 A.3d at 1188-89. I submit that this demarcation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>protective wing of the ministerial exception is overly inclusive, and that in these statements, the pastor spoke and acted outside the range of the exception.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, the majority does not cite, and I have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>not found, any cases suggesting that the discussion of such matters is protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">The majority\u2019s rule is especially perilous because it suggests that simply by adding cursory religious content to a statement, a minister gains unlimited freedom to speak with impunity on almost any subject, protected from Title VII and corresponding state claims, as well as from defamation or other tort claims. This rule could allow an unscrupulous minister to use the pulpit to wage a campaign of continued harassment and defamation, cloaked in but unrelated to doctrine or theology.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Lusk was addressing his congregation during the church\u2019s annual meeting. Lusk\u2019s remarks on Linklater took up approximately half of his entire address to the congregation, and they had a very personal tone. He protested to the entire congregation about Linklater\u2019s claim, singling her out by name. Lusk gave assurances that Linklater\u2019s allegations had \u201cno credence.\u201d He described his own personal and familial stress and called the lawsuit a \u201ccrisis,\u201d a \u201cquagmire,\u201d and a \u201cpersonal trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The content and tone of his speech could reasonably be interpreted as trying to sway congregational opinion against Linklater. Lusk encouraged the congregation to obtain a public-record copy of the Complaint that Linklater filed. He singled out another church member by name for representing Linklater and for \u201cdemanding a $2.5 million settlement,\u201d calling the settlement negotiation \u201cdisturbing.\u201d He even insinuated that Linklater\u2019s claim itself was retaliatory, in that she did not make her allegations until after the church council \u201cexpressed displeasure with her performance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Lusk made it very clear that his motivation for speaking about Linklater was not spiritual in nature. He specifically said that he was not speaking \u201cin worship or teaching.\u201d His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>statement had little to do with church governance or an employment decision. Instead, his remarks could reasonably be perceived as an effort to turn congregational sentiment in his own favor and against Linklater. All of these factors operate to remove his remarks from the shelter of the ministerial exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">For these reasons, I would reach the same result as the majority on Counts I and III, holding that limitations is no bar to Petitioner\u2019s claims. But, I would rely on this speech, in addition to the \u201cphotograph stabbing\u201d conduct relied on by the majority, to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge BATTAGLIA authorize me to state that they join in the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-7\">. Maj. Op. at 692-93, 696, 28 A.3d at 1187, 1189.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-6\">. In addition to Counts I (Sexual Harassment and Hostile Work Environment) and III (Gender Discrimination), I think Counts II (Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment), IV (Retaliatory Harassment and Constructive Discharge), <em>V </em>(Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress), X (Negligent Retention and Supervision), XIV (Breach of Contract), and XV (Breach of Implied Contract) survive proper application of the ministerial exception. Nevertheless, I agree with the majority that Count V does not survive a motion to dismiss because it fails to meet our standards for claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress generally. I do not address whether the other counts have other, possibly fatal, deficiencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\">. Although I consider this point significant, it is not outcome-determinative as to any count. The issue arises on appeal because the statements were offered by Linklater as an instance of retaliatoiy conduct that fell within the period of limitations, thus saving her claims from dismissal on limitations grounds by virtue of the continuing violation doctrine. The majority concludes that other conduct by the pastor suffices to save Linklater\u2019s claims from a limitations defense. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 692-93, 695-96, 28 A.3d at 1189, 1188-89.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b728-8\">.

The relevant portion of Lusk\u2019s remarks follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">\"St. Paul counsels us to speak the truth in love. This has been difficult to do these past nine months since we are in the midst of a legal action by a staff member Mary Linklater that has necessitated the church leadership\u2019s maintaining confidentiality. Nevertheless I need in this forum to speak a word about the troubles of this past year. I don\u2019t talk about this in worship or teaching, but in council and MMC, and here is a place to address the entire congregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">\"I am the interim pastor. I have no intention of outstaying my usefulness to this congregation. I have been sent here by Bishop Schneider to help you with the transition from one called pastor to another. While I may be the interim pastor I am a real pastor and your presiding pastor. I pray for this congregation, I celebrate your joys and share your agonies. I love this congregation and have done the best I know how to preach and teach and pastor this past year.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">\"But I am very concerned about the future of this congregation. We face a budget that has either a $60K or $40K deficit depending upon your actions this afternoon. Moreover, as many of you know, Ms. Linklater has filed a complaint with the Montgomery County Human Rights Commission alleging a hostile work environment and other allegations and naming the council, the MMC, the bishop, Neil Howard and myself. This is a public document and you may request a copy. It should be noted that these allegations were only made after the council and MMC expressed displeasure with her performance. More disturbing, a church member, her attorney of record Alice Johnson, has written a letter demanding a $2.5 million settlement for these supposed allegations, hoping that a significant amount of the money would come from me personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">\"One reason I remain your interim pastor is because of the personal request of your bishop, despite the stress these unfounded allegations have caused me and my family. The bishop has complete faith in my ability to see, you through this crisis knowing full well there is no credence to Ms. Linklater\u2019s allegations against me.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">\"As a member of the nominating committee it was my goal, shared absolutely I believe by all members of the committee to find the best six people in our congregation to lead us out of this quagmire. I believe that we have found those six people, and I would urge you to vote for them while also thanking the other five candidates for their concern and love for Prince of Peace. Whoever you elect today I would hope that the congregation would let the new council do its job in a peaceful fashion. Come to the council when you have business before them, but please let them do their job without micro-managing or trying to intimidate them. Moreover, I would hope that the new council would maintain confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">\"Finally the work of pastoring to the many members of the congregation I have come to know well over the past 15 months, the joy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>welcoming new members into this congregation, and my unfailing commitment, despite this personal trial, to the continuance of this Christian community has deeply enriched my faith.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
