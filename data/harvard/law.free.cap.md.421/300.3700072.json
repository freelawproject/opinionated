State, </em>373 Md. 234, 817 A.2d 241 (2003), namely, whether a defendant, who reveals a prior conviction in his or her direct examination during the defense case-in-chief (knowing that the trial judge ruled <em>in limine </em>that the State will be allowed to impeach him or her with the prior conviction in cross-examination), waives his or her right to appellate review of the trial judge\u2019s <em>in limine </em>ruling. Secondly, this case presents an opportunity to consider the admissibility <em>vel non </em>of a prior arson conviction for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Deltavia Cure (\u201cCure\u201d or \u201cPetitioner\u201d) challenges here the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City), which reasoned in its supporting opinion that, under the plurality opinion in <em>Brown, </em>a defendant who acknowledges, on direct examination in the defense case, the existence of a prior conviction, waives his or her right to appellate review of the trial judge\u2019s prior determination that the conviction may be used by the prosecution for impeachment purposes. Despite holding the issue to be waived, the Court of Special Appeals proceeded to reach the merits of using Cure\u2019s prior conviction for arson as impeachment evidence, explaining that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling <em>in limine </em>that Cure\u2019s prior arson conviction was admissible for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Before this Court, Cure argues generally that, on the issue of waiver, the plurality opinion for the Court in <em>Brown </em>is not controlling because it represented the views of only three of the seven participating judges. Moreover, Cure contends that, knowing the State will be allowed to impeach him if he testifies, \u201cdrawing the sting out\u201d of a prior conviction is a valid trial tactic that serves to further the policies underlying the Rules of Evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Denying a defendant this potential tactical maneuver, by threat of waiver, disadvantages him or her unfairly. Finally, Cure avers that an arson conviction has little impeachment value and, under these facts, fails the balancing test established in Maryland Rule 5-609.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We hold, for reasons to be explained more fully <em>infra, </em>that when a defendant elects to testify and, in doing so, testifies affirmatively on direct examination to the existence of a prior conviction in order to \u201cdraw the sting out\u201d of that conviction, he or she does not waive necessarily his or her right to appellate review of the merits of the trial judge\u2019s prior <em>in limine </em>determination that the prosecution may use the conviction for impeachment purposes. Upon reaching the merits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Cure\u2019s argument vis \u00e1 vis the use of his conviction of arson for impeachment purposes, we hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in ruling that Cure\u2019s prior arson conviction could be used. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">On 14 March 2008, Baltimore City Police arrested and charged Cure with two counts of possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance, two counts of conspiracy to distribute a controlled dangerous substance, and two counts of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance. The arrest followed an investigation by Detective Randolph, who testified that he observed Cure engaging in behavior resembling the dealing of drugs in the 800 block of North Bond Street in Baltimore City. According to Detective Randolph, Cure was wearing a black skull cap, a black sweatshirt with a red design on the back, and blue jeans. Cure testified, however, that at the time of his arrest, he was wearing a white hooded sweatshirt with a black fingernail design and pajama pants. Cure also denied involvement in any drug activity and contended that the police mistook him for someone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">On the first day of his trial, 12 January 2009, Cure moved for a ruling that the prosecution not be allowed to introduce certain of Cure\u2019s prior convictions, should he testify. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Mr. Cure has two prior convictions that could be used to impeach him if he decides to testify. I mean, we haven\u2019t made that decision yet, obviously and so, I mean we would want a hearing as to whether or not the State would be allowed to use those convictions to impeach him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">[COURT]: Well, what are they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So, I didn\u2019t know\u2014one is\u2014they were both when he was a juvenile, but was charged and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>convicted as an adult. One is attempted murder and the other was arson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, actually the State doesn\u2019t believe any attempt falls under\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">[COURT]: Neither do I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">[PROSECUTOR]:\u2014falls under, but there was a, let me, let me back up first, again. There was a conviction separately of first degree arson. The State would like to bring that up and then in that, attempted first degree murder case, there was a conviction for the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">[COURT]: Well, that\u2019s not an impeachable [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: That leaves us with the first degree arson, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">[COURT]: Yeah and the same argument that applies to possession with intent to distribute applies to arson. It\u2019s done secretly, covertly with knowledge that an individual is violating the law. Essentially, it\u2019s the same reasoning. I\u2019d let that in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor, and certainly we would object and my argument would be obviously that the prejudicial effect of an arson would like so inflame the jury that he couldn\u2019t get a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">[COURT]: That may be prejudicial, but in a legal sense, it\u2019s not. Of course, albeit, did that happen within the last 15 years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: It did, Your Honor. I\u2019ll have the exact dates for you in a second.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-13\">[COURT]: Do you agree it happened within the last 15 years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: March of 2001, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-16\">[COURT]: Mm-hmm and all evidence that\u2019s against the defendant is prejudicial. The question is, is it prejudicial in a legal sense and I don\u2019t believe it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-17\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>On the second day of the trial, Cure, knowing of the trial judge\u2019s ruling on his earlier motion <em>in limine </em>regarding use of the arson conviction, elected to testify in his own defense. Prior to testifying, Cure\u2019s attorney advised him on the record of his Fifth Amendment rights, as well as reminding him of the court\u2019s ruling that the arson conviction would be admissible for impeachment purposes during any cross-examination by the prosecutor. The following relevant exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, do you understand that we\u2019ve already had a hearing on this and [the judge] has ruled that if you testify, the State can ask you about your arson conviction, right, and you understand that the jury can take that into consideration not as to whether you\u2019re guilty of this charge or not. However, they can take that into consideration as to whether your testimony is believable or not. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">[PETITIONER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now that you know all of that, do you still want to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">[PETITIONER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">During direct examination, Cure and his defense counsel attempted to \u201cdraw the sting out\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of his prior arson conviction by acknowledging it. The revelation unfolded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, this is not your first brush with the law. In fact, you have a prior conviction; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">[PETITIONER]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And that conviction is for first degree arson; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">[PETITIONER]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: You\u2019re on probation for that right now; aren\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">[PETITIONER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And you served time for that; didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">[PETITIONER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: When was that conviction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-13\">[PETITIONER]: That was\u2014I actually was convicted March the 7th, 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: 2001. How old were you at the time that this alleged offense took place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-16\">[PETITIONER]: I was 16 at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-17\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: You were 16 years old.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-18\">[PETITIONER]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-19\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. So and in fact, you\u2019re on probation to the Violent Offenders Unit\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-20\">[PETITIONER]: Yeah, it\u2019s the Violence Prevention Unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-21\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And what does that mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-22\">[PETITIONER]: Well, basically what it is is people who have been convicted from my understanding, what it is is that people have been convicted of a violent crime, they just implemented this as I believe my PO [Parole Officer] had told me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-23\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-24\">[THE COURT]: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-25\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And how often do you have to report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-26\">[PETITIONER]: Every single week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Every single week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">[PETITIONER]: And call in twice a week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">[PROSECUTOR]:Objeetion. Relevance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">[THE COURT]: Okay. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">During cross-examination, the State did not inquire directly regarding the arson conviction. The only exchange in cross-examination that touched indirectly on the prior arson conviction was in Cure\u2019s response to the prosecution\u2019s questioning about the alleged accomplice (McNeil) in the present case. The exchange was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Sir, how long have you known Mr. McNeil?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\">[PETITIONER]: Well, as you brought up my incarceration, I was locked up for seven and a half years. So I just\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">The jury returned a guilty verdict as to each count against Cure. The trial judge sentenced Cure to three concurrent ten-year terms of incarceration for the convictions for possession with intent to distribute heroin, possession with intent to distribute cocaine, and conspiracy to distribute heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">Cure appealed timely to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the trial court abused its discretion by ruling that he could be impeached with his prior arson conviction. The Court of Special Appeals, in a reported opinion, <em>Cure v. State, </em>195 Md.App. 557, 561, 7 A.3d 145, 147 (2010), and relying upon <em>Brown, </em>held that by introducing the conviction during direct examination, Cure waived his right to appellate review of the trial court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>decision to allow the State to impeach him with the prior arson conviction. <em>See Cure, </em>195 Md.App. at 573, 7 A.3d at 154 (\u201cAs we perceive no reason why the contemporaneous objection rule[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] should be \u2018bent\u2019 in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>we hold that the issue presented by Cure is not preserved for our review.\u201d). The intermediate appellate court, finding ambiguity regarding this Court\u2019s position on the waiver issue due to the \u201cunusual disposition\u201d of <em>Brawn,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>distinguished <em>Brown </em>from <em>Cure\u2019s </em>case. <em>See Cure, </em>195 Md.App. at 571, 7 A.3d at 152. Our appellate colleagues reasoned that, even if they were to hold that Cure\u2019s objection to the <em>in limine </em>ruling that his prior arson conviction would be admissible for impeachment purposes had not been waived through his testimony about it, he failed nonetheless to meet the requirements for an exception to the contemporaneous objection rule under the rationale of the dissent in <em>Brown. See Cure, </em>195 Md.App. at 572, 7 A.3d at 153 (\u201cThe record before us, however, does not reflect that the defense renewed its objection to the court\u2019s ruling of the previous day that the State could impeach Cure with the prior arson conviction, or that <em>the trial court </em>affirmed its earlier ruling.\u201d (footnote omitted)). The appellate court found significant: (1) Cure did not renew his objection to the admittance of the conviction on the day of his testimony; (2) the defense elicited more information about the conviction than simply its existence; and (3) the prosecution did not mention the conviction directly during cross-examination of Cure and, therefore, concluded that it was \u201cpersuaded that the facts in the present case are sufficiently distinguishable from those in <em>Brown.\u201d Cure, </em>195 Md.App. at 573, 7 A.3d at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Even though the Court of Special Appeals held that Cure waived his right to appellate review of the admissibility of his conviction for impeachment purposes, the panel (as appellate courts are wont to do frequently as an exercise in completeness and \u201cbelt and suspenders\u201d support of its judgment) addressed the merits of the issue, stating that, \u201calthough a prior arson conviction is no longer admissible <em>per se </em>on the grounds that it is an \u2018infamous crime,\u2019 the fact that it is an \u2018infamous crime\u2019 in and of itself indicates that it is germane to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>a witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Cure, </em>195 Md.App. at <em>581, 7 </em>A.3d at 159. The Court concluded: \u201cAccordingly, we reject Cure\u2019s contention that \u2018the impeachment value of an arson conviction is virtually non-existent.\u2019 Rather, the impeachment value is assumed by virtue of the fact that it is an \u2018infamous crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the panel of the intermediate appellate court stated that, waiver aside, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to rule that Cure\u2019s arson conviction would be admissible for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Cure filed timely a petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted, <em>Cure v. State, </em>418 Md. 190, 13 A.3d 798 (2011), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">(1) When the trial court ruled prior to jury selection that the State could impeach Mr. Cure with his prior conviction for first-degree arson, did Mr. Cure waive his right to complain on appeal about the Court\u2019s ruling by testifying about the conviction during his direct examination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">(2) Did the trial court abuse its discretion when it ruled that the State could impeach Mr. Cure with his prior conviction for first-degree arson?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">For reasons to be explained more fully <em>infra, </em>we hold that, on this record, Cure did not waive his ability to seek appellate review of the trial judge\u2019s ruling that the prior conviction for arson may be used potentially for impeachment purposes. On the merits of Cure\u2019s argument regarding the impeachment value of a prior arson conviction, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing use of Cure\u2019s prior arson conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">I. <em>Waiver.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">In <em>Ohler v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 753, 120 S.Ct. 1851, 146 L.Ed.2d 826 (2000), the United States Supreme Court addressed whether a defendant\u2019s \u201cdrawing the sting out\u201d of a prior conviction by testifying regarding the conviction on direct examination amounts to waiver of appellate review of the conviction\u2019s admissibility for impeachment purposes. Maria Ohler was charged with the importation of and possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>with intent to distribute marijuana. <em>Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 754-55, 120 S.Ct. at 1852, 146 L.Ed.2d at 829. The Government filed pre-trial motions seeking an <em>in limine </em>ruling on whether Ohler\u2019s prior conviction for possession of methamphetamine could be used as either character or impeachment evidence. <em>See Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 755, 120 S.Ct. at 1852, 146 L.Ed.2d at 829. Although the federal district court ruled that the conviction would not be allowed as character evidence, it held that the conviction could be used as impeachment evidence. <em>Id. </em>Upon direct examination during the defense case-in-chief, presumably to \u201cdraw the sting out\u201d of the conviction, Ohler testified regarding her prior conviction. <em>See id. </em>Ultimately, she was convicted on both of the marijuana counts. <em>Id. </em>Ohler appealed on the ground that it was improper for her prior conviction for possession to be used as impeachment evidence. <em>Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 755, 120 S.Ct. at 1852-53, 146 L.Ed.2d at 829-30. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that, by testifying to the conviction under direct examination, Ohler waived the issue for appellate review. <em>Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 755, 120 S.Ct. at 1853, 146 L.Ed.2d at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">In a five-to-four decision, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the issue was waived on appeal, reasoning that, \u201c[generally, a party introducing evidence cannot complain on appeal that the evidence was erroneously admitted.\u201d <em>Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 755, 120 S.Ct. at 1853, 146 L.Ed.2d at 830. The Court also rejected Ohler\u2019s argument that applying the waiver rule in this situation \u201ccompels a defendant to forgo the tactical advantage of pre-emptively introducing the conviction in order to appeal the <em>in limine </em>ruling,\u201d explaining that, ultimately, both sides must make many strategic choices during trial. <em>Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 757, 120 S.Ct. at 1853, 146 L.Ed.2d at 830-31; <em>see Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 757, 120 S.Ct. at 1854, 146 L.Ed.2d at 831 (\u201cWhatever the merits of these contentions, they tend to obscure the fact that both the Government and the defendant in a criminal trial must make choices as the trial progresses.\u201d). To highlight this particular tactical crossroads, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">The defendant must choose whether to introduce the conviction on direct examination and remove the sting or take her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>chances with the prosecutor\u2019s possible elicitation of the conviction on cross-examination. The Government too, in a case such as this, must make a choice. If the defendant testifies, it must choose whether or not to impeach her by use of her prior conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-5\"><em>Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 758, 120 S.Ct. at 1851, 146 L.Ed.2d at 831. Finally, the Court reasoned that, as held in <em>Luce v. United States, </em>469 U.S. 38, 105 S.Ct. 460, 83 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c[o]nly when the government exercises its option to elicit the testimony is an appellate court confronted with a case where, under the normal rules of trial, the defendant can claim the denial of a substantial right if in fact the district court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>ruling proved to be erroneous.\u201d <em>Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 759, 120 S.Ct. at 1854-55, 146 L.Ed.2d at 832. The Court concluded: \u201cFor these reasons, we conclude that a defendant who preemptively introduces evidence of a prior conviction on direct examination may not on appeal claim that the admissions of such evidence was error.\u201d <em>Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 760, 120 S.Ct. at 1855, 146 L.Ed.2d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Justice Souter\u2019s dissent rejected the Majority\u2019s reliance upon <em>Luce. See Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 761, 120 S.Ct. at 1856, 146 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>L.Ed.2d at 833 (Souter, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In contrast to the defendant in <em>Luce, </em>Ohler testified in her defense. <em>Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 755, 120 S.Ct. at 1852, 146 L.Ed.2d at 829. Whereas the harm in <em>Luce </em>was purely speculative, in <em>Ohler, </em>because the defendant testified, there was \u201ca factual record on which Ohler\u2019s claim can be reviewed ... and there is no question that the <em>in limine </em>ruling controlled her counsel\u2019s decision to enquire about the earlier conviction.\u201d <em>Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 761, 120 S.Ct. at 1856, 146 L.Ed.2d at 833. For this reason, the dissent explained \u201cthe case raises none of the practical difficulties on which <em>Luce </em>turned, and <em>Luce </em>does not dictate today\u2019s result.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The main thrust of Justice Souter\u2019s dissent addressed the Majority\u2019s stance that \u201cthere is nothing \u2018unfair\u2019 ... about putting petitioner to her choice in accordance with the normal rules of trial.\u201d <em>Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 763, 120 S.Ct. at 1857, 146 L.Ed.2d at 834-35. Justice Souter argued that \u201c[a]ny claim of a new rule\u2019s fairness under normal trial conditions will have to stand or fall on how well the rule would serve the objects that trials in general, and the Rules of Evidence in particular, are designed to achieve.\u201d <em>Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 763, 120 S.Ct. at 1857, 146 L.Ed.2d at 835. The Rules are structured, Justice Souter averred, to facilitate the pursuit of truth rather than to outline particular trial strategies. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cThe question is not which side gains a tactical advantage, but which rule assists in uncovering the truth.\u201d). \u201cDrawing the sting out\u201d of a prior conviction is, therefore, a valid trial tactic because of the prejudicial effect that might result if a defendant was perceived as concealing the full truth.

Although <em>Ohler </em>is binding on federal courts, it is not binding on state courts because the waiver issue does not implicate federal constitutional principles that are mandatory upon state courts. <em>See Danforth v.

At the close of the State\u2019s case, Brown argued to the trial judge that the prior conviction should not be admissible as impeachment evidence, as the risk of unfair prejudice outweighed its probative value. <em>Brown, 373 </em>Md. at 236, 817 A.2d at 242. The trial court disagreed. <em>Id. </em>Following this ruling,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">Petitioner elected to testify on his own behalf. During his direct examination, petitioner admitted that he had been convicted of the criminal offense of possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance.

Only two other judges share that view, however. I disagree with it, as do Chief Judge Bell and Judge Eldridge.

I disagree with that as well; so do Chief Judge Bell and Judges Eldridge and Raker. When coupled with Judge Raker\u2019s view that petitioner\u2019s complaint was waived, however, Judge Harrell\u2019s conclusion as to admissibility suffices to create four votes to affirm the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\"><em>Brown, </em>373 Md. at 251-52, 817 A.2d at 251-252. This \u201cpeculiar setting\u201d is what the Court of Special Appeals identified here as creating ambiguity in the ultimate holding of the Court, and merits us revisiting the question of whether a defendant waives his or her right to appellate review of the admissibility of a prior conviction for impeachment purposes when, under direct examination in the defense case, he or she attempts to \u201cdraw the sting out\u201d of the conviction by \u201cconfessing\u201d to that conviction before the State has the opportunity to confront him or her.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Judge Raker\u2019s opinion (announcing the judgment of the Court) began by relying on the long-settled general proposition in Maryland law that \u201ca party introducing evidence cannot complain on appeal that the evidence was erroneously admitted.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>373 Md. at 238, 817 A.2d at 243 (citations omitted). She then discussed <em>Ohler, </em>stating: \u201cAlthough not binding on this Court, we agree with the majority\u2019s reasoning in <em>Ohler.\u201d Brown, </em>373 Md. at 239, 817 A.2d at 244. The opinion bolstered its stance by citing dicta from <em>Johnson v. State, </em>9 Md.App. 166, 177, 263 A.2d 232, 239 (1970), <em>overruled on others grounds by Bailey v.

Finally, Judge Raker explained that, because the defense made no objection during direct examination of the defendant, its position \u201cruns counter to the requirement in Maryland for a contemporaneous objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>tion to the admission of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plurality held ultimately \u201cthat petitioner may not now complain that the evidence that he introduced himself in his direct testimony was not admissible.

Recognizing the particular challenges associated with admitting evidence impeaching a criminal defendant, Judge Wilner noted that \u201c[l]ay people, and, I expect, even lawyers may have considerable difficulty in putting what they regard as logic and common experience aside and treat this powerful experiential evidence as affecting only one\u2019s credibility as a witness.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>373 Md. at 260, 817 A.2d at 256. The fact that evidence introduced solely for the purpose of impeaching credibility may be misused easily by the fact-finder as substantive evidence, the <em>Brown </em>dissent argued, is an impairment to the jury\u2019s role at trial. Crediting Justice Souter, Judge Wilner wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">\u201cCreating such an impression of current deceit by concealment is very much at odds with any purpose behind Rule 609, being obviously antithetical to dispassionate factfinding in support of a sound conclusion,\u201d that the chance to create that impression may be a tactical advantage for the Government but \u201cdisserves the search for truth\u201d and that allowing the defendant to draw the sting promotes the fairness of trial without depriving the Government \u201cof anything to which it is entitled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number><em>Brown, </em>373 Md. at 265, 817 A.2d at 259 (quoting <em>Ohler, </em>529 U.S. at 764, 120 S.Ct. at 1857, 146 L.Ed.2d at 835). The dissent, noting the \u201cstrong tide\u201d of state courts\u2019 opposition to <em>Ohler, </em>concluded that \u201c[t]he Federal courts, of course, are bound by <em>Ohler, </em>but we are not, and although we necessarily give any decision of the United States Supreme Court great respect, there is good reason not to give this one very much weight.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>373 Md. at 265, 817 A.2d at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Rather than abandoning the contemporaneous objection rule, however, Judge Wilner proposed a narrow exception. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">I would adhere generally to the contemporaneous objection rule, because it is a useful rule. I would bend it in this situation, however, because, when rigidly applied, it fails to serve the ends of either fairness or the search for truth. Bending it in this limited setting advances the cause of justice and creates no problem, either for the courts or for the State. The limited setting is where (1) the State makes clear that it intends to offer the conviction[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] if the defendant testifies, (2) the defendant makes a clear objection to the evidence, (3) the court makes a definitive ruling, intended to be final, that the evidence will be admitted, and (4) the defendant testifies and, to blunt the force of the conviction, reveals it on direct examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-7\"><em>Brown, </em>373 Md. at 266, 817 A.2d at 260. We now adopt the reasoning of Justice Souter\u2019s dissent in <em>Ohler </em>and Judge Wilner\u2019s dissent in <em>Brown. </em>For purposes of <em>stare decisis, </em>we note this is a proposition that garnered the support of four Judges in <em>Brown </em>(the three dissenting Judges and myself). Further, we hold that, in the limited setting delineated by Judge Wilner, by \u201cdrawing the sting out\u201d of a conviction by testifying about the conviction on direct examination during the defense case, knowing that the court will admit the prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>conviction for the limited use of impeachment, a defendant does not waive his or her right to appellate review of the admissibility ruling on the use of that conviction for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Applying to the present case the four prongs discussed in the <em>Brown </em>dissent, we observe that the prosecutor stated explicitly that \u201c[t]he State would like to bring that up\u201d (referring to the arson conviction), satisfying the first prong. As to the second prong, defense counsel made a clear objection during argument on the motion <em>in limine, </em>stating \u201cYes, Your Honor, and certainly we would object\u201d to the trial judge\u2019s ruling \u201cI\u2019d let [the prior arson conviction] in.\u201d Fulfilling the third prong, the court made an unequivocal and definitive ruling allowing the use of the prior arson conviction for impeachment, but not the prior attempted murder conviction, offering nothing that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the trial judge would reconsider his decision on the motion. Moreover, when defense counsel advised Cure, before he elected to testify, that his prior conviction would be admissible for impeachment purposes, the trial court made no attempt to revisit the issue. Finally, satisfying the fourth prong, Cure testified to the conviction under direct examination in the defense case-in-chief in an obvious attempt to blunt its force.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, we conclude Cure did not waive the opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>nity to seek appellate review of the admissibility of his prior arson conviction for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">II. <em>Impeachment with a Prior Conviction for Arson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">When reviewing the admissibility ruling for impeachment purposes regarding a defendant\u2019s prior conviction, \u201cwe will give great deference to the [trial] court\u2019s opinion.

Westpoint, </em>404 Md. 455, 477-78, 947 A.2d 519, 532-33 (2008) (quoting <em>State v. Giddens, </em>335 Md. 205, 213-14, 642 A.2d 870, 874 (1994)), we explained the analytical framework of appellate consideration of a ruling made under Rule 5-609:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6g\">First, subsection (a) sets forth the \u201celigible universe\u201d for what convictions may be used to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility. This universe consists of two categories: (1) \u201cinfamous crimes\u201d and (2) \u201cother crimes relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d Infamous crimes include treason, common law felonies, and other offenses classified generally as <em>crimen falsi. </em>If a crime does not fall within one of the two categories, then it is inadmissible and the analysis ends. This threshold question of whether or not a crime bears upon credibility is a matter of law. If a crime falls within one of the two categories in the eligible universe, then the second step is for the proponent to establish that the conviction was not more than 15 years old, that it was not reversed on appeal, and that it was not the subject of a pardon or a pending appeal. Finally, in order to admit a prior conviction for impeachment purposes, the trial court must determine that the probative value of the prior conviction outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the witness or objecting party. This third step is clearly a matter of trial court discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The parties do not dispute that arson originated as a common-law felony. <em>See Robinson v. State, 4 </em>Md.App. 515, 523 n. 3, 243 A.2d 879, 884 n. 3 (1968) (\u201cThe common law felonies were murder, manslaughter, robbery, rape, burglary, larceny, arson, sodomy and mayhem.\u201d). Because arson was a common-law felony\u2014a subsection of \u201cinfamous crimes\u201d\u2014it therefore falls within the \u201celigible universe\u201d of crimes that are admissible potentially for impeachment, meeting the first requirement under Rule 5-609.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The second touchstone is that the date of the prior conviction must be less than \u201cfifteen years old,\u201d and has not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>reversed, pardoned, or the subject of an open appeal. In the present case, Cure was convicted of arson in March of 2001, and the parties do not dispute that the March 2001 conviction was the final disposition of that case. Because the trial in the present case was held on 12-13 January 2009\u2014a period of approximately 8 years after the prior conviction became final\u2014this factor is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The third requirement is a balancing test, where \u201cthe court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the witness or the objecting party.\u201d Md. Rule 5\u2014609(a)(2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In order to balance the probative value of information that relates to a witness\u2019s credibility on one hand, with the danger of a prior conviction igniting unfair prejudice against the defendant on the other hand, we use typically five non-exhaustive factors, namely: \u201c(1) the impeachment value of the prior crime; (2) the point in time of the conviction and the defendant\u2019s subsequent history; (3) the similarity between the past crime and the [current] charged crime; (4) the importance of the defendant\u2019s testimony; and (5) the centrality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the defendant\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>340 Md. at 717, 668 A.2d at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Cure argues generally that the trial court abused its discre-' tion by ruling that it would allow the use of Cure\u2019s prior arson conviction for impeachment purposes, explaining that \u201cthe impeachment value of an arson conviction is virtually nonexistent as it does not reflect adversely on a person\u2019s honesty.\u201d As the argument goes, because arson is not probative of credibility, the probative value of a prior arson conviction will be outweighed in most cases by the potential to kindle unfair prejudice in the fact-finder. The State, on the other hand, argues generally that \u201c[b]oth the plain language and the historical background of Rule 5-609 contemplates that infamous crimes\u2014no matter the specific type\u2014are necessarily relevant to the witness\u2019s veracity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">1. <em>Impeachment Value.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">At common law, a convicted felon was barred completely from testifying. <em>See Giddens, </em>335 Md. at 214, 642 A.2d at 874 (\u201cAt common law, one who had been convicted of treason, any felony, a misdemeanor involving dishonesty, or crimes relating to the obstruction of justice, was considered incompetent to testify at any trial.\u201d (citations omitted)).

Under the common law, for a defendant to be convicted for arson, \u201cthe State had to establish four elements: (1) that the building burned was a dwelling house or outbuilding within the curtilage; (2) that the building burned was occupied by another; (3) that the building was actually burned, as mere scorching would not suffice; and, (4) that the accused\u2019s <em>mens rea </em>was willful and malicious.\u201d <em>Holbrook, </em>364 Md. at 367, 772 A.2d at 1247 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>By the time of Cure\u2019s conviction, first-degree arson had been codified for some time as a crime under Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That provision read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">(a) In general.\u2014A person may not willfully and maliciously set fire to or burn a dwelling or occupied structure, whether the property of the person or another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">(b) Penalty.\u2014A person who violates this section is guilty of the felony of arson in the first degree and on conviction is subject to a fine of not more than $50,000 or imprisonment for not more than 30 years or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Art. 27 \u00a7 6.

State, </em>195 Md.App. at 581-82, 7 A.3d at 159.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Because the Rules recognize that an infamous crime is \u201crelevant to [a] witness\u2019s credibility,\u201d such a conviction must have some impeachment value. <em>See, e.g., Jackson, </em>340 Md. at 729, 668 A.2d at 20 (Bell, J., dissenting) (\u201cWhere the prior conviction is for an infamous crime or one affecting credibility, the first factor invariably will favor admissibility.\u201d). The first prong of the balancing test in the present case weighs in favor of admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">2. <em>The Period Between the Prior Conviction and Impeachment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">It is well-settled that the more recent a conviction, the more probative value it has for purposes of impeachment. <em>See, e.g., Bane v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 135, 146, 533 A.2d 309, 314-15 (1987) (\u201cAs a general rule, the f[ur]ther in the past the crime, the weaker its relevance to present credibility.\u201d); <em>Jackson, </em>340 Md. at 731, 668 A.2d at 21 (Bell, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe rule also recognizes, if only by negative implication, that the more recent the conviction the more probative its impeachment value.\u201d). The eight-year period between Cure\u2019s arson conviction and the ruling in 2009 as to its use as impeachment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>evidence at the trial, being roughly half way to Rule 5-609(b)\u2019s fifteen-year outside limit, results in a neutral weight under the second prong. <em>See Fulp v. </em>State, 130 Md.App. 157, 168, 745 A.2d 438, 444 (2000) (holding that \u201c[t]he second factor is relatively neutral\u201d where \u201c[t]he conviction for assault with intent to murder occurred eight years previously, <em>ie., </em>not exactly ancient history, yet not recent either\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">3. <em>The Similarity Between the Prior Conviction and the Crime Charged Now.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The third consideration\u2014the similarity between the past crime and the charged crime\u2014weighs in favor of admissibility in the present case. This Court has explained that \u201c[t]his risk of prejudice is particularly great where the crime for which the defendant is on trial is identical or similar to the crime of which he has previously been convicted.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>340 Md. at 716, 668 A.2d at 13. As we stated in <em>Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. 701, 703, 436 A.2d 906, 908 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">Where the crime for which the defendant is on trial is identical or similar to the crime for which he has been previously convicted the danger is greater, as the jury may conclude that because he did it before he most likely has done it again. The net effect of such evidence is often to discourage the defendant from taking the stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Cure admits, and we agree that \u201c[a]rson and drug-related offenses are admittedly not similar crimes, and the prior arson conviction would obviously have been more prejudicial if Mr. Cure had been on trial for arson or for malicious burning.\u201d Because the prior arson conviction and the drug charge are dissimilar wholly, the prejudicial impact is reduced. The third consideration therefore weighs in favor of allowing the State to use the arson conviction for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">4 &amp; 5. <em>The Importance of the Defendant\u2019s Testimony and the Centrality of the Defendant\u2019s Credibility.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">The fourth and fifth considerations, weigh clearly here in favor of admissibility. In <em>Jackson, </em>340 at 721, 668 A.2d at 16, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Factors four and five are restatements of the considerations that underlie the Rule: balancing the defendant\u2019s right to testify against the State\u2019s right to impeach the witness on cross-examination. Where credibility is the central issue, the probative value of the impeachment is great, and thus weighs heavily against the danger of <em>unfair </em>prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIb\">(Internal citations omitted.) Cure\u2019s defense of misidentification, as well as the conflicting reports about his attire, make his credibility central to the case. One of the critical considerations the jury had to contemplate was the question of whom to believe\u2014Cure or the identifying detective. Cure\u2019s testimony, which amounted to the bulk of his defense, made \u201ccredibility ... the central issue\u201d in the case, and, therefore, factors four and five weigh heavily in favor of admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">At bottom, the question is whether the trial judge <em>abused his discretion </em>when he applied the balancing test to determine whether the probative value of the use of Cure\u2019s prior arson conviction for impeachment evidence outweighed the potential for prejudice in using the prior conviction. As this Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">[I]f the trial judge, in the exercise of his discretion, feels that the prior conviction rationally carries probative value on the issue of truth and veracity of the witness, ... the evidence [should] be admitted. Such exercise of discretion will be accorded every reasonable presumption of correctness and will not be upset except in a clear case of abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap4\"><em>Prout v. State, </em>311 Md. 348, 363-64, 535 A.2d 445, 452 (1988). We cannot say, as a matter of law, that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing use of Cure\u2019s prior arson conviction. The first prong was in favor of admissibility at least marginally, the second factor was neutral, and the third, fourth, and fifth weighed in favor of admissibility. Therefore, we afford the trial court due deference and hold that it was not an abuse of discretion to rule that Cure\u2019s prior conviction for arson was available to the State as impeachment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\">. <em>See infra, </em>Op. at 314-16, 26 A.3d at 907-08.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b336-10\">. <em>See Brown v.

The State contends that Cure\u2019s testimony went beyond mentioning merely the conviction and, thus, went into more depth than the State would have been permitted to do on cross-examination. Specifically, defense counsel asked: two questions about the nature and existence of the conviction; two questions about Cure\u2019s age at the time of the conviction; one question about the date of the conviction; one question about whether he served jail time; and five questions about the terms of his probation. The State avers that it would not have been permitted to inquire into the details surrounding the conviction in its case-in-chief and, consequently, Cure\u2019s voluntary testimony about details beyond the reach of the State constitutes waiver of a challenge to the admissibility of the conviction. This argument is not compelling. The State's interest in impeachment was satisfied by Cure admitting in front of the jury that he was a convicted felon. By testifying affirmatively to his prior arson conviction, Cure had the opportunity to frame the damaging admission in as positive a light as possible. A review of the transcript reveals that all ten of the questions posed to Cure by defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>counsel were aimed at this underlying purpose of blunting the force of the conviction by divulging jail time served, the terms of his probation, and stressing his age at the time of conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\">.

Prior to the 1929 codification of the crime of arson, <em>see infra </em>note 14, the Legislature expanded the common law definition to include the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>burning of one's own dwelling. <em>See Richmond v. State, </em>326 Md. 257, 263, 604 A.2d 483, 486 (1992) (\"In 1904, the General Assembly slightly expanded upon the common law definition of arson by making illegal the burning of one\u2019s own dwelling house if the intent in burning it was to injure or defraud.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b355-10\">. This Court explained: \"The first substantive attempt to codify the elements of the crime of arson occurred in 1929. Ch. 255, \u00a7 6 of the Acts of 1929.\u201d <em>Richmond, </em>326 Md. at 263, 604 A.2d at 486.

First degree arson thus has remained largely unchanged substantively since 1929.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b355-11\">. Cure seeks to re-characterize arson by analogy to battery, claiming that both are crimes of violence with a wide range of behavior that could yield convictions. <em>See State v. Duckett, </em>306 Md. 503, 510-11, 510 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>A.2d 253, 257 (1986) (stating that \"the types of offenses which fall within the ambit of the crime of battery vary widely\u201d and holding that \"[b]y the name of the crime battery, then, the conduct of the witness is unknown; thus nothing can be shown concerning the probable veracity of the witness\u201d). This argument ignores the severity and historical underpinnings of common law arson. As this Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auf\">ARSON, <em>ab ardendo, </em>is the malicious and wilful burning of the house or outhouses of another man. This is an offence of very great malignity, and much more pernicious to the public than simple theft: because, first, it is an offence against that right, of habitation, which is acquired by the law of nature as well as by the laws of society; next, because of the terror and confusion that necessarily attends it; and, lastly, because in simple theft the thing stolen only changes it\u2019s [sic] master, but still remains <em>in esse </em>for the benefit of the public, whereas by burning the very substance is absolutely destroyed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3v\"><em>Richmond, </em>326 Md. at 264, 604 A.2d at 486-87 (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 220). First-degree arson is not simply a \"crime of violence perpetrated against property\u201d as Cure insists, but rather, \"in keeping with its common law roots, first degree arson is a crime against habitation, not persons or property.\u201d <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>364 Md. 354, 372, <em>772 </em>A.2d 1240, 1250 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\">. As noted, first-degree arson is the burning of either an occupied structure or a dwelling (either occupied or unoccupied). The statute contains this distinction in recognition of the fact that a structure adapted for overnight habitation, i.e., a dwelling, is more likely to have people present than a building which lacks overnight accommodation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\">. We recognize, as the Court of Special Appeals did, that certain infamous crimes may have a greater bearing upon the credibility of the defendant than others. That is, a conviction for first-degree arson is not <em>admissible per se, </em>but it is <em>relevant per se </em>to a witness\u2019s credibility. Of course, this relevance must then be placed on the scale with the other factors in order for the trial judge to weigh the probative value against the prejudicial impact of admitting the conviction for impeachment purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
