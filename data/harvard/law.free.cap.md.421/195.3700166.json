Northam, Respondent, of second degree murder and first degree assault. The State\u2019s case, which included evidence of post-arrest inculpatory statements that Respondent made to law enforcement officers and to two former cell mates, was sufficient to establish that he committed those offenses in the early morning hours of January 13, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">Respondent noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and filed a brief in which he presented five questions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>appellate review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the first one being \u201c[w]hether the trial court erred by not addressing [Respondent\u2019s] discharge of counsel, as required by Maryland Rule 4\u2014215(e)[?]\u201d After the Court of Special Appeals held that Respondent was entitled to a new trial on the ground that the Circuit Court had failed to comply with the requirements of Maryland Rule' 4-215(e), the State filed a petition for writ of certiorari that presented the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">Did the Court of Special Appeals misapply this Court\u2019s precedent when it determined that a Maryland Rule 4-215(e) inquiry was required even though no one brought to the court\u2019s attention in open court that the defendant had any desire to discharge his appointed public defender?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">We granted that petition. 415 Md. 337, 1 A.3d 467 (2010). For the reasons that follow, we hold that Respondent is not entitled to a new trial on the ground that the Circuit Court \u201cviolated Maryland [R]ule 4-215(e).\u201d We shall therefore remand this case to the Court of Special Appeals, so that Court can address the merits of Respondent\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Respondent was arrested on January 22, 2008, and was served with a District Court Statement of Charges on January 23, 2008. The District Court ordered that Respondent be held without bail, advised Respondent of his right to a preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>hearing, and noted that Respondent requested a preliminary hearing. The District Court scheduled a preliminary hearing for February 21, 2008, at 9:00 a.m. On January 28, 2008, Assistant Public Defender W. Burton Anderson entered his appearance on Respondent\u2019s behalf. Respondent was indicted on February 12, 2008. At all times relevant to the issue before us, he was incarcerated in the Worcester County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">On February 26, 2008, Respondent wrote the following letter to the Clerk of the Circuit Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">Feb 26, 2008</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">Dear Clerk of the Circuit Court</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">I am dropping my public defender.

This letter was written on the front and back of a single piece of paper, and was received in damaged condition\u2014the bottom portion of the paper had been tom. The following was written on the front of the paper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">Feb 27, 2008</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-12\">Hi my name is Kendall Irin Northam and I have a high profile case wich [sic] I don\u2019t have anyone to represent me.

Eschenburg presided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">THE COURT: Mr. Northam, the only reason you had to be in court today is because there hasn\u2019t been any lawyer enter his or her appearance to represent you in this case.

As a matter of fact, he will I know. He\u2019s been a public defender a long time and handled a lot of murder cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">THE DEFENDANT: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">MR. ANDERSON: If I may address the Court. Mr. Northam, we met at the Worcester County Detention Center probably within 10 days of your arrest. And my intentions at that time were really just to come down, introduce myself to you, to meet you, to let you meet me, and the relationship that an attorney has with a client is ongoing and not a one time meeting. In assuming the responsibilities of your lawyer I will be meeting with you many, many times ... So whatever feelings you had about the inadequacy of our first introductory meeting I want to assure you that we will have an ongoing process as a client and lawyer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">THE COURT: All right. You understand the way this works is if for some reason, you have to have a reason that you don\u2019t want Mr. Anderson to personally represent you[,] that he\u2019s going to appoint somebody else from his office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">APPELLANT: I don\u2019t want none of them to represent me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqE\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t get to pick a dream team and have me appoint them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">APPELLANT: I understand that, but I mean, there\u2019s a difference between a public defender and a lawyer, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">THE COURT: No, in other words\u2014I knew you were going to ask that, you want a real lawyer, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-12\">APPELLANT: Yeah, a real lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-13\">THE COURT: Yeah, a real lawyer. Well, Mr. Anderson is a real lawyer ... Mr. Anderson is a lawyer who has tried more murder cases in this county than everybody else <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>probably combined.

If you and he still don\u2019t see eye to eye I imagine he\u2019ll appoint somebody else. You better think about it, it\u2019s up to you though.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The following day, Mr. Anderson entered his appearance on Respondent\u2019s behalf, and represented Respondent at a July 9, 2008 motions hearing at which the Honorable Thomas C. Groton, III, presided. The following transpired at the beginning of this hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">THE PROSECUTOR: K-08-055. State versus Kendall Northam. Your Honor, it\u2019s my understanding based on conversations with defense counsel yesterday that the issues he\u2019s raising deal with the constitutionality of the interrogation of the Defendant as well as probable cause for the Defendant\u2019s arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">THE COURT: All right. Is that correct, Mr. Anderson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQC\">MR. ANDERSON: Yes, sir. And good morning. I\u2019m here with the Defendant at the Court\u2019s trial table, and we are prepared to proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">On July 18, 2008, the Clerk of the Circuit Court filed a letter in which Respondent made the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">K-08-0055</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">To whom this may concern:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-13\">I\u2019m asking for a motion to have a change of venue do [sic] to circumstances below please Reply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-14\">Deeply Concern</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aom\">Kendall I.

Rule 1-323, the Clerk of the Circuit Court sent copies to the State\u2019s Attorney and to the Court. The record shows that the State\u2019s \u201cRESPONSE TO MOTION FOR CHANGE OF VENUE\u201d was filed on July 30, 2008, and the record includes an ORDER OF COURT signed and filed on July 31, 2008 in which Judge Groton ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">The Motion for Change of Venue, and response thereto having been duly read and considered, it is this 31st day of July, 2008 ORDERED that the Motion be, and hereby is DENIED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">On September 4, 2008, the Clerk of the Circuit Court filed a Motion in which Respondent stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">September 1, 2008</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">In the Matter of * In the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">Kendall Irin Northam * Circuit Court</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-12\">* For</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-13\">For a Change of Venue * Worcester County</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-14\">* Case No:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-15\">* 2S-K-08-000055</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-16\">*My case has been publicized in all the Local Counties on all Local News Media and Local Newspapers.

Northam</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The docket entries show that this Motion was denied in a ruling filed on September 11, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">A pretrial hearing in Respondent\u2019s case was held on September 12, 2008, with Judge Groton presiding. The first issue discussed at this hearing involved one Mr. Johnson, a State\u2019s witness who had once been represented by Mr. Anderson. The following transpired after the prosecutor advised the Court that the State had no objection to the witness being cross-examined by Mr. Anderson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">THE COURT: Okay. Have you had an opportunity to discuss this with your client, Mr. Anderson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">MR. ANDERSON: Yes, I met with him at the detention center and discussed it with him in detail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">THE COURT: And is it your client\u2019s position that he wants you to cross-examine Mr. Johnson, or does he want Mr. Abu-Zaid to cross-examine Mr. Johnson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-11\">MR. ANDERSON: Well, we haven\u2019t discussed that. I met with him, then spoke with Mr Townsend, and then, again, we were with you on Wednesday afternoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-12\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>MR. ANDERSON: Again, so it\u2019s for a very short period of time that this is unfolding. But that\u2019s something he and I will discuss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The following docket entries were made after this hearing had concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">09/12/08</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">Judge Thomas C.

Burton Anderson, Esq. a copy of the State\u2019s plea agreement with Mr. Justice pursuant to Defendant\u2019s Motion in Limine. Defendant consents to continued representation by W. Burton Anderson, Esq.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">(Emphasis supplied). Although the transcript of this hearing does not include any statements made by Respondent, the docket entries show that the issue of who will cross-examine Mr. Johnson has been resolved, and the entry that Respondent \u201cconsents to continued representation\u201d is in no way inconsistent with anything in the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">The final pretrial hearing in Respondent\u2019s case occurred on September 24, 2008, at which Judge Groton made several <em>in limine </em>rulings. The following transpired after Judge Groton announced his final <em>in limine </em>ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">THE COURT: And I believe that\u2019s all the motions that are pending at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-13\">THE COURT: All right.

ANDERSON: Those are all the motions that are pending before the court. The Defendant has brought something to my attention that I would request the opportunity to speak with him about in the back, and I ask the Sheriff and our Reporter to remain available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">THE COURT: Sure. Let us know when you\u2019re ready and we will reconvene at that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The Court did not reconvene on September 24, 2008. Judge Groton presided at Respondent\u2019s trial, which commenced on September 25, 2008 and concluded on the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">While holding that Respondent\u2019s September 1 letter required a Md. Rule 2-415(e) inquiry,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">In light of appellant\u2019s prior request in February to discharge counsel, appellant\u2019s September 1, 2008 letter, in which he raised the same issue, triggered a Maryland Rule 4-215(e) inquiry. <em>See [State </em>v.] <em>Campbell, </em>385 Md. [616] at 629[, 870 A.2d 217, 224 (2005)]. From the September 1st letter, the court \u201creasonably could deduce\u201d that appellant sought to discharge his counsel. <em>See Id. </em>at 632[, 870 A.2d at 226],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>The State argues that Respondent\u2019s September 1, 2008 Motion was (in the words of its brief) \u201csufficient only to alert the prosecutor and the trial court that [Respondent] desired a change of venue ... and his vague request that he wanted a \u2018Court appointed attorney,\u2019 buried in the final sentence of the final paragraph of what was captioned and pled specifically and solely as a change of venue motion stands in stark contrast to other cases where 4-215 inquiries were mandated.\u201d We agree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In <em>White v. State, </em>23 Md.App. 151, 326 A.2d 219 (1974), cert. denied, 273 Md. 723 (1975), while affirming convictions for murder and related offenses, and rejecting the appellant\u2019s contention \u201cthat prejudicial error was committed by the failure of the court below to rule on the speedy trial issue he raised prior to trial [in subparagraph c of paragraph 10 in a single Motion to Dismiss the Indictments],\u201d the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">Although appellant raised several preliminary questions to be decided by [the trial judge], at no time did appellant mention the undecided subparagraph 10c of the Motion to Dismiss, disposed of in all other respects by [the motions hearing judge].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">Although appellant cites no authority for his contention that failure to rule upon a pending motion may be prejudicial error we have no question that such right is an important element of Maryland law. <em>Brice v. State, </em>254 Md. 655[,255 A.2d 28 (1969) ]. We note, however, that this right, as most other rights, carries with it a commensurate responsibility. The motion to be decided must be brought to the attention of the trial court. Appellant may not take advantage of an obscurely situate, undecided motion and stand mute in the face of repeated requests by the judge for all pending motions to be decided....If the question is not of such importance to appellant that he remembers to request an answer, the court cannot be charged with screening previously decided motions to discern an unanswered sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>tence obscured by a plethora of unrelated issues. Nor can we permit such distended motions to be set as a trap for an unwary judge. Appellant obviously waived his right to a ruling on the motion by repeatedly failing to present the question to [the trial judge].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 155-56, 326 A.2d at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">That analysis, which is entirely consistent with this Court\u2019s opinions involving \u201comnibus\u201d motions filed pursuant to Md. Rule 4-252,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is fully applicable to the case at bar. At the pretrial hearing held on September 12, 2008, at the final pretrial hearing held on September 24, 2008, as well as prior to trial on September 25, 2008, Respondent had the opportunity to request permission to discharge Mr. Anderson. Because no such request was presented to Judge Groton on any of these occasions, we agree with the State\u2019s argument that (in the words of its brief), \u201cRule 4-215(e) was not implicated, much less violated, by the trial court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Respondent argues that we should infer from what occurred at the conclusion of the September 24, 2008 hearing that he was attempting to request permission to discharge Mr. Anderson, but that attempt was thwarted by Judge Groton and by Mr. Anderson. We decline to draw that inference, because (1) Judge Groton\u2019s \u201ctalk to your lawyer\u201d response is the proper response to a criminal defendant who is represented by counsel, and (2) we shall not infer that Mr. Anderson failed to comply with the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">In <em>Garner v. State, </em>414 Md. 372, 995 A.2d 694 (2010), while rejecting the contention that the trial court erroneously failed to comply with the requirements of Md. Rule 4-215(a)(3) when responding to the defendant\u2019s request for permission to discharge his trial counsel, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">Members of the Maryland Bar are officers of the court who have an obligation to comply with the Rules of Professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Conduct. While serving as Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel, Rule 1.2 required that [he] abide by Petitioner\u2019s decision concerning the services to be performed on Petitioner\u2019s behalf, and Rule 3.3 prohibited [him] from making a false statement to the Circuit Court. When [Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel] stated, \u201cI\u2019m still in the case[,]\u201d the Circuit Court was entitled to rely upon that statement and was not required to make further inquiry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 390, 995 A.2d at 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">If\u2014either at the conclusion of the September 24, 2008 pretrial hearing, or prior to the commencement of trial on the following day\u2014Respondent requested that Mr. Anderson arrange for him to be represented by another defense counsel, Mr. Anderson would have been obligated to notify Judge Groton that Respondent had made such a request.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As Judge Groton was not so notified, Respondent is not entitled to a new trial on the ground that he was not permitted to explain the reasons for requesting permission to discharge Mr. Anderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR CONSIDERATION OF RESPONDENT\u2019S ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE YET TO BE ADDRESSED; COSTS IN THIS COURT TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT; COST IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO ABIDE THE RESULT ON REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-10\">.

Maryland Rule 4-215(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\">If a defendant requests permission to discharge an attorney whose appearance has been entered, the court shall permit the defendant to explain the reasons for the request. If the court finds that there is a meritorious reason for the defendant's request, the court shall permit the discharge of counsel; continue the action if necessary; and advise the defendant that if new counsel does not enter an appearance by the next scheduled trial date, the action will proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel. If the court finds no meritorious reason for the defendant's request, the court may not permit the discharge of counsel without first informing the defendant that the trial will proceed as scheduled with the defendant unrepresented by counsel if the defendant discharges counsel and does not have new counsel. If the court permits the defendant to discharge counsel, it shall comply with subsections (a)(l)-(4) of this Rule if the docket or file does not reflect prior compliance.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b235-9\">. See <em>Miller v. State, </em>380 Md. 1, 49, 843 A.2d 803, 831 (2004), and <em>Denicolis v. State, </em>378 Md. 646, 660, 837 A.2d 944, 952-53 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\">. During the period of time in which there is an attorney-client relationship between a criminal defendant and his or her lawyer, it is not unusual for the defendant to express a desire for representation by a different lawyer. For that reason, defense counsel is not obligated to tell the triad court about every conversation in which a client has indicated an interest in changing counsel. A transitory wish for a different lawyer at various points in time prior to trial is, however, distinguishable from a considered decision to request that the trial court permit the defendant to discharge defense counsel. Therefore, when a lawyer has been told by a criminal defendant that the defendant wants to be represented by some other lawyer, unless the defendant thereafter consents to the lawyer's continued representation, the lawyer is obligated to advise the trial court of the defendant\u2019s wishes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
