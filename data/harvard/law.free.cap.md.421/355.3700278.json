The Wietzkes requested some three million dollars in damages against the Church, as well as injunctive relief requiring the Church to \u201ctake any and all necessary steps;to prevent further flooding of the [Wietzkes\u2019] home as a result of the changed topography, excavation, construction and/or drainage conditions on the Church property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">At the ensuing jury trial, after the close of the Wietzkes\u2019 case, the Montgomery County Circuit Court granted the Church\u2019s motion for judgment as to the Wietzkes\u2019 negligence claim. After the close of the Church\u2019s case, but before the jury was instructed, the trial judge, over the Wietzkes\u2019 objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>tions, denied several of the Wietzkes\u2019 requested jury instructions: one requested, but denied, jury instruction would have directed the jury that interference with the comfortable enjoyment of the affected property was the only consideration; another rejected instruction would have admonished the jury that Montgomery County\u2019s approval of the Church\u2019s construction project was not a defense to the Wietzkes\u2019 claim for private nuisance; yet another rejected instruction would have advised the jury that the existence of other contributing sources to a nuisance was not a defense to an offending landowner\u2019s own contribution to the same nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Thereafter, the jury found in favor of the Church on nuisance and trespass, and judgment was entered. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion, and we granted certiorari, <em>Wietzke v. The Chesapeake Conference Ass\u2019n, </em>417 Md. 501, 10 A.3d 1180 (2011), to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">1. Do Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions 20:1 and 20:2, which fail to include any reference to strict liability, but instead require a finding of \u201cunreasonable conduct\u201d, conflict with the Maryland law of strict liability nuisance established by the Maryland Court of Appeals?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">2. Were the Wietzkes improperly denied a jury instruction which reflected the strict liability law of nuisance in Maryland when the instructions given by the Court completely failed to address strict liability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">3. Were the Wietzkes improperly denied a jury instruction reflecting Maryland law that County approval does not absolve a Defendant of nuisance liability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">4. Were the Wietzkes improperly denied a jury instruction reflecting Maryland law that a Defendant is not absolved of nuisance liability merely because other sources may have contributed to the nuisance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">5. Did the trial court err in dismissing the negligence count when the evidence established that the Defendants violated, and were given notices of violations, of Montgom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>ery County Code ordinances as a result of the flooding of the Wietzke property?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We shall hold that the doctrine of private nuisance dictates that the fact finder should consider the reasonableness of the offending landowner\u2019s use of its property, and that the jury instructions in issue were, then, a correct exposition of the law. We shall further hold that, because the Church did not raise County approval of its construction project as a defense to the Wietzkes\u2019 nuisance claim, the Wietzkes\u2019 requested jury instruction was not generated by the evidence adduced at trial. Similarly, we shall hold that, because the Church did not introduce evidence that other sources \u201ccontributed\u201d to the conditions on the Wietzkes\u2019 property as a defense to the Wietzkes\u2019 nuisance claim, the Wietzkes\u2019 requested jury instruction regarding other sources was inapplicable. Finally, we shall hold that the trial judge erred in granting the Church\u2019s motion for judgment on the Wietzkes\u2019 negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Testimony adduced at trial reflected the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The Church and the Wietzkes owned two adjacent properties in Silver Spring, Maryland. The Wietzkes\u2019 property sits at the corner of Mill Grove Place and Magnolia Street, while the Church\u2019s property is situated at the corner of Timber Ridge Road and Magnolia Street. A topographical map establishes that the properties are situated together such that the Wietzkes\u2019 property sits at the bottom of a hill and the Church\u2019s property sits atop a hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">In 2000, the Church made the decision to construct a new parking lot on its property, though construction did not begin immediately. On March 4, 2004, the Church sent correspondence to all neighboring, downstream property owners, including the Wietzkes, informing them it intended to develop its property and employ a \u201cstormwater management\u201d concept to deal with any increased runoff the construction may cause. The letter invited neighboring landowners to provide comments and concerns to the Montgomery County Government. Though some neighbors responded, the Wietzkes did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>The Church, in conjunction with the construction of the parking lot, developed a stormwater runoff and sediment control strategy, which was intended to control the flow of surface water from the Church property. On October 26, 2006, the Church held a pre-construction meeting, which was attended by a team of engineers, contractors, excavators and sediment control experts, and the stormwater and sediment control concept was discussed at length. Moreover, a large portion of the pre-construction meeting focused on the placement of certain limitations on how much earth could be disturbed during the construction of the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Thereafter, between October 26, 2006 and mid-to-late summer of 2007, a large stormwater pond was constructed on the Church\u2019s property. The stormwater pond, which held thousands of gallons of water, was designed to collect excess water runoff from the Church\u2019s property to release it in a slow, controlled manner. Moreover, the stormwater pond was designed to filter solid matter out of the water by guiding it through a \u201csilt fence\u201d made of woven fabric. Also, to maintain the purity of the stormwater on the Church\u2019s construction site, earth dikes, or trenches fashioned out of dirt, were dug to direct stormwater around the construction site.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">On two occasions, once on November 28, 2006, and once on June 14, 2007, the Church was visited by a County Inspector and issued a \u201cNotice of Violation\u201d for being in non-compliance with certain County ordinances relating to stormwater and sediment control. The November 28, 2006 Notice, issued pursuant to Section 19-7 of the Montgomery County Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>was issued because the Church had not yet built an earth dike and other sediment controls. The November 28, 2006 Notice itself provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">The site is out of compliance due to the sequence of construction not being followed. Install the earth dike and other sediment controls listed and call for an inspection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqEe\">The November 28, 2006 Notice was accompanied by an \u201cInspection Summary,\u201d which instructed the church to cease construction until it built an earth dike:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">Inspection this date reveals the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">1) The site is out of sequence for construction. A notice of violation is being issued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">2) Install the earth dikes per sequence of construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">3) Bring the site into compliance and call for inspections per the sequence of construction and preconstruction memo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amd\">4) If any changes are wanted, first contact the inspector and your engineer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">The second Notice, dated June 14, 2007, issued pursuant to Section 19-16(a) of the Montgomery County Code,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>after an usually heavy rainfall, when stormwater had escaped from the earth dikes into the Church\u2019s construction site, permitting soil to be washed away. The June 14, 2007 Notice contained a brief narrative, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">Sediment left the site after a storm event. There was flooding in the neighborhood. Contact your engineer for a Solution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The June 14, 2007 Notice was also accompanied by an Inspection Summary, which stated \u201cthere was flooding of the house,\u201d without identifying any specific property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">Inspection this date reveals the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">1) A rainfall event last evening caused sediment to leave the site. The clean water diversion worked but there were wash outs on the private roadway below the site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">2) The water built up on the super silt fence and because of the head pressure of the water caused the water to be forced under the fence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">3) There was sediment water and deposition on the property below. There was flooding of the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\">4) The site is not in sequence with the plans. The parking lot area was cleared earlier and some of the area was to receive excess dirt from the pond. The dirt is now being hauled off. Complete the remaining removal of dirt (the dewatering device and riser are installed!)]. Stabilize and install the safety fence. Call for inspection of the sediment basin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-13\">5) A notice of violation and a civil citation are being issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">During the Wietzkes\u2019 case, the Wietzkes themselves testified that they had experienced three major flooding events in their basement, which they used as a family room, one in June of 2006, one in November 2006, and one in June of 2007. The Wietzkes also testified that they had experienced somewhere between forty to fifty more minor flooding events in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>basement during the same time period. Due to the flooding, the Wietzkes testified that they had ceased using their basement entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The Wietzkes produced no expert testimony. Rather, apparently in an attempt to link the Church\u2019s construction of the parking lot with the flooding in their basement, the Wietzkes themselves, as well as two neighbors, gave testimony that, based on their perception, water appeared to flow towards the Wietzkes\u2019 property from the portion of the Church\u2019s property which abutted Magnolia Drive. James Jamison, one of the Wietzkes\u2019 neighbors, shot video footage of the June 2007 flooding of the Wietzkes\u2019 house, which they charged came from the Church.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The Wietzkes also called Devona Malcolm, a contractor the Church had hired to oversee the building of the new parking lot. Ms. Malcolm admitted that the Church\u2019s construction project increased runoff from the Church property, but that the Church had installed a stormwater pond to control it. She also testified that the Church had considered whether it would be beneficial to utilize sandbags during a heavy rainfall, but before action could be taken, the rain had stopped. Moreover, Ms. Malcolm testified that the Church had inquired into whether they could install a permanent concrete curb on their property, but that the County never issued the proper permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">At the close of the Wietzkes\u2019 case, the Church moved for judgment on both the Wietzkes\u2019 negligence and trespass claims. The trial judge granted the Church\u2019s motion as to the negligence count, explaining as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">[W]ith regard to the negligence count, there is evidence that there were citations read in (unintelligible) alleged violations in connection with the sediment and control plan and so forth during the construction. But in order for negligence, or in order for a violation of the statute to be evidence of negligence you would have to show that the statute was designed to prevent the type of harm that, you know, ultimately occurred, and, and here we don\u2019t have that, and there\u2019s no proof, at this point, that the specific alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>violation was the cause of water flooding the basement. So, without that evidence, we\u2019re back to the standard (unintelligible) of negligence and the duty of the breach and the injury and the cause, and there\u2019s not been testimony with regard to a duty.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] And it seems to me that the negligence you\u2019re talking about would have to do with the construction and whether appropriate methods were or were not employed and that that would be the subject of expert testimony to establish a duty and a breach of a duty, and I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s been done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">The trial judge denied the Church\u2019s motion for judgment as to the trespass count, reasoning that, contrary to the Church\u2019s argument, the evidence showed that the Church exercised dominion and control over their property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">I\u2019ll deny the motion with regard to the other counts, because I think it\u2019s different from a supplier of gasoline to a facility here. There was active involvement on the property, on the premises, of the defendants, that they did exercise certain control over the property, and I think, at least at this point looking at it in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, there is evidence from which the jury could find for the plaintiff with regard to those other counts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The Church presented a case rife with expert testimony. Thomas Wheadon, a sediment control and stormwater management specialist, testified that the Church had employed an effective concept for managing stormwater runoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Thomas Woodhouse, the County Inspector issuing the November 28, 2006 and June 14, 2007 Notices to the Church, and stormwater expert, testified that, in his opinion, the November 28, 2006 sequencing violation would not have increased surface water flow from the Church property onto the Wietzke property, and that when he issued the Notice, the Wietzkes\u2019 property was not \u201ca thought in [his] mind.\u201d Further, Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Woodhouse testified that when he issued the June 14, 2007 Notice to the Church, he did not determine whether water or sediment from the Church\u2019s property had reached the Wietzkes\u2019 home. Mr. Woodhouse also reviewed the videotape made by Mr. Jamison and concluded that the water flowing onto the Wietzkes\u2019 property originated from more than one direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The Church also called David O\u2019Bryan, an expert in the areas of civil-engineering, land-use planning, and stormwater management. Mr. O\u2019Bryan testified that, after visiting and observing the Church\u2019s property, the construction of the new parking lot did not cause water to flow \u201cwhere it wasn\u2019t previously flowing.\u201d Mr. O\u2019Bryan also testified that, based on his review of Mr. Jamison\u2019s videotape and a topography map, the surface water flowing onto the Wietzkes\u2019 property most likely originated from multiple properties, but that it was impossible to determine which properties in particular without a detailed runoff study. Moreover, Alan Beal, a real estate construction specialist, testified that he recommended the Wietzkes regrade their property and improve the drainage system to control surface waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">At the close of trial, the parties met with the trial judge regarding their requested jury instructions. The Wietzkes requested several jury instructions relating to their nuisance claim, one of which would have advised the jury that the Church was liable if the Wietzkes\u2019 comfortable enjoyment of their property had been interfered with, without more:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">Nuisance is a strict liability cause of action. This means that it does not matter whether or not the nuisance was the result of illegal or negligent conduct. Even if a business is lawful and conducted in the most approved method, it is still a nuisance if it interferes with the comfortable enjoyment by another of his property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Another of the Wietzkes\u2019 requested jury instructions would have advised the jury that County approval of the Church\u2019s construction project was not a defense to nuisance liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>In this case, there has been evidence that the County approved some of the Church\u2019s activities. The County approval, however, is not a defense to an action for nuisance. If the Church\u2019s activities constituted a nuisance to the Wietzke\u2019s, then the Church is liable for that nuisance regardless of any county approval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Yet another of the Wietzkes\u2019 requested jury instructions would have advised the jury that evidence the flood waters at issue came from sources other than the Church was not a defense to nuisance liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">If water from the Church property contributed to flooding of the Wietzke property, it is not a defense that water from other sources may have also contributed. If you find that the water from the Church property contributed to flooding of the Wietzke property then the Church is liable for any resulting nuisance to the Wietzkes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The trial judge and counsel met over a two-day period to discuss the proposed instructions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and eventually, the judge denied the Wietzkes\u2019 requested jury instructions, opting to instruct the jury in accordance with Sections 20:1, 20:2, and 20:4 of the Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instructions (4th ed., 2008 Supp.), with specific portions omitted, as noted:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>A nuisance is any unreasonable conduct which causes real, substantial, and unreasonable damage to, or interference with, another person\u2019s ordinary use and enjoyment of his or her property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">Conduct is unreasonable if it is prohibited by law or violated regulations which were adopted to control the use of property, or it is not suitable for the nature of the area and the use being made of other property in the area, or it causes interference with the other person\u2019s use and enjoyment and the interference could have been reduced or eliminated without too much hardship or too much expense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">In determining whether the conduct was unreasonable, you should consider whether it was the kind of conduct an ordinary person would expect might interfere with the use and enjoyment of another person\u2019s property or cause real and substantial injury to another person\u2019s health or comfort. You should also consider the right of both parties to make a reasonable use and enjoyment of their property. The plaintiffs right to be free from interference with his or her use and enjoyment should be balanced against defendant\u2019s right to use his or her property. And the plaintiff must expect to endure some inconvenience or discomfort which results from the defendant\u2019s reasonable use of his or her property. In determining what reasonable amount of interference, inconvenience, or discomfort the plaintiff should be expected to tolerate you should consider the right of the defendant to use his or her property or to conduct his or her affairs in a reasonable manner. The extent of interference which would result from the defendant\u2019s reasonable use of his or her property or conduct of his or her affairs, the circumstances under which the interference occurred, the nature of the area in which the real property is located, and the uses being made of other property in the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>A person who creates or continues a nuisance is responsible for the injury or damage caused to others by the nuisance. The defendants in this case have asserted that the natural flow of water in the neighborhood leads to plaintiffs property. You are instructed that even if the natural flow of water in the neighborhood leads to plaintiffs property, the defendants are liable if they created a change in that water flow which created a nuisance to the Wietzkes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Church on the remaining nuisance and trespass counts, and the verdict sheet provided as follows, regarding the Church\u2019s liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">1. Do you find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Defendants are liable to Plaintiffs on their claim of nuisance?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Yes No X</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">2. Do you find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Defendants are liable to Plaintiffs on their claim of trespass?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Yes No X</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">\n<em>If you answered \u201cYes\u201d to either of the above questions, proceed to questions 3 and 4. If you answered \u201cNo\u201d to any of the above questions, your verdict is complete.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">The Wietzkes noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing the same five points they raise before us.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment, reasoning that as to the nuisance count, \u201cthe pattern jury instructions given by the court were a correct statement of, and adequately covered, the law of nuisance as a strict liability cause of action.\u201d As to the trial judge\u2019s denial of the Wietzkes\u2019 county approval instruction, the court reasoned that the record did not reflect that the Church was seeking to defend the action \u201con the basis that they were in compliance with County mandates,\u201d and thus, the Wietzkes\u2019 requested instruction was inapplicable. With respect to the Wietzkes\u2019 requested \u201cother source\u201d instruction, the court reasoned that the Church \u201cdid not contend that other sources absolved them from liability if the existence of a nuisance and causation were otherwise established,\u201d likewise rendering the Wietzke\u2019s instruction inapplicable. As to the negligence count, the court reasoned that the Wietzkes \u201cintroduced no evidence\u201d that the Montgomery County ordinance violated was designed to prevent the type of harm claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In challenging the propriety of the jury instructions on the issue of nuisance, the Wietzkes contended at trial, before the Court of Special Appeals, and now before us, that it was error for the trial judge to instruct the jury to consider the reasonableness of the Church\u2019s use of its property. The Wietzkes argue that, because the doctrine of private nuisance is a matter of strict liability, it was irrelevant how the Church used its property if the Wietzkes\u2019 use and enjoyment of their property was substantially interfered with. The Wietzkes also have argued that it was error for the trial judge not to instruct the jury to disregard the County\u2019s approval of the Church\u2019s project or that other sources may have contributed to the Wietzkes\u2019 flooding as defenses. To this end, the Wietzkes offered the following instruction in lieu of that which was given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Nuisance is a strict liability cause of action. This means that it does not matter whether or not the nuisance was the result of illegal or negligent conduct. Even if a business is lawful and conducted in the most approved method, it is still a nuisance if it interferes with the comfortable enjoyment by another of his property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\">In this case, there has been evidence that the County approved some of the Church\u2019s activities. The County approval, however, is not a defense to an action for nuisance. If the Church\u2019s activities constituted a nuisance to the Wietzke\u2019s, then the Church is liable for that nuisance regardless of any County approval.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">If water from the Church property contributed to flooding of the Wietzke property, it is not a defense that water from other sources may have also contributed. If you find that the water from the Church property contributed to flooding of the Wietzke property then the Church is liable for any resulting nuisance to the Wietzkes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">In essence, the Wietzkes\u2019 instructions would have had the jury instructed only as to whether their comfortable use and enjoyment was adversely affected, without any other consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">In reviewing the propriety of a jury instruction, we use an abuse of discretion standard. In <em>Collins v. National Railroad Passenger Corp., </em>417 Md. 217, 9 A.3d 56 (2010), we explained that, \u201c[a] trial judge exercises discretion by assessing whether the evidence produced at trial warrants a particular instruction on legal principles applicable to that evidence and to the theories of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 9 A.3d at 63. To succeed on a claim that a trial judge abused his or her discretion in denying a party\u2019s requested jury instructions, we determined that three criteria must be met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">(1) the requested jury instruction must be a correct exposition of the law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">(2) the particular law must have been applicable to the evidence before the jury; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>(3) the substance of the requested instruction must not have been fairly covered by the instructions actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 229, 9 A.3d at 63 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The Wietzkes\u2019 first two certiorari questions espouse separate, but inextricably linked, legal conclusions, that only the level of interference to an affected landowner can be considered in assessing a nuisance claim and that strict liability must be imposed once the nuisance is established. As a result, we will address the first two questions together in our initial discussion of the nuisance doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The Wietzkes\u2019 first instruction equated nuisance with a determination of whether the Wietzkes\u2019 \u201ccomfortable enjoyment\u201d of their property was interfered with:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">Nuisance is a strict liability cause of action. This means that it does not matter whether or not the nuisance was the result of illegal or negligent conduct. Even if a business is lawful and conducted in the most approved method, it is still a nuisance if it interferes with the comfortable enjoyment by another of his property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">In contrast, the trial judge\u2019s instruction involved a much more comprehensive inquiry, in which the use of its property by the alleged offender must be balanced against the right of the affected landowner to be free from interference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">A nuisance is any unreasonable conduct which causes real, substantial, and unreasonable damage to, or interference with, another person\u2019s ordinary use and enjoyment of his or her property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">Conduct is unreasonable if it is prohibited by law or violated regulations which were adopted to control the use of property, or it is not suitable for the nature of the area and the use being made of other property in the area, or it causes interference with the other person\u2019s use and enjoyment and the interference could have been reduced or eliminated without too much hardship or too much expense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-11\">In determining whether the conduct was unreasonable you should consider whether it was the kind of conduct an ordinary person would expect might interfere with the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>and enjoyment of another person\u2019s property, or cause real and substantial injury to another person\u2019s health or comfort. You should also consider the right of both parties to make a reasonable use and enjoyment of their property. The plaintiffs right to be free from interference with his or her use and enjoyment should be balanced against defendant\u2019s right to use his or her property. And the plaintiff must expect to endure some inconvenience or discomfort which results from the defendant\u2019s reasonable use of his or her property. In determining what reasonable amount of interference, inconvenience, or discomfort the plaintiff should be expected to tolerate you should consider the right of the defendant to use his or her property or to conduct his or her affairs in a reasonable manner. The extent of interference which would result from the defendant\u2019s reasonable use of his or her property or conduct of his or her affairs, the circumstances under which the interference occurred, the nature of the area in which the real property is located, and the uses being made of other property in the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\">A person who creates or continues a nuisance is responsible for the injury or damage caused to others by the nuisance. The defendants in this case have asserted that the natural flow of water in the neighborhood leads to plaintiffs property. You are instructed that even if the natural flow of water in the neighborhood leads to plaintiffs property, the defendants are liable if they created a change in that water flow which created a nuisance to the Wietzkes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Whether the trial judge gave a correct exposition of the law of nuisance is the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Nuisance is \u201cone of the most ancient concepts in the Anglo-American common law,\u201d existing at least as far back as 1066 A.D. David A. Thomas, Thompson on Real Property \u00a7 67.01, at 111 (2d ed., 2010 Supp.). The doctrine was originally conceived to protect private landholders from being dispossessed of their property. <em>Id. </em>As the doctrine of nuisance evolved, however, it also became one of the primary tools for protecting private landholders against \u201csubstantial interfer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>enees\u201d with their possession of the land. Importantly, the claim is \u201cphrased as a harm or nuisance to the land\u201d itself, not as a harm to the individual landholder. <em>Id. </em>Nuisance, then, is somewhat of a hybrid cause of action, involving property tenets, as well as tort principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Since its inception, moreover, the doctrine of nuisance has evolved to protect the property rights of the public as well, where a \u201cright common to the general public\u201d has been interfered with. Thomas, \u00a7 67.02, at 113. Regarding the distinction between a public and private nuisance, we have explained that \u201cpublic nuisance is an injury to the public at large or to all persons who come in contact with it,\u201d while \u201cprivate nuisance is an injury to an individual or a limited number of individuals only.\u201d <em>Adams v. Commissioners of Trappe, </em>204 Md. 165, 170, 102 A.2d 830, 834 (1954). Thus, while the same activity may give rise to both a public and a private nuisance, the difference is in whether the property rights affected are either confined to private ownership or are cast broadly across the general public:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">A livestock feed lot or a refinery may produce pests or odors over such a wide area that the rights of the general public are affected and, at the same time, nearby private landowners may suffer extraordinary interference with the use and enjoyment of their own lands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Thomas, \u00a7 67.02(a), at 114. Because the case before us involves interference with only the Wietzkes\u2019 use and enjoyment of their own private property, we hereafter confine our analysis to private nuisance, which we have defined as \u201ca nontrespassory invasion of another\u2019s interest in the private use and enjoyment of land.\u201d <em>Rosenblatt v. Exxon Co., U.S.A., </em>335 Md. 58, 80, 642 A.2d 180, 190 (1994), quoting Section 821D of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The universe of private nuisance is split into a further dichotomy, nuisances <em>per se </em>and nuisances in-fact. <em>See </em>Thomas, \u00a7 67.03, at 117. A nuisance <em>per se, </em>or a nuisance at law, involves the use of one\u2019s land, which is \u201cso unreasonable,\u201d that it is deemed to constitute an actionable nuisance \u201cat all times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>and under any circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.; Leatherbury v. Gaylord Fuel Corp., </em>276 Md. 367, 377, 347 A.2d 826, 832 (1975) (\u201cTo constitute a nuisance per se, the activity sought to be enjoined must be a nuisance \u2018at all times and under any circumstances regardless of location or surroundings.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Commissioners of Trappe, </em>204 Md. at 170, 102 A.2d at 834)). Such nuisances are typically found only where a particular land use is \u201cmotivated by malice toward the plaintiff landowner,\u201d is \u201cforbidden by law,\u201d or is \u201cflagrantly contrary to generally accepted standards of conduct.\u201d Thomas, \u00a7 67.03(a), at 118; <em>Commissioners of Trappe, </em>204 Md. at 175, 102 A.2d at 836 (\u201cto engage in any form of business in defiance of laws regulating or prohibiting [a] business constitutes a nuisance <em>per se\u201d); State use of Bohon v. Feldstein, </em>207 Md. 20, 34, 113 A.2d 100, 106 (1955) (explaining that it is a nuisance <em>per se </em>if \u201cthe thing itself\u2019 works \u201csome unlawful peril to health or safety of person or property.\u201d (quoting <em>Sherwood Bros., Inc. v. Eckard, </em>204 Md. 485, 494, 105 A.2d 207, 211 (1954))); <em>see, e.g., Patapsco Electric Co. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City, </em>110 Md. 306, 312, 72 A. 1039, 1041-1042 (1909) (concluding that the City of Baltimore could seek an injunction against a power company from operating on city property because the company had not yet received the required consent from the Mayor and City Council).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Nuisances in-fact, or nuisances <em>per accidens,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>arise where, considering the \u201cparticular setting\u201d and surrounding circumstances, a particular land use constitutes a nuisance even though \u201cthe conduct might not be a nuisance in another locality or at another time or under some other circumstances.\u201d Thomas, \u00a7 67.03(b), at 124; <em>Commissioners of Trappe, </em>204 Md. at 170, 102 A.2d at 834 (\u201cA nuisance in fact is an act, occupation, or structure, not a nuisance <em>per se, </em>but one which becomes a nuisance by reason of the circumstances, location, or surroundings.\u201d). As early as 1879, we had occa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>sion to consider the issue of nuisance in fact in <em>Dittman &amp; Berger v. Repp, </em>50 Md. 516 (1879), in which we determined that the maintenance of loud and vibratory beer brewing devices created a private nuisance sufficient to justify the issuance of an injunction. We explained that, in order to be actionable, a nuisance must be one which \u201cin view of the <em>circumstances </em>of the case, is <em>unreasonable </em>and in derogation of the rights of the complainant.\u201d 50 Md. at 522 (emphasis added). We ordained that consideration of the circumstances of a given nuisance claim necessarily involved a review of \u201cthe locality, the nature of the trade, the character of the machinery, and the manner of using the property producing the annoyance and injury complained of.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Hendrickson v. Standard Oil Co., </em>126 Md. 577, 588, 95 A. 153, 157 (1915) (\u201cThe facts of each case must determine the question whether a nuisance exists against which a neighboring proprietor is justly and reasonably entitled to call upon a Court of equity\u201d for relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In <em>Short v. Baltimore City Passenger Railway Company, </em>50 Md. 73 (1878), we considered a private nuisance claim, such as that brought in the instant case, brought against a commercial railroad where, after clearing its tracks of snow, the railroad had allegedly created a large snow ridge that reportedly concentrated the flow of surface waters onto a nearby property. We were asked to determine whether it was error for the trial judge to instruct the jury to consider the reasonableness of the railroad\u2019s use of its property in finding whether the railroad had created an actionable nuisance. In framing our analysis, we explained that the nuisance inquiry necessarily involved the balancing of conflicting property rights, and to that end, a determination of whether the offending landowner\u2019s use of its own property was \u201creasonable, usual, and proper\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">As a general rule, it is conceded that every one must so use his own property and exercise the rights incident thereto, in such a manner as not to injure the property of another. And it is equally true, that the <em>mere lawfulness of the act </em>is not in itself a test in all cases, of exemption from liability for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>injuries resulting therefrom to the property of others. But yet, there are certain rights incident to the dominion and ownership of property, in the exercise and enjoyment of which a person will not be liable for damages, although injury may be occasioned thereby to the property of another.... The question then is, what is the true test in actions of this kind, by which the <em>exemption from liability is to be determined? </em>We think it may be safely said, both on principle and on authority, that the true test is, whether in the act complained of, the owner has used his property in <em>a reasonable, usual and 'proper manner, </em>taking care to avoid unnecessary injury to others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><em>Short, </em>50 Md. at 81-82. We affirmed on the basis that the trial court\u2019s instructions had correctly admonished the jury to consider the reasonableness of the railroad\u2019s use of its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In other late nineteenth century cases, we had occasion to flirt with discussing only the unreasonableness of the interference caused to the affected landowner\u2019s use and enjoyment as a basis for relief, but never expressly adopted a view consistent with that doctrine nor deflected one that balanced reasonable use versus unreasonable interference as adopted in <em>Short. </em>To illustrate, in <em>Adams v. Michael, </em>38 Md. 123 (1873), we were asked to determine whether a petition to prospectively enjoin the construction of a felt-roofing facility in close proximity to a group of residential tenements was erroneously dismissed. We framed the nuisance analysis as one focusing solely on whether the activity complained of would interfere with \u201cthe ordinary comfort of human existence\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">[Wjhether it be smoke, smell, noise, vapors, or water, or any gas or fluid ... [t]he owner of one tenement cannot cause or permit to pass over, or flow into his neighbor\u2019s tenement, any one or more of these things in such a way as materially to interfere with the ordinary comfort of the occupier of the neighboring tenement, or so as to injure his property.... The real question in all the cases is the question of fact, viz: whether the annoyance is such as materially to interfere with the ordinary comfort of human existence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 127-28. (internal quotation marks omitted). Also, in both <em>Dittman, </em>50 Md. at 516, and <em>Woodyear v. Schaefer, </em>57 Md. 1 (1881), we dealt with questions relating to the propriety of granting injunctions to restrain the maintenance of nuisances and applied the framework set forth in <em>Adams. </em>In this regard, see Robert G. Bone, <em>Normative Theory and Legal Doctrine in American Nuisance Law: 1850 to 1920, </em>59 S. Cal.L.Rev. 1101, 1184 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Our opinion in <em>Susquehanna Fertilizer Company v. Malone, </em>73 Md. 268, 280, 20 A. 900, 902 (1890), however, embraces the balance of use against interference test. In <em>Susquehanna Fertilizer Company, </em>in the context of a commercial fertilizer company\u2019s alleged creation of overwhelming and offensive odors, we suggested that the concept of reasonable use of property by the alleged offender was essential to the discussion of nuisance in fact. Thus, we advised that not all inconveniences to surrounding landowners would justify limiting the reasonable use of the offending landowner\u2019s property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6W\">[I]n actions of this kind, the law does not regard trifling inconveniences.... [I]n determining the question of nuisance in such cases, the locality and all the surrounding circumstances should be taken into consideration; and that where expensive works have been erected and carried on, which are useful and needful to the public, persons must not stand on extreme rights, and bring actions in respect of every trifling annoyance, otherwise, business could not be carried on in such places. [I]f the result of the trade or business thus carried on is such as to interfere with the physical comfort, by another, of his property, or such as to occasion substantial injury to the property itself, there is wrong to the neighboring owner for which an action will lie.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9M\"><em>Id. </em>at 280, 20 A. at 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In more modern nuisance in-fact cases, we also have balanced the competing rights of landowners. In <em>Evans v. Burruss, </em>401 Md. 586, 933 A.2d 872 (2007), an affected landowner discovered that a neighbor had received a building permit to construct four amateur radio towers on his property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>only after contractors showed up and began developing the neighbor\u2019s land. Unavailingly, the affected landowner requested a stop work order from the Montgomery County Department of Permit Services. Thereafter, the affected landowner lost two appeals before the Board of Appeals and the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on the basis that the appeals were untimely. We were asked to determine whether the affected landowner had a due process right to be given actual notice that his neighbor had been issued a building permit. In our analysis, we discussed the competing property rights of adjoining landowners, significantly characterizing the doctrine of private nuisance as one which \u201cbalance[d] the conflicting rights of landowners.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610, 933 A.2d at 886, quoting <em>Prah v. Maretti, </em>108 Wis.2d 223, 321 N.W.2d 182, 187 (1982). In the brief discussion, we determined that because private nuisances existed \u201cindependently of the issuance of any public permits,\u201d they were \u201cnot a normal element of rights arising out of the issuance of building permits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610, 933 A.2d at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">In <em>Battisto v. Perkins, </em>210 Md. 542, 124 A.2d 288 (1956), we addressed the flow of surface waters from an offending landowner\u2019s property to that of a neighboring property in the context of a claim for private nuisance. Specifically, we considered whether the trial court had erroneously directed a verdict for the offending landowner. The affected landowner alleged that, by \u201cgrading, bulldozing and building\u201d new homes on a nearby property, the offending landowner had accelerated \u201clarge quantities of mud and debris\u201d upon the property of the affected landowner, and had thus created a nuisance. We framed our analysis by establishing that, due to the competing property interests at stake, a court in equity was obliged to balance the benefit versus the harm caused by an offending landowner\u2019s use of its property, leaving the question of whether the offending landowner had used his or her property reasonably to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">[A]n upper owner has the right to have surface waters flow naturally over the lands of lower owners, according to the civil law doctrine adopted in Maryland and a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>other states. [We have] adopted and applied the rule, known as \u201creasonableness of use\u201d involving a balance of benefit and harm.... The Maryland cases make it clear that the upper owner cannot, with impunity, artificially increase or concentrate the natural flow. The rule applies to urban as well as rural lands.... [The offending landowner] had a right to improve their property and prepare it for the erection of houses, but it was entirely foreseeable that the removal of all ground cover might increase the runoff and cause damage to the lower owners, and we think the upper owners were under a duty to use reasonable precautions against harm. What would be reasonable is ordinarily a question for the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 546, 124 A.2d at 290 (citation omitted). Thus, the balance of use and interference was joined.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">We reiterated that the reasonableness of the offending landowner\u2019s use of his or her land was a matter for the fact-finder in yet another surface water case, <em>Slaird v. Klewers, </em>260 Md. 2, 271 A.2d 345 (1970). In <em>Slaird, </em>we considered whether the trial judge had erroneously denied a landowner\u2019s nuisance claim, which arose in part from the alleged increased flow of surface waters originating from a neighboring property. The affected landowner claimed that their neighbor\u2019s installation of a swimming pool \u201cchanged the elevation and sloping\u201d of the land such that chlorinated surface water flowed unrestrained into their yard. In affirming the dismissal, we determined that the judge had appropriately considered the reasonableness of the offending landowner\u2019s use and development of their land:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">In regard to the alleged change of grade and increased flow of surface and other water on the Slaird property, the testimony was conflicting but there was substantial testimony to support the Chancellor\u2019s conclusion that this condition, if it existed at all, was not caused by the construction of the swimming pool, which was done in accordance with the requirements of the Montgomery County Code and with full compliance with the recommendations of the building inspector. The Chancellor, himself, with the consent of coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>sel for both parties and accompanied by them, visited the site after a heavy rain, as we have noted, and observed that the drainage problem \u201cis not acute today.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 10-11, 271 A.2d at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">We will not disturb a trial judge\u2019s decision to deny a litigant\u2019s requested jury instructions if the instruction given is a correct exposition of the law. Collins, 417 Md. at 228-229, 9 A.3d at 63. In the present surface water case, the trial judge, in accordance with our jurisprudence, properly instructed the jury that they should consider the reasonableness of the offending landowner\u2019s use of its property, the locality of the affected landowner\u2019s property, the surrounding circumstances, and the substantiality of the interference with the Wietzkes\u2019 use and enjoyment of their property. Conversely, the Wietzkes\u2019 formulation of nuisance would have erroneously directed the jury to consider only whether the Wietzkes\u2019 \u201ccomfortable enjoyment\u201d of their property experienced interference. Therefore, the trial judge correctly instructed the jury regarding the elements of nuisance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In order to obviate our holding, however, the Wietzkes rely on <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. CAE-Link Corp., </em>330 Md. 115, 622 A.2d 745 (1993), and argue that, in that case, we substantially revised the law of nuisance in Maryland by prohibiting a trier of fact from considering the reasonableness of an offending landowner\u2019s conduct in arriving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>at its verdict on nuisance in fact. In that case, the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission built and operated a sewage sludge facility, and as a part of its day to day operations, would receive shipments of sewage sludge, mix the sludge with wood chips, divide the mixture into \u201ccomposting piles,\u201d and essentially let the piles ferment for some fifty-one days. Though the Commission utilized a \u201cvacuum blower\u201d system to control the smells emitted, the sewage facility created a radius of \u201cnoxious odors\u201d which could be detected on nearby properties. <em>Electro-Nucleonics, Inc. v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>315 Md. 361, 378, 554 A.2d 804, 812 (1989), <em>cited in CAE-Link Corp., </em>330 Md. at 119 n. 2, 622 A.2d at 747 n. 2. The question before us was whether negligence had to be proven in order to submit a nuisance claim to the jury. This question was generated by the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment on the affected landowner\u2019s nuisance claim, which required a showing that the Commission had negligently operated the sewage sludge facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">At trial, the affected landowners failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>showing of negligence, and the trial court granted the Commission\u2019s motion for judgment. We framed our analysis by explaining that a nuisance claim did not depend upon proof of negligence of an offending landowner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">[Njuisance focuses not on the possible negligence of the defendant but on whether there has been <em>unreasonable interference </em>with the plaintiffs use and enjoyment of his or her own property. To prove the existence of a nuisance, therefore, the complained of interference must cause actual physical discomfort and annoyance to those of ordinary sensibilities, tastes and habits; it must interfere seriously with the ordinary comfort and enjoyment of the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afs\"><em>CAE-Link Corp., </em>330 Md. at 126, 622 A.2d at 750 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). We concluded that, because the creation of a nuisance resulted in strict liability, making out a <em>prima facie </em>case of nuisance did not require a showing that the Commission had been negligent. In so doing, however, we did not dramatically revise our nuisance jurisprudence, as the Wietzkes\u2019 have argued, such that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>finding of a private nuisance no longer involves a balance of the competing property interests at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">We also perceive little merit in the Wietzkes\u2019 argument that the concept of \u201cstrict liability\u201d was not fairly covered by the trial judge\u2019s instructions. Strict liability is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">Liability that does not depend on actual negligence or intent to harm, but that is based on the breach of an absolute duty to make something safe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 998 (9th ed.2009). In the present case, the concept of strict liability was articulated, correctly, in the trial judge\u2019s instruction that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">A person who creates or continues a nuisance is responsible for the injury or damage caused to others by the nuisance. The [Church has] asserted that the natural flow of water in the neighborhood leads to [Wietzkes\u2019] property. You are instructed that even if the natural flow of water in the neighborhood leads to [the Wietzkes\u2019] property, the [Church is] liable if they created a change in that water flow which created a nuisance to the Wietzkes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The jury, therefore, was correctly instructed as to strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">The Wietzkes next allege that the trial judge abused his discretion by failing to instruct the jury that County approval of the Church\u2019s construction project did not absolve the Church of liability for creating a nuisance. The Wietzkes\u2019 instruction provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-10\">In this case, there has been evidence that the County approved some of the Church\u2019s activities. The County approval, however, is not a defense to an action for nuisance. If the Church\u2019s activities constituted a nuisance to the Wietzkes\u2019, the Church is liable for that nuisance regardless of any county approval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">The Wietzkes argue that the \u201clinchpin\u201d of the Church\u2019s defense was the testimony of \u201ca plan reviewer and a plan inspector\u201d from the Montgomery County government \u201cwho praised the Church for its compliance with the County\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\u2018approved\u2019 plan.\u201d The Church responds that they were not defending on the ground that they had complied with County requirements, in and of itself, but on the grounds that they had developed and executed an exacting strategy for controlling stormwater runoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Even if a requested jury instruction is a correct exposition of the law, a trial judge should incorporate it only where it is generated by the evidence before the jury, and not already fairly covered by the instructions given. <em>Collins, </em>417 Md. at 229, 9 A.3d at 68. In the present case, it is clear that the Church introduced evidence that surface water runoff was a serious consideration in its construction of a new parking lot. As initially set forth in their pretrial statement, the Church\u2019s purpose in introducing testimony of a County plan reviewer was to provide a basis for their claim that they had come up with an effective strategy to \u201cease water flow impacting [the Wietzkes\u2019] property and other low lying areas,\u201d and the County plan reviewer testified that he reviewed the Church\u2019s concept specifically to determine whether it \u201c[could] provide sediment control for the proposed disturbed area[, and,] if required, provide stormwater management....\u201d The Church\u2019s project manager admitted the parking lot project would increase runoff. Likewise, as elucidated in the Church\u2019s opening statement, the purpose for providing testimony of a County Inspector was to illustrate that the Church had actually followed through and executed their strategy to control storm-water runoff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">When water runs downhill, stormwater management is about controlling the rate of water.... [I]n Montgomery County, the stormwater management [] is on the cutting edge....[B]ecause of Montgomery County\u2019s requirements that are so exacting, both on stormwater management and on forestation, reforestation ... this project ended up costing [ ] over $400,000....[Djuring this entire period of time, the County was monitoring the property because they had a tree save plan, they had a forestation plan going on, and a stormwater management plan. And before you get your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>building permit and have your pre-construction meeting, you\u2019re not allowed to disturb land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">During closing, the Church summed up their case by asserting that, though the parking lot project increased runoff from their property, they had controlled it effectively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">We knew there was going to be a larger amount of runoff because we were creating [an] impervious surface. But how do you deal with that runoff? You control it....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Both the Church\u2019s theory of the case, and the evidence presented at trial, therefore, were aimed at illustrating the extent of the measures taken by the Church to prevent increased surface water runoff due to the construction of the parking lot. At no time did the Church claim, nor did the evidence give rise to the inference, that County approval, without more, insulated the Church from liability for contributing to a private nuisance. Moreover, the trial judge instructed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">[a] person who creates or continues a nuisance is responsible for the injury or damage caused to others by the nuisance ... [and the Church is] liable if they created a change in that water flow which created a nuisance to the Wietzkes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">We therefore conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in rejecting the Wietzkes\u2019 proposed \u201cCounty approval\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">The Wietzkes further argue that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying their requested jury instruction that \u201cthe [Church was] not absolved of nuisance liability merely because other sources may have contributed to the nuisance.\u201d The Wietzkes\u2019 instruction provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">If water from the Church property contributed to flooding of the Wietzke property, it is not a defense that water from other sources may have also contributed. If you find that the water from the Church property contributed to flooding of the Wietzke property then the Church is liable for any resulting nuisance to the Wietzkes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>The Wietzkes argue that the Church presented expert testimony that water from \u201cother residences contributed to the Wietzke flooding,\u201d and thus, sought to defend on the ground that their property was one of many others releasing runoff.' The Church, in response, argues they never contended, nor did the evidence tend to establish, that the flow of surface waters from other properties was a defense for the creation of a nuisance, only that, because the natural flow of water ran from high to low, with the Wietzkes\u2019 property at the bottom, surface water flowed onto the Wietzkes\u2019 property from all directions. The Church also argues that the trial court\u2019s instruction fairly covered the relevant law on contributing sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">In the present case, the Church introduced the testimony of several experts which tended to establish that the Wietzkes\u2019 property sat lower topographically than all other nearby properties, and that because of this, water naturally flowed onto the Wietzkes\u2019 property from all directions. For instance, a County Inspector and a civil-engineering expert, reviewed the videotape adduced at trial of the June 2007 rainstorm and concluded that, contrary to the Wietzkes\u2019 contentions, the water flowing onto their property originated from more than one direction. Similarly, a County employee testified that the Wietzkes\u2019 home also sat lower topographically than the neighboring properties. Moreover, a real estate construction specialist testified that he recommended the Wietzkes regrade their property and improve the drainage system to control surface waters. As set forth in the Church\u2019s opening statement, the Church\u2019s purpose for introducing evidence that surface waters flowed from all directions onto the Wietzkes\u2019 property was to establish that the Wietzkes\u2019 property sat at the \u201cbottom of [a] hill,\u201d and in its natural state, took on surface water from all directions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">This case is about water running downhill. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about. Water runs downhill. We all know that....[T]he law does not require individuals or churches or anybody to stop the water from flowing downhill. If that\u2019s the way it goes, and you\u2019re living at the bottom of the hill, you might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>get flooded. That can happen.... When water runs downhill, stormwater management is about controlling the rate of water. And there\u2019s no one in this case who\u2019s going to tell you that the Church was not allowed to have rainwater run downhill from its property. The key is controlling the rate at which that flows.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">During closing argument, the Church again summed up their purpose for introducing evidence that the Wietzkes\u2019 property received surface water from many directions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">[T]his case is about water running downhill. It\u2019s really very simple. And we\u2019ve stuck to that the whole time. We like that topographical map. And the reason being[,] when it comes right down to it[,] the water\u2019s going to flow downhill. The water always has flowed downhill. And that\u2019s the history of this whole neighborhood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Thus, the Church\u2019s purpose for introducing evidence of the runoff from other properties was not, as has been contended by the Wietzkes, an attempt to accuse others of participating in the same nuisance. To the contrary, the Church introduced their theory of the case to negate the Wietzkes\u2019 claim that the Church\u2019s parking lot project increased the flow of surface waters onto the Wietzkes\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Moreover, the trial judge instructed that if the Church created any change in water flow, that it would be liable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR2\">The defendants in this case have asserted that the natural flow of water in the neighborhood leads to plaintiffs property. You are instructed that even if the natural flow of water in the neighborhood leads to [the Wietzkes\u2019] property, the [Church is] liable if they created a change in that water flow which created a nuisance to the Wietzkes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">We therefore conclude that the trial judge properly denied the Wietzkes\u2019 proposed \u201cother source\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">The Wietzkes also argue that the trial court erred in taking the negligence count away from the jury. Specifically, the Wietzkes dispute the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that Section 19\u201416(a) of the Montgomery County Code, which was cited in a Notice of Violation issued to the Church on June 14, 2007, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>was not \u201cdesigned to prevent the type of harm that ... ultimately occurred,\u201d and that there was no proof that the Church\u2019s violation of Section 19-16(a) \u201cwas the cause of water flooding the [Wietzkes\u2019] basement.\u201d The Church counters that the Wietzkes were not members of any such class of persons protected by Section 19-16(a), and that the testimony of the County Inspector who issued the June 14, 2007 Notice established that the Notice was not issued because the Wietzkes\u2019 home was flooded.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">A <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence may be established by proof that an individual violated an applicable statute or ordinance. <em>Brooks v. Lewin Realty III, Inc., </em>378 Md. 70, 78-80, 835 A.2d 616, 620-622 (2003). In <em>Brooks, </em>Judge John C.

To make the requisite showing of proximate cause, the claimant must show both that they are \u201cwithin the class of persons sought to be protected,\u201d and that the \u201charm suffered is of a kind which the drafters intended the statute to prevent.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 79, 835 A.2d at 621-622 (\u201cIt is the existence of this cause and effect relationship that makes the violation of a statute <em>prima facie </em>evidence of negligence.\u201d (quoting <em>Brown v.

We examined the language of the Housing Code and concluded that it imposed numerous duties upon landlords with respect to the tenants to whom they lease, to, one of which was to ensure that any leased premises was entirely free of \u201cinterior loose or peeling wall covering or paint\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\">\u00a7 706. Painting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">(b) <em>Interiors.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">(1) All interior loose or peeling wall covering or paint shall be removed and the exposed surface shall be placed in a smooth and sanitary condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">(2) No paint shall be used for interior painting of any dwelling ... unless the paint is free from any lead pigment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Baltimore City Code (2000, Supp. II 2002), Art. 13, \u00a7 706. We determined that, under the plain language of the Housing Code, it was \u201cclear that the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore mandated a <em>continuing </em>duty to keep the dwelling free of flaking, loose, or peeling paint, <em>at all limes </em>\u2018while [the dwelling is] in use,\u2019 in order for the landlord to remain in compliance with the Housing Code.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 83-84, 835 A.2d at 624. Because the Housing Code violation was issued for the presence of lead-paint in the leased apartment, we determined that the requisite \u201ccause and effect\u201d relationship existed. We concluded that, because the lead-paint provision was \u201cenacted to prevent lead poisoning in children,\u201d and that the injured child was \u201cin the class of people intended to be protected\u201d and \u201chis injury, lead poisoning, [was] the kind of injury intended to be prevented by the Code,\u201d the child had established a <em>prima facie </em>case sounding in negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 89, 835 A.2d at 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">In the case before us, the Church received two Notices for violating provisions of the Montgomery County Code relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>to erosion, sediment control and stormwater management. The November 28, 2006 Notice, which cited Section 19-7 of the Montgomery County Code, was issued when the County discovered that the Church was out of sequence with its approved construction plan. Section 19-7 of the Montgomery County Code, which sets forth a \u201csediment control\u201d permitting scheme, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">In granting any permit, the director may attach the conditions that the director deems reasonably necessary to prevent sedimentation to public or private property or any sewer, storm drain, or watercourse, to prevent the operation from being conducted in a manner hazardous to life or property, or in a manner likely to create a nuisance. Those conditions may include the erection or installation of walls, drains, dams and structures, plantings, erosion and sediment control measures or devices, furnishing necessary easements and a specified method of performing the work. These items must be identified on the sediment control plan submitted for approval. A permit must not be issued until an erosion and sediment control plan is approved by the department and the district, and the owner certifies that all land-disturbing activities will be performed pursuant to the erosion and sediment control plan....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">It is evident from the language of Section 19-7 that the County\u2019s permitting scheme was enacted, at least in part, to \u201cprevent sedimentation\u201d on \u201cprivate property,\u201d which would appear to encompass the harm the Wietzkes complain of. The Wietzkes were also required to show, however, that the Church\u2019s November 28, 2006 violation caused, at least in part, the flooding of the Wietzkes\u2019 basement. The Notice itself is unhelpful in this regard, as it states only that \u201cthe site is out of compliance due to the sequence of construction not being followed,\u201d and orders the Church to install an \u201cearth dike\u201d and \u201c[o]ther sediment controls.\u201d The \u201cInspection Summary,\u201d which accompanied the Notice, is similarly unhelpful, providing only that the Church was required to bring the construction site back into compliance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">Inspection this date reveals the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>1) The site is out of sequence for construction. A notice of violation is being issued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\">2) Install the earth dikes per sequence of construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">3) Bring the site into compliance and call for inspections per the sequence of construction and preconstruction memo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">4) If any changes are wanted, first contact the inspector and your engineer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Moreover, the Wietzke\u2019s case was silent as to whether the November 28, 2006 Notice was in any way related to the flooding of their basement. To be sure, the Wietzkes adduced evidence that the Church received the Notice, and that the Notice was issued during the same month as one of the Wietzkes\u2019 flooding incidents, but they failed to show a \u201ccause and effect relationship\u201d between the Notice and the flooding, <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 79, 835 A.2d at 621, and thus failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence as to the November 28, 2006 Notice. We therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling as to this particular Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">The June 14, 2007 Notice, which cited Section 19\u201416(a) of the Montgomery County Code, however, was issued under different circumstances. After the County discovered that sediment had actually escaped from the Church\u2019s construction site onto the neighboring private property, the County Inspector issued a Notice, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">Sediment left the site after a storm event. There was flooding in the neighborhood. Contact your engineer for a Solution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">The June 14,2007 Notice was also accompanied by an \u201cInspection Summary,\u201d which, among other details, provided that \u201c[t]here was sediment water and deposition on the property below\u201d and that \u201c[t]here was flooding of the house\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">Inspection this date reveals the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">1) A rainfall event last evening caused sediment to leave the site. The clean water diversion worked but there were wash outs on the private roadway below the site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>2) The water built up on the super silt fence and because of the head pressure of the water caused the water to be forced under the fence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\">3) There was sediment water and deposition on the property below. There was flooding of the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">4) The site is not in sequence with the plans. The parking lot area was cleared earlier and some of the area was to receive excess dirt from the pond. The dirt is now being hauled off. Complete the remaining removal of dirt (the dewatering device and riser are installed[) ]. Stabilize and install the safety fence. Call for inspection of the sediment basin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">5) A notice of violation and a civil citation are being issued. The ordinance cited in the June 14, 2007 Notice, Section 19-16(a), governs the \u201crolling], flowing], or wash[ing]\u201d of sediment from one property \u201cover the premises of another in a manner to cause damage to the premises\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">A person must not engage in any land-disturbing activity or by any action cause or permit any soil, earth, sand, gravel, rock, stone, or other material, to be deposited upon or to roll, flow, or wash upon or over the premises of another in a manner to cause damage to the premises without the express written consent of the owner of the premises affected. A person must not engage in any land-disturbing activity or by any action cause or permit any soil, earth, sand, gravel, rock, stone, or other material to be deposited to roll, flow, or wash upon or over any public street, streetimprovement, road, sewer, storm drain, watercourse, right-of-way, or any public property in a manner to damage or to interfere with the use of that property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">The language of Section 19-16(a) of the Montgomery County Code prohibits \u201cland-disturbing activity,\u201d which causes materials such as \u201csoil, earth, sand, gravel, rock, stone, or other material,\u201d from \u201cbeing deposited upon,\u201d or from \u201croll[ing], flow[ing], or wash[ing] upon or over the premises of another in a manner to cause damage.\u201d \u201cLand-disturbing activity\u201d has been defined broadly to encompass \u201c[a]ny earth movement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>and land changes which may result in soil erosion from water or wind or the movement of sediments into state waters or onto lands in the state, including tilling, clearing, grading, excavating, stripping, stockpiling, filling and related activities, and the covering of land surfaces with an impermeable material.\u201d Montgomery County Code, Section 19-1(15). Thus, in a plain meaning analysis, the ordinance clearly encompasses the type of harm the Wietzkes complain of, the washing of certain \u201cmaterials\u201d onto their property, and protects a class of persons encompassing the Wietzkes, private landowners in Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Our plain meaning analysis of Section 19-16(a) of the Montgomery County Code is bulwarked by the legislative record. Originally enacted in 1975, part of Section 19-16(a)\u2019s purpose was to prohibit certain \u201cconduct involving land disturbing activities,\u201d including those which caused \u201csoil, earth, sand, gravel, rock, stone, or other material, or liquid\u201d from being deposited upon or washing over the \u201cpremises of another.\u201d 1976 Montgomery County Laws, Chapter 14.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In 1986, the word \u201cliquid\u201d was excised from Section 19-16(a)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>\u201cremove the reference to liquid that does not contain sediment.\u201d 1986 Montgomery County Laws, Chapter 45; Summary of Proposed Amendments to Chapter 19, Article I, \u201cErosion and Sediment Control\u201d (1986). Excising the word liquid, then, was to avoid reference to \u201cpure\u201d liquids, while including reference to liquids that include sediment. Notwithstanding this nuance, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Section 19-16(a) did not protect against the harm the Wietzkes complained of was not supported, as the issue of whether the flood waters in the Wietzkes\u2019 basement bore sediment from the Church\u2019s property formed no part of the trial judge\u2019s discussion in granting the Church\u2019s motion for judgment. Moreover, at trial, the Wietzkes presented the following testimony of Ms. Malcolm, who stated that the \u201cprivate property\u201d referred to in the June 14, 2007 Notice was actually the Wietzkes\u2019 property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: [T]hat violation was issued the, the day after the Wietzkes had their June 2007 flood, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">[MS. MALCOLM]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: [0]ne of the boxes checked there is section 19-16A, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">[MS. MALCOLM]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And can you read out loud for what it says there for that box that\u2019s checked? [MS. MALCOLM]: \u201cPermitted soil to be deposited on a roadway, permitted soil to flow onto private property, or permitted soil to flow, wash, or to be deposited in a water course.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: And the private property was the Wietzke property, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\">[MS. MALCOLM]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Because the purpose of Section 19-16(a) of the Montgomery County Code was to prevent liquid containing sediment from being deposited onto the premises of another, which protects the Wietzkes, as members of a particular class, and because, various evidence, if believed and credited by the jury as favorable to the Wietzkes, could have supported a negligence claim, we conclude that the trial court erred in granting the Church\u2019s motion for judgment on the Wietzkes\u2019 negligence claim, as to the June 14, 2007 Notice, before submitting the case to the jury. As a result, we reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court as to the negligence count, as it related to Section 19-16(a), and we remand for further proceedings on the issue of negligence in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.

After amending their initial complaint, the Wietzkes proceeded against the Chesapeake Conference Association of Seventh-Day Adventists, the Chesapeake Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists, Columbia Excavating Co., Inc., and Devona Malcolm, who apparently was the project manager for the Church's construction project.

The Wietzkes raised five issues before the Court of Special Appeals, all of which are now before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-12\">1. Were the Wietzkes improperly denied a jury instruction which reflected the strict liability law of nuisance in Maryland when the instructions given by the Court failed to address strict liability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-13\">2. Do Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions 20:1 and 20:2, which fail to include strict liability, but instead require a finding of \"unreasonable conduct\", conflict with Maryland nuisance law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-14\">3. Were the Wietzkes improperly denied a jury instruction reflecting Maryland law that County approval does not absolve a Defendant of nuisance liability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-15\">4. Were the Wietzkes improperly denied a jury instruction reflecting Maryland law that a Defendant is not absolved of nuisance liability merely because other sources may have contributed to the nuisance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>5.

We believe a part of the difficulty that the Wietzkes experience with the jury instruction given is with the inclusion of the word \"conduct\u201d in the first two paragraphs of the jury instructions in which the concept of nuisance is introduced. Although the word \u201cconduct\u201d is an unfortunate addition to the nuisance pattern jury instructions, the gravamen of the instruction includes the balancing of use principles that our jurisprudence embraces. As the Court of Special Appeals noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">[The Wietzkes\u2019] arguments highlight language in the pattern instructions that we believe could be improved. We suggest that the Maryland State Bar Association Standing Committee on Pattern Jury Instructions review the instructions in question and consider a revision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-9\"><em>Wietzke, et ux. v.
