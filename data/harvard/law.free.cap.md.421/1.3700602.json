Khandpur (\u201cRespondent\u201d), charging him with professional misconduct arising out of his representation of Bhuwani S. Subedi in his application for asylum. Petitioner charged Respondent with violating Rules 1.3 (Diligence),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1.4 (Communication),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1.15 (Safekeeping Property),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 3.4(c) (Fair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>ness to Opposing Party and Counsel),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 8.4(c) and (d) (Misconduct)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d). In accordance with Maryland Rule 16-752(a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we referred the matter to the Honorable Robert A. Greenberg, of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, to conduct an evidentiary hearing and to render findings of fact and recommend conclusions of law. In response to our request, Judge Greenberg held an evidentiary hearing on September 20, 2010, and rendered the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">FINDINGS OF FACT</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Respondent was admitted to practice law in Maryland on June 11, 2001, and has since maintained a solo law practice in Montgomery County, Maryland. He was born, educated, and attended law school in India. In 1993, he was awarded an LLM by Howard University in Washington, D.C., and admitted to the District of Columbia Bar. He was staff counsel at an information technology company until he entered private practice in 1997. Since then he has been a sole practitioner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>without support staff. He handles primarily immigration matters and typically has no more than ten active files at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The hearing judge noted that Respondent \u201copened an Interest on Lawyers\u2019 Trust Account (IOLTA) at the Bank of America,\u201d in 2001. Until 2008, Respondent failed to retain monthly statements for this account and, for the period between 2006 and 2008, he did not identify which client or matter was the source of funds on his bank deposit records. He has since changed his practices to retain monthly statements and keep more detailed deposit records.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">On or about February 14, 2006, Bhuwani Shanker Subedi, a native of Nepal, entered the United States. In June 2006 a friend of Respondent\u2019s, Mohan Thapa, referred Subedi to Respondent to handle Subedi\u2019s application for asylum. In early August, Respondent met with Thapa and Subedi, explained that the asylum application would need to be filed within one year of Subedi\u2019s arrival in the United States, and agreed to represent Subedi in preparing the written application and representing him at an asylum interview. Both Respondent and his client spoke Hindi and had no trouble communicating. On or about August 8, Respondent sent his client a letter relaying their agreement: Subedi would pay a fixed fee of $1,500, to be paid in two equal installments, and Respondent would represent Subedi in his application for asylum, culminating in an asylum interview with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). If the matter ended up in immigration court, an additional fee would be negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Judge Greenberg found that Subedi made an initial $750 payment in cash \u201con a date uncertain,\u201d and that this payment was never deposited in Respondent\u2019s IOLTA. He found that Thapa provided the second $750 payment by check, which was deposited directly into Respondent\u2019s personal account on or about February 4, 2007. Although it was due by February 14, 2007\u2014one year after Subedi\u2019s arrival in the United States\u2014 Respondent did not file his client\u2019s application for asylum until on or about March 27, 2007. Respondent testified that the delay was due to the client\u2019s failure to provide essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>information, but Judge Greenberg noted that no documentation or records were produced to support this claim. Immigration authorities returned the application as incomplete on June 4. Respondent resubmitted an amended application but it was denied and the INS commenced deportation proceedings. Subedi retained new counsel and filed this grievance. Because Subedi did not testify at the hearing, Judge Greenberg did not give any weight to his complaint in determining these facts. According to the hearing judge, he \u201cbased [his] findings solely on Respondent\u2019s testimony, admissions to Bar Counsel and its representatives, and the other exhibits admitted at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">On or about September 16, 2008, Respondent met with Petitioner\u2019s investigator, Marc 0. Fiedler. Respondent told Fiedler that Subedi\u2019s payments had been deposited in Respondent\u2019s IOLTA until they were earned and agreed to provide financial records, which were not timely produced. On February 24, 2009, Respondent and Bar Counsel entered into a Conditional Diversion Agreement (CDA) under Maryland Rule 16-736, which was contingent on Respondent producing certain specific financial records to substantiate his story. Respondent provided copies of monthly bank account statements for his IOLTA, but no other documentation. When Bar Counsel informed Respondent that he had violated the CDA by failing to produce the required records, Respondent promised to get more records from his bank and provide them by May 26, 2009. On June 1, Respondent provided some additional records, but none of the records produced explained what happened to the fees paid by Subedi or Thapa. As a result, on November 18, 2009, Petitioner revoked the CDA and, subsequently, began these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Judge Greenberg concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3 (Diligence), 1.15 (Safekeeping Property), and 8.4(d) (Misconduct). He found that Respondent violated Rule 1.3 by failing to file Subedi\u2019s asylum application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>on time. Respondent violated Rule <em>1.15 by failing to keep </em>proper records for his IOLTA, failing to fully account for either the original $750 cash payment or the subsequent $750 check, and failing to deposit advance fee payments in trust until they were earned. He violated Rule 8.4(d) by falsely stating to Petitioner\u2019s investigator and in the CDA that he had deposited the prepaid funds into his IOLTA, and by failing to produce complete records, in a timely manner, after a legitimate demand by Bar Counsel, to show the receipt and distribution of trust funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Judge Greenberg concluded that there was not clear and convincing evidence that Respondent had violated Rule 8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters) or Rule 8.4(c) because Respondent\u2019s false statements were \u201cmisinformed, not devious,\u201d and his delayed production of documents was \u201ceither through laziness or ineptitude,\u201d but not \u201cdeceitful.\u201d Bar Counsel announced at the Circuit Court hearing that it would not pursue its allegation that Respondent had violated Rule 1.4 (Communication). Judge Greenberg did not address the allegation in the petition that Rule 3.4(c) (Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel) had been violated, and neither party filed an exception to this omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">We explained in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Sapero, </em>400 Md. 461, 478, 929 A.2d 483, 493 (2007):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">This Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney disciplinary proceedings. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Cherry-Mahoi </em>388 Md. 124, 152, 879 A.2d 58, 76 (2005) (citations omitted). As noted in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mahone, </em>398 Md. 257, 265-66, 920 A.2d 458, 463 (2007): \u2018We accept a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless we determine that they are clearly erroneous. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 50, 891 A.2d 1085, 1095 (2006). As to the scope of our review, we take into consideration whether the findings of fact have been proven by the requisite standard of proof set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>out in Rule 16-757(b). This Rule provides that Bar counsel has the burden of proving the averments of the petition by clear and convincing evidence, and the attorney who asserts an affirmative defense or a matter of mitigation or extenuation has the burden of proving the defense or matter of mitigation or extenuation by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Guida, </em>391 Md. at 50-51, 891 A.2d at 1095 (citing Rule 16\u2014757(b)). \u2018Weighing the credibility of witnesses and resolving any conflict in the evidence are tasks proper for the fact finder.\u2019 <em>State v. Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 750, 720 A.2d 323, 331 (1998). With regard to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, our review is de novo. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harrington, </em>367 Md. 36, 49, 785 A.2d 1260, 1267-68 (2001).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Bar Counsel filed an exception to Judge Greenberg\u2019s finding that Respondent did not violate MRPC 8.1(b) by failing to respond in a timely manner to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for records. Respondent filed two exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and two exceptions to the court\u2019s conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">First, Respondent excepts to Judge Greenberg\u2019s finding that Respondent did not keep proper records for his IOLTA because the hearing judge did not note that monthly statements were available online. Second, Respondent objects to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Subedi\u2019s first $750 payment was paid in cash on a \u201cdate uncertain,\u201d before the conclusion of the representation. Respondent maintains that the $750 check from Thapa was the first payment received, and that the second payment was not received until after the asylum interview. Respondent\u2019s third exception is to Judge Green-berg\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated MRPC 1.3 (Diligence) by filing his client\u2019s asylum application more than a month late. Fourth, Respondent takes exception to Judge Greenberg\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15 (Safekeeping Property) by receiving client funds and placing them into his personal account before they were earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Violation of MRPC 8.1</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">MRPC 8.1(a) dictates that a lawyer, in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not \u201cknowingly make a false statement of material fact,\u201d and 8.1(b) requires that a lawyer shall not \u201cknowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority....\u201d Respondent did falsely state to Petitioner\u2019s investigator and in the CDA that the two $750 payments had been deposited into his IOLTA. Judge Greenberg, however, found that Respondent was credible when he testified that the misstatements were due to Respondent\u2019s lack of support staff, and having become \u201coverwhelmed by the investigation.\u201d As a result, the hearing judge concluded that there was not clear and convincing evidence that Respondent knowingly mislead the Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Petitioner notes, correctly, that \u201cthe Hearing judge did not address the aspect of MRPC 8.1 dealing with the failure to respond to the investigator\u2019s requests for records.\u201d On two separate occasions during the disciplinary process, Respondent failed to respond to Petitioner\u2019s lawful demands for information. First, Judge Greenberg found that, at the initial September 16, 2008 meeting between Respondent and Petitioner\u2019s investigator, Respondent \u201cagreed to provide records to corroborate his contention [that the payments had been deposited into his Attorney Trust Account], but ultimately failed to do so in a timely manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Second, Judge Greenberg found that under the terms of the CDA, Respondent was required to provide specific records, namely, \u201cmonthly statements; cancelled checks; check register; information identifying funds received and disbursed in the Subedi matter; and any and all other records of deposits and disbursements involving the account.\u201d Initially, Respondent provided only monthly statements. After additional prodding from Bar Counsel, Respondent agreed to provide the remaining records by May 26, 2009. On June 1, he provided copies of some cancelled checks, but no other records. The court noted that \u201c[t]hrough the present time, Respondent has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>not provided copies of all IOLTA disbursements, or records of any transactions with Complainant, nor has he provided a satisfactory explanation as to why these records have not been produced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Respondent essentially concedes that he failed to produce these records, but argues that this failure is excusable because the Petition for disciplinary or remedial action did not provide sufficient notice of the basis for the charges Respondent faced to constitute a \u201clawful demand for records\u201d under Rule 8.1(b). Specifically, Respondent points out that \u201c[w]hile the petition sets forth specific allegations of conduct followed by assertions of what rules were violated, it does not say which allegations support which assertions,\u201d and that Maryland Rule 16-758(c)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> requires that the petition be \u201csufficiently clear and specific\u201d to give Respondent notice of the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Respondent\u2019s citation is incorrect because Rule 16-758 applies to the post-hearing phase of disciplinary proceedings, rather than to the initial investigation when the demands occurred. The language Respondent quotes is likely from Rule 16-751 (c),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which governs the form of the petition for disciplinary or remedial action. But both of the demands for information at issue here, in the initial September 16 meeting and in the CDA, were in the course of investigating Subedi\u2019s original complaint, before the Petition was filed. As a result, whether or not the Petition was \u201cclear and specific\u201d can have no bearing on whether these demands were \u201clawful\u201d or whether Respondent\u2019s failure to produce records was \u201cknowing\u201d under Rule 8.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>In any event, this Court has held that an \u201cassertion that there was no evidence that the materials requested by Bar Counsel were necessary to the investigation is immaterial, as Respondent has an obligation to provide Bar Counsel with any relevant material requested in the course of an investigation.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Obi, </em>393 Md. 643, 654, 904 A.2d 422, 428-29 (2006) (citing Md. Rule 16-731(c)(1) (\u201cBar Counsel may demand that the attorney provide information and records that Bar Counsel deems appropriate and relevant to the investigation.\u201d)). As long as Bar Counsel\u2019s demand clearly indicates which records are being sought, there is no requirement that Bar Counsel explain how the records relate to the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">A request for information by Bar Counsel does not have to come in any particular form in order to trigger the compliance requirements of MRPC 8.1. In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 760 A.2d 1108 (2000), an attorney argued that he had not violated Rule 8.1 by failing to respond to letters from Bar Counsel requesting records because the letters did not contain the word \u201cdemand.\u201d We considered that argument \u201cplainly frivolous,\u201d and held that the attorney had been \u201cput on notice.\u201d <em>Fezell, </em>361 Md. at 252, 760 A.2d at 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">In this case, the hearing judge found that Bar Counsel twice made clear and specific demands for financial records relating to Respondent\u2019s IOLTA and that neither all the documents, nor a satisfactory explanation for their absence, were ever produced. Because these findings provide clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MRPC 8.1(b) by \u201cknowingly failing] to respond to a lawful demand for information,\u201d Petitioner\u2019s exception is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Online Access to Bank Records</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Respondent excepts to Judge Greenberg\u2019s finding that \u201cMypically, the respondent did not retain monthly IOLTA statements from the bank, and for the period 2006-2008 did not identify the source of funds on deposit tickets he prepared for his IOLTA.\u201d Respondent does not contend that either of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>these statements is untrue, but argues, essentially, that the failure to keep proper records was less severe than it sounded because the statements were available online, and Respondent reviewed them regularly and \u201cwas able to identify the source of funds deposited and was able to identify which fees were earned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">It is well established that, although we conduct an independent review of the complete record relating to a disputed finding, a hearing judge\u2019s factual findings are considered <em>prima fame </em>correct and will not be overruled unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Harris, </em>366 Md. 376, 388, 784 A.2d 516, 523 (2001). <em>See also, Attorney Grievance v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 17, 741 A.2d 1143, 1152 (1999); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Kemp, </em>303 Md. 664, 674, 496 A.2d 672, 677 (1985). We have emphasized that \u201cthe hearing judge \u2018may elect to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon,\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris, </em>366 Md. at 388-89, 784 A.2d at 523 (quoting <em>Kemp, </em>303 Md. at 675, 496 A.2d at 677), because the hearing judge \u201cis in the best position to assess first hand a witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>366 Md. at 389, 784 A.2d at 523 (quoting <em>Sheridan, </em>357 Md. at 17, 741 A.2d at 1152).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Here, Respondent points only to his own testimony at the hearing to establish that the availability of online statements was part of his record-keeping procedure. Judge Greenberg found that \u201cRespondent failed to maintain records for receipt and distribution of trust funds, as required by [MRPC] 1.15(a).\u201d According to the judge\u2019s finding, \u201cto this day, [Respondent] has not been able to identify what happened to the first $750 paid by [Subedi].\u201d Although Respondent posits that he could access his account statements online, this contention overlooks Respondent\u2019s obligation to maintain records for receipt and distribution of trust funds in order to explain, verify, or corroborate his handling of client funds when requested by Bar Counsel to do so. The exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">When the Cash Payment was Received</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Respondent\u2019s second exception is to Judge Greenberg\u2019s factual finding that Subedi \u201cpaid $750.00 in cash to Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>dent, on a date uncertain, which was not deposited into the IOLTA.\u201d Respondent asserts that Subedi\u2019s initial payment was in the form of a check, which was not deposited because it was drawn on insufficient funds. Respondent alleges that the first payment he actually received in the matter was Thapa\u2019s $750 check, which was deposited into Respondent\u2019s personal account on February 4, 2007\u2014after he had done at least some work on the matter\u2014and that Respondent did not receive the remaining $750 payment until after he had completed the asylum interview, and the representation, in September 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">But this assertion is undermined by several facts in the record. Judge Greenberg, in his determinations, refers to \u201cthe court\u2019s finding that Respondent was paid $750.00 cash at the time of the first meeting with [Subedi], for which there is no accounting.\u201d The retainer agreement between the Respondent and Subedi required that the fee be paid in two installments <em>before </em>Respondent attended an \u201casylum interview\u201d for the client. It is undisputed that Respondent stated to Petitioner\u2019s investigator that the first $750 payment was in cash and the second was a check. And the CDA signed by Respondent in February of 2009 stated: \u201cRespondent was paid $1,500 as a prepaid fee for services to be provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Judge Greenberg does not mention Respondent\u2019s testimony that Subedi\u2019s initial payment was a bounced check. He must not have found this testimony to be credible, in light of the absence of any supporting documentation (such as a copy of the check) and Respondent\u2019s prior statements to Petitioner\u2019s investigator and in the CDA that the initial payment was made in cash. There is no evidence supporting Respondent\u2019s testimony and considerable evidence contradicting it, so Judge Greenberg\u2019s finding that the $750 cash payment was made before the representation was completed was not clearly erroneous. Therefore, Respondent\u2019s exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Rule 1.3\u2014Diligence</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">MRPC 1.3 requires that \u201c[a] lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d Respondent\u2019s third exception is to the hearing judge\u2019s conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>sion that Respondent violated MRPC 1.3 by filing Subedi\u2019s application for asylum more than a month late. While he does not dispute that the application was filed late, Respondent argues that there was not clear and convincing evidence that the filing was late because of his lack of diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">At the disciplinary hearing in the Circuit Court, Respondent contended that Subedi\u2019s asylum application was not filed on time because Subedi was tardy in providing essential information that Respondent needed to complete the application. Judge Greenberg did not find this testimony to be credible, finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">[b]esides Respondent\u2019s contention that he had several conversations with Complainant reminding him that this information was overdue, there are no memoranda, notes, or documents supporting this assertion. No correspondence of any kind was ever sent by Respondent to Complainant, other than the August 3 letter that served as the legal services agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Respondent also argues that, regardless of his own testimony, Petitioner has not met its burden of establishing clear and convincing evidence that Respondent was not reasonably diligent merely by proving that the filing was late, without producing some evidence of how Respondent\u2019s lack of diligence caused its lateness. Petitioner responds by pointing to Judge Greenberg\u2019s finding that Subedi\u2019s application was ultimately denied \u201cnot because information was lacking, but because it was tardy.\u201d Judge Greenberg found that the application that was ultimately submitted did not even attempt to provide an explanation beyond \u201cyes\u201d to answer the question \u201cAre you filing the application more than one year after your last arrival in the United States?\u201d He also found that the application, which was ultimately submitted in March, was returned as incomplete, but that Respondent was allowed to resubmit a supplemented application, apparently without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">It was not clearly erroneous for the hearing judge to conclude that because a late application is grounds for rejec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>tion, while an incomplete application can be supplemented later, a reasonably diligent attorney would have submitted as complete an application as possible before the deadline regardless of whether the attorney were missing information from his or her client. At absolute minimum, Respondent should have made some attempt to explain to the immigration authorities why the application was late. Because he failed to take either of these steps, and the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions are not clearly erroneous, Respondent\u2019s exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Rule 1.15(c)\u2014Safekeeping Property</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Respondent concedes that he violated MRPC 1.15(a) by failing to keep adequate records, but takes exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(c) by failing to deposit the unearned portion of each $750 payment into his IOLTA. Rule 1.15(c) requires that \u201ca lawyer shall deposit legal fees and expenses that have been paid in advance into a client trust account and may withdraw those funds for the lawyer\u2019s own benefit only as fees are earned or expenses incurred.\u201d Judge Greenberg found that the entire fee was paid before the representation was completed, and concluded that at least some portion of the fee \u201cshould have been in Respondent\u2019s IOLTA until the asylum interview was conducted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Respondent argues that the entire fee was earned when it was received, so he was not required to place any of it in his IOLTA. First, Respondent suggests that we sustain his second factual exception and conclude that Subedi\u2019s $750 cash payment was made after the representation was concluded, rather than \u201cat the time of the first meeting with Complainant.\u201d Second, Respondent argues that Thapa\u2019s $750 check was earned when it was received, six months into the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Our cases hold that fee payments, even if a flat fee, must be placed in escrow upon receipt if the work has not yet been performed at the time of payment. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Guido, </em>391 Md. 33, 53, 891 A.2d 1085, 1097 (2006). As explained above, we have overruled Respondent\u2019s exception to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Judge Greenberg\u2019s finding that the cash payment was made at the beginning of the representation. The hearing judge did not believe that Respondent could have performed substantial work on the matter, entitling him to receive payment of half of the total fee by the time this payment was made. And, as we accept the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that the cash payment came first, Thapa\u2019s $750 check was the second payment, completing Respondent\u2019s fee. At the time it was received, Respondent had not yet filed Subedi\u2019s asylum application or attended his interview. Accordingly the entire fee was not yet earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">Even if Thapa\u2019s check had been the first payment, Judge Greenberg found Respondent\u2019s \u201ctime estimate to be greatly exaggerated.\u201d The hearing judge emphasized that Respondent did not begin to argue that the fees were properly earned before they were received until after he had retained counsel in the present matter. Respondent produced no timesheets or any other documentation to demonstrate how much work he had done on the matter; hence, there is no reason to question Judge Greenberg\u2019s assessment of Respondent\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Because we accept Judge Greenberg\u2019s findings that the $750 cash payment was delivered in the beginning of the representation, but was never deposited into Respondent\u2019s Attorney Trust Account, and at least some portion of Thapa\u2019s $750 check was unearned when it was deposited into Respondent\u2019s personal account, there is ample evidence to support the conclusion that Respondent violated Rule 1.15(c). We overrule Respondent\u2019s fourth exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">SANCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u201cThe purpose of attorney disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public and not to punish the erring attorney.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Usiak, </em>418 Md. 667, 689, 18 A.3d 1, 14 (2011) (citing <em>Attorney Grievance v. Mahone, </em>398 Md. 257, 268, 920 A.2d 458, 464-65 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Kinnane, </em>390 Md. 324, 339, 888 A.2d 1178, 1187 (2005)). Sanctions protect the public when they deter future offending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>conduct and remove \u201cthose unfit to continue in the practice of law from the rolls of those authorized to practice in this State.\u201d <em>Mahone, </em>398 Md. at 268-69, 920 A.2d at 465 (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Lee, </em>393 Md. 546, 563, 903 A.2d 895, 905-906 (2006)). Sanctions should be \u201ccommensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed,\u201d taking into account the particular circumstances of each case and any aggravating or mitigating factors. <em>Id. See also, Attorney Grievance v. Stein, </em>373 Md. 531, 533, 819 A.2d 372, 375 (2003). In <em>Attorney Grievance v. DiCicco, </em>369 Md. 662, 686, 802 A.2d 1014, 1027 (2002) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Garfield, </em>369 Md. 85, 98, 797 A.2d 757, 764 (2002)), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-4\">The public interest is served when this Court imposes a sanction which demonstrates to members of this legal profession the type of conduct that will not be tolerated. By imposing such a sanction, this Court fulfils its responsibility to insist upon the maintenance of the integrity of the Bar and to prevent the transgression of an individual lawyer from bringing its image into disrepute. Therefore, the public interest is served when sanctions designed to effect general and specific deterrence are imposed on an attorney who violates disciplinary rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">In the present case, Respondent has violated Rules 1.3, 1.15(a) and (c), 8.1(b), and 8.4(d). He has failed to represent his client with reasonable diligence, failed to keep proper records for his Attorney Trust Account and properly hold client payments in trust until earned, and frustrated Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation by carelessly making false statements and knowingly failing to produce documents demanded by Bar Counsel. These failures, as determined by the hearing judge, were the result of respondent\u2019s \u201claziness or ineptitude,\u201d rather than an intent to deceive. Our task is to determine the proper sanction for an attorney\u2019s wrongdoing in accordance with Md. Rule 16-759(c).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Petitioner recommends that this Court sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>pend Respondent indefinitely. Respondent acknowledges that he has committed some wrongdoing, but recommends that we impose a reprimand. An indefinite suspension from the practice of law is the appropriate sanction to issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">To support its recommendation for an indefinite suspension, Petitioner analogizes this case to <em>Attorney Grievance v. McCulloch, </em>397 Md. 674, 687-689, 919 A.2d 660, 667-69 (2007). In that case, an attorney was suspended indefinitely for violating Rules 1.4(a)(3), 1.15(a), 1.16(d), and 8.4(b), (c) and (d) by depositing an unearned retainer directly into her operating account, spending it, and, after her client discharged her, failing to promptly refund the unearned fee or respond to numerous communications from her client. Bar Counsel and the Commission recommended disbarment, but we determined that McCulloch\u2019s misconduct was mitigated because she accepted responsibility for her actions, showed remorse, had no prior disciplinary history, and the hearing judge\u2019s findings as to McCulloch\u2019s level of culpability were ambiguous. <em>See McCulloch, </em>397 Md. at 688-89, 919 A.2d at 668 (finding ambiguity where the hearing judge found, on one hand, \u201cthat the respondent\u2019s conduct violated each of the subsections of Rule 8.4 ...,\u201d and referred to \u201cthe respondent\u2019s spending of the unearned portion of the retainer as \u2018basic misappropriation,\u2019 \u201d and, on the other hand, the hearing judge found that \u201cthese actions [did not] result[] from the requisite criminal intent to constitute theft\u201d). In the present case, Petitioner acknowledges that Respondent\u2019s misconduct was less egregious than McCulloch\u2019s, but argues that because Respondent violated Rule 8.1 by failing to produce records for Bar Counsel, and that this finding was not a component of McCulloch\u2019s charges, the same sanction is appropriate. Respondent counters this argument by pointing to language in the <em>McCulloch </em>opinion which indicates that McCulloch \u201cfail[ed] to answer Bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Counsel\u2019s request for information about this matter for almost five months,\u201d <em>McCulloch, </em>397 Md. at 687, 919 A.2d at 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">The conduct in <em>McCulloch </em>was perhaps more egregious than in the present case because McCulloch\u2019s failure to appropriately keep client funds in trust was found to be a violation of Rule 8.4(c), \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation,\u201d however, as noted above, it was determined that McCulloch did not possess the requisite criminal intent to constitute the crime of Theft. In the case at bar, Respondent\u2019s violation of Rule 8.1 was found to be a result of his carelessness in keeping and producing records, managing his accounts, and responding to Petitioner\u2019s investigation. By finding that Respondent did not violate Rule 8.4(c), the hearing judge found that Respondent\u2019s conduct did not amount to dishonest or fraudulent behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Petitioner also argues that this case resembles <em>Attorney Grievance v. Lawson, </em>401 Md. 536, 579, 581-86, 933 A.2d 842, 867, 869-71 (2007), in which we imposed a sanction of an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply after one year for an attorney\u2019s violation of Rules 1.4(a), 1.5, 1.15, 1.16(d), 8.4(c) and (d), and Md. Rules 16-604 and 16-609. Although that attorney was unremorseful and uncooperative throughout the disciplinary process, we concluded that his relative youth and inexperience, along with the lack of any prior disciplinary record, warranted a less severe sanction than disbarment. Again, that was a case involving a violation of Rule 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Finally, Petitioner cites to <em>Attorney Grievance v. Webster, </em>402 Md. 448, 473-74, 937 A.2d 161, 175-76 (2007) and <em>Attorney Grievance v. James, </em>385 Md. 637, 665-66, 870 A.2d 229, 246 (2005), in which attorneys were disbarred for mishandling client funds. But, in those cases, we concluded that the violations unequivocally amounted to intentional theft of client funds. In the present case, however, the hearing judge did not find that Respondent intentionally or knowingly violated his client\u2019s trust, nor did the hearing judge make any finding with regard Respondent\u2019s level of intent with regard to his handling of trust funds. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm. v. Drew, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>341 Md. 139, 154, 669 A.2d 1344, 1351 (1996) (involving a case where we imposed a suspension where an attorney failed to safe keep property in the attorney\u2019s trust account, absent clear and convincing evidence to support intentional misappropriation); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Maignan, </em>390 Md. 287, 296-97, 888 A.2d 344, 349 (2005) (holding that an indefinite suspension was the appropriate sanction where evidence in the record showed that the attorney spent funds that belonged to his client, but Bar Counsel did not argue that the misappropriation was intentional, but did argue that the attorney\u2019s failure to maintain client funds in a proper trust account was also a violation of MRPC 1.15(a) and (b) and 8.4(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">In the present case, in an effort to further investigate allegations of attorney misconduct, Bar Counsel directed Respondent to account for and show that he had properly safeguarded funds he initially claimed to have deposited into his attorney trust account. In response to that request and in violation of the Conditional Diversion Agreement entered into with Bar Counsel, Respondent failed to establish that he had made the deposits into the trust account. Bar Counsel did not argue, however, that Respondent\u2019s misappropriation of client funds was intentional or knowing. Similarly, the hearing judge did not find that Respondent\u2019s mishandling of the advance retainer was intentional or knowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">As to Respondent\u2019s conduct in failing to produce records essential to Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation, the hearing judge did not characterize Respondent\u2019s conduct as intentional or deceitful, but assessed that Respondent\u2019s conduct was the result of \u201claziness or ineptitude.\u201d In Bar Counsel\u2019s request for this Court to impose a sanction, he concedes that the hearing judge \u201cwas not willing to characterize Respondent\u2019s conduct as deceitful by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Bar Counsel, however, points to the fact that the hearing judge found Respondent\u2019s response, to Bar Counsel\u2019s legitimate demands in connection with the investigation and Conditional Diversion Agreement, was \u201cunjustified and inexcusable, and prejudicial to the thorough and orderly investigation contemplated\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the attorney disciplinary rules and in violation of MRPC 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Respondent, arguing for a reprimand, relies upon <em>Attorney Grievance v. Ugwuonye, </em>405 Md. 351, 952 A.2d 226 (2008), where we imposed a 90 day suspension as a sanction for an attorney\u2019s misconduct. Respondent argues that his misconduct was less severe than Ugwuonye\u2019s. In that case, the hearing judge found that Ugwuonye had violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 3.4(d) with respect to one client, and Rules 1.5, 1.15, and 1.16(d) with respect to another. Although the violations were quite serious, we found that Ugwuonye\u2019s misconduct was mitigated because he \u201cdid not act with dishonest, deceitful, or fraudulent intent, lack[ed] a prior disciplinary record, made after-the-fact efforts to ameliorate the circumstances that led to a number of his violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct and was cooperative with Bar Counsel throughout the investigation....\u201d <em>Ugwuonye, </em>405 Md. at 375, 952 A.2d at 240. Here, to the contrary, Respondent failed to produce records essential to Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation, mislead Bar Counsel, albeit not intentionally, about the existence of those records, and violated MRPC 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Respondent also points to <em>In re Mance, </em>980 A.2d 1196, 1208-09 (D.C.2009), where an attorney was given a \u201cpublic censure\u201d for claiming prepaid fees before they were earned, even though the attorney had already been disciplined on three prior occasions. But the attorney\u2019s conduct in that case was not compounded by a lack of diligence and an uncooperative response to Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation, as it was here.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">It is most significant, in the present case, that Judge Greenberg did not find that Respondent was acting from a dishonest motive. Although Judge Greenberg did not make an explicit finding regarding Respondent\u2019s intent, i.e., whether Respondent\u2019s misappropriation of client funds was intentional, knowing or negligent, the judge did find that \u201cRespondent\u2019s acts and omissions during the investigation were not intentional\u201d and did not violate MRPC 8.4(c), which involves \u201cdishones<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d Moreover, Petitioner did not except to the hearing judge\u2019s findings with regard to MRPC 8.4(c). In addition, in the Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law with regard to MRPC 8.4(c) that Petitioner submitted to the hearing judge, Petitioner did not argue that Respondent\u2019s violations of MRPC 1.15 provided a basis for a finding of intentional or knowing misappropriation or dishonesty; Petitioner relied, instead, exclusively on Respondent\u2019s false statements to Bar Counsel\u2019s investigator and in the CDA to make the case against Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">Further, in discussing why he did not feel that Respondent had violated MRPC 8. 1, Judge Greenberg noted that \u201cthere is abundant evidence that Respondent\u2019s bookkeeping and accounting methods were slipshod.\u201d Judge Greenberg elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">It was the sense of the court, which had the opportunity to listen to Respondent\u2019s explanation, that he\u2014a sole practitioner without any support staff, unrepresented by knowledgeable counsel\u2014was a bit overwhelmed by the investigation. <em>His sloppy record-keeping, including the maintenance of the case file itself, certainly was of no assistance in trying to reconstruct what had become of the Subedi fee. </em>Having had this opportunity to observe his demeanor at trial, the court cannot find by clear and convincing evidence that there was a violation of this rule, but finds his statements to Bar Counsel and its investigator were misinformed, not devious. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">From the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent had violated MRPC 8.4(d), it is clear that Judge Greenberg\u2019s focus was on Respondent\u2019s failure to respond, in a timely manner, to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for essential records and the impact of that misconduct on the disciplinary process. This focus is also evident in the hearing judge\u2019s assessment of Respondent\u2019s character when Judge Greenberg pointed out that \u201cRespondent acknowledged at trial that he had the IOLTA bank statements in his garage, records which he could have produced at any time.\u201d Also, the hearing judge mentioned that, \u201cAfter counsel was retained, many of the other requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>records did indeed appear, albeit too late to prevent charges in this case.\u201d In that regard, ultimately, the hearing judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\"><em>While the court has not been willing to characterize Respondent\u2019s conduct as deceitful by clear and convincing evidence, </em>the \u2018day late and dollar short\u2019 manner in which response was made to legitimate demands by Bar Counsel was unjustified and inexcusable, and prejudicial to ... thorough and orderly investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">We have held that \u201c[wjhere there is no finding of intentional misappropriation ... and where the misconduct did not result in financial loss to any of the respondent\u2019s clients, an indefinite suspension ordinarily is the appropriate sanction.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. DiCicco, </em>369 Md. 662, 687, 802 A.2d 1014, 1028 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Sperling, </em>380 Md. 180, 844 A.2d 397, 399 (2004) (imposing an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply for admission after 90 days where an attorney \u201cunintentionally and knowingly\u201d violated MRPC 1. 15, and 8.4(c) and had been previously disciplined); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Seiden, </em>373 Md. 409, 818 A.2d 1108 (2003) (imposing an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply after 30 days where an attorney unintentionally misappropriated client funds and violated MRPC 1.1, 1.15(b), and 8.4(a) and (d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Goff, </em>399 Md. 1, 922 A.2d 554 (2007), we imposed a sanction of indefinite suspension with the right to apply for readmission after 60 days. Although the hearing judge found that the attorney had violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.15(a) and (d), 8.1(b), 8.4(d) and 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, the hearing judge declined to find by clear and convincing evidence violations of MRPC 5.3(b), 8.1(a), 8.4(c) and Maryland Rule 16-609.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">In <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n. v. Kramer, </em>325 Md. 39, 51, 599 A.2d 100, 106-107 (1991), a case involving an attorney\u2019s inattention and sloppiness in managing his attorney trust account, we imposed an indefinite suspension, as a sanction for the attorney\u2019s misconduct, with the right to reapply for admission to the Bar after one year. In that case, the attorney failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>maintain any records or to render any accounting of funds that were in the attorney trust account. In addition, the attorney did not know what became of the money that had been deposited in the account. We said, \u201ccoupled with his cavalier attitude about the missing records, [Kramer\u2019s misappropriation of client funds] is at least gross negligence and unacceptable for a member of the bar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Although Judge Greenberg found that Respondent has taken steps to correct his problematic record-keeping, \u201cand now retains monthly statements, while preparing more detailed deposit tickets[,]\u201d his prior practice of failing to retain monthly IOLTA statements from the bank for over two years and failure to identify the sources of funds on deposit tickets he prepared for his trust account, in our view, cannot be overlooked. Therefore, consistent with our dispositions in <em>Goff, McCulloch, DiCicco, </em>and other cases involving unintentional misappropriations <em>and </em>out of concern for the protection of the public as a result of Respondent\u2019s inattention to the management of his attorney trust account and the mishandling of client funds in this case, we are persuaded that Petitioner\u2019s recommendation of an indefinite suspension is the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In the present case, the hearing judge believed that the advanced fee of $1,500 was ultimately earned, even though some part of the fee was deposited in Respondent\u2019s personal account prematurely. Although the hearing judge did not comment upon Respondent\u2019s state of mind as to his deposits of client funds into his personal account, at the very least, the evidence supports a finding that Respondent was careless in handling his attorney trust account and responding to Bar Counsel\u2019s demands for documents and an accounting. In addition to the safekeeping violation, Respondent has failed to diligently represent his client and failed to respond to a lawful demand for information from Bar Counsel. As we said in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 255, 760 A.2d 1108, 1119 (2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>The practice of law carries with it special responsibilities of self-regulation, and attorney cooperation with disciplinary authorities is of the utmost importance to the success of the process and the integrity of the profession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Accordingly, Respondent is suspended indefinitely from the practice of law in this State, effective thirty days from the date of the filing of this opinion. He may apply for readmission 60 days after the effective date of his suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-715(0, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND AGAINST JAGJOT S.

I hope thereby not to see this case offered in the future as an authority for some purpose other than for what it holds.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">The misappropriation of client funds \u201cis a most egregious violation,\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 489, 671 A.2d 463, 483 (1996), and, if intentional, \u201cordinarily will result in disbarment in the absence of compelling extenuating circumstances justifying a lesser sanction.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 406, 773 A.2d 463, 480 (2001). Negligent misappropriation, on the other hand, does not usually result in disbarment, but is more often met with an indefinite suspension, frequently with a right to reapply for reinstatement after a specified period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-13\">Because of the way that Bar Counsel pursued and argued the violations charged in the present case, there was no need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>for the hearing judge (or this Court) to determine conclusively for purposes of MRPC 1.15 whether Khandpur\u2019s misappropriation (i.e., depositing the $750.00 check in his personal bank account) was intentional or negligent. This is so because Bar Counsel did not assert that the misconduct upon which the MRPC 1.15 violation was predicated was the relevant misconduct for purposes of determining whether Khandpur violated MRPC 8.4(c). Rather, Bar Counsel argued that Khandpur\u2019s misconduct with regard to the charge of violation of MRPC 8.1 supported the 8.4(c) charge. As the Court\u2019s opinion points out, the hearing judge rejected Bar Counsel\u2019s discriminating argument with respect to MRPC 8.4(c), finding that the MRPC 8.1 misconduct was negligent and not intentional. Majority op. at 7, 25 A.3d at 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Had Bar Counsel contended that Khandpur\u2019s MRPC 1.15 misconduct supported the 8.4(c) charge, I would have argued strenuously with my colleagues to remand the case to the hearing judge to determine explicitly whether Khandpur\u2019s misconduct under MRPC 1.15 was intentional or negligent, as such a finding would be integral in addressing the MRPC 8.4(c) charge and the appropriate sanction. Indeed, the Court\u2019s opinion concedes that the hearing judge did not find or conclude that Khandpur\u2019s misconduct under MRPC 1.15 was intentional or negligent. <em>See </em>Majority op. at 17, 25 A.3d at 174-75 (\u201c[T]he hearing judge did not ... make any finding with regard [to] Respondent\u2019s level of intent with regard to his handling of trust funds.\u201d). As it is, the Court\u2019s opinion and sanction is appropriate for this case, as it was presented and argued to the hearing judge and this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Judge ADKINS authorizes me to state that she joins in the views expressed in this concurring opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
