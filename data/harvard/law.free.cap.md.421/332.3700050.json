After responding to a domestic altercation between Petitioner Mark E. Furda and his wife, Montgomery County police seized Furda\u2019s extensive collection of weapons and transported him to the hospital for a mental health evaluation. Furda was later transferred to a behavioral health facility. Upon release, Furda requested the return of his firearms, which a judge denied on the grounds that Furda had been committed to a mental institution and was, therefore, prohibited from possessing a firearm. Although Furda asked the judge to reconsider, he did not wait for the judge\u2019s response before traveling to a gun store to acquire a new gun. When filling out the application to purchase a firearm, Furda certified, under penalty of perjury, that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>not been committed to a mental institution. His application was denied, and the State subsequently charged him with perjury and false information in a firearm application. A trial court later convicted him of these two offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In two separate cases, Furda appealed both the judge\u2019s denial of his motion for the return of his firearms and his two convictions. In one case the Court of Special Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of Furda\u2019s motion for the return of his weapons, but in another, it affirmed Furda\u2019s convictions. In the latter case, the Court held that the judge\u2019s erroneous order could still serve as a predicate for perjury and false information in a firearm application because the order was in effect at the time Furda completed the application under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Displeased with this decision, Furda petitioned this Court, presenting the following issues for our review:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>1) In the State\u2019s required application to purchase a firearm, is a question asking whether the applicant had ever been adjudicated mentally defective or had been committed to a mental institution sufficiently unambiguous to serve as the predicate for a conviction of perjury and false information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">2) Is a statement on a State firearm application that the applicant had not been committed to a mental institution, made while the applicant was under a court order deeming him to have been \u201ccommitted,\u201d sufficient evidence to support a conviction for perjury and false statement when the court order was later overturned on appeal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">For the reasons articulated below, we hold that the relevant question was not impermissibly ambiguous and that Furda knowingly and -willfully answered that question falsely. Accordingly, we affirm Furda\u2019s convictions for perjury and false information.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">The events of this case were triggered by a domestic dispute between Furda and his wife, Karen. On February 27, 2003, Karen initiated a petition for an emergency mental evaluation of her husband, alleging that he had made threatening gestures with a gun against himself and against her. A SWAT team from the Office of the Sheriff for Montgomery County served Furda with the petition that night, and later seized many of his weapons, including fifteen rifles, one handgun, and ammunition. The SWAT team then transported Furda to Montgomery County General Hospital for psychiatric evaluation. Later, upon certification of two doctors, Furda was transferred to the Potomac Ridge Behavioral Health facility, where he was kept even though he refused to sign in. He was discharged from Potomac Ridge on March 4, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>A year and a half after Furda\u2019s release from Potomac Ridge, the Montgomery County Circuit Court issued an order prohibiting Furda from contacting his wife and requiring that he surrender all firearms to law enforcement for the order\u2019s duration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The order was to be in effect from its issuance on September 21, 2004 until March 16, 2006. By January 31, 2005, however, Furda violated this order when he contacted and threatened Karen, leading the Circuit Court to sentence him to a suspended one-year term of incarceration and two years of probation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">On October 31, 2007, after his probation period had ended, Furda filed a Motion for Return of Property seeking the release of the firearms and all other property seized by the SWAT team in 2003. Following a hearing eight days later, the Circuit Court denied Furda\u2019s request in part (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cDenial Order\u201d), allowing only the return of \u201citems appearing on the inventory that are not firearms or ammunition!].]\u201d The court would not permit Furda to recover the firearms, finding that \u201c[u]pon the evidence presented.... Furda is considered a prohibited person under 18 U.S.C. Section 922(g)(4)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and is thereby prohibited from possessing firearms.\u201d The court determined that this prohibition extended to the Montgomery County Code, which prevents a person from possessing a firearm if that person \u201chas been confined to any hospital or institution for treatment of a mental disorder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>or for mental illness[.]\u201d Montgomery County Code-\u00a7 57-9(d). The court did not, however, determine whether Furda was also prevented from possessing firearms under State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">On December 3, 2007, Furda moved for reconsideration of the Denial Order on the grounds that his evaluation by the behavioral health facility did not constitute commitment under federal law. The court denied that motion in a January 15, 2008 order. According to Furda, neither he nor his counsel received this order until \u201csome time later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">On January 24, 2008, Furda walked into Gilbert\u2019s Guns, his motion for reconsideration in hand,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and applied to buy a Ruger Mark III, a .22 caliber, semiautomatic.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Relevant to the case here, Question 8 on the Maryland State Police Application and Affidavit to Purchase a Regulated Firearm asked: \u201cHave you ever been adjudicated mentally defective or have you been committed to a mental institution?\u201d Furda answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Furda also signed the bottom of the application, certifying the following: \u201cI, the below signed Transferee/Voluntary Registrant, certify under the penalty of perjury that the above answers are true and correct and that I am not prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing a regulated firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Based on his statements on the application, Furda was charged with perjury and making a false statement in a firearm application. At trial, Furda testified that he did not believe that he had been committed to an institution, instead characterizing his stay at Potomac Ridge as an evaluation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">I was submitted to an emergency evaluation petition through the courts by my now ex-wife.... [She] filed a motion [of] false statements ... saying that I had threatened her and the children, which I had never done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">... [T]he Montgomery County Sheriffs Department was sent to my house, and did take me to Montgomery General.... I was then transferred to Potomac Ridge for the I guess 72-hour evaluation that is allowable by the courts ... I had ... read the discharge [which] stated that the doctor had a dilemma as to whether or not to commit me. However, there was no psychosis, no withdrawals, or bad presence, or anything like that. And that without any type of hearing or any adjudication I was released.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">When cross-examined, Furda admitted that he had taken his motion of reconsideration to the gun store and that he understood that such a motion meant that he was \u201casking [the court] to reconsider [its] denial of [his] request[.]\u201d Yet, he also maintained that he did not willingly and knowingly make a false affidavit, explaining that \u201clegally I\u2019m not prohibited. If I\u2019ve never been committed, I am not a prohibited] person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Furda\u2019s attorney also took the stand for the defense, and testified that he had advised Furda of the contents of the Denial Order before Furda\u2019s trip to Gilbert\u2019s Guns. This advice included a discussion of the court\u2019s finding that Furda had been involuntarily committed to an institution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Now, ... you said [that] you discussed [the Denial Order] with your client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">[FURDA\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Yes, the first order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ari\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... Unquestionably then Mr. Furda understood that [the court] ruled that he was a prohibited] person because he was involuntarily committed, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>[FURDA\u2019S ATTORNEY]: That would be the essence of [the Denial Order].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: And you discussed that with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">[FURDA\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Furda\u2019s attorney was also aware that, under the terms of the order, Furda could not purchase a firearm, and that this prohibition would remain in effect until and unless the order was overturned on appeal. Accordingly, Furda\u2019s attorney testified that, although he believed Furda was not ineligible to purchase additional firearms, \u201c[he] would have cautioned [Furda] against it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">At the trial\u2019s conclusion, the court found as a \u201cfirst-level fact\u201d that Furda knew that the court had made a finding that Furda had been committed to a mental institution, and that the Denial Order was still in effect at the time Furda completed the firearms application. Accordingly, \u201cthe false statement was not the result of confusion or an honest mistake.\u201d Rather, Furda knew that his answer to Question 8 was false and he \u201cattempted to deceive the Maryland State Police in answering Question 8 falsely because he wanted a gun and he didn\u2019t want to put down the truth.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, the court convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Furda of perjury and false information in a firearm application. The court then sentenced Furda to ten years incarceration, with all but five years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">In two separate matters, Furda appealed both his convictions and the denial of his motion for reconsideration to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court rendered its decision in the protective order case on July 2, 2010, and in the perjury case four days later. In the former, the intermediate appellate court held that Furda had not been \u201ccommitted\u201d to a mental institution as that term was contemplated in 18 U.S.C. Section 922(g)(4), and thus that the circuit court erred by denying Furda\u2019s motion for the return of his weapons on that ground. <em>See Furda v. State, </em>193 Md.App. 371, 997 A.2d 856 (2010) <em>(\u201cFurda </em>I\u201d). Regardless, in the latter case, the Court held that Furda was still guilty of perjury and providing false information in a firearm application because he knew that his answer to Question 8 was contrary to the Denial Order, which was still in effect when he completed the application. <em>See Furda v. State, </em>194 Md.App. 1, 1 A.3d 528 (2010) <em>(\u201cFurda II </em>\u201d). Thus, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">I. The Alleged Ambiguity Of Question 8</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Furda first attacks the language of Question 8 (\u201cHave you ever been adjudicated mentally defective or have you been committed to a mental institution?\u201d), arguing that it is impermissibly ambiguous and cannot serve as the basis for his convictions. His challenge is two-pronged. The first ambiguity, he contends, lies in the compound nature of Question 8, which permits a legitimate \u201canswer \u2018no\u2019 to [the question of] whether a person has ever been adjudicated a mental defective or whether a person has been committed to a mental institution.\u201d (emphasis in original). Second, he claims that the word \u201ccommitted\u201d is susceptible to multiple meanings, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>pending on whether federal,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> State,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or local law applies. Furda emphasizes that the trial court determined that he was a prohibited person under federal and local law, but not under State law, and the application was a State form for the purchase of firearms. Accordingly, he believes that his answer \u201cno\u201d to the commitment portion of Question 8 was a true statement. We take each of these contentions in turn, starting with a general review of some Federal perjury cases involving responses to allegedly ambiguous questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u201c[A] prosecution for a false statement ... under the perjury statutes cannot be based on an ambiguous question where the response may be literally and factually correct.\u201d <em>United States v. Vesaas, </em>586 F.2d 101, 104 (8th Cir.1978) (citing <em>Bronston v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 352, 362, 93 S.Ct. 595, 602, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973)). Yet, \u201c[a]s a general rule, the fact that there is some ambiguity in a falsely answered question will not shield the [defendant] from a perjury or false statements prosecution.\u201d <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>828 F.2d 1010, 1015 (3d Cir.1987). An inquiry is not rendered impermissibly or fundamentally ambiguous merely because \u201cthe words used in the question have different meanings in differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ent situations!)]\u201d <em>United States v. Lighte, </em>782 F.2d 367, 375 (2d Cir.1986). Rather, the question is fundamentally ambiguous when \u201cit [is] entirely unreasonable to expect that the defendant understood the question[ ] posed to him.\u201d <em>United States v. Slawik, </em>548 F.2d 75, 86 (3d Cir.1977). Moreover, \u201c[a] defense to a charge of perjury may not be established by isolating a statement from context, giving it in this manner a meaning entirely different from that which it has when the testimony is considered as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonacorsa, </em>528 F.2d 1218, 1221 (2d Cir.1976). Accordingly, a court should \u201cconsider the context of the question and [the defendant\u2019s] answers, as well as other extrinsic evidence relevant to [the defendant\u2019s] understanding of the questions posed in the Form.\u201d <em>United States v. Culliton, </em>328 F.3d 1074, 1079 (9th Cir.2003). Whether a question is fundamentally ambiguous is a matter of law that courts review <em>de novo. See Lighte, </em>782 F.2d at 375 (\u201cquestions posed may be insufficient as a matter of law to support the perjury conviction ... [and] a reviewing court may override a jury determination.\u201d). We apply these cases in assessing Furda\u2019s challenges to Question 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">With respect to the compound nature of a question, we have found several Federal cases holding that a compound question is not always fundamentally ambiguous. In <em>United States v. Heater, </em>63 F.3d 311 (4th Cir.1995), the Fourth Circuit affirmed the defendant\u2019s perjury conviction based upon a false declaration he made to a grand jury regarding his use of marijuana. On appeal, the defendant attacked the question at issue\u2014whether he had ever bought <em>or </em>sold marijuana-arguing that it was a \u201cmisleading double question[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument, saying that the defendant \u201cdramatically overstates the complexity of the question[] to which he had to respond.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court reasoned that, \u201cput in context, the question[] [was] understandable and plainly clear enough to elicit informed and intelligent responses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Yasak, </em>884 F.2d 996, 1002 (7th Cir.1989)). Thus, there was no fundamental ambiguity that would have required the court to remove the question from the jury\u2019s consideration. <em>Id. See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>also United States v. Bollin, </em>264 F.3d 391, 411 (4th Cir.2001) (question of \u201cwhether [defendant\u2019s coconspirator] \u2018directed, coordinated, or orchestrated\u2019 the disbursement of funds to the investors\u201d was not fundamentally ambiguous because all three possibilities \u201crefer to some conduct on [the co-conspirator\u2019s] part intended to bring about the repayment of investors.\u201d). Applying similar reasoning in this case, we conclude that the question was not impermissibly ambiguous just because an applicant was required to answer \u201cyes\u201d if either of the two events had occurred (\u201cadjudicated a mental defective\u201d or \u201ccommitted to a mental institution\u201d). Underlying Furda\u2019s argument for ambiguity is the assumption that, if the answer to one subpart is \u201cno,\u201d the applicant may legitimately answer \u201cno\u201d to the full compound question. Yet nothing in the wording of the question suggests or even permits this interpretation. The word \u201cor\u201d is not ambiguous: it means that if either of the events have occurred, then the applicant\u2019s answer should be \u201cyes.\u201d We see no ambiguity in the question arising from its compound nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">We next consider Furda\u2019s second contention\u2014that the word \u201ccommitted\u201d is susceptible to multiple meanings, depending on whether federal, state or local law applies. Again, federal case law is helpful. Federal courts have held that a term is not impermissibly ambiguous simply because, when considered in isolation, it may have two plausible meanings. In <em>United States v. Camper, </em>384 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2004), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the false statement conviction of a defendant who, on an employment criminal history questionnaire, answered \u201cno\u201d to the question \u201cHave you been convicted ... [of] [u]nlawful possession, use, sale, distribution or manufacture of an explosive or weapon[,]\u201d even though he had pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charge of \u201ccarrying a loaded firearm in public without being a registered owner....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1074. The Court recognized that, although there were two \u201cplausible meanings\u201d to the phrase \u201cunlawful possession,\u201d extrinsic evidence shed light as to \u201cwhich construction [the defendant] placed on the question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1078. Specifically, when he had pleaded guilty to carrying a loaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>firearm, he had \u201cused the phrase \u2018unlawfully possessed\u2019 to refer to the offense[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Court reasoned that a \u201creasonable trier of fact could conclude ... that the questionnaire asked, and [the defendant] answered, a question about convictions for possessing a gun in an unlawful manner[,]\u201d meaning that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">There is comparable extrinsic evidence in this case. The circuit court\u2019s order referenced federal and local law. Furda\u2019s own lawyer testified that he had advised Furda, and Furda \u201c[unquestionably\u201d understood, that the judge had \u201cruled that he was a prohibited] person because he was involuntarily committedf.]\u201d Furda\u2019s motion for reconsideration challenged the court\u2019s finding that he had been \u201ccommitted\u201d under federal and local law. He brought that motion to the gun store, and engaged in an extended conversation with the store\u2019s owner, referencing the motion. Had Furda believed that Question 8\u2019s use of the word \u201ccommitted\u201d was somehow different than the court\u2019s use of that term in its order, then there would have been no need to bring and discuss his motion for reconsideration. This is sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that, when he went to Gilbert\u2019s Guns, Furda understood that the Denial Order and application used a similar definition of the term \u201ccommitment,\u201d that the Denial Order was still in effect, and that \u201cthe false statement was not the result of confusion or an honest mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Furthermore, it is no defense that the circuit court\u2019s findings were made pursuant to Federal and local law, and not the Maryland statutory definition. <em>See </em>Md.Code, Public Safety Article, \u00a7 5-118 and \u00a7 5-133(b)(7) (defining \u201ccommitment\u201d as when a person \u201chas been confined for more than 30 consecutive days\u201d to a mental institution). Question 8 was not limited to \u201ccommitment\u201d under Maryland State law, and was phrased broadly enough to include multiple definitions of the term \u201ccommitment.\u201d Indeed, it is the question that precedes question 8 which limits its inquiry to the state-law prohibition in section 5-133(b)(7),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> specifically asking: \u201cHave you ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>spent more than 30 consecutive days in any medical institution for treatment of a mental disorder or disorders?\u201d Question 8, which follows this narrower question, must be interpreted to ask for different information.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">As further evidence that Furda was required, under the circuit order, to answer \u201cyes\u201d on the application, the language of Question 8 tracks, almost <em>verbatim, </em>the language of 18 U.S.C. Section 922(g)(4). <em>Compare </em>18 U.S.C Section 922(g)(4) (a prohibited person is someone \u201cwho has been adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed to a mental institution\u201d) <em>with </em>Question 8 (\u201cHave you ever been adjudicated mentally defective or have you been committed to a mental institution?\u201d). Furda was well aware of the Federal law. He attended the hearing on his motion to recover firearms, and thus was aware of the State\u2019s contention that he had been \u201ccommitted\u201d within the meaning of the Federal statute. The Denial Order was issued before Furda went into Gilbert\u2019s Guns, and there is no dispute that Furda knew of the contents of that order and discussed its significance with the owner of the store before completing the firearm application. The Denial Order described Furda as a prohibited person under 18 U.S.C. Section 922(g)(4) because he had \u201cbeen involuntarily <em>committed </em>to a mental institution[.]\u201d (emphasis added). Once again, this language tracks exactly the language of Question 8, leading any reasonable person to conclude that the term \u201ccommitted\u201d had the same meaning in the application as it did in the federal statute. If Furda had any doubt, he should have disclosed the Denial Order in conjunction with his answer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">In sum, we agree with the State\u2019s averment that These facts yield the reasonable inferences that: (1) Furda knew that federal and state statutory schemes evince concern about gun ownership by people with mental illness; (2) Furda knew that the federal definition of commitment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>broader than the Maryland definition; (3) Furda knew that the application sought disclosure of any commitment within the federal law definition; and (4) Furda knew that he had been deemed committed, at least within the meaning of federal law[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Ultimately, our examination of all of the circumstances of this case leads us to the conclusion that Question 8 is not fundamentally or impermissibly ambiguous and can serve as the basis for Furda\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">II. The Effect of Appellate Reversal of the Denial Order</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Furda also challenges his convictions on the grounds that his answer to Question 8 was truthful in hindsight, in light of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s reversal of the original order denying Furda the return of his firearms. In essence, Furda claims that the intermediate appellate court\u2019s decision in <em>Furda I </em>should be applied retroactively to the time he completed the firearm purchase application.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">In Maryland, a person \u201cmay not knowingly give false information or make a material misstatement in a firearm application for a dealer\u2019s license.\u201d Md.Code (2003), \u00a7 5-139(a) of the Public Safety Article (\u201cPS\u201d). Additionally, a person commits perjury if he \u201cwillfully and falsely make[s] an oath or affirmation as to a material fact ... in an affidavit required by any state, federal, or local law[.]\u201d Md.Code (2002, 2007 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 9-101 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d). The Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions (\u201cMPJI-CR\u201d) address the requirements of proving perjury in an affidavit as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">In order to convict the defendant of perjury by affidavit, the State must prove:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">(1) that the defendant declared under the penalty of perjury that a written document was true;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-10\">(2) that the writing contained a false statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-11\">(3) that the false statement was given wilfully, rather than as a result of confusion or honest mistake;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>(4) that the defendant knew the statement was false at the time it was given; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">(5) that the false statement was material, that is, it related to the reason why the affidavit was prepared.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">MPJI-CR 4:26:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">To support his claim that we should apply <em>Furda I </em>retroactively, so as to render his false answer to Question 8 a truthful statement, Furda cites numerous cases in which courts have retroactively applied decisions that create a new standard or strike down an existing law as unconstitutional. For example, Furda cites <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a Supreme Court ruling that the provisions of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines were unconstitutional, and the application of that ruling by federal courts to cases where the defendant had already been convicted and sentenced, but that were still open on appeal. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Edwards, </em>424 F.3d 1106 (D.C.Cir.2005) (applying <em>Booker </em>and remanding for a determination of whether the sentences for the defendant\u2019s convictions were the product of the court\u2019s independent, discretionary judgment, or the Federal Sentencing Guidelines). <em>See also Potts v. State, </em>300 Md. 567, 577, 479 A.2d 1335, 1340-1341 (1984) (\u201cas a general rule, a new constitutional decision applies to all cases pending on direct appeal.\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>457 U.S. 537, 562, 102 S.Ct. 2579, 2594, 73 L.Ed.2d 202 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Yet, these cases are inapposite because they do not involve the question .of whether a defendant made an intentionally false statement under oath, a crime that requires that we focus on Furda\u2019s intent and the facts as they existed <em>at the time he filled out the application: </em>In a more analogous case, <em>United States v. Seidenberg, </em>420 F.Supp. 695 (D.Md.1976), the United States District Court for the District of Maryland upheld a defendant\u2019s convictions for making a false statement in connection with the acquisition of a firearm and unlawful receipt of a firearm by a person who has been committed to a mental institution, even though his prior commitment to a mental institution may have been constitutionally infirm. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>defendant argued that, because his commitment was unconstitutional, it \u201cmust be treated as nonexistent for purposes of any allegations of false statements].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 696. The District Court disagreed, relying on the nature of a false statement charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">[The statute] compels disclosure of all convictions which have not been set aside, whether ultimately shown to have been valid or not. That section penalizes [the defendant] for making a false statement. It penalizes him not for being a convicted felon, but for failing to tell the truth about the conviction. We think it apparent from the language employed that Congress intended to provide a scheme of regulation by compelling full and honest disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 697 (quoting <em>Cassity v. United States, </em>521 F.2d 1320, 1323 (6th Cir.1975)). Likewise, Furda cannot justify a false statement on his application because of his lack of knowledge how the Circuit Court had disposed of his Motion for Reconsideration of the original Denial Order or that the Denial Order would be overruled on appeal. He was required to wait\u2014either by deferring his application or by filing the application and disclosing the court order\u2014until he had taken the necessary steps to discover the trial court\u2019s action on his reconsideration motion or to appeal the order if it had not been modified on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">It is settled law that a court\u2019s decision is binding on the parties until it is overturned. <em>See Roessner v. Mitchell, </em>122 Md. 460, 466, 89 A. 722, 723 (1914) (\u201cIf the judgment of the Court is erroneous, the remedy is by appeal, and until reversed on appeal, the judgment is binding on the parties to the suit.\u201d); <em>see also Donner v. Calvert Distillers Corp., </em>196 Md. 475, 489, 77 A.2d 305, 310 (1950) (Although erroneous, a court order \u201cmust be obeyed until such time as it is stricken out on application, or reversed on appeal[.]\u201d). As explained by the Supreme Court, \u201c[i]t is beyond question that obedience to judicial orders is an important public policy.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>W.R. Grace &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number><em>Co. v. Rubber Workers, </em>461 U.S. 757, 766, 103 S.Ct. 2177, 2183, 76 L.Ed.2d 298 (1983). Consequently, a judicial determination and the findings that it is predicated upon constitute \u201cthe truth\u201d <em>until </em>invalidated.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Da Silva v. Musso, </em>76 N.Y.2d 436, 560 N.Y.S.2d 109, 559 N.E.2d 1268, 1270 (1990) (\u201cIt is elementary that a final judgment or order represents a valid and conclusive adjudication of the parties\u2019 substantive rights, unless <em>and until </em>it is overturned on appeal.\u201d) (emphasis added). Here, the Denial Order, which was still in effect at the time Furda completed the application, established the relative truth concerning Question 8 at that time. Thus, as the intermediate appellate court concluded, Furda \u201cwas obligated to answer \u2018Yes\u2019 to Question 8 until such time as that court\u2019s finding of commitment was set aside.\u201d <em>Furda II, </em>194 Md.App. at 47, 1 A.3d at 555. Instead, Furda answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 8, rendering his statement false.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">To be sure, as the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Furda I </em>makes clear, Furda had a valid, ongoing dispute with the circuit court\u2019s Denial Order. Furda, however, was required to make that challenge through the appropriate channels, and was not entitled to engage in self-help and enforce his rights extra-judicially by making his case to the owner of Gilbert\u2019s Guns. <em>Cf. Hill v. State, </em>419 Md. 674, 20 A.3d 780 (2011) (although Petitioners\u2019 sentences may have been illegal, they were required to challenge those sentences in the courts and could not engage in self-help by failing to report for imprisonment). Thus, up and until Furda succeeded on ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>peal, the court\u2019s finding of \u201ccommitment\u201d remained valid and Furda was required to answer Question 8 with a \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">III. Furda\u2019s Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Furda contends that he did not have the subjective intent necessary to support a perjury conviction, explaining that he did not knowingly and willfully lie on the application because he truly believed that the Denial Order was wrong. Although the perjury and false information statutes employ two different terms\u2014willfully and knowingly\u2014to describe the requisite state of mind of the defendant, this Court has stated that the two words are of \u201csimilar import\u201d and are \u201cthe same in substance and effect.\u201d <em>Greenwald v. State, </em>221 Md. 235, 244, 155 A.2d 894, 899 (1959). \u201cTo be willful, the false oath must be deliberate and not the result of surprise, confusion or bona fide mistake[.]\u201d <em>Myers v. State, </em>303 Md. 639, 640 n. 1, 496 A.2d 312, 312 n. 1 (1985). In conducting our inquiry, we are mindful that the trial judge here did not find Furda to be a credible witness: \u201cThe Court also finds that Mr. Furda did not testify candidly when he testified during his trial. He told me then, he told me now, he was not aware of [the Denial Order]. To be blunt, I do not believe him[.]\u201d We give \u201cgreat deference to a hearing judge\u2019s ... credibility determinations\u201d because \u201ccredibility determinations are to be made by trial courts, not appellate courts.\u201d <em>Longshore v. State, </em>399 Md. 486, 520, 924 A.2d 1129, 1149 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">A review of the record reveals sufficient evidence to support the trial judge\u2019s conclusion. Before walking into Gilbert\u2019s Guns, Furda had been made aware of the Denial Order through his counsel. As Furda\u2019s lawyer explained to him, that order described Furda as a prohibited person under 18 U.S.C. Section 922(g)(4) because he had \u201cbeen involuntarily <em>committed </em>to a mental institution^]\u201d (emphasis added). We reiterate, this language tracks exactly the language of Question 8, leading any reasonable person to conclude that the term \u201ccommitted\u201d had the same meaning in both the Denial Order and the firearm application. In addition, Furda signed his name under the certification \u201cI am not prohibited by law from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>purchasing or possessing a regulated firearm[,]\u201d even though he knew there was a judicial finding to the contrary still in effect.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Perhaps the most damning evidence of Furda\u2019s intent was that, after conferring with his attorney and the owner of Gilbert\u2019s Guns on the issue of whether the Denial Order prevented him from purchasing a firearm, he failed to attach or otherwise make reference to his motion for reconsideration in his application. We agree with the logic of the Sixth Circuit that the federal regulatory scheme prohibiting false statements are designed to compel \u201cfull and honest disclosure[,]\u201d <em>see Cassity v. United States, </em>521 F.2d 1320, 1323 (6th Cir.1975), and conclude that this reasoning is equally applicable to Maryland\u2019s scheme. Clearly, Furda\u2019s disclosure did not measure up to that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">We hold that the trial court did not err in finding that, by answering \u201cNo\u201d to Question 8, Furda \u201cknowingly [gave] false information ... in a firearm application\u201d and \u201cwillfully and falsely [made] an oath or affirmation as to a material fact[.]\u201d Accordingly, we affirm his convictions for false information and perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">. We have consolidated Furda\u2019s original three \"Questions Presented\u201d contained in his Petition for Certiorari, into two questions, and rephrased them for clarity and brevity. His original three questions are set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">1) Is Maryland Form 77R legally inadequate? The Maryland State Form, Form 77R, used by the State Police as an application to purchase a regulated firearm, contains a question (Question 8) that is vague, ambiguous, imprecise and is clearly a compound question; thereby creating a situation where any answer is not precise and any answer could potentially be the wrong answer. An answer can be both right and wrong at the same time. This ambiguity and imprecision is compounded by the fact that Form 77R does not contain a \"comments\u201d section, nor an instruction to the applicant to attach an explanatory sheet explaining any of the related answers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">2) Should the Appellate Court\u2019s Order, vacating the Circuit Court\u2019s Order, be retroactively applied to the time of Mr. Furda filling out the application to purchase? Can a Defendant, in a criminal case, be convicted of perjury and false application for making a statement, on a form, that by decision of the Court of Special Appeals, is the correct answer? According to Mr. Furda's belief, it was the correct answer at the time of filling out the form; but at the time of the application, had been the subject of a Circuit Court Order, holding the opposite and which Circuit Court Order was subsequently vacated by the Court of Special Appeals?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">3) Can a person commit perjury when he has a subjective belief that his answer to a question is correct and truthful, he has not made a deliberate attempt to deceive and it is eventually confirmed by the appellate court that his is, in fact, telling the truth?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b366-9\">. The State did not appeal the Court of Special Appeals s reversal of the trial court\u2019s order denying the return of Furda\u2019s weapons. Thus, the issue of whether Furda\u2019s stay at the behavioral health facility constituted \u201ccommitment,\u201d as that term is contemplated by federal law, is not currently before us and we will not address it in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b367-8\">.

Furda claims that he showed the motion for reconsideration to the owner of Gilbert\u2019s Guns, Richard Gilbert, before filling out the application.

Prior to going to Gilbert\u2019s Guns, Furda consulted his attorney as to whether he was permitted to purchase a gun.

Although Congress has not defined \"committed to a mental institution,\u201d as it is used in 18 U.S.C.
