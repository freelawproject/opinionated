State, </em>196 Md.App. 254, 9 A.3d 123 (2010), does not expressly hold that the findings made by the federal judge in 2003 were admissible to attack Detective Wilson\u2019s credibility in the case at bar, I am certain that this opinion will be cited as authority for the manifestly incorrect proposition that a witness can be impeached with extrinsic evidence that\u2014on a prior occasion, in another courtroom\u2014a trial judge found that the witness\u2019 testimony included \u201cknowing lie[s].\u201d While such a finding obviously \u201cestablishes a reasonable factual basis\u201d to permit cross-examination of the witness about whether he or she had lied under oath when testifying in that particular case, Md. Rule 5-608 prohibits the introduction of \u201cextrinsic evidence\u201d to establish that the witness had previously lied under oath. Moreover, in <em>Newton v. State, </em>147 Md. 71, 127 A. 123 (1924), this Court held that it was \u201chighly objectionable\u201d to impeach the credibility of a witness by showing that \u201cthe same statement as that to which he testified in this case ... had already been discredited by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>three judges sitting in the same court in another case[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 127 A. at 131. I would therefore make it clear that the Circuit Court should have granted the State\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the federal judge\u2019s on-the-record findings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">I would also make it clear that improper prosecutorial \u201cvouching\u201d did not occur in the case at bar. While holding that \u201c[t]he invited response doctrine does not salvage the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in this case,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">The objected to comments, that the officers could lose their pensions and livelihood if they lied, and that these honorable officers \u201ctold the truth,\u201d were not a response to defense counsel\u2019s argument that this was one of the lamest prosecutions he had seen. Rather, it was a response to defense counsel\u2019s attacks on the credibility of the officers, and we have already concluded that these credibility attacks were not improper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s response, vouching for the credibility of the State\u2019s primary witnesses against appellant, was not a reasonable response to an improper defense remark[.] <em>Sivells, supra, </em>196 Md.App. at 287-88, 9 A.3d at 143. In the case at bar, however, (1) the jury was presented with evidence\u2014introduced by Petitioner, over the State\u2019s <em>in limine </em>objection\u2014that the Police Department had disciplined Detective Wilson as a result of his federal court testimony, and (2) during closing argument, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel actually characterized that discipline as \u201cas close as you get to being fired.\u201d Under these circumstances, it is clear to me that Petitioner was not <em>unfairly </em>prejudiced by a rebuttal argument that included an assertion that a police officer who testifies falsely runs the risk of losing his or her \u201cpension\u201d and/or \u201clivelihood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>It is also clear to me that Petitioner was not <em>unfairly </em>prejudiced by a rebuttal argument that included the assertion that the Detective Wilson and Detective Carrington were \u201chonorable officers.\u201d No reasonable juror would infer that this assertion was based upon evidence not presented to the jury, but known to the prosecutor. The prosecutor was entitled to argue that (1) it was \u201chonorable\u201d for Detective Wilson to admit that he had \u201cmade some mistakes\u201d while testifying in federal court, (2) what police officers do is \u201chonorable\u201d work, and (3) \u201cYou\u2019ve had the ability to judge their demeanor. They are honorable men.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In <em>Riggins v. State, </em>125 Md. 165, 93 A. 437 (1915), citing with approval the nearly identical analysis of the California Supreme Court in <em>People v. Weber, </em>149 Cal. 325, 86 P. 671, 677 (1906), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">It is of course improper for a prosecuting officer to assert his personal belief or personal conviction as to the guilt of the accused, if that belief or conviction is predicated upon anything other than the evidence in the case. But, upon the other hand, such prosecuting officer has the undisputable right to urge that the evidence convinces his mind of the accused\u2019s guilt. Indeed, it would be mere stultification if it were contended that the prosecuting attorney could argue to the jury that the evidence should convince their minds although it did not convince his. A prosecuting officer therefore has the right to state his views as to what the evidence shows.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 174, 93 A. at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">For the above stated reasons, this Court should not deny\u2014 as improvidently granted\u2014the petition before us in the case at bar. We should instead reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals on the ground that the rebuttal argument at issue was a fair response to (inadmissible) evidence\u2014and argument on that evidence\u2014introduced over the objection of the State, and was predicated upon nothing other than the evidence presented to the jury.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-11\">.
