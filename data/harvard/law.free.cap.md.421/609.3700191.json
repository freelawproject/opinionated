The State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish that he had committed those offenses on April 11, 2003. After Petitioner\u2019s convictions were affirmed by the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Special Appeals in an unreported opinion, he filed a petition for writ a of certiorari in which he presented this Court with the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">Did the lower courts err by ruling admissible a handwriting expert\u2019s testimony that petitioner might have written the victim\u2019s signature on an important questioned document and that, based on his comparison of documents while on the stand testifying, the \u201cgeneral appearance\u201d of the handwriting on the questioned document did not match the victim\u2019s handwriting?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">We granted the Petition. 409 Md. 413, 975 A.2d 875 (2009). For the reasons that follow, we hold that neither the Circuit Court nor the Court of Special Appeals erred in their conclusions that the handwriting expert\u2019s testimony was admissible. We shall therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Petitioner was convicted of murdering Jason Convertino and a second victim (who, in the words of the Court of Special Appeals, \u201capparently happened to have been visiting Convertino and was in the wrong place at the wrong time\u201d), whose bodies were found in Mr. Convertino\u2019s apartment on April 16, 2003. To prove that Petitioner shot them to death five days earlier, the State presented evidence that (1) Petitioner\u2019s DNA \u201cmatched\u201d the DNA on latex gloves found in close proximity to Mr. Convertino\u2019s body; (2) on April 17, 2003, Petitioner pawned Mr. Convertino\u2019s laptop computer, (3) on April 9, 2003, Petitioner requested that the travel agency making arrangements for his honeymoon trip to Canc\u00fan fax to him an \u201cauthorization to charge\u201d form so that the $2,015.98 he owed the agency could be charged to the credit card of an unnamed friend, (4) during the late evening of April 11, 2003 and during the early hours of April 12, 2003, Petitioner placed more than twenty phone calls to one Earl Fowlkes, claiming to be \u201cin trouble,\u201d and requesting that Fowlkes pick him up on the east side of Baltimore; and (5) on April 12, 2003, the travel agency received a fax transmission of the authorization form, purport<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>edly signed by Mr. Convertino on April 10, 2003, that allowed the agency to obtain the funds owed by Petitioner from Mr. Convertino\u2019s account. It is the testimony related to the \u201cauthorization to charge\u201d that is at issue in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The State\u2019s closing argument includes the following discussion of the evidence linking Petitioner to the murders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">... [The Petitioner] kills [Jason Convertino], takes his grandmother\u2019s phone, takes his laptop, takes his credit card, and after the man is dead just buys gas with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">And how do we know that Jason [Convertino] didn\u2019t, out of the courtesy of his heart, give a man who did not invite him to his wedding, a $2,000 honeymoon? How do we know that? Well we heard Robert [Verderamo], the State\u2019s expert, testify that this handwriting, he couldn\u2019t say for sure but it had a lot in common with the defendant\u2019s handwriting. So then I asked him to look at Jason\u2019s Chevy Chase Bank account records full of Jason\u2019s signature. Remember [exhibits] 44A through 44K I think it was? You have lots and lots of checks from Jason and the signature on these checks looks absolutely nothing like the signature on the travel voucher. So what does he do? He is slick he dates it April 10th because Jason is still alive on April 10th. But he can\u2019t get it back to his good friend Terry Robinson on the 11th because he can\u2019t get out of Dodge. He is stuck in Fells Point. He calls Earl [Fowlkes] on April 11th, after he\u2019s killed the two men and taken everything [he can] find of Jason\u2019s....he\u2019s called Earl [Fowlkes] over and over and over and over saying man get me out of here. Come get me, I\u2019m in trouble..... only he can\u2019t get out of Dodge. Earl\u2019s not coming and so all night he calls, over and over and over and over[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">In support of its contention that Petitioner forged the deceased Mr. Convertino\u2019s signature on the authorization to charge form, the State presented the testimony and written report of Robert J. Verderamo, a Baltimore City Police De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>partment questioned document expert. The following transpired prior to Mr. Verderamo\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m going to object to this next witness ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: If I understand\u2014normally, when I have these handwriting cases, the expert who is\u2014there\u2019s no question he\u2019s an expert\u2014says in my expert opinion this guy wrote this. This handwriting is his handwriting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">THE COURT: Right</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: If I understand it, [the prosecutor] will certainly correct me if I am wrong, he\u2019s not going to say that. He\u2019s going to say it could have been him; it might have been him; maybe it\u2019s him; we can\u2019t say it\u2019s not him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">It seems to me that that is not admissible. That is prejudicial and it\u2019s not admissible evidence. The probative value has\u2014it\u2019s just not admissible. I think he\u2019s going to have to say more\u2014and I don\u2019t think he can\u2014than it could have been him; we can\u2019t exclude him as the writer. That\u2019s the basis for my objection, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">THE COURT: [Defense Counsel], you\u2019ll have the opportunity to cross examine this witness and to question him in any respect you wish about the extent of his opinion and how far it goes, which would be true of any expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeD\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But you wouldn\u2019t even let ... an expert in another field testify unless he could say within a reasonable degree of certainty, scientific or medical certainty depending on the context, this was this. You wouldn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think, allow an expert to testify that it could have been, it might have been, I can\u2019t say it\u2019s not him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-11\">THE COURT: Well that is to the ultimate issue, I think. In respect to a handwriting expert, I\u2019m presuming that he can get on the stand and explain how he goes about making his analysis and why he can reach the conclusion and I can\u2019t exclude that this was his handwriting. That\u2019s probative, as far as that may go. It may not go very far, or it may, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>depending on\u2014I don\u2019t know how the testimony is going to come out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-4\">I think that, on balance (inaudible) the jury, so I\u2019m going to permit the State to put [Mr. Verderamo] on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The record shows that the following transpired during Mr. Verderamo\u2019s direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We stipulate to\u2014if you would like to accept it\u2014to Mr. Verderamo\u2019s expertise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuD\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay, Your Honor, I\u2019ll offer Mr. Verderamo as an expert in the field of handwriting analysis and identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">THE COURT: Very well. Base on the Stipulation of Counsel, I will find, and do find, that Mr. Verderamo is qualified as an expert to testify on the issue of handwriting analysis and identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">Q: Now, with regard to the case involving the murder investigation into the death of Jason Convertino and [the second victim] ... Were you involved in any manner in this investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">A: Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\">Q: What was your role?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">A: I had a request to do a comparison between a copy of a travel authorization sheet, or a credit card authorization sheet. That was the questioned] document that I mentioned. I also had submitted to me index cards with the knowing writing of the suspect. I looked at both sets of documents and did my comparison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-12\">Q: I\u2019m going to show you what have been marked for identification purposes only, as State\u2019s Exhibit 40, 41, 42 ... Can you tell us what, if anything, you did with regard to this document? Just briefly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-13\">A: This would be the questioned document. It\u2019s labeled as Q, meaning questioned, Q-l on my report. This is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>document I used for compar\u2014this is the actual document that I used for comparing to the index cards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\">Q: Is that the document that says, \u201cTravel Concepts\u201d with Jason Convertino\u2019s name and credit card information on it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APgV\">A: That\u2019s correct. I have that listed as \u201cOne Travel Concepts Authorization to Charge Form.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">Q: Okay and that\u2019s already in evidence. Let\u2019s show you what\u2019s been marked, for identification purposes only, as State\u2019s exhibit 40. What are we looking at here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">A: This is the actual report, outlining exactly the results of my examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">Q: What is State\u2019s 41 for identification purposes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">A: There are 113 index cards that were indicated to me as the known handwriting of [Petitioner]. They have different writings on them, each one of the index cards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">I looked at these as the known writing and used that to make a comparison with the travel authorization sheet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-10\">Q: Now, will you please tell us what you did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-11\">A: Well, first thing I did was, I first looked at the questioned document. In doing a handwriting comparison, handwriting is a mental and muscular coordinated process. It\u2019s a habit and it\u2019s identifiable because it\u2019s a habit, and you repeat the characteristics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-12\">I\u2019m looking for these repetitive characteristics that are identified to a particular individuals writing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-13\">The type of characteristics I\u2019m looking for are, like, the size of the writing; the spacing between the letters; the pen movements; underhand connecting strokes; overhand connecting strokes; proportion of the letters, how tall the \u201cT\u201d is to an \u201cA\u201d or maybe how high up on the cross bar the \u201cT\u201d is compared to the staff of the \u201cT\u201d; or how big one letter is compared to another letter. I\u2019m also looking for subtle pen movements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-14\">So, I first looked at the questioned document to see what I thought was important for identification purposes. After I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>looked and saw what I thought was important on the questioned document, I then went to the index cards and I wanted to see what characteristics were presenting in the index cards and what kind of results I could have, having looked at both the questioned document and compared it to the known document and that is how I come to a conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">[Mr. Verderamo]: The conclusion here is\u2014I can read my report and I\u2019ll explain to you my results after showing you this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Having compared the questioned travel document with these index cards, my report reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">Due to unexplained variations in the writing, in the questioned writing of Q-l, there was not a basis for identifying Miller as the writer of this document. However, there are characteristics of Miller [that] appear in the document which prevents his elimination as a suspect in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">Q: What does that mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-9\">A: As I mentioned, I saw several characteristics that I thought were in common. I pointed this out. \u201cUnexplained variations\u201d, \u201cdue to unexplained variations in the questioned writing\u201d, the backwards slant, I couldn\u2019t explain that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">I didn\u2019t know if this was a deliberate attempt, either in this writing or in this writing, to change the natural writing habit because these were appearing in combination. I had characteristics in common. I had characteristics unexplained. I didn\u2019t come to a definitive conclusion but there were characteristics here, that I could not ignore, in common between the two. (Inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-11\">Q: Now, when you say that you cannot eliminate him as a suspect, what does that mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-12\">A: Well, the fact is, these characteristics are common in both. The possibility exists that this is the same writer. However, when I used subjective evaluation, I would like to have something overwhelming. I guess may[be] I\u2019m over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>conservative but I\u2019m not making a positive identification unless I had similar characteristics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">Q: Are you saying its not him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">A: No, I can\u2019t say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">Q: So can you give it to us in lay terms exactly what you are saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">A: What I\u2019m saying is, there\u2019s characteristics here that I don\u2019t understand why they are here. There are characteristics that are there that are common between the two. That sort of gives me pause to make a positive identification (inaudible) basis to make (inaudible) identification. I cannot ignore what I saw and what I demonstrated to you today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABu\">Q: S[o], you can\u2019t say its him and you can\u2019t say for sure it isn\u2019t him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">A: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">Q: And that\u2019s a reasonable degree of scientific certainty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-11\">A: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">The following transpired during Mr. Verderamo\u2019s cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-14\">Q: Frequently you are able to sit on the stand and look at the jury and say, the same guy, the same person wrote this, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-15\">A: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-16\">Q: And you can\u2019t do that in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-17\">A: Not in this case, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-18\">Q: By the way, did you\u2014you took the time to compare [Petitioner\u2019s] handwriting to the known signature in State\u2019s exhibit 37 correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-19\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-20\">Q: Did you attempt to compare a number of known signature [sic] of Mr. Convertino with the exhibit 3[2]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>A: The only exemplars that I compared were the 113 index cards. I did not have any other exemplars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">Q: You were just trying to see if [Petitioner] wrote that? A: Correct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">Q: You were never asked to determine whether that, in fact, is Jason Convertino\u2019s?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">A: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The following transpired at a bench conference that preceded Mr. Verderamo\u2019s redirect examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to offer into evidence at this time [State\u2019s exhibit 43]----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">[Defense Counsel]: ... I am certainly entitled to know of any expert reports. Now, I knew about, I knew about</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aut\">[Petitioner\u2019s]\u2014the report Mr. Verderamo prepared with respect to [Petitioner]. I certainly don\u2019t object to that but I\u2019m not aware of any report or any thing with respect to any examination which could have been done, obviously, prior to the middle of trial, with respect to Mr. Convertino.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">Now it\u2019s true that I asked that question but it isn\u2019t really a very tricky or clever question. It pretty much jumps out at you. Certainly, the State if they wanted to have Mr. Convertino\u2019s signatures examined by this expert, prior to trial and offer an opinion, which Discovery would have been with [the] Defense, the State had all the time in the world to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-12\">Now I feel I am basically being sandbagged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-13\">THE COURT: There has been no question from the very beginning that the State was taking the position that [Jason Convertino\u2019s] signature on Exhibit No. 32 was not his signature, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-14\">[Prosecutor]: Correct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-15\">THE COURT: There has been no issue about that from the beginning of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>[Defense Counsel]: Yes sir, I agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\">THE COURT: Now, even in the absence of an expert handwriting analyst, would it not be in the jury\u2019s responsibility as the finder of fact, to be able to make a comparison of a known signature by Jason Convertino and the signature on Exhibit 32? They don\u2019t need expert testimony to make a handwriting comparison, true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">[Defense Counsel]: I agree with you</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqH\">THE COURT: Ok</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">[Defense Counsel]:\u2014but here\u2019s the distinction ... Yes, I am saying I didn\u2019t. What I\u2019m saying I didn\u2019t receive is any indication or report indicating that this expert would testify that these were not Convertino\u2019s signatures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">THE COURT: I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">THE COURT: ... The further objection that [Defense Counsel] is raising is whether or not [Mr. Verderamo], an expert can offer an opinion in redirect, as to whether or not the signature which appears on State\u2019s 43 is written by the same individual who signed the document as State\u2019s No. 32 is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">[Defense Counsel]: Yes your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-10\">THE COURT: Okay, and [if I understand the Prosecutor\u2019s argument, it is that Defense Counsel] opened the door to this line of questioning by his question on cross about whether or not Mr. Verderamo had ever compared a known signature by Mr. Convertino with a signature on State\u2019s Exhibit 32?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-11\">[Prosecutor]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-12\">[Defense Counsel]:\u2014I may have opened the door, I mean, I haven\u2019t. I asked him that question, I\u2019m not saying that the State can\u2019t, for example, bring in a lay witness to say I recognize that signature. What it doesn\u2019t allow, I respectfully suggest, to allow an expert to now, while he\u2019s on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>witness stand, when I\u2019ve never been given any reports or any indication that he\u2019s made that kind of examination</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">THE COURT:....I think, quite frankly that you did open the door to have this question asked on redirect, so I\u2019m going to overrule the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">On redirect, Mr. Verderamo testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">Q: Now, I\u2019m going to show you (inaudible), State\u2019s 44J, which is the signature card from the Chevy Chase Bank records ... Can you compare it to the Jason Convertino signature on the travel voucher for us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">A: Well, I\u2019m not in a position to do a full handwriting comparison here. Again, we\u2019re dealing with copies but just general, overall appearance\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\">[Defense Counsel]: I again preserve my objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-11\">THE COURT: Very well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-12\">[Prosecutor]: Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-13\">[Mr. Verderamo]: The signature on the Chevy Chase, 44J document a little bit tighter, including a middle initial, which the travel document does not have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-14\">I see a difference in the crossing of the \u201cT\u201d. It looks like the finishing of the \u201c0\u201d comes back to complete a \u201cT\u201d crossing, so there\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s just\u2014I mean, I\u2019m not doing a full comparison here but I do see a general appearance difference between here and the Chevy Chase documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay7\">[Prosecutor]: To a reasonable degree of scientific certainty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5K\">[Mr. Verderamo]: For being on the witness stand and not being in my laboratory, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-15\">As stated previously, the jury convicted Petitioner of two counts of second degree murder in the shooting deaths of Mr. Convertino and the second victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-16\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b648-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-18\">The history of Md.

Ev. 901(b)(3), under which an item may be authenticated by comparing it, for purposes of admissibility, with another item which has previously been authenticated to determine if the items came from the same source. The Committee has modified the language of F.R. Ev. 901(b)(3) so as not to change Maryland law to the effect that questions of admissibility, including those involving authentication, are to be determined by the judge.

The \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard of review is applicable to the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling that the State was entitled to present Mr. Verderamo\u2019s opinion that \u201cthere are characteristics of [Petitioner\u2019s writing] ... in the [\u2018authorization to charge form\u2019] which prevents his elimination as a suspect in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Petitioner argues that he was unfairly prejudiced by the opinion that he could not be \u201celiminated as a suspect\u201d because Mr. Verderamo was unable to express the opinion that Petitioner <em>had </em>forged Mr. Convertino\u2019s signature on that document.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This argument is identical to the argument presented to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <em>United States v. Fleishman, </em>684 F.2d 1329 (9th Cir.1982), in which that court affirmed the convictions of three defendants who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute cocaine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>The government\u2019s evidence included \u201ca piece of paper with a series of numerals inscribed on it [that] were later linked to the cocaine negotiations over price and quantity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1334. One of the defendant/appellants, Peter Combs, argued that he was unfairly prejudiced by \u201cinconclusive\u201d opinion testimony that he was the person who had written the numerals. While rejecting Combs\u2019 argument that \u201cprejudice resulting from the limited level of certainty of [the handwriting expert\u2019s] testimony outweighed its probative value,\u201d the <em>Fleishman </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">\n<em>The Handwriting Expert\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">After testifying to his qualifications as an expert in handwriting analysis, Bruce Greenwood of the Los Angeles Police Department testified that there were \u201cdefinite indications\u201d that Combs wrote the note found in Ramada Inn Room 1021. On cross-examination, Greenwood admitted that his opinion was qualified by the limited number of writings available for comparison and he could not provide a definite conclusion whether Combs indeed wrote the note. Greenwood also testified that he could not find any convincing evidence that Green had authored the note [ ], nor could he conclude that the writing was made by anyone other than Peter Combs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">The requisites of Fed.R.Evid. 702 were met. Greenwood was properly qualified as a handwriting expert, and his testimony, regardless of the level of certainty as to his conclusions, was helpful in assisting the jury in its deliberation of the relevance, if any, of the note found in Room 1021. Greenwood provided the jurors with an extensive review of the principles of handwriting analysis he used while making the comparisons he made. The jury could, therefore, properly apply the principles to the facts of the case in order to reach their own conclusion regarding the suggested authorship of the note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">The cases cited by Combs regarding the inadmissibility of certain types of expert testimony are inapposite here. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Those cases are concerned with the possible prejudice to the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial of admitting testimony of purported experts based upon insufficiently substantiated scientific theories, techniques or tests. It is undisputed that handwriting analysis is a science in which expert testimony assists a jury. <em>See generally, </em>32 C.J.S. <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7\u00a7 612-622 (1964). <em>See also United States v. Spencer, </em>439 F.2d 1047, 1049 (2d Cir.1971) (handwriting expert\u2019s testimony that the alleged forged securities were \u201cprobably prepared\u201d by the defendant held admissible). All that is really disputed here is that Greenwood\u2019s opinion was inconclusive. To the extent that Greenwood\u2019s testimony lacked certainty, that uncertainty was probed extensively during cross-examination. Absolute certainty of result is not required for admissibility. <em>United States v. Baller, </em>519 F.2d 463, 466 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1019, 96 S.Ct. 456, 46 L.Ed.2d 391 (1975). Combs\u2019 issue with the certainty of Greenwood\u2019s testimony, therefore, goes to the weight given the testimony; the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1336-37. (Internal citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Other cases that are consistent with <em>Fleishman </em>include <em>United States v. Jolivet, </em>224 F.3d 902 (8th Cir.2000), in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed Catherine Jolivet\u2019s mail fraud convictions based in part on the testimony of a handwriting expert, who opined that Jolivet was the \u201clikely\u201d signatory on documents that had been submitted to insurance companies. While rejecting the argument that this \u201clikely, but not certain\u201d opinion should have been excluded, the <em>Jolivet </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">Jolivet complains that the district court erred in admitting the testimony of Donald Lock. Lock, proffered as an expert in handwriting comparison, analyzed a large number of documents at trial to determine if Jolivet was the signatory on the documents. After comparing the questioned documents with other documents that were known to contain Jolivet\u2019s signature, he opined that the signatory on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>questioned documents was likely Jolivet, but he would not state that he was absolutely certain of his conclusions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">In order to be admissible, expert testimony must be both relevant and reliable. <em>See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 147, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999). The district court is afforded wide latitude in making its reliability and relevance determinations. <em>See id. </em>at 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">Because Lock was particularly well-qualified in analyzing questioned documents\u2014having studied and taught internationally, written manuals, and practiced in the field for over two decades, performing several thousand comparisons\u2014the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding Lock\u2019s expert testimony to be reliable. <em>See United States v. Paul, </em>175 F.3d 906, 910-11 (11th Cir.1999). Similarly, in light of Lock\u2019s experience and expertise, we believe his testimony may be properly characterized as offering the jury knowledge beyond their own and enhancing their understanding of the evidence before them. <em>See id. </em>at 911. The district court thus committed no abuse of discretion ... in admitting Lock\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 905-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">In <em>United States v. Herrera, </em>832 F.2d 833 (4th Cir.1987), while affirming conspiracy to import marijuana convictions, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit was presented with an argument that the trial court \u201cimproperly allowed a handwriting expert to offer an unduly speculative opinion based upon \u2018a high degree of belief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 835. While holding that the trial court was \u201cnot compelled to strike [the handwriting expert\u2019s testimony] as \u2018speculative,\u2019 \u201d the <em>Herrera </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">An expert opinion regarding handwriting need not be based upon absolute certainty in order to be admissible. It was well within the bounds of sound discretion for the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>allow the jury to weigh the probative value of the somewhat equivocal opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 837. (Internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\"><em>Herrera </em>was cited with approval in <em>United States v. McGlory, </em>968 F.2d 309 (3d Cir.1992), and in <em>Sewell v. State, </em>721 So.2d 129, (Miss.1998). In <em>McGlory, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">Under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, the expert testimony need only be helpful to the jury. Expert testimony as to the similarities in handwriting is generally admissible. <em>See United States v. Cairns, </em>434 F.2d 643, 644 n. 3 (9th Cir.1970). This is so even if the handwriting expert is not absolutely certain that the handwriting is that of the defendant. <em>See United States v. Herrera, </em>832 F.2d 833, 837 (4th Cir.1987); <em>United States v. Fleishman, </em>684 F.2d 1329, 1336-37 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1044, 103 S.Ct. 464, 74 L.Ed.2d 614 (1982). Any issue regarding the certainty of Riordan\u2019s testimony goes to the weight given that testimony and could be tested by cross-examination. The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ads\"><em>Id. </em>at 346. (Footnotes omitted). In <em>Sewell, </em>the Supreme Court of Mississippi stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">Even when the expert\u2019s opinion does not serve to identify or eliminate a particular writer as the source of questioned writing, that opinion is helpful to the trier of fact because \u201can expert opinion regarding handwriting need not be based upon absolute certainty in order to be admissible.\u201d <em>United States v. Herrera, </em>832 F.2d 833, 837 (4th Cir.1987).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">We agree with the above quoted authorities, which are entirely consistent with medical \u201ccausation\u201d opinions approved of by this Court and by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">In <em>Langenfelder v.

Carter, </em>236 Md. 484, 204 A.2d 566 (1964), while holding that a plaintiffs evidence was sufficient to generate a jury issue on the question of whether she had suffered pneumonia as a result of an automobile accident, even though her attending physician expressed a \u201cnot very positive\u201d opinion that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that the accident caused the plaintiffs pneumonia, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">The appellant cites <em>Ager v.

Garrettson, </em>188 Md. 85, 94 [51 A.2d 642 (1947) ], Judge Markell, for the Court, said: \u201cThe law requires proof of probable, not merely possible, facts, including causal relations. Reasoning <em>post hoc, propter hoc </em>is a recognized logical fallacy, a <em>non sequitur. </em>But sequence of events, plus proof of <em>possible </em>causal relation, may amount to proof of <em>probable </em>causal relation, in the absence of evidence of any other equally probable cause\u201d (citing cases).

While holding that this testimony was properly admitted, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">[T]he jury had at least two obvious options concerning the inconsistencies in [the victim\u2019s] statements: 1) she was lying, or 2) her ability to accurately recount the details of the event was adversely affected by the medication she had been given. The State was offering the testimony of an expert to show that these drugs <em>could, </em>and were known to, cause this effect upon a person such as [the victim]. This information was relevant, and potentially useful to the jury. A juror attempting to determine whether [the victim] was telling the truth when she said she was disoriented or \u201cin and out of it\u201d because of medication would obviously benefit from knowing as a scientific fact whether that medication could, or often did, produce such an effect. Proof that the medication was known to diminish the ability to respond coherently to questions was therefore relevant and admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">314 Md. at 309-310, 550 A.2d at 932.

It is clear, however, from the above quoted portions of Mr. Verderamo\u2019s testimony that the questions he was asked on cross-examination \u201copened the door\u201d to the opinion that was elicited on redirect examination. The \u201copening the door\u201d doctrine is applicable to cross-examination that has \u201cexpanded the scope\u201d of a witness\u2019s testimony. <em>Trimble v.

Several opinions of this Court include discussion of \u201cinconclusive\u201d handwriting analysis. <em>See e.g., Schultz v. Bank of America, </em>413 Md. 15, 21 990 A.2d 1078, 1082 (2010) (handwriting expert testified that checks drawn on plaintiff's account \"appeared to have been forged\u201d with plaintiff's signature); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>342 Md. 724, 733, 679 A.2d 1106, 1111 (1996) (handwriting expert testified that \"there were similarities\u201d between petitioner's handwriting and a sign left at the scene, but could not form a definite opinion); <em>Foster v. State, </em>304 Md. 439, 445, 499 A.2d 1236, 1239 (1985). In none of those cases, however, were we presented with the argument that an \"inconclusive\u201d opinion is unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b649-7\">. Since the Federal Rules of Evidence have been \"on the books,\u201d FRE 901(b)(3) has provided that the requirement of authentication may be satisfied by \"[cjomparison by the trier of fact or by expert witnesses with specimens which have been authenticated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\">. Petitioner does not argue that expert handwriting analysis is inadmissible under the Maryland Rules of Evidence. In <em>United States v. Jones, </em>107 F.3d 1147 (6th Cir.1997), an appellant convicted of credit card fraud argued that she was entitled to a new trial on the ground that the trial court should have sustained her objection to the testimony of a forensic document analyst who opined that the appellant had signed three incriminating documents. According to the appellant, as a result of the standards established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), opinions by handwriting experts are no longer admissible. While concluding that the analyst's opinion was admissible under FRE 702, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">[AJppellant admits [in her brief] that \u2018handwriting analysis was never scrutinized under <em>Daubert\u2019s </em>predecessor, <em>Frye v. United States,' </em>[and] is, therefore, arguing that even though expert handwriting analysis was never considered a matter of scientific knowledge by any of the courts applying the <em>Frye </em>test over a seventy-year period, we should treat it as such now and conclude that it fails the <em>Daubert </em>reliability requirements. We decline her invitation to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">[I]f we were to hold that handwriting analysis is not a field of expertise under the Federal Rules of Evidence, there would be no place for expert witnesses to compare writing on one document with that on another in order to authenticate a document. In other words, appellants suggested approach would render Rule 901(b)(3) meaningless. We refuse to adopt that interpretive approach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">107 F.3d at 1157-59.
