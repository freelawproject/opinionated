WILNER (Retired, Specially Assigned), J.</author>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">This case presents a very narrow legal issue, but one of first impression. Maryland Code, \u00a7 8-104(c) of the Estates and Trusts Article (ET) permits a creditor to file a claim against a decedent\u2019s estate prior to the appointment of a personal representative. Because, in such a situation, no estate has yet been opened and no Orphans\u2019 Court has therefore assumed jurisdiction, the law permits the creditor to file the claim with the register of wills in any of three counties: where the decedent was domiciled, where the decedent \u201cresided\u201d on the date of his or her death, or where real property or a leasehold interest in real property of the decedent is located.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only legal issue before us is what is meant by \u201cresided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">The relevant facts are undisputed. The decedent in this case, Dorothy Faya, lived for most of her 82 years at her home in Catonsville, in Baltimore County. On November 29, 2002, when she was 81 and had been living alone for some time, she suffered a fall and was taken by ambulance to St. Agnes Hospital. She remained at St. Agnes, which is located in Baltimore City, for about three weeks, until December 21, 2002. Upon her discharge, the intent was to take Ms. Faya to a nursing home in Catonsville, but, while en route, she became unable to breathe on her own, so she was taken instead to University Specialty Hospital (USH), a licensed chronic care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>hospital also located in Baltimore City, and placed on artificial life support\u2014a ventilator and a feeding tube.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">With the exception of five emergency admissions to two nearby acute care hospitals, both located in Baltimore City, for brief periods\u2014three of them for a day or less\u2014Ms. Faya remained at USH for the next eleven months, until November 21, 2003, when she died. During her stay at USH, she remained on the ventilator and feeding tube. She was mentally competent but unable to talk.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">During the first few months of her hospitalizations, Ms. Faya\u2019s hospital and medical bills were covered by Medicare. That insurance was exhausted on March 29, 2003, however. Her daughter, Deborah Boer, was advised, and, either from Ms. Faya\u2019s accounts or joint accounts of mother and daughter, Ms. Boer made three payments between May and November 2003, totaling $35,896. Counsel to USH attempted to work with Ms. Boer to have her mother qualify for Medicaid benefits, but, unfortunately, Ms. Faya died before that could be arranged. The outstanding balance due USH at the time of Ms. Faya\u2019s death was $206,343.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">On December 10, 2003, prior to the opening of an estate and the appointment of a personal representative, USH filed a claim with the register of wills in Baltimore City.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On February 18, 2004, Ms. Faya\u2019s will was admitted to probate in Baltimore County and her son-in-law, John Boer, was appointed as personal representative. On October 1, 2004, USH filed a claim for $206,343\u2014the actual amount owed\u2014with the register of wills in Baltimore County. The personal representative denied the claim on the ground that it was not filed timely\u2014 within six months after the decedent\u2019s death\u2014and that the claim filed in Baltimore City, which was timely, was invalid because, in his view, Ms. Faya did not \u201creside\u201d in the City at the time of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>After an evidentiary hearing, the Orphans\u2019 Court for Baltimore County agreed with the personal representative and entered judgment for the estate. The court recognized that, under ET \u00a7 8-104(c), a creditor who files a claim prior to the appointment of a personal representative may file it with the register of wills in the county where the decedent \u201cresided\u201d at the time of her death. It acknowledged as well that, for purposes of that statute, \u201cresided\u201d means something different than domicile, and that a person may \u201creside\u201d in a county other than that of his or her domicile. Nonetheless, the court found that the evidence did not support the conclusion that Ms. Faya \u201cresided\u201d in Baltimore City at the time of her death. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\">\u201cAlthough she was hospitalized for approximately nine months, she never changed her mailing address to have her mail sent to the University Specialty Hospital nor did she have her clothes or personal possessions moved to the [hospital]. In fact, each time Decedent required emergency treatment or laboratory tests she was transferred to another hospital and discharged from [USH].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Throughout her stay at the [USH], Decedent maintained her home at the [Catonsville property] and it was her intent to return to [the Catonsville property] if possible. As a result, this Court finds that Decedent did not \u2018reside\u2019 in Baltimore City.\u201d USH filed an appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqr\">County, which affirmed the judgment, largely for the reasons stated by the Orphans\u2019 Court. The Circuit Court also recognized that \u201cresided\u201d was not synonymous with domicile but, citing <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>required \u201conly bodily presence as an inhabitant of a place.\u201d It too found, however, that \u201cthe facts of this case do not support the conclusion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Decedent \u2018resided\u2019 at [USH].\u201d The court based that conclusion on the facts that (1) Ms. Faya never changed her mailing address or had her clothes or personal possessions moved to USH, (2) each time she left for acute care elsewhere, she was formally discharged from USH, and (3) throughout her stay, she maintained her home in Catonsville and intended to return there if possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">USH appealed to the Court of Special Appeals which, in an unreported opinion, reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court. The intermediate appellate court resolved the issue by applying traditional rules of statutory construction. By permitting a creditor, prior to the appointment of a personal representative, to file a claim in the county where the decedent \u201cresided\u201d at the time of her death, the Court concluded that the Legislature obviously intended that the claim could be filed in a place other than the decedent\u2019s domicile and that residence \u201csimply requires bodily presence as an inhabitant in a given place.\u201d (quoting from <em>T.P. Laboratories, Inc. v. Huge, </em>197 F.Supp. 860, 863 (D.Md.1961)). In the case at bar, the Court held, Ms. Faya\u2019s \u201cbodily presence as an inhabitant of a Baltimore City health facility at the time of her death\u201d qualified her as a resident of the City when she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">We granted the personal representative\u2019s petition for <em>certiorari </em>to review the Court of Special Appeals decision and, for the reasons that follow, shall affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">As a preface, we are not in accord with any implication from the Court of Special Appeals opinion that the mere fact that a person is bodily present in a particular county at the time of his or her death means, for purposes of ET \u00a7 8-104(c), that the person then \u201cresided\u201d in that county. If that were so, a person who dies while on vacation, or on a business trip, or during a short-term stay in a hospital could be regarded as \u201cresiding\u201d in the county where the hotel, hospital, or other facility is located, and we do not believe that, in enacting \u00a7 8-104(c), the Legislature contemplated or intended such a result. Residence means something more than that, but to determine what, we need to look at some legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Prior to 1969, the Maryland law, in the words of the Governor\u2019s Commission to Review and Revise the Testamentary Law of Maryland, \u201cprescribe^] a number of detailed and archaic rules with respect to the manner of presenting claims.\u201d Second Report of the Commission, at 125 (1968). The only section of the then-current Code dealing specifically with the actual presentation of claims required that they \u201cbe exhibited against an administrator.\u201d Md.Code, Art. 93, \u00a7 119 (1957, 1964 Repl.Vo.). To remedy that collection of detailed and archaic rules, and many others as well, the Commission recommended, and the Legislature enacted, a comprehensive, substantive rewriting of Art. 93, which then comprised the State probate code. Section 8-104, as enacted in 1969, provided alternative means of presenting a claim\u2014either directly to the personal representative or by filing it -with the register of wills.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">There was, however, a specific time range within which the claim had to be filed. It could not be filed <em>prior </em>to the appointment of the personal representative, nor, with limited exceptions, could it validly be filed more than six months <em>after </em>that appointment. <em>See </em>ET \u00a7\u00a7 8-101(a) and 8-103(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the claim had to be filed after the personal representative was appointed, it necessarily had to be filed in the county where the estate was being administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">That remained the law until 1989. The 1989 law that made the change was enacted as an emergency bill in order to comply with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, </em>485 U.S. 478, 108 S.Ct. 1340, 99 L.Ed.2d 565 (1988), which invalidated, on due process grounds, the statutes of limitations or repose, like that in Maryland, which cut off claims after a period commencing with the opening of a judicial proceeding. The Title to the bill (1989 Md. Laws, ch. 496) made clear that the principal purpose of the bill was to \u201calter[ ] certain time limitations on the presentation of creditor\u2019s claims against a decedent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>estate,\u201d which it did principally by commencing the period of repose, alternatively, from the date of the decedent\u2019s death (initially nine months, later reduced to six months), or the date the creditor received actual notice (two months).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The amendment to \u00a7 8-104(c), which enacted the language at issue here, must be read in light of the overall purpose of the law. By commencing the period of repose from the date of the decedent\u2019s death, the statute (\u00a7 8-103), for the first time, permitted creditors to file claims <em>prior </em>to the appointment of a personal representative and, in that circumstance, to file the claim with the register of wills in any of three possible counties\u2014where the decedent was domiciled, where the decedent resided at the time of death, or where the decedent owned or leased real property. No one of these options was, or is, preferred over another. It is the creditor\u2019s choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">This Court\u2019s cases dealing with <em>domicile </em>look principally to the person\u2019s subjective belief as to where his or her true home is located. If the person is physically somewhere else, the Court has given overwhelming weight to evidence that the person hopes, intends, or expects to return. <em>See Blount v. Boston, </em>351 Md. 360, 368, 718 A.2d 1111, 1115 (1998) (\u201cThis Court has held on numerous occasions that the \u2018controlling factor in determining a person\u2019s domicile is his intent. One\u2019s domicile, generally, is that place where he intends it to be.\u2019 \u201d). The objective indicia usually considered by the Court\u2014where the person is registered to vote, the address on the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license, where the person receives mail or keeps furniture or other belongings, for example\u2014seem to be examined less for any direct bearing on domicile and more in determining what the person\u2019s subjective belief really is and whether it is reasonable under the circumstances. <em>See Bainum v. Kalen, </em>272 Md. 490, 499, 325 A.2d 392, 397 (1974); <em>Stevenson v. Steele, </em>352 Md. 60, 70, n. 3, 720 A.2d 1176, 1180, n.3 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">That kind of deference to the person\u2019s subjective hope or intent, which both the Orphans\u2019 Court and the Circuit Court stressed in reaching their respective conclusions, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>far less validity when determining pure residency for purposes of ET \u00a7 8-104(c). Whether, in her heart, Ms. Faya regarded Catonsville as her true home and earnestly hoped, intended, or even expected that, one day, she might be able to return there is certainly entitled to be considered as part of the broad mix of evidence relevant to where she actually \u201cresided\u201d when she died. Because residency under that statute is an independent alternative to domicile, however, it ultimately must be determined on the basis of objective facts beyond her subjective hope, intention, or expectation, and, if the statute is to have real meaning, residency <em>must be reasonably capable of determination by the creditor. </em>Accordingly, those subjective factors, important to a determination of domicile, necessarily have much less weight than whether, or when, the person <em>actually </em>might be able or expected to return to his or her former residence or place of domicile.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">This was not a situation of Ms. Faya\u2019s being in a Baltimore City facility for acute care or even for a several-week or several-month period of longer-term therapy or care that, one day, would no longer require her presence there. Of critical importance in looking at the reality of her situation, the undisputed evidence was that, during the entire period of eleven months left to her, Ms. Faya was unable to be weaned off a ventilator and had to be fed through a feeding tube. The only times she left University Specialty Hospital were when she needed more acute care at other hospitals, all in Baltimore City. The fact that, because of Medicare requirements, the hospital was required to formally discharge and readmit her if she were away for more than 24 hours has no significance whatever because she was, in fact, returned to USH each time.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Here, notwithstanding what turned out to be unduly optimistic progress notes made within a few months after her arrival at USH indicating some improvement in her condition and some prospect of her returning home, the evidence at the more critical times nearer to her death eight months later was clear that, due to her unfortunate medical condition, it remained unlikely that she ever would have been able to return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>to her Catonsville home. A progress note dated as early as July 3, 2003 noted that she was in the chronic ventilator unit and that \u201c[s]he is not a candidate for weaning as she has severe end-stage COPD.\u201d Additional progress notes in the succeeding months confirmed that she was not a candidate for weaning from the ventilator unit. She obviously could not return home while she remained dependent on artificial life support and needed to be constantly monitored by trained professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">As an element of domicile, this Court has defined \u201cresidence\u201d as the place where one \u201cactually lives.\u201d <em>Stevenson v. Steele, </em>352 Md. 60, 69, 720 A.2d 1176, 1180 (1998). The plain simple fact, given insufficient attention by the Orphans\u2019 Court and the Circuit Court, is that, in light of Ms. Faya\u2019s situation, \u00dcSH was where she \u201cactually live[d]\u201d when she died. That <em>was </em>her dwelling, her home, her abode for eleven months\u2014the balance of her life\u2014and likely would have remained so even if she had lived months or perhaps even years longer. She did not die prematurely while in the course of recovery. The two trial courts effectively, and erroneously, grafted on to the concept of actual residency subjective elements of permanency that are more appropriate to determining domicile, and that is not the way the statute should be read.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Relying on the fact that \u00a7 19-342 of the Health-General Article refers to persons receiving care in hospitals as \u201cpatients\u201d and \u00a7 19-343 of that Article refers to persons in \u201crelated facilities\u201d such as nursing homes as \u201cresidents,\u201d the personal representative suggests that, in enacting ET \u00a7 8-104(c), the Legislature did not intend for persons receiving treatment in hospitals to be considered as \u201cresidents.\u201d We reject that notion. For one thing, there is no support for it in the legislative history of any of those statutes. Long-term care for medical problems, disabilities, or rehabilitation therapy may be provided by long-term acute care hospitals, chronic care hospitals, chronic disease centers, comprehensive care facilities, continuing care facilities, nursing homes, and nursing facilities. A patient in any of those facilities, depending on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>or her actual situation, may be regarded as \u201cresiding\u201d there for purposes of \u00a7 8-104(c), or not. The definitions vary and overlap.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">It is neither reasonable nor practical to base a determination of whether a decedent who was a patient in any of these long-term care facilities \u201cresided\u201d there, for purposes of \u00a7 8-104(c), on what kind of license the facility has or whether it is called a nursing home or a chronic care hospital. Nor is it consistent with the statutory purpose. One must keep in mind that \u00a7 8-104(c) applies to <em>all </em>creditors of the decedent, not just hospitals or nursing homes seeking to recover the cost of care provided to the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">How is any particular creditor, who may have little knowledge about the decedent other than that he or she died while a patient in a facility, to know whether the decedent would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>been able, within any particular time, to return to a home in another county, much less whether, at the time of her death, she hoped, intended, or expected to do so? Is the creditor to be put to the burden of discovering who her treating physicians were and asking their opinion as to whether she would be returning home soon\u2014information that, due to health privacy laws, the physicians probably would be unable to supply? To read the statute as requiring that kind of extensive inquiry as a precondition to filing a claim in the county where the decedent died and had, in fact, lived for the preceding eleven months is wholly inconsistent with the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">A simple investigation by a creditor in this case would reveal that Ms. Faya died while in a long-term care facility, that she had lived there for eleven months and at the time of her death was in no condition to return to her Catonsville home, and that no estate had been opened in any other county. Under ET \u00a7 8-104(c), that suffices. The filing of the claim in Baltimore City caused no prejudice to the estate or burden to the personal representative. As pointed out by Allan J. Gibber in <em>Gibber on Estate Administration, </em>6-55 (5th ed. and 2011 Supplement):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">\u201cUpon appointment, a personal representative has an affirmative duty to search the claims dockets in each of the counties in which a claim could have been filed, to discover if any claim was filed prior to appointment. The sooner after death appointment is accomplished, the less likely it is for claims to have been filed elsewhere.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals is affirmed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>JUDGMENT OF COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">BELL, C.J., BATTAGLIA and ELDRIDGE, JJ., dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-10\">.

That is what occurred in Ms. Faya\u2019s case. On each occasion, she was officially discharged and readmitted upon her return.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b563-6\">. In 1974, as part of the ongoing code revision process, Article 93 was recodified as part of the Estates &amp; Trusts Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b567-6\">. As an example, Md.Code, \u00a7 19-301(l) of the Health-General Article defines \"nursing facility\u201d as \u201ca related institution that provides nursing care for 2 or more unrelated individuals.\u201d Section 19-1401 of that same Article defines \"nursing home\u201d as \"a facility (other than a facility offering domiciliary or personal care as defined in Subtitle 3 of this title) which offers nonacute inpatient care to patients suffering from a disease, chronic illness, condition, disability of advanced age, or terminal disease requiring maximal nursing care without continuous hospital services and who require medical services and nursing services rendered by or under the supervision of a licensed nurse together with convalescent, restorative, or rehabilitative services.\u201d The State Health Plan, which is a regulation of the State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH), defines \"nursing home\u201d as \u201ca health care facility licensed for comprehensive care beds under COMAR 10.07.02. COMAR 10.24.08.16.B(32).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The State Health Plan defines \"chronic hospital\u201d as \"a facility licensed as a special hospital-chronic disease in accordance with COMAR 10.07.01 that serves patients who do not need acute care or care in another kind of specialty hospital, whose needs for frequency of monitoring by a physician and for frequency and duration of nursing care exceeds the requirements of COMAR 10.07.02 for care in a comprehensive care or extended care facility, and whose expected length of stay, typically exceeds 25 days.\u201d COMAR 10.24.08.16B(10). A \u201ccomprehensive care facility\u201d is defined as \u201ca facility licensed in accordance with COMAR 10.07.02 that admits patients suffering from disease or disabilities, or advanced age, requiring medical service and nursing service rendered by or under the supervision of a registered nurse.\u201d COMAR 10.24.08.16.B(12).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b568-7\">. The dissent accuses us of making assertions not supported by the record and of giving no guidance to the public regarding the proper interpretation of the word \"resided.\u201d Although we certainly disagree with the ultimate conclusion of the two trial courts, we have made no assertions of fact unsupported in the record. It is the dissent, rather, that has \"cherry-picked\" the parts of the record that support its argument and largely ignored the more relevant ones that destroy it. The critical determinative fact is that, whatever may have been her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>hopes or expectations when she was first taken to USH and during the early part of her stay there, for the entire eleven months Ms. Faya was at USH, she remained on artificial life support from which, according to the medical records the dissent had chosen to ignore, she could not and would not be weaned. The dissent does not tell us how any creditor would be able to know that Ms. Faya\u2014an 82-year old woman who had lived alone in her Catonsville home\u2014would be able to return there while totally dependent on artificial life support and constant monitoring for her daily survival. As for guidance, this is obviously not a situation where there is a \"one size fits all'' universal construct. Each case is dependent on its facts. We have decided this case based on <em>its </em>facts, which is what courts are supposed to do.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b569-5\">JOHN C. ELDRIDGE (Retired, Specially Assigned), J., dissenting, in which BELL, C.J., and BATTAGLIA, J., join.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">I dissent. While I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Court of Special Appeals erred by determining that a person\u2019s bodily presence in a particular county served as the main qualification for residency in that county, I believe that the majority opinion makes factual findings not supported by the record and fails to offer any instructive guidance regarding the criteria to determine what is a county of residence under Maryland Code (1974, 2011 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-104(c) of the Estates and Trusts Article. Section 8-104(c) provides, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">\u201cIf the claim is filed prior to the appointment of the personal representative, the claimant may file his claim with the register in the county in which the decedent was domiciled <em>or in any county in which he resided </em>on the date of his death .... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Maryland Rule 6-413(a) contains essentially the same provision. The dispositive issue in this case concerns the meaning of the word \u201cresided\u201d in \u00a7 8-104(c) and Rule 6-413(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">The majority opinion states that the \u201crelevant facts are undisputed\u201d in this case, but then proceeds to make a variety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>of assertions that are either not supported by the record or are contrary to findings made by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. As stated in the majority opinion, the decedent, Dorothy C. Faya, lived most of her life at 606 Stoney Lane, Catonsville, in Baltimore County, where she owned her home. She suffered a fall which led to her hospitalization at St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore City, from November 29, 2002, until December 21, 2002, when she was transferred to the respondent, University Specialty Hospital, a chronic care facility in Baltimore City. From that time until her death on November 21, 2003, Dorothy Faya was on several occasions transferred to other Baltimore City hospitals when she required services not available at University Specialty Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Each time Dorothy Faya was transferred to another hospital, she was officially discharged from University Specialty Hospital, and there was always the chance that she would not later have been re-admitted. In hindsight, the majority opinion argues that the fact that Ms. Faya was officially discharged \u201chas no significance\u201d because, in the end, she always returned to University Specialty Hospital. This position, however, overlooks the fact that her return to University Specialty Hospital was never guaranteed after her discharge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For every re-admission, she was assigned a new patient number. Her bed at the facility was not saved while she was away, but instead, her belongings were placed in a box and \u201cput ... downstairs in the office ... [to] keep ... in case she came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>back.\u201d Had University Specialty Hospital been fully occupied when she returned, she would not have been re-admitted. As the representative explained, \u201cOnly nursing homes have bed holds, not chronic [care hospitals.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The majority opinion also treats as a foregone conclusion that Dorothy Faya was never going to return to her home in Catonsville and advises lower courts to consider whether a \u201cperson <em>actually </em>might be able or expected to return to his or her former residence or place of domicile\u201d (emphasis in original). In the present case, however, what was \u201cactually\u201d going to happen to Ms. Faya was unknown at time. Neither her physicians nor Ms. Faya herself ever concluded that she would be unable to leave University Specialty Hospital. The record before this Court clearly indicates that Dorothy Faya always intended to return home, and the hospital was well aware of this intent. She was competent during the period of hospitalizations, and the Circuit Court, reviewing the evidence firsthand, found that, for a variety of reasons, her only residence was her Catonsville house, which had remained unoccupied the entire time she was hospitalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Although Ms. Faya\u2019s ultimate discharge plan was uncertain,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the physician progress notes tracking Dorothy Faya\u2019s health at University Specialty Hospital indicated that she had shown \u201cgreat improvement since her admission\u201d and that she was often \u201cfeeling really fine and she [did] not have any ... discomfort.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She could \u201cmove[ ] ... all four limbs fairly well\u201d and \u201csit[ ] comfortably in the chair by the side of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>bed\u201d offering \u201cno complaints....\u201d The hospital staff assisted her \u201cgetting range of motion by restorative nursing.\u201d Although she remained on a ventilator and a gastric feeding tube during her stay at University Specialty Hospital, the record is silent as to whether her conditions would sufficiently improve so that she could return home or be transferred to a nursing facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Ms. Faya\u2019s actual cause of death is another issue obscured in the majority opinion, which states that \u201c[s]he did not die prematurely while in the course of recovery.\u201d However, the record is actually silent on the ultimate Cause and location of her death. Ms. Faya\u2019s hospital records show that staff at University Specialty Hospital commenced cardiopulmonary resuscitation on her and that she was then \u201csent out [to] 911 to the acute where she was unable to be resuscitated.\u201d A separate report notes that she was \u201ctransferred via 911\u201d to \u201cUMMS.\u201d However, where she was sent, what caused her death, and where she ultimately died is not disclosed in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The doctors treating Ms. Faya never gave her the prognosis that the majority opinion now sees fit to pronounce, that Ms. Faya \u201cobviously could not return home.\u201d Ms. Faya was receiving treatment at University Specialty Hospital and, according to her physician\u2019s progress notes, was doing quite well. The simple fact is, at the time, no one knew what the outcome of Ms. Faya\u2019s care would be. It is unreasonable, as well as a violation of Maryland Rule 8-131(c),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for this Court now to make findings of historical facts concerning matters which, at the time, no one knew the outcome and which the Circuit Court record does not reveal.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The majority opinion stresses that if \u00a7 8-104 of the Estates and Trusts Article \u201cis to have real meaning, residency <em>must be reasonably capable of determination by the </em>creditor.\u201d (Emphasis in original). I agree that creditors, both medical providers and others alike, should be able to ascertain the residency of the decedent. Unfortunately, the majority opinion only offers confusion where more clarity is needed. There are no guidelines established by the majority\u2019s opinion regarding what criteria this Court, the lower courts, or creditors should employ to determine an individual\u2019s residency. The majority\u2019s decision in this case hinges on the rather amorphous condition of \u201cwhether, or when, [a] person <em>actually </em>might be able or expected to return to his or her former residence or place of domicile\u201d (emphasis in original) rather than being based on objective criteria previously applied by this Court to evaluate residency, such as mailing address, location of personal possessions, and documentary records. Foremost among the undefined criteria in the majority\u2019s opinion is what comprises the difference between a long-term residential stay at a hospital and a shorter, non-residential stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">As a starting point, the majority opinion fails to point out that the Hospital was, at all times, aware that the decedent\u2019s home was in Baltimore County, as most of her hospital paperwork noted her residence as 606 Stoney Lane in Catonsville. Creditors did not need to conduct an extensive search for Ms. Faya\u2019s home address, as the majority opinion implies, and her home address was in no way obscured from possible creditors. The majority opinion espouses concern that creditors will be unable to locate the proper venue for filing their claims, but in this case, it could not have been clearer that the most appropriate venue was the county where her home was located and where the majority of hospital records indicated she resided, Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">This case presents a simple matter of a creditor filing in the wrong county and not correcting its mistake until the time for filing expired. Rather than taking the optimal course of action and filing a claim in the county where the decedent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>home was located, University Specialty Hospital, on December 10, 2003, less than a month after Ms. Faya\u2019s death and prior to the decedent\u2019s estate being opened, filed a claim with the office of the Register of Wills for Baltimore City, where the Hospital itself was located, in the amount of $210,028.26, although the actual balance of the decedent\u2019s hospital bill was $206,343.12. Not until October 1, 2004, did University Specialty Hospital file a second claim in Baltimore County, where Ms. Faya\u2019s home was located. This second claim was filed after the sixth month limitation period for filing claims specified by \u00a7 8-103 of the Estates and Trusts Article.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the second claim filed in Baltimore County was late and, therefore, barred, University Specialty Hospital was forced to rely on its first claim and accordingly, brought the suit now before this Court, advancing the novel argument that Dorothy Faya \u201cresided\u201d in Baltimore City because of her hospital stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">At the conclusion of its proceedings, the Circuit Court denied University Specialty Hospital\u2019s claim, finding that the decedent did not reside in Baltimore City on the date of her death. The court, while acknowledging a legal distinction between a residence and domicile, nonetheless found that the decedent\u2019s only residence on the date she died was at 606 Stoney Lane, Catonsville, in Baltimore County, which was also her domicile. The court reviewed the facts that had been complied during the hearing and noted that it was \u201cuncontro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>verted\u201d that Dorothy Faya \u201cwanted to return to her\u201d Catonsville home. Reviewing the entire record, the court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYI\">\u201cThis lady was there [Baltimore City] for medical treatment only. She intended to get medical treatment, but on a temporary basis. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t get out of the hospital and return to her home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">As the majority opinion points out, the Circuit Court itself found that \u201cthe <em>facts </em>of this case do not support the conclusion that the Decedent \u2018resided\u2019 at University Specialty Hospital.\u201d (Emphasis added). The Circuit Court also pointed out that no writings indicated that the decedent intended to change either her residence or her domicile and that the application for medical assistance, prepared for Dorothy Faya by an agent or employee of the hospital, listed her residence as 606 Stoney Lane, as did numerous other documents related to her stay at the Hospital. Even the University Specialty Hospital\u2019s computer system listed the decedent\u2019s residence as 606 Stoney Lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The majority asserts, and I agree, that \u201c[rjesidence means something more than\u201d \u201ca person who dies while on vacation, or on a business trip, or during a short-term stay in a hospital.\u201d Unfortunately, the majority fails to explain which indicia can or should be used to determine what that \u201csomething more\u201d is. In resolving what it means to \u201creside\u201d in a place, I believe this Court should consider its previous opinions on residency, which the majority opinion, in large part, ignores. Those opinions, however, indicate that an individual does not \u201creside\u201d in a hospital room, especially when all of the objective criteria indicate that she \u201cresided\u201d elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">This Court\u2019s opinions construing and/or applying the words \u201creside\u201d or \u201cresidence\u201d in statutes and constitutional provisions generally have involved enactments where those words were construed to mean \u201cdomicile.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But \u00a7 8-104(c) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Estates and Trusts Article is a rare exception where the wording of the statute makes it clear that \u201cresided\u201d does not mean \u201cdomiciled.\u201d Instead, in this statute, \u201cany county in which [the decedent] resided\u201d serves as an alternative to \u201cthe county in which the decedent was domiciled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Nevertheless, this Court\u2019s opinions concerning the words \u201creside\u201d or \u201cresidence\u201d have often construed those words to mean \u201cdomicile.\u201d The connection between the words \u201cresidence\u201d and \u201cdomicile\u201d is logical because a place where someone actually resides (in a non-domiciliary sense) is a major factor in determining whether the location is also that person\u2019s domicile. But even in opinions where this Court has construed \u201cresidence\u201d to mean \u201cdomicile,\u201d the decisions lend insight as to what \u201creside\u201d or \u201cresidence\u201d means when those words do not mean \u201cdomicile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Our opinions have treated the words \u201creside\u201d or \u201cresidence,\u201d in a non-domiciliary sense, as synonymous with \u201cdwelling,\u201d \u201chabitation,\u201d \u201cabode,\u201d \u201cactual residence,\u201d \u201cplace where one lives\u201d and \u201chome.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Oglesby v. Williams, </em>372 Md. 360, 373-379, 382, 812 A.2d 1061, 1068-1072, 1074 (2002) (repeatedly equating non-domiciliary \u201cresidence\u201d with \u201cdwelling,\u201d \u201chabitation,\u201d \u201cabode,\u201d \u201chome,\u201d and place where one \u201cactually lives\u201d); <em>Blount v. Boston, </em>351 Md. 360, 365-372, 379-386, 718 A.2d 1111, 1114-1117, 1121-1124 (1998) (same); <em>Stevenson v. Steele, </em>352 Md. 60, 69-70, 720 A.2d 1176, 1180 (1998) (residence is where one \u201cactually lives\u201d); <em>Roberts v. Lakin, </em>340 Md. 147, 153, 665 A.2d 1024, 1027 (1995) (\u201c \u2018A person may have several places of abode or dwelling\u2019 \u201d); <em>Bainum v. Kalen, </em>272 Md. 490, 497, 325 A.2d 392, 396 (1974) (same). <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>at 1335 (8th ed.2004), defines \u201cresidence\u201d as \u201c[t]he act or fact of living in a given place for some time.... The place where one actually lives, as distinguished from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>domicile.... [B]odily presence as an inhabitant in a given place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">The common understanding of the words \u201cinhabitant,\u201d \u201chabitation,\u201d \u201cdwelling,\u201d \u201chome,\u201d \u201cabode,\u201d and \u201cplace where one lives,\u201d would not encompass a hospital where one is taken for medical treatment because of an accidental injury, and when the injured person intends to return to her \u201chome\u201d as soon as hospitalization is no longer necessary. This understanding is reflected in dictionary definitions. Thus, the word \u201cinhabitant\u201d is defined in <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>at 1163 (1981) as \u201ca person who dwells or resides permanently in a place as distinguished from a transient lodger or visitor....\u201d \u201cHabitation\u201d is defined as \u201cthe act of inhabiting\u201d and as \u201ca dwelling place: HOUSE, HOME, RESIDENCE. ...\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 1017). <em>Webster\u2019s </em>defines \u201cdwelling\u201d as a \u201cbuilding ... used for residence: ABODE, HABITATION.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 706). \u201cDwelling house\u201d is defined as a \u201chouse ... that is occupied as a residence in distinction from a store, office, or other building....\u201d <em>(Ibid.). </em>Similarly, \u201cabode\u201d is defined as a \u201cplace where one ... dwells: HOME....\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 4). Finally, the first definitions of \u201chome\u201d are \u201cthe house and grounds with their appurtenances habitually occupied by a family ...,\u201d and \u201ca private dwelling: HOUSE.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 1082).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The majority opinion fails to consider these definitions in deciding that Dorothy Faya\u2019s residence was University Specialty Hospital, but even more troubling, it leaves open the question of which factors contribute to a determination of an individual\u2019s residency. In evaluating residency, this Court has always considered objective indicators that get to the heart of the question of where the individual lived. A reasonable person, viewing Ms. Faya\u2019s situation, would not objectively believe that she resided at University Specialty Hospital. No one would have described it as her home or her dwelling. The normal trappings of a residence were simply not present at the hospital. Her family members did not, and could not, reside with her; she did not furnish her room besides having a few personal belonging, and she never changed her mailing address.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Even more confusing for creditors is the majority\u2019s insistence that \u201ca several-week or several-month period of longer-term therapy or care\u201d does not create a residence, particularly in light of the majority\u2019s failure to furnish any specifics concerning when such \u201clonger-term therapy or care\u201d becomes residential. Nothing in the majority decision would prevent, for example, a hospital in Baltimore City from filing a claim against a decedent\u2019s estate in Baltimore City, even if the decedent owned a home in Howard County and had merely spent a month at the Baltimore City hospital. No guidance is offered, or criteria set forth, as to what, in the majority\u2019s opinion, distinguishes a non-residential \u201cshort-term stay\u201d from a residential stay in a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Finally, the majority opinion bases its ultimate decision on information that it rightly acknowledges would not normally be available to creditors. The majority notes that, in this case, a \u201csimple investigation\u201d by a creditor would reveal that \u201cat the time of [Ms. Faya\u2019s] death [she] was in no condition to return to her Catonsville home,\u201d but then criticizes the notion that creditors should be \u201cput to the burden of discovering who [a patient\u2019s] treating physicians [are] and asking their opinion as to whether [the patient] would be returning home soon\u2014 information that, due to health privacy laws, the physicians probably would be unable to supply.\u201d The majority\u2019s decision relies on information that it knows an average creditor would not be able to obtain. Nevertheless, a \u201csimple investigation by a creditor in this case\u201d would have quickly yielded the address of Dorothy Faya\u2019s Catonsville home, where the estate was opened and where claims should have been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">University Specialty Hospital at all times knew the address of Dorothy Faya\u2019s home. The Hospital had it listed in their records, and knew that she intended to return there. On the facts of this case, the creditor was well-aware of the decedent\u2019s residency. It is sincerely unlikely that the Hospital filed in Baltimore City because it was confused as to where Ms. Faya resided. It filed in Baltimore City for its own ease and only now relies on that claim because the appropriately filed claim in Baltimore County was barred as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>A normal person\u2019s understanding of one\u2019s \u201cresidence\u201d would exclude hospitals treating a patient\u2019s accidental injury, with the patient intending to return home as soon as hospitalization is no longer required. This is not to say that a health care facility cannot, under some circumstances, be a \u201cresidence.\u201d For example, when an elderly person is unable to care for himself or herself, and is placed in a nursing home with no intention or prospect of returning to his or her prior home, the nursing home may well be the person\u2019s new \u201cresidence.\u201d Nevertheless, in this case, a representative of University Specialty Hospital testified that \u201c[w]e are a chronic care facility, we are not a nursing home.\u201d Moreover, it was stipulated that Dorothy Faya was competent during her hospitalizations, and the Circuit Court found that she wanted to and intended to return to her home in Catonsville.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Under the facts of this case, the Circuit Court was justified in concluding that Dorothy Faya did not \u201creside\u201d at the respondent Hospital within the meaning of \u00a7 8-104(c) of the Estates and Trusts Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge BATTAGLIA join this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-5\">.
