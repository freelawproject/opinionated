Carithers, Jr., Respondent, was admitted to the Bar of this Court on September 26, 2006. On April 30, 2010, the Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cPetitioner\u201d or \u201cBar Counsel\u201d), acting pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-751 (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a \u201cPetition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Respondent, charging several violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d) including 1.15(a) (Safekeeping Property)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 8.4(a)-(d) (Misconduct),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> stemming from the deposit of unearned fees into his personal account. In accordance with Maryland Rule 16-752(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we referred the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>to the Honorable Kendra Y. Ausby, of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, to conduct an evidentiary hearing and to render findings of fact and recommend conclusions of law. In response to our request, Judge Ausby held an evidentiary hearing on January 5 and 6, 2010, and, pursuant to Rule 16-757(c),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> rendered the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">[Respondent] earned his J.D. at the University of Michigan Law School and is admitted to practice law in the District of Columbia, Michigan and Maryland. In 1991, after law school, [Respondent] was an associate with the firm Ross, Dixon &amp; Masbeck located in the District of Columbia. In 1993, [Respondent] found another position as an associate with the firm Galon, Carash, Morris &amp; Garfinkel. In 1999, Respondent took a position with the Office of the General Counsel at Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan. In 2000, [Respondent] was an associate at the law firm of Collier, Shannon and Scott located in the District of Columbia. In March of 2003, Respondent was \u201cof counsel\u201d with the firm of Kevin Marino, P.C. located in Newark, New Jersey. From June of 2003 through September of 2003, [Respondent] was unemployed. From Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ber of 2003 until October of 2003, Respondent took a position with the City Solicitor\u2019s Office in Baltimore, Maryland. From October of 2003 through May of 2005, [Respondent] was \u201cof counsel\u201d with the firm Greenberg Traurig, LLP located in the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">During March of 2003 through May of 2003, [Respondent] held an \u201cof counsel\u201d position while working at the firm of Kevin Marino, P.C. The position \u201cof counsel\u201d was not defined. [Respondent] was paid by Mr. Marino and handled both Mr. Marino\u2019s cases and cases of his own. [Respondent] handled his own clients independently and did not enter his own clients into the Kevin Marino, P.C. client database.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">During October of 2003 through May of 2005, [Respondent] held an \u201cof counsel\u201d position while working at the firm of Greenberg Traurig, LLP. [Respondent] maintained his own clients and handled cases for Greenberg Traurig, LLP. [Respondent] did not enter his own clients into the Green-berg Traurig, LLP client database.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In August of 2005, the Respondent was hired at the [Baltimore-based] firm of Brown &amp; Sheehan, LLP (hereinafter \u201cB &amp; S\u201d). Michael Alan Brown, Esquire (hereinafter \u201cMr. Brown\u201d) and David Sheehan, Esquire (hereinafter \u201cMr. Sheehan\u201d) were the only two equity partners at the firm of B <em>&amp; </em>S. Mr. Brown was the managing partner of the firm and was responsible for generating work throughout the firm, maintaining day-to-day activities, and managing the employees at B &amp; S. Mr. Sheehan was the administrative managing partner of the firm and was responsible for bookkeeping and administration of the firm with respect to purchasing, billing, collecting and managing the accounts. In 2005, the firm of B &amp; S had approximately fourteen (14) to sixteen (16) attorneys, consisting of equity and non-equity partners, of counsel attorneys, and associates. The attorneys at B &amp; S were required to bill one-thousand eight-hundred (1,800) billable hours per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">[Respondent] was hired by Mr. Brown as \u201cof counsel\u201d at the firm of B &amp; S. There was no written contract regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the Respondent\u2019s employment at B <em>&amp; S, </em>including any written contracts or memoranda regarding the Respondent\u2019s \u201cof counsel\u201d position at the firm. The Respondent was hired as a full-time employee of B &amp; S, -with a full-time salary of approximately ninety thousand dollars per year ($90,000), including vacation and sick days, and various benefits including health, disability, life insurance, malpractice insurance, and a 401k plan. This was the same arrangement for associates at B &amp; S. However, during the Respondent\u2019s interview with B <em>&amp; </em>S, it was determined that considering the Respondent\u2019s experience, the Respondent would hold an \u201cof counsel\u201d designation at the firm in order to denote a more senior status than an associate. There was no agreement between the Respondent and Mr. Brown or Mr. Sheehan, that Respondent could maintain a side practice. On December 13, 2007, the Respondent signed an acknowledgment form, indicating that he had received the B &amp; S personnel handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The Respondent was an attorney with B &amp; S from August of 2005 through June of 2008. During the Respondent\u2019s employment with B &amp; S, he was a panel attorney under the Criminal Justice Act (CJA) for the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. After the Respondent completed a case for the CJA, the Respondent would submit a voucher with timesheets that would include the number of hours multiplied by the CJA established hourly rate. The voucher would be submitted to the coordinator of the CJA and after a period of 30 to 90 days, the Respondent would receive a check for both legal fees and out of pocket expenses. During Respondent\u2019s employment at B &amp; S, the Respondent only received two checks from the CJA The Respondent deposited the two checks into his personal checking account, then issued cashier\u2019s checks to B &amp; S for the original amount, less his out of pocket expenses. The first CJA check was in the amount of two-thousand seven-hundred and five dollars and twenty cents ($2,705.20), of that amount, the Respondent took out sixteen dollars and eighty cents ($16.80) for his out of pocket expenses. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>second C JA check was in the amount of six-thousand seven-hundred and six dollars ($6,706.00), of that amount, the Respondent took out two-hundred and thirty-two dollars ($232.00) for his out of pocket expenses. The Respondent deposited the checks in order to receive his out of pocket expenses because it was difficult to receive such reimbursements from B &amp; S in a reasonably timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The Respondent admits that he had a side practice while employed at B &amp; S. The Respondent deposited checks received from clients in his side practice into his personal account. The Respondent did not maintain a trust account for his side practice and all payments were deposited into his personal account. The Respondent did not maintain separate malpractice insurance and did not create a separate entity for his side practice. Further, the Respondent did not initially report any of the income received from his side practice from 2005 through 2008 to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). However, the Respondent had to file amended returns regarding taxable income received from his side practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">During the Respondent\u2019s employment at B <em>&amp; </em>S, the Respondent opened a number of cases on his own without entering them into the B &amp; S client database, while receiving payments using the B <em>&amp; </em>S billing statements and using B <em>&amp; </em>S resources. The Respondent acknowledged that he used B <em>&amp; </em>S retainer agreements, B &amp; S letterheads and stationary for clients for his side practice. The Respondent acknowledged that he represented clients of his side practice during the hours that he was at B <em>&amp; </em>S. Further, the Respondent retained several clients that were previously B &amp; S clients, but had been terminated by B <em>&amp; </em>S for failing to pay their legal fees. The following are examples of the Respondent\u2019s side practice while at B <em>&amp; </em>S:</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Representation of Patsy Stewart: The Respondent represented Patsy Stewart, who was entered into the B &amp; S client database and had executed a B <em>&amp; </em>S retainer agreement dated September 27, 2007. The Respondent fabricated a billing statement in order for it to look similar to the B <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>&amp; </em>S billing statement form and sent Ms. Stewart a letter and billing statements using B <em>&amp; </em>S letterhead. On September 27, 2007, the Respondent directly received an initial retainer of one-thousand dollars ($1,000.00) from Ms. Stewart and deposited the check into his personal account. However, the Respondent did not begin work on Ms. Stewart\u2019s matter until September 28, 2007. Further, the Respondent requested that Ms. Stewart forward all payment to Respondent\u2019s personal address.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Representation of Leona Victors: The Respondent represented Leona Victors as a side practice client after B &amp; S terminated Ms. Victors as a client for failing to pay B <em>&amp; S </em>legal fees. Ms. Victors was entered into the B <em>&amp; </em>S client database and had executed a B <em>&amp; </em>S retainer agreement on B &amp; S letterhead. The Respondent entered billable hours for work done on Ms. Victors\u2019 case into the B &amp; S billing system. However, the Respondent directly received payments from Ms. Victors and deposited the checks into his personal account. The Respondent had regular meetings with Ms. Victors outside of the B <em>&amp; </em>S office, specifically at McDonald\u2019s restaurant and at a hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Representation of John Paul Lennon: The Respondent represented John Paul Lennon as part of his side practice. Mr. Lennon was entered into the B <em>&amp; </em>S client database and had executed a B <em>&amp; </em>S retainer agreement on B <em>&amp; </em>S letterhead. The Respondent entered billable hours for work done on Mr. Lennon\u2019s case into the B &amp; S billing system. On September 5, 2007, the Respondent deposited the initial one-thousand dollar retainer ($1,000.00) from Mr. Lennon into his personal account. However, in the B &amp; S billing system the Respondent only billed one-hundred and twenty-five dollars ($125.00) for a \u2018meeting with client\u2019 on September 4, 2007. Further, the Respondent directly received payments from Mr. Lennon and deposited the checks into his personal account. The Respondent had regular meetings with Mr. Lennon only outside the B &amp; S office, specifically at Le Madeline\u2019s Restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>On June 23, 2008, Mr. Brown and Mr. Sheehan discovered that the Respondent had personally negotiated checks from clients and deposited the checks into the Respondent\u2019s personal account and had maintained a side practice separate from B &amp; S. On the same day, [Respondent\u2019s] employment with B &amp; S was terminated via email from Mr. Brown to [Respondent].</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">The Respondent did not disclose, either in writing or orally, to anyone at B <em>&amp; </em>S that he was retaining clients on his own, outside of the firm, or that he was regularly depositing client fees into his personal account, while being employed as a full-time salary attorney at B &amp; S. The Respondent never requested permission from B <em>&amp; </em>S to retain clients for himself, maintain an outside practice for himself or retain payments for himself, even though he had multiple opportunities to discuss the matter with Mr. Brown or Mr. Sheehan. Even after Mr. Sheehan informed the Respondent to withdraw from the cases where clients had failed to pay B &amp; S legal fees, the Respondent \u2018decided to keep [the clients] as a side practice to avoid withdrawing from the cases.\u2019 Further, the Respondent admitted that he knew there was going to be a problem if he informed Mr. Brown and Mr. Sheehan that he was not withdrawing from the cases and instead continued to represent the clients as a side practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The Respondent was never given authorization by either Mr. Brown or Mr. Sheehan to retain his own clients or have a side practice during his employment with B &amp; S. The Respondent was not given authorization to use B &amp; S letterhead, billing statements, or resources for the purposes of retaining his own clients. Furthermore, the Respondent was not given authorization to retain his own clients and accept payments from those clients directly for himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Judge Ausby found by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent\u2019s acts and omissions constituted a violation of Rules 8.4(a)-(d) and 1.15(a) of the MRPC. The hearing judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>also found that Respondent violated the Maryland Business Occupations and Professions Art. Sec. 10-304(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">As to MRPC 1.15(a), safekeeping of client funds, the hearing judge made the following conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">The failure to establish a proper trust account and the failure to \u201chold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property\u201d is a violation of Rule 1.15(a) of the MRPC. MRPC 1.15(a); <em>see Attorney Grievance v. Mitchell, </em>386 Md. 386, 872 A.2d 720 (2005). Further, in accordance with the Maryland Business Occupations and Professions Code \u00a7 10-304, \u201ca lawyer expeditiously shall deposit trust money into an attorney trust account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIu\">In this case, the Respondent never maintained a trust account while representing clients at his side practice. In addition, the Respondent deposited the initial retainers for Ms. Stewart and Mr. Lennon into his personal account prior to earning all of the legal fees. There is clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated Rule 1.15(a) of the MRPC and the Maryland Business Occupations and Professions Code \u00a7 10-304(a) by failing to place the initial retainers of clients into a separate trust account until such fees were earned by the Respondent. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Thomas, </em>409 Md. 121, 165, 973 A.2d 185 (2009) (finding that Respondent\u2019s placement of the entire retainer fee from the client including at least a portion not yet earned into his general operating account violates \u00a7 10-304(a) and MRPC 1.15(a)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">As to MRPC 8.4(b), engaging in criminal conduct that reflects adversely on a lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer, the hearing judge made the following conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Criminal prosecution is not required to find a violation of MRPC 8.4(b) and its absence does not necessarily mean the Rule has not been violated. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Breschi, </em>340 Md. 590, 667 A.2d 659 (1995). [The Rule requires] ... clear and convincing evidence of conduct that constitutes a commission of the criminal offense.... <em>Attorney Grievance v. Proctor, </em>309 Md. 412, 418, 524 A.2d 773 (1987). Further, the court must also find that the criminal conduct adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects. MRPC 8.4(b); <em>see Attorney Grievance v. Thompson, </em>367 Md. 315, 324, 786 A.2d 763, 769 (2001).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-4\">The Respondent [is] alleged to have committed theft by accepting payments directly from clients and retaining clients outside of B &amp; S. Theft is the \u201cunauthorized control over property.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Crim. Law Aet. \u00a7 7-104(a). Unauthorized control over property means a person who willfully or knowingly obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property by either intending to deprive the owner of property, willfully or knowingly using, concealing or abandoning the property in a manner that deprives the owner of the property, or using, concealing or abandoning the property knowing the use, concealment or abandonment probably will deprive the owner of the property. Md.Code Ann., Crim. Law Art. \u00a7 7-104(a)(1)-(a)(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">There is clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent deposited payments from clients into his personal account. Several of the clients were previously B &amp; S clients that had been terminated because of outstanding balances to B &amp; S. The Respondent continued to represent these clients despite Mr. Sheehan\u2019s orders to terminate the attorney-client relationship. The payments received directly by the Respondent represented legal fees still owed to B &amp; S. The Respondent was never authorized to receive and deposit any payments directly from clients. The Respondent willingly and knowingly deposited checks from previous B &amp; S clients that had outstanding balances with B <em>&amp; </em>S. There is clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>willfully exerted control over checks and intended to deprive B &amp; S of the checks. Theft is criminal conduct that explicitly and adversely reflects on a lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness, and fitness as a lawyer. Therefore, there is clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent has violated Rule 8.4(b) of the MRPC by engaging in criminal conduct that reflects adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">As to MRPC 8.4(c), engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit and misappropriation, the hearing judge made the following conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">The misappropriation of client\u2019s funds and third party funds is considered conduct that constitutes \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d and is considered an act of deceit and dishonesty, which is in violation or Rule 8.4(c) of the MRPC. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Moore, </em>301 Md. 169, 482 A.2d 497 (1984); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Ezrin, </em>312 Md. 603, 541 A.2d 966 (1988).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">While employed as an attorney at B &amp; S, the Respondent deposited retainers and payments from clients into his personal account. The Respondent was never authorized to retain former clients of B &amp; S and continue representing them as part of his side practice. The Respondent was never authorized to receive any payments directly from clients to deposit into his personal account. Moreover, the Respondent was never authorized to use B &amp; S resources in order to maintain his side practice. The Respondent\u2019s intentional misconduct reflects adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer. There is clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent has violated Rule 8.4(c) of the MRPC by misappropriating payments received from his clients that represented [legal fees still owed to B &amp; S] and using B &amp; S resources to maintain his side practice. Furthermore, there is clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated Rule 8.4(c) of the MRPC by depositing Ms. Stewart\u2019s and Mr. Lennon\u2019s initial retainers into his personal account prior to earning the legal fees. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Moore, </em>301 Md. 169, 482 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>A.2d 497 (1984); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Ezrin, </em>312 Md. 603, 541 A.2d 966 (1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">As to MRPC 8.4(d), involving conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice, the hearing judge made the following conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">The Court of Appeals of Maryland has found that conduct constituting the misappropriation of client or third party funds to be \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d in violation of Rule 8.4(d) of the MRPC. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Snyder, </em>368 Md. 242, 260-61, 793 A.2d 515, 525-26 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Hollis, </em>347 Md. 547, 702 A.2d 223 (1997). There is clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent has violated Rule 8.4(d) of the MRPC by misappropriating payments received from clients that represented B &amp; S\u2019 fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Finally, as to MRPC 8.4(a), the hearing judge determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">When an attorney has violated several Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, he necessarily violates 8.4(a) of the MRPC as well, which [provides that it is] professional misconduct [for] a lawyer [to] violate[] or attempt[] to violate the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Foltz, </em>411 Md. 359, 983 A.2d 434 (2009).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">There is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent has violated Rules 8.4(b)-(d) and 1.15(a) of the MRPC by committing professional misconduct.... Therefore, there is clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent has violated Rule 8.4(a) of the MRPC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">The hearing judge noted several mitigating circumstances. Judge Ausby found that Respondent cooperated with the Attorney Grievance Commission\u2019s investigation by submitting a letter to Bar Counsel describing his billing practices and use of B &amp; S resources. Respondent also informed Bar Counsel that he signed an agreement with B <em>&amp; </em>S to pay B &amp; S an amount representing the fees that B &amp; S clients had paid directly to Respondent, while Respondent was employed at B <em>&amp; </em>S. The hearing judge further found that Respondent had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>not engaged in any previous known acts of misconduct, and that his prompt issuance of checks to B &amp; S for CJA legal fees indicated that he did not intend to deceive B &amp; S, with regards to the CJA cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The hearing judge also noted several aggravating circumstances. Judge Ausby found that Respondent had intentionally deceived B &amp; S by maintaining a side practice while a full-time salaried employee of B &amp; S. The hearing judge found that Respondent had represented and personally accepted payments from terminated B &amp; S clients after B &amp; S expressly prohibited such representation. In addition, the hearing judge found that Respondent failed to disclose his side practice to B &amp; S, and used B &amp; S resources to maintain his side practice. According to the hearing judge\u2019s findings, Respondent intentionally deceived his side practice clients by using B &amp; S letterhead, stationary, retainer agreements and billing statements, and thereby purported to represent these clients as an attorney of B &amp; S. The hearing judge stated that \u201cRespondent\u2019s motives were dishonest because he purposefully and intentionally did not disclose to anyone at B &amp; S that he was accepting payments directly from clients and retaining clients outside of B &amp; S to supplement his full-time salary at B &amp; S.\u201d In addition, the hearing judge noted that, even if Respondent had been authorized by B &amp; S to maintain a side practice, Respondent still failed to maintain a trust account for his side practice clients. Finally, the hearing judge pointed out that, \u201cRespondent has been practicing law since 1991 and should be considered to have substantial experience in the practice of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A8p\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">This Court has original jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings, and is required to conduct an independent review of the record. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Zuckerman, </em>403 Md. 695, 709, 944 A.2d 525, 534 (2008); <em>Attorney Grievance v.

Respondent\u2019s written exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, and our responses, are set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\"><em>Exception 1: </em>Respondent contends that the record does not support the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Respondent\u2019s medical and other employment benefits were essentially the same as those given to associates at B &amp; S. Respondent further states, \u201cif the implication that [his] position as \u2018Of Counsel\u2019 at B &amp; S was effectively no different than an associate, this is not true. According to Respondent, it is more accurate to say that \u2018This was the same arrangement for all employees at the firm except for Michael Brown and David Sheehan, including all other of-counsels, associates and non-equity partners.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The hearing judge found that Respondent and B &amp; S had agreed that \u201cRespondent would hold an \u2018of counsel\u2019 designation at the firm in order to denote a more senior status than an associate.\u201d The hearing judge therefore understood that Respondent\u2019s Of Counsel position was different from an associate position, and credited evidence to this effect. The hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>ing judge considered unrefuted testimony <em>that </em>Respondent received employment benefits while Of Counsel to B &amp; S. In addition, Respondent testified during his hearing that he understood his Of Counsel relationship with B &amp; S to be \u201cthe same status that [he] had at Greenberg Trowick\u2019s D.C. office,\u201d where, according to his own testimony during the hearing, Respondent received employment benefits. Respondent\u2019s testimony supports the hearing judge\u2019s finding of fact. Therefore, the hearing judge\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous, and we overrule Respondent\u2019s first exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><em>Exception 2: </em>Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that \u201cRespondent signed an acknowledgment form, indicating that he had received the B <em>&amp; </em>S personnel handbook.\u201d In his written exception to this finding, Respondent states that, \u201c[i]t is undisputed in the record that the handbook contained no prohibition against maintaining a side practice or definition of what an \u2018of counsel\u2019 can and cannot do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The hearing judge did not find, nor did she infer, that the personnel handbook contained a prohibition against maintaining a side practice or a definition of the Of Counsel relationship. Respondent\u2019s own testimony during the hearing supports the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Respondent signed a form acknowledging his receipt of the personnel handbook. In addition, Respondent testified that he did not read the personnel handbook. Respondent\u2019s second exception does not challenge any findings of fact or conclusions of law, but merely refers to an inference that the hearing judge did not make. The fact that the employee handbook did not contain language expressly prohibiting an attorney from maintaining a side practice is not dispositive of the issues in this case. There was evidence before the hearing judge that B &amp; S did not authorize Respondent to hold a side practice of law while in the employ of B <em>&amp; </em>S. Accordingly, we overrule the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\"><em>Exceptions 3, 6, 8 &amp; 10: </em>Respondent\u2019s third exception is to the hearing judge\u2019s general finding that Respondent used B &amp; S retainer agreements, letterhead and stationary in his representation of his side practice clients. Respondent\u2019s sixth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>eighth and tenth exceptions are to the hearing judge\u2019s specific findings that Respondent used such materials in his representation of Ms. Stewart, Ms. Victors and Mr. Lennon.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Respondent admits that he used B &amp; S retainer agreements, letterhead and stationary in his representation of these clients as part of his side practice. Respondent contends, however, that he used his own language, and not the standard B &amp; S retainer agreement language. Respondent admits, however, that there is nothing in the record to support this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The hearing judge based her findings on both oral testimony and Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit No. 9, which includes several communications between Respondent and one of his side practice clients, Ms. Stewart. The client communications were on B <em>&amp; </em>S letterhead and signed by Respondent. The communications did not state whether Respondent was acting on behalf of B &amp; S or on his own behalf, nor did the communications indicate that Respondent was Of Counsel to B &amp; S. In his testimony during the hearing, Respondent neither explained why he used B <em>&amp; </em>S stationary for his side practice, nor did he assert that there was any distinction between B &amp; S retainer agreements and retainer agreements for his side practice, written on B <em>&amp; </em>S stationary.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">This Court has held previously that a material omission of fact by an attorney in client communications constitutes a violation of Rules 7.1<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 7.5<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of the MRPC. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Brown, </em>353 Md. 271, 290, 725 A.2d 1069, 1078 (1999) (finding that an attorney who included his co-counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>name on firm letterhead, without disclosing co-counsel\u2019s jurisdictional limitations, violated Rules 7.5 and 7.1 of the MRPC). Similarly, Respondent\u2019s use of B &amp; S materials supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent intentionally deceived his clients and B &amp; S. Respondent\u2019s assertions do not persuade us that the hearing judge\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. Therefore, we overrule Respondent\u2019s third, sixth, eighth and tenth exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><em>Exception U: </em>Respondent admits that he performed work for clients as a result of his side practice during the hours that he was working at B &amp; S, but contends that, \u201c[tjhere is no support in the record that such work for the Respondent\u2019s clients during B &amp; S hours impeded work for B &amp; S clients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The hearing judge did not find, nor do we consider, whether Respondent\u2019s work for his side practice in fact impeded his work for B &amp; S. Judge Ausby\u2019s finding that Respondent represented side practice clients during his B &amp; S hours is material to her analysis, and her conclusion that Respondent violated the MRPC. It is not material to the case whether Respondent\u2019s work for his side practice impeded his work for B <em>&amp; </em>S. We therefore overrule Respondent\u2019s fourth exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\"><em>Exception 5: </em>Respondent contends that the record does not support the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that some of the clients Respondent represented in his side practice had been terminated previously as clients by B &amp; S. Respondent contends that these clients had not been terminated by B &amp; S, but were never accepted by B &amp; S as clients in the first place, due to their inability to pay B &amp; S rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact were based on Respondent\u2019s testimony during the hearing. While Respondent never used the word \u201cterminated\u201d to refer to the clients, he clearly stated that the clients in question had been entered into the B &amp; S billing system and had outstanding balances to B &amp; S, that Mr. Sheehan had told Respondent to withdraw from his representation of those clients, and that Respondent continued to represent the clients on his own, against Mr. Sheehan\u2019s command. Respondent testified that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>\u201c[i]n the Victors case she had made payments to Brown &amp; Sheehan up until the end of December.... Then she went three months without making payments to Brown <em>&amp; </em>Sheehan. So in March of 2008, approximately, in her case was when I decided I couldn\u2019t keep her on the Brown &amp; Sheehan system with uncollected money for Brown &amp; Sheehan....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqc\">Respondent further testified that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\">\u201cwhen I decided to keep [Ms. Victors and another B &amp; S client] as a side practice to avoid from withdrawing the cases and I knew, or had been informed from David Sheehan, and withdrawing from ... their cases and I decided to keep their cases, I knew there was going to be a problem in discussing them in terms of time.... I tried to get [Mr. Sheehan] to talk to [Ms. Victors and other clients] and what [Mr. Sheehan] said to me was that you need to withdraw from these cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In light of Respondent\u2019s testimony during the hearing, the hearing judge\u2019s finding that \u201cRespondent retained several clients that were previously B &amp; S clients, but had been terminated by B &amp; S for failing to pay their legal fees,\u201d is not clearly erroneous. We therefore overrule Respondent\u2019s fifth exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\"><em>Exception 7: </em>Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Respondent did not begin work for Ms. Stewart until after Respondent deposited her first payment into his personal account.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Respondent also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Respondent requested that his clients forward payment to his personal address, claiming instead that the address was a P.O. Box used for business.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The hearing judge referred to Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit No. 9 to support her conclusion that, \u201c[o]n September 27, 2007, the Respondent directly received an initial retainer of one-thousand dollars ($1,000.00) from Ms. Stewart and deposited the check into his personal account. However, the Respondent did not begin work on Ms. Stewart\u2019s matter until September 28, 2007.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit No. 9 contains a written affida<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>vit signed by Respondent, stating that he deposited Ms. Stewart\u2019s initial retainer into his personal account- on September 27, 2007, and began work on her case on September 28, 2007. The affidavit further states that Respondent requested that Ms. Stewart forward all payment to Respondent\u2019s personal address. Therefore, the hearing judge\u2019s findings with respect to Respondent\u2019s representation of Ms. Stewart are based on Respondent\u2019s signed affidavit and are not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we overrule Respondent\u2019s seventh exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><em>Exception 9: </em>Respondent\u2019s ninth exception states, \u201c[t]he [hearing judge] credited none of the undisputed evidence and testimony from the client herself that the Respondent worked on the Victors case before payment was made by Ms. Victors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The hearing judge did not find that Respondent deposited payments received from Ms. Victors prior to earning the legal fees. In addition, any finding that Respondent did not engage in any type of misconduct during his representation of one client would not alter Judge Ausby\u2019s finding that Respondent engaged in misconduct during his representation of another client. Accordingly, we overrule Respondent\u2019s ninth exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\"><em>Exception 11: </em>Respondent\u2019s eleventh exception refers to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that, \u201cin the B &amp; S billing system the Respondent only billed one-hundred and twenty-five dollars ($125.00) for a \u2018meeting with client\u2019 on September 4, 2007.\u201d Respondent\u2019s eleventh exception states that, \u201c[t]his evidence contradicts Respondent\u2019s testimony that he did substantial work for Mr. Lennon before his first payment and also contradicts Mr. Lennon\u2019s testimony. This contradiction in the evidence does not measure up to clear and convincing evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Respondent did not demonstrate sufficiently that he had done substantial work for Mr. Lennon before he deposited the fees into his personal account. The hearing judge was not bound to adopt Respondent\u2019s testimony on this issue. The hearing judge concluded that Respondent reported only a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>portion of his legal fees to B &amp; S, and withheld the remainder for himself. \u201cConsistent with the standard of review for factual findings in attorney discipline cases, we have iterated that the judge \u2018may elect to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Harris, </em>403 Md. 142, 158, 939 A.2d 732, 742 (2008) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Harris, </em>371 Md. 510, 543, 810 A.2d 457, 477 (2002)). Respondent has not presented evidence to persuade us that the hearing judge\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. Thus, we overrule Respondent\u2019s eleventh exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><em>Exception 12: </em>Respondent contends that B <em>&amp; </em>S did not \u201cdiscover\u201d that Respondent was maintaining a side practice. According to Respondent, he kept his side practice files in his B &amp; S office, where the files remained in plain sight. In Respondent\u2019s view, B &amp; S could not be said to have \u201cdiscovered\u201d anything about Respondent\u2019s side practice, because he did not actively hide these files.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The hearing judge found that Respondent used his side practice to represent clients that B &amp; S had specifically told him not to represent. In addition, Respondent used B <em>&amp; </em>S resources for his own benefit without authorization. Respondent\u2019s lack of transparency in representing former B &amp; S clients and using B &amp; S resources constitutes clear and convincing evidence that he intended to deceive B &amp; S. The possibility that B &amp; S employees could have discovered Respondent\u2019s conduct by entering his office and examining his files does not rebut this evidence. Therefore, we overrule Respondent\u2019s twelfth exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\"><em>Exception 13: </em>Respondent contends that the hearing judge did not credit evidence that Respondent deposited two CJA checks into his personal account, and then promptly issued two checks to B &amp; S as payment for the legal fees. Respondent contends that these checks were accepted and deposited by B <em>&amp; </em>S without incident or complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Contrary to Respondent\u2019s exception, the hearing judge did describe Respondent\u2019s practice of depositing the CJA checks, and issuing cashier\u2019s checks to B &amp; S as payment for the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>fees. The hearing judge pointed to this practice as an indication that Respondent did not intend to deceive B &amp; S, or deprive B &amp; S of these legal fees. We therefore overrule Respondent\u2019s thirteenth exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><em>Exception H: </em>Respondent contends that B &amp; S was aware of his side practice, because he notified B &amp; S of his individual side practice clients through conflict check emails. Respondent testified that it was his practice to send emails containing his client\u2019s names to other B &amp; S attorneys, so that the attorneys could avoid any potential conflicts of interest in client representations. Respondent testified that he included the names of his side practice clients in these emails, but never received a response from any B &amp; S attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">It has already been established and unrefuted that Respondent continued to represent clients that had been entered, at one time, into the B <em>&amp; </em>S client database. Respondent has not presented any evidence that the extent to which he disclosed certain of his client representations to B &amp; S actually gave notice to B &amp; S that Respondent was maintaining a side practice. Furthermore, the hearing judge found by clear and convincing evidence that, while Respondent had several opportuniti\u00e9s to expressly notify B &amp; S that he was maintaining a side practice, he instead intentionally concealed his side practice from B <em>&amp; </em>S. For example, Respondent testified that he had several conversations with Mr. Brown or Mr. Sheehan in which he expressed his interest in \u201cme marketing.\u201d Respondent testified that he initially used this term in his interview to convey his desire to become a partner at B &amp; S, but later discussed \u201cme marketing\u201d in reference to both his side practice and his interest in becoming a partner. Respondent never expressly disclosed his side practice to B &amp; S, but instead omitted the word \u201cpartner\u201d from some of his conversations about \u201cme marketing.\u201d Respondent has not presented evidence that the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we overrule Respondent\u2019s fourteenth exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Exceptions to the Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">The hearing judge found that Respondent violated the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 8.4(a)-(d) and 1.15(a), as well as the Maryland Business Occupations and Professions Art. \u00a7 10-304(a). Respondent\u2019s written exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, and our responses, are set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\n<em>MRPC 1.15(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Respondent contends that he did not violate Rule 1.15(a) of the MRPC, because, \u201c[wjhile it is true that [he] had no trust account, it is untrue that he took money that did not rightfully belong to him by virtue of his legal efforts.\u201d Respondent does not directly address the hearing judge\u2019s legal conclusions with regards to Rule 1.15(a), but instead asserts that his clients were satisfied with his services and made no complaints about Respondent\u2019s practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Rule 1.15(a) of the MRPC requires a lawyer to \u201chold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property.\u201d Respondent testified during the hearing that he deposited client payments into his personal account. We therefore overrule Respondent\u2019s exception, and agree that Respondent violated Rule 1.15(a) of the MRPC.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\n<em>MRPC 8Mb)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">Respondent asserts that he did not commit theft or any violation of Rule 8.4(b) of the MRPC. Respondent con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>tends further that the fees he collected from former B &amp; S clients represented payment for his own work, not outstanding B &amp; S legal fees, that his actions did not constitute theft, because B &amp; S had already stated that it would not represent the clients in question, and that the clients in question were not terminated because of outstanding balances owed to B &amp; S.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The hearing judge found that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(b) of the MRPC, because he committed theft by accepting payments directly from clients and retaining clients outside of B <em>&amp; </em>S. A person commits theft when he or she willfully or knowingly exerts control over property without authorization, while possessing the requisite criminal intent. Md.Code Ann., Crim. Law Art. \u00a7 7-104(a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Respondent was never authorized to, and was expressly prohibited from, continuing to represent and personally accept payments from terminated B &amp; S clients. Respondent possessed specific information regarding the clients\u2019 ability to pay legal fees, as a direct result of his relationship with B &amp; S. And Respondent used this information, coupled with B &amp; S resources, to retain and personally accept payments from clients, without B &amp; S\u2019 authorization, for his own benefit and not for the benefit of his employer, B &amp; S.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">While he was a full-time salaried employee at B <em>&amp; </em>S, Respondent took time out of his normal B &amp; S working hours and used B <em>&amp; </em>S resources to represent clients for his personal profit. Respondent knowingly represented former B &amp; S clients with outstanding balances owed to B <em>&amp; </em>S. His efforts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>conceal his continued representation of these clients against B &amp; S\u2019 command, and his failure to adequately separate the finances, resources and client representation of his side practice from his work at B &amp; S, all support the conclusion that Respondent knowingly and with fraudulent intent deprived B &amp; S of its property for his own benefit. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Vlahos, </em>369 Md. 183, 186, 798 A.2d 555, 556 (2002) (finding that attorney violated Rule 8.4(b) by misappropriating payments from clients of his firm for his own use, and took steps to conceal his conduct from his firm), <em>Attorney Grievance v. Spery, 371 </em>Md. 560, 570-71, 810 A.2d 487, 493 (2002) (finding that attorney had committed theft, and that his \u201cfraudulent, criminal conduct acting on his own behalf for his personal gain to the detriment of his partners\u201d was grounds for disbarment).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">We agree with the hearing judge that Respondent\u2019s unauthorized retention of former B <em>&amp; </em>S clients, and his practice of accepting payments directly from such clients, was a criminal offense that adversely reflects on Respondent\u2019s honesty and trustworthiness to practice law. Accordingly, we overrule Respondent\u2019s exception, and affirm the legal conclusion that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(b) of the MRPC by committing theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\n<em>MRPC 84(c)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Respondent contends that he did not violate Rule 8.4(c) of the MRPC, because he was within his rights to maintain a side practice in addition to his work at B <em>&amp; </em>S. Respondent justifies his conduct by explaining that his Of Counsel relationship with B <em>&amp; </em>S permitted him to maintain a side practice, in addition to his work at B <em>&amp; </em>S.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">This Court has never had occasion to define the Of Counsel relationship, however, this relationship has been discussed by the Court of Special Appeals,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and acknowledged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Maryland State Bar Association (MSBA) Ethics Committee explained in a formal opinion that \u201cthe \u2018of counsel\u2019 designation denotes a close and continuing relationship with a firm, but not as a member of the firm, either as a partner or as an associate.\u201d MSBA Ethics Comm., Formal Op. 94-49 (1994).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The MSBA\u2019s ethics opinions clearly state that the Of Counsel attorney must at all times accurately represent his or her jurisdictional limitations, relationship to the firm, and the professional capacity in which he or she is representing a client. MSBA Ethics Comm., Formal Op. 97-2 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Even if we were to assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Respondent was Of Counsel to B &amp; S, and that his relationship with B &amp; S permitted him to maintain a side practice, Respondent\u2019s conduct as displayed here, nonetheless, was deceptive, misleading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>and unethical. The observations of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Homa v. Friendly Mobile Manor </em>are illustrative of how an attorney Of Counsel to a firm may maintain a side practice in addition to his or her work at the firm. 93 Md.App. 337, 612 A.2d 322 (1992). In that case, the court acknowledged that the Of Counsel attorney clearly stated in all client and firm communications whether he was acting individually or in his capacity as attorney Of Counsel to the firm. <em>Homa </em>at 361, 612 A.2d at 334. The court determined that the attorney had kept his side practice entirely separate <em>from </em>his work as Of Counsel to the firm, and that the firm did not have any financial interest in the attorney\u2019s side practice. <em>Homa </em>at 361-63, 612 A.2d at 335. The court further pointed out that the attorney retained his side practice clients by way of his own reputation, and not as a result of his Of Counsel relationship with the firm. <em>Homa </em>at 362-63, 612 A.2d at 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">In contrast, Respondent did not accurately represent the capacity in which he was representing certain clients, failed to separate his side practice clients and legal fees from his work at B &amp; S, and used his relationship with B <em>&amp; </em>S to retain clients for his personal benefit. Accordingly, our assumption that Respondent was permitted to maintain a side practice does not disturb the hearing judge\u2019s findings that Respondent misappropriated legal fees and used B &amp; S resources for the benefit of his side practice, or otherwise failed to take affirmative steps to avoid the appearance that the clients he represented were not B &amp; S clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">In addition, Respondent contends that he did not deposit unearned sums of money into his personal account. As we stated in our response to Respondent\u2019s seventh and eleventh exceptions to the findings of fact above, Respondent has not presented any persuasive evidence to contradict the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Respondent willfully deposited, as his own funds, advanced fee payments into his personal account, to be consumed, prior to earning the fees. Accordingly, we overrule Respondent\u2019s exception, and agree with the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(c) of the MRPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\n<em>MRPC 84(d)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Respondent contends that he did not violate Rule 8.4(d), which prohibits an attorney from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice, because \u201cthe case sub judice involves a fee dispute only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">An attorney engages in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice when he or she engages in conduct which erodes public confidence in the legal profession. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Clark, </em>363 Md. 169, 183, 767 A.2d 865, 873 (2001). We have long recognized that the commingling of personal and client funds is conduct which erodes public confidence in the legal profession, in violation of MRPC 8.4(d). <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Drew, </em>341 Md. 139, 669 A.2d 1344 (1996), <em>Attorney Grievance v. Kapoor, </em>391 Md. 505, 520-21, 530-32, 894 A.2d 502, 511-12, 517-18 (2006) (finding that an attorney who deposited his client\u2019s funds into the attorney\u2019s personal account violated Rule 8.4(d), because his conduct was harmful to public confidence in the attorney-client relationship), <em>Attorney Grievance v. Maignan, </em>390 Md. 287, 297-98, 888 A.2d 344, 350 (2005) (imposing an indefinite suspension where an attorney deposited client funds into his operating account and failed to even use a client trust account). In the present case, similarly, Respondent even failed to establish and use a client trust account. Moreover, Respondent did not offer any explanation for his failure to establish and maintain a trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The intentional misappropriation of client funds is conduct which erodes public confidence in the legal profession, and such conduct also violates MRPC 8.4(d). <em>Attorney Grievance v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 484, 671 A.2d 463, 481 (1996) (defining misappropriation as \u201cany unauthorized use by an attorney of [a] client\u2019s funds entrusted to him [or her], whether or not temporary or for personal gain or benefit.\u201d). The failure to keep client funds separate subjects the funds to the claims of creditors of the lawyer. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Bernstein, </em>363 Md. 208, 229, 768 A.2d 607, 618 (2001) (stating that \u201cthe rule against misappropriation is concerned with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>risk of loss, not only the actual loss.\u201d), <em>Attorney Grievance v. Goldberg, </em>292 Md. 650, 658, 441 A.2d 338, 342 (1982) (noting that, although an attorney\u2019s misappropriation of his client\u2019s funds did not result in an actual loss to his clients, \u201cthe public must be protected.\u201d). We agree with the conclusion that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(d) of the MRPC by misappropriating funds and failing to maintain a client trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\n<em>MRPC 8.4(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Respondent contends that the hearing judge was incorrect in finding that our holding in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Foltz, </em>411 Md. 359, 983 A.2d 434 (2009) stands for the proposition that any violation of the MRPC constitutes a violation of Rule 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">We have concluded previously that the violation of several rules of the MRPC may constitute a violation of Rule 8.4(a). <em>Foltz </em>at 411, 983 A.2d at 465. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Lara, </em>418 Md. 355, 363, 14 A.3d 650, 656 (2011) (stating that \u201cmultiple violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct as determined herein also establish misconduct in violation of Rule 8.4(a).\u201d). This Court has the ultimate authority to determine whether an attorney has violated one or more rules of the MRPC, and whether such violation also leads to a violation of Rule 8.4(a). <em>Attorney Grievance v. Harris, </em>403 Md. 142, 156, 939 A.2d 732, 740 (2008) (\u201cAs to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, such as whether provisions of the MRPC were violated, our consideration is essentially <em>de novo\u201d) </em>(citing Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(1)). The hearing judge was correct in concluding that Respondent violated Rules 8.4(b)-(d), 1.15(a) of the MRPC and Rule 8.4(a). Therefore, Respondent\u2019s exceptions are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">We have often stated that, \u201c[t]he primary objective of this Court, in matters of attorney discipline, is \u2018to protect the public, promote general and specific deterrence, and maintain the integrity of the legal profession.\u2019 <em>Attorney Grievance v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Roberts, </em>394 Md. 137, 904 A.2d 557 (2006); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Clark, </em>363 Md. 169, 184, 767 A.2d 865, 873 (2001) (\u2018The appropriate sanction depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including consideration of any mitigating factors.\u2019).\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Butler, </em>395 Md. 1, 11, 909 A.2d 226, 232 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">We conclude from the hearing judge\u2019s findings that Respondent committed criminal acts by intentionally and deceptively misappropriating fees from former B &amp; S clients that represented B &amp; S legal fees. In addition, Respondent failed to set up and maintain a separate client trust account and willfully deposited unearned fees into his personal account, for his personal use, prior to earning the fees. All of the above acts and omissions violated the MRPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Absent compelling extenuating circumstances, intentional misappropriation of client funds or another\u2019s funds is deceitful and dishonest conduct, which justifies disbarment. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Vlahos, </em>369 Md. 183, 186, 798 A.2d 555, 556 (2002) (holding that disbarment was proper, where attorney misappropriated payments from clients of his firm for his own use, and took steps to conceal his conduct from his firm). <em>Attorney Grievance v. Ezrin, </em>312 Md. 603, 541 A.2d 966 (1988) (holding that disbarment of an attorney who misappropriated funds from his law firm was proper, despite a finding that the attorney felt remorse and made restitution to the firm), <em>Attorney Grievance v. Zakroff, </em>387 Md. 603, 648, 876 A.2d 664, 691 (2005) (holding that, where the attorney engaged in intentional dishonesty and misappropriation of client funds, his depression did not amount to a compelling extenuating circumstance to justify a lesser sanction, and disbarment was proper), <em>Attorney Grievance v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 773 A.2d 463 (2001). In <em>Vanderlinde, </em>we held that, \u201cin cases of intentional dishonesty, misappropriation cases, fraud, stealing, serious criminal conduct and the like, we will not accept, as \u2018compelling extenuating circumstances,\u2019 anything less than the most serious and utterly debilitating mental or physical health conditions, arising from any source that is the \u2018root cause\u2019 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>the misconduct and that also result in an attorney\u2019s utter inability to conform his or her conduct in accordance with the law and with the MRPC.\u201d <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 413-14, 773 A.2d at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Respondent has not presented adequate mitigating or extenuating circumstances to justify a lesser sanction. The hearing judge made no findings that would in any way indicate that Respondent suffered from any mental or physical health conditions at the time of his misconduct. Although the hearing judge found several mitigating factors, those findings do not amount to extenuating circumstances that would warrant a sanction less than disbarment. We conclude from the hearing judge\u2019s findings that Respondent willfully and knowingly misappropriated funds and deceived both B <em>&amp; </em>S and the clients involved. Under the circumstances, the appropriate sanction is disbarment. Respondent\u2019s disbarment is effective 30 days after the effective date of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-515(0, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND AGAINST MICHAEL ROBERT CARITHERS, JR.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\">.
