Cox appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed his convictions. <em>Cox v. State, </em>194 Md.App. 629, 5 A.3d 730 (2010). Subsequently, Cox filed for <em>certiorari </em>and we granted his petition. <em>Cox v. State, </em>417 Md. 500, 10 A.3d 1180 (2011). In his petition Cox sought review of three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">I. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in upholding the admission of the hearsay testimony of State\u2019s witness Michael West, a jailhouse informant, in violation of the Petitioner\u2019s right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">II. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of the Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress the Petitioner\u2019s statements allegedly made to Michael West, a jailhouse informant, at Central Booking following the Petitioner\u2019s unlawful arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">III. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in finding the evidence sufficient to sustain the Petitioner\u2019s convictions?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">We answer all three questions in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">The Court of Special Appeals held that, because the out-of-court statements to fellow inmate Michael West were made voluntarily and were unprompted in casual conversation, the statements were nontestimonial, and therefore their admission did not violate the Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Cox, </em>194 Md.App. at 649-50, 5 A.3d at 742. Additionally, the court held that, because the trial court found that Petitioner had adopted the statements as his own, he was effectively the declarant, and thus his availability to testify satisfied the Confrontation Clause. <em>Cox, </em>194 Md.App. at 652, 5 A.3d at 743. The court also held that West\u2019s testimony was properly admitted because it was \u201csufficiently attenuated\u201d from the \u201ctaint\u201d of an earlier illegal search and arrest. <em>Cox, </em>194 Md.App. at 661, 5 A.3d at 748-49. Finally, the court concluded that the evidence presented at trial, including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>extrajudicial confession and the medical examiner\u2019s testimony that the manner of death was homicide, was sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find that Petitioner was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Cox, </em>194 Md.App. at 663, 5 A.3d at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">For reasons stated in this opinion, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">On December 28, 2007, at approximately 12:38 p.m., Baltimore City Police Officer William Keitz found Todd Dargan lying face up, bleeding and unresponsive, at the Church Square Shopping Center in Baltimore. Officer Keitz called for a medic and surveyed the scene. He later testified that he found a bullet casing and a head wrap, or \u201cdo-rag\u201d at the crime scene. The lead detective on the case, Baltimore City Homicide Detective David McDermott, arrived on the scene at approximately 1:00 p.m., accompanied by Detective Chester Norton. At that time, Dargan had already been transported to the hospital. Upon arrival, Detective McDermott canvassed the area and observed the head wrap and bullet casing as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Baltimore City crime lab technician Natalie Hoban arrived on the scene with another evidence technician, Tech Payne, at approximately 2:40 p.m. Ms. Hoban preserved the physical evidence at the scene, and identified the bullet casing observed by law enforcement to be a nine-millimeter cartridge casing. Ms. Hoban later testified at trial that, although the casing was dusted for latent fingerprints, none were found. The day after the incident, Dr. Donna Yincenti, an assistant medical examiner with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, conducted an autopsy of the victim\u2019s body. Dr. Vincenti determined that the victim sustained a gunshot wound to the head and the cause of death was homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">At approximately 12:30 p.m. on the same day the victim was shot, Baltimore City Police Detectives Milton Smith, III, Derek Phyall, and Eugene Bush were patrolling in an unmarked cai1 approximately ten blocks away from the Church <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Square Shopping Center when they observed Petitioner driving a black 2006 Mercedes Benz without his seatbelt fastened. Rodney Johnson, a black male wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, was sitting in the passenger\u2019s seat. When the car failed to come to a complete stop at a stop sign, the detectives initiated a traffic stop. Although all three detectives testified at a pretrial hearing involving Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress, the exact time line of the events that followed, between the initial stop and Petitioner\u2019s arrest, remains unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">According to the findings of the Circuit Court at the suppression hearing, when the police stopped Mr. Johnson and Petitioner, Mr. Johnson\u2019s hands were visibly shaking, and Petitioner appeared calm. As the detectives spoke with Petitioner and Mr. Johnson, a series of calls came over the police radio reporting the nearby shooting, and Mr. Johnson appeared increasingly nervous as he overheard the calls. Observing this, Detective Smith asked Mr. Johnson if he possessed anything illegal, and after Mr. Johnson replied that he did not, the detective asked if he \u201ccould check.\u201d Mr. Johnson stepped out of the car and Detective Smith patted him down, but did not find either drugs or weapons in his possession. Mr. Johnson was instructed to sit on the curb beside the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Based on the testimony of the officers at the suppression hearing and police dispatch records, the Circuit Court found that, between fifteen and twenty-three minutes after the initial stop, a description of the suspect in the Church Square shooting was relayed over the radio describing a \u201cblack male wearing a black hoodie.\u201d Noting that Mr. Johnson matched that description, Detective Phyall asked Petitioner if there was anything in the car. In response, Petitioner stepped out of the car with his hands in the air. Detective Phyall testified that he felt this action constituted consent to a search, and while Detective Bush patted Petitioner down, finding no drugs or weapons, Detective Phyall searched the vehicle and found a handgun in the trunk. At this point, both Petitioner and Mr. Johnson were placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Petitioner and Mr. Johnson filed a pretrial motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the stop, namely the recovered gun. The Circuit Court held an evidentiary hearing, during which the court heard testimony from Detectives Phyall, Bush, and Smith, and subsequently granted the motion and suppressed the handgun in addition to any testimony relating to the search or arrest. The court found that the initial stop was lawful, but concluded that the length of that detention, which was between fifteen and twenty-three minutes, was unreasonable. The court based this determination on the facts that the police did not conduct a check for warrants prior to the arrest, and no citations were issued during the period between the initial detention and the call reporting the description of the murder suspect. Additionally, the hearing judge found that the police lacked both consent and probable cause to search the vehicle. <em>See Cox, </em>194 Md.App. at 637-38, 5 A.3d at 734. The State does not challenge that the detention, and therefore the search and subsequent arrest, were unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The Circuit Court held a second pretrial suppression hearing regarding Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress the testimony of a fellow inmate named Michael West. At the hearing, Mr. West testified that he had been arrested, on an unrelated weapons charge, on the same date as Petitioner and Johnson. According to Mr. West, he saw Petitioner and Mr. Johnson the next day in central booking. Mr. West explained that he had known Mr. Johnson for approximately fifteen years. According to Mr. West, Mr. Johnson told Mr. West about the murder and the subsequent arrest in detail, without provocation, while Petitioner stood close by, listening and occasionally filling in details. Mr. West continued that, according to Mr. Johnson, Petitioner and Mr. Johnson were driving by the shopping center when Petitioner identified the victim as someone who had been involved in the murder of an acquaintance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Mr. Johnson told Mr. West that Petitioner offered him $15,000 to kill the victim. When Mr. Johnson agreed, Petitioner gave him a nine-millimeter pistol and dropped him off on Caroline Street, adjacent to Church Square Shopping Center. Mr. Johnson ran up behind the victim and shot him in the head, then met Petitioner on Bond Street around the corner, put the gun in the trunk of the car, and got into the vehicle. According to Mr. West, Mr. Johnson then explained that they had been pulled over, and Petitioner added that the police had noticed Mr. Johnson\u2019s nervousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Petitioner\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of this testimony as hearsay, a violation of his right to confrontation, and as the \u201cpoisonous fruit\u201d of the illegal detention, search, and arrest. The hearing court denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress the statements, finding that, because the Petitioner made an independent decision to speak to Mr. West and did not deny the statements made by Mr. Johnson, the statements were \u201c \u2018outside of the ambit of the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cox, </em>194 Md.App. at 638, 5 A.3d at 735. As to the hearsay issue, the hearing court held that the statements by Mr. Johnson, to Mr. West, were admissible under Md. Rule 5-803(2)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as adopted admissions by Petitioner, with the exception of those statements regarding events between when Mr. Johnson left Petitioner\u2019s car and when he returned, as Petitioner would not have had first-hand knowledge of those events and thus could not adopt the statements. To support its ruling, the hearing court cited to <em>Henry v. State, </em>324 Md. 204, 596 A.2d 1024 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 972, 112 S.Ct. 1590, 118 L.Ed.2d 307 (1992), in which we held that a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>can make a \u201ctacit admission\u201d adopting another\u2019s statement by his or her silence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Following the pretrial motions hearings, trial commenced on January 27, 2009. Police officers Keitz, McDermott, Norton, and Phyall testified regarding the stop, arrest, and crime scene. The lab technician and medical examiner testified as to the crime scene evidence and wounds on the victim. Additionally, Michael West testified about the conversation between Mr. Johnson, himself, and Petitioner. At the pretrial suppression hearing, Mr. West testified regarding the statements made by Mr. Johnson, which were deemed tacit admissions of Petitioner. The jury convicted Petitioner of first degree murder, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence, wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun, and possession of a regulated firearm after conviction of a disqualifying crime. Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed his convictions. <em>Cox v. State, </em>194 Md.App. 629, 5 A.3d 730 (2010). The intermediate appellate court held that Petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation had not been violated, that Mr. Johnson and Petitioner\u2019s admission in the presence of Mr. West was sufficiently attenuated from the illegal detention and search so as to not require exclusion, and that the State produced sufficient evidence at trial to allow a reasonable jury to find Petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">As we explained recently in <em>Smith v. State, </em>414 Md. 357, 361, 995 A.2d 685, 687-88 (2010):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>We review the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling on the motion to suppress and \u201cconsider only the facts and information contained in the record of the suppression hearing.\u201d <em>Longshore v. State, </em>399 Md. 486, 498, 924 A.2d 1129, 1135 (2007). \u201cThe factual findings of the suppression court and its conclusions regarding the credibility of testimony are accepted unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Prioleau v. State, </em>411 Md. 629, 638, 984 A.2d 851, 856 (2009) (quoting <em>Rush v. State, </em>403 Md. 68, 82-83, 939 A.2d 689, 697 (2008)). The foregoing notwithstanding, we \u201cundertake our own independent constitutional appraisal of the record by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the present case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">A. Confrontation Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d Similarly, Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides \u201c[t]hat in all criminal prosecutions, every man hath a right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d Because \u201c[t]he Fourteenth Amendment renders the [Confrontation] Clause binding on the States,\u201d <em>Michigan v. Bryant, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1143, 1152, 179 L.Ed.2d 93, 104 (2011) (citing <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965)), we analyze the admission of out-of-court statements against criminal defendants under the framework created by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">In <em>Crawford, </em>the State obtained a tape recording of a statement that the defendant\u2019s wife had previously given to the police. She claimed marital privilege and did not take the stand to testify. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 38, 124 S.Ct. at 1356-57, 158 L.Ed.2d at 185. At trial, the State played the taped recording over defense objection. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 40, 124 S.Ct. at 1358, 158 L.Ed.2d at 186. The United States Supreme Court explained that the Confrontation Clause is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>focused specifically on the defendant\u2019s right to confront \u201cthe witnesses against him,\u201d U.S. CONST, amend. VI, and the Court determined that the prevailing definition of the word \u201cwitness\u201d at the time the Sixth Amendment was drafted was \u201cthose who \u2018bear testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192 (citing 2 N. WEBSTER, AN AMERICAN DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE (1828)). As a result, the Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">An accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not. The constitutional text, like the history underlying the common-law right of confrontation, thus reflects an especially acute concern with a specific type of out-of-court statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-6\"><em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The Court continued that, regardless of the prevailing hearsay laws or how reliable a statement may be, \u201cthe Framers would not have allowed admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. at 1365, 158 L.Ed.2d at 194. In contrast, the Court explained that if a statement is nontestimonial, the Confrontation Clause does not bar its admission, and the only remaining question is whether the statement is admissible under the relevant rules of evidence. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 203 (stating that \u201can approach that exempted such [nontestimonial] statements from Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether\u201d would be \u201cwholly consistent with the Framers\u2019 design\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Thus, following <em>Crawford, </em>whether a statement was considered \u201ctestimonial\u201d became critically important to the Confrontation Clause analysis. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">Various formulations of this core class of \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements exist: \u201cex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent\u2014that is, material such as affidavits, custo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>dial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially,\u201d ... \u201cextrajudicial statements .. contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions,\u201d ... \u201cstatements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-5\"><em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 193 (citations and quotations omitted). Although the Court found that the term testimonial \u201capplies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations,\u201d it left \u201cfor another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Later, <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006), expanded on the <em>Crawford </em>principle, creating the following test for determining whether an out-of-court statement given during police interrogation is testimonial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">Statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-8\"><em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. at 2273-74, 165 L.Ed.2d at 237. In <em>Davis, </em>the defendant was accused of domestic violence against his former girlfriend. The trial court allowed the State to play a tape recording of a 911 call the victim made, seeking help during a physical altercation with Davis. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 817, 126 S.Ct. at 2271, 165 L.Ed.2d at 234. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>The Court concluded that, under the above test, the recording was admissible despite the fact that the victim did not testify, because the statements \u201cwere not testimonial.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 829, 126 S.Ct. at 2277, 165 L.Ed.2d at 241. The Court explained that the victim\u2019s \u201ccall was plainly a call for help resulting from a bona fide physical threat....[T]he nature of what was asked and answered in <em>Davis, </em>again viewed objectively, was such that the elicited statements were necessary to be able to <em>resolve </em>the present emergency, rather than simply to learn (as in <em>Crawford) </em>what had happened in the past.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 827, 126 S.Ct. at 2276, 165 L.Ed.2d at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Although the facts of <em>Davis </em>\u201c[made] it unnecessary to consider whether and when statements made to someone other than law enforcement personnel are \u2018testimonial,\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 823 n. 2, 126 S.Ct. at 2274, 165 L.Ed.2d at 238, the Court strongly implied that statements made in casual conversation between prisoners are nontestimonial. While other courts did not necessarily use the term \u201ctestimonial\u201d or explicitly refer to the distinction between testimonial and nontestimonial statements until <em>Crawford </em>in 2004, the Court in <em>Davis </em>pointed out that courts have consistently found that the right to confrontation \u201capplied only in the testimonial context\u201d throughout American history. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 824, 126 S.Ct. at 2275, 165 L.Ed.2d at 238. The Court continued that \u201cLw]here our cases did dispense with those [Confrontation Clause] requirements ... the statements at issue were clearly nontestimonial.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 825, 126 S.Ct. at 2275, 165 L.Ed.2d at 239. To illustrate this point, the Court cited <em>Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 181\u201484, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987) (finding no Confrontation Clause violation in admission of statements made by a co-conspirator to an undercover informant) and <em>Dutton v. Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 87-89, 91 S.Ct. 210, 27 L.Ed.2d 213 (1970) (plurality opinion) (finding no violation in the admission of a statement made by a co-conspirator to another inmate). <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 825, 126 S.Ct. at 2275, 165 L.Ed.2d at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Although the <em>pre-Crawford </em>reasoning employed in <em>Dutton </em>is no longer valid, the facts of <em>Dutton </em>are quite similar to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>in the present case and the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent treatment of those facts in its <em>post-Crawford </em>Confrontation Clause cases aids in our analysis. As a result, it is significant that the <em>Davis </em>Court referred to the <em>Dutton </em>statements as \u201cclearly nontestimonial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Dutton, </em>the defendant, Alex Evans, was convicted of first degree murder for the fatal shooting of three policemen. <em>Dutton, </em>400 U.S. at 76, 91 S.Ct. at 213, 27 L.Ed.2d at 219. At his trial, the prosecution was allowed to introduce testimony by an inmate named Shaw, regarding a statement made by Evans\u2019s co-conspirator, a man named Williams, when Shaw and Williams were sharing a jail cell. According to the Court, \u201cShaw said that when Williams was returned to the penitentiary from the arraignment, he had asked Williams: \u2018How did you make out in court?\u2019 and that Williams had responded, \u2018If it hadn\u2019t been for that dirty son-of-a-bitch Alex Evans, we wouldn\u2019t be in this now.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dutton, </em>400 U.S. at 77, 91 S.Ct. at 214, 27 L.Ed.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">As in the present case, in <em>Dutton, </em>it did not appear that the witness was acting as a law enforcement agent at the time the incriminating statements by the co-conspirator were made. <em>See Dutton, </em>400 U.S. at 87, 91 S.Ct. at 219, 27 L.Ed.2d at 226 (stating that the case \u201cdoes not involve the use, or misuse, of a confession made in the coercive atmosphere of official interrogation\u201d). Like the jailhouse informant in this case, it was purely coincidental that Shaw was in the same jail at the same time as Williams. Further, similar to Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements to Michael West in the present case, Williams\u2019s statements in <em>Dutton </em>arose purely out of casual conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Additionally, several courts since <em>Crawford </em>have held that statements made by one inmate to another are nontestimonial, even where the testifying witness was acting as a government agent. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Smalls, </em>605 F.3d 765, 779-80 (10th Cir.2010) (involving a statement to an inmate acting as confidential informant was \u201cundoubtedly nontestimonial under any legitimate view of the law\u201d because the defendant \u201cdid not make his statement to [the] Cl for the \u2018primary purpose\u2019 of establishing or proving facts relevant to a later prosecution\u201d and the statement lacked the formality required to render a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>statement testimonial); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>495 F.3d 951, 976 (8th Cir.2007) (determining that remarks by one inmate to another \u201cfall safely outside the scope of testimonial hearsay\u201d because \u201cHonken was not making \u2018formal statements.\u2019 Nor were his statements elicited in response to government interrogation whose primary purpose was to establish facts potentially relevant to a criminal prosecution.\u201d). Specifically, we find the analysis in <em>Smalls </em>particularly enlightening. In applying the primary purpose test from <em>Davis, </em>the 10th Circuit explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-4\">Moreover, Cook did not make his statement to [the] Cl for the \u2018primary purpose\u2019 of establishing or proving facts relevant to a criminal prosecution. Obviously, Cook would not have shared what he did had he known the Government was recording his statement or that his cellmate was a CL Objectively viewed from Cook\u2019s standpoint, his statement was much more akin to casual remarks to an acquaintance than formal declarations to an official. Cook in no sense intended to bear testimony against Defendant Smalls; Cook in no manner sought to establish facts for use in a criminal investigation or prosecution. Cook boasted of the details of a cold-blooded murder in response to \u2018casual questioning\u2019 by a fellow inmate and apparent friend. Cook\u2019s statement is undoubtedly nontestimonial under any legitimate view of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-5\"><em>Smalls, </em>605 F.3d at 779-80 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In a <em>post-Crawford </em>Confrontation Clause case decided by the United States Supreme Court, <em>Giles v. California, </em>554 U.S. 353, 128 S.Ct. 2678, 171 L.Ed.2d 488 (2008), the Court held that a California statute providing a \u201cforfeiture by wrongdoing\u201d exception to the right of confrontation was too broad. <em>Giles, </em>554 U.S. at 359-60, 128 S.Ct. at 2683-84, 171 L.Ed.2d at 495-96. Responding to the dissent\u2019s criticism in <em>Giles </em>that this holding would create particular hardships in domestic violence cases, Justice Scalia explained for the Court that \u201conly <em>testimonial </em>statements are excluded by the Confrontation Clause. Statements to friends and neighbors about abuse and intimidation and statements to physicians in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>receiving treatment would be excluded, if at all, only by hearsay rules.\u201d <em>Giles, </em>554 U.S. at 376, 128 S.Ct. at 2692-93, 171 L.Ed.2d at 505-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The Court\u2019s declaration in <em>Davis </em>that the casual remarks in <em>Bourjaily </em>and <em>Dutton </em>were \u201cclearly nontestimonial,\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 825, 126 S.Ct. at 2275, 165 L.Ed.2d at 239, the assertion in <em>Giles </em>that statements to \u201cfriends and neighbors\u201d or to \u201cphysicians\u201d are not testimonial, <em>Giles, </em>554 U.S. at 376, 128 S.Ct. at 2692-93, 171 L.Ed.2d at 505-06, and the underlying premise in <em>Crawford </em>that \u201c[a]n accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192, strongly suggest that most, if not all, statements that are not made to state actors are nontestimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Earlier this year, in <em>Michigan v. Bryant, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1143, 179 L.Ed.2d 93 (2011), the United States Supreme Court elaborated on its earlier holdings and provided a broader framework for determining whether a statement is testimonial. In <em>Bryant, </em>a murder victim made statements to police officers, who found the victim dying in a parking lot, identifying the defendant as his killer. <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 1150, 179 L.Ed.2d at 102. The Court held that the statements were nontestimonial because \u201cthe circumstances of the interaction between [the victim] and the police objectively indicate that the \u2018primary purpose of the interrogation\u2019 was \u2018to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 1150, 179 L.Ed.2d at 101 (quoting <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. at 2273). The Court explained that \u201c[w]hen, as in <em>Davis, </em>the primary purpose of an interrogation is to respond to an \u2018ongoing emergency,\u2019 its purpose is not to create a record for trial and thus is not within the scope of the Clause.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 1155, 179 L.Ed.2d at 107. Thus, if the primary purpose of a statement is not to create a substitute for trial testimony, then \u201cthe admissibility of a statement is the concern of state and federal rules of evidence, not the Confronta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>tion Clause.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 1155, 179 L.Ed.2d at 107-08. In making this determination, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is not the subjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved in a particular encounter, but rather the purpose that reasonable participants would have had, as ascertained from the individuals\u2019 statements and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 1156, 179 L.Ed.2d at 108-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Applying the holdings in <em>Crawford, Davis, </em>and <em>Bryant </em>to this case, the Court of Special Appeals held that Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements were nontestimonial because \u201cthey were not made under circumstances in which a reasonable person would believe that the statements would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d <em>Cox v. State, </em>194 Md.App. 629, 649, 5 A.3d 730, 741 (2010). Petitioner argues that none of these cases applied to statements made outside the contexts of law enforcement investigations or judicial proceedings, and that whether a conversation between private citizens should be considered testimonial is an \u201copen question.\u201d Petitioner also contends that the Court of Special Appeals \u201cwas led astray\u201d by extrapolating general principles from the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in cases in which the statements in question were given to police officers. According to Petitioner, the Clause\u2019s protections might extend to purely private interactions, noting that Justice Scalia, in his dissent in <em>Bryant, </em>referenced <em>King v. Brasier, </em>1 Leach 199, 200, 168 Eng. Rep. 202, 202-03 (K.B. 1779), in which an English court refused to admit a mother\u2019s account of statements her daughter made after being sexually assaulted. <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 1173, 179 L.Ed.2d at 126 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">In contrast, the State argues that the Court of Special Appeals was correct to apply the objective primary purpose test laid out in <em>Bryant. </em>The State relies on <em>Davis, Crawford, Bryant, </em>and cites to <em>State v. Snowden, </em>385 Md. 64, 83, 867 A.2d 314, 325 (2005), in which we held that a statement given during police interrogation is testimonial if \u201cmade under circumstances that would lead an objective declarant reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d Citing to these cases, the State argues that \u201cthe intermediate appellate court properly applied the very factors enunciated by both the Supreme Court and this Court ... because application of the prevailing factors compels the conclusion that Cox\u2019s statements to West were not testimonial, they were not inadmissible under <em>Crawford.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">We agree with the State that the Court of Special Appeals applied the correct test. We hold that when the State seeks to introduce an out-of-court statement against a criminal defendant, the proper inquiry under <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Bryant </em>is to determine whether a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s situation would have made the statement \u201cwith a primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>562 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 1155, 179 L.Ed.2d at 107. Thus, if the primary purpose of the statement is \u201cmade under circumstances that would [not] lead an objective declarant reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial,\u201d <em>Snowden, </em>385 Md. at 83, 867 A.2d at 325, then it is not testimonial and the Confrontation Clause does not bar its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Applying this test to the facts of this case, Mr. West testified that the conversation with Mr. Johnson and the Petitioner began because Mr. West and Mr. Johnson had known each other for approximately fifteen years. Mr. West was not acting as a law enforcement agent; rather, the interaction was a casual conversation between private acquaintances. Further, much like in <em>Smalls, </em>it is unlikely that Mr. Johnson would have made the statements to Mr. West if he believed the statements would be used in a later trial. Rather, the statements were \u201cmuch more akin to casual remarks to an acquaintance than formal declarations to an official.\u201d <em>Smalls, </em>605 F.3d at 780 (referencing <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354). In our view, Mr. Johnson did not intend to bear testimony against Cox, nor did he seek to establish \u201cfacts for use in a criminal investigation or prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Like the casual conversation between cell mates in <em>Dutton, </em>which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>the Supreme Court referred to as \u201cclearly nontestimonial\u201d in <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 825, 126 S.Ct. at 2275, 165 L.Ed.2d at 239, Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements were \u201cspontaneous, and it was against his penal interest to make [them].\u201d <em>Dutton, </em>400 U.S. at 89, 91 S.Ct. at 220, 27 L.Ed.2d at 227. Therefore, the casual statements between acquaintances were not made for the primary purpose of creating a substitute for trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">B. Fruit of the Poisonous Tree</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Petitioner argues that Mr. West\u2019s testimony should have been suppressed as the \u201cpoisonous fruit\u201d of the illegal search, because Petitioner and Mr. Johnson were only in jail, and thus in a position to make their admissions to Mr. West, because the police illegally detained them and searched their car. \u201c[T]he fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine excludes direct and indirect evidence that is a product of police conduct in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Myers v. State, </em>395 Md. 261, 291, 909 A.2d 1048, 1066 (2006). Though the phrase \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d and the attending doctrine date as far back as the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Nardone v. United States, </em>308 U.S. 338, 341, 60 S.Ct. 266, 268, 84 L.Ed. 307 (1939), we are generally guided by the Court\u2019s seminal decision in <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). In <em>Wong Sun, </em>the Court explained that, although evidence derived from illegal police activity is generally inadmissible, some derivative evidence can be introduced. In determining what evidence will be admissible, the question is \u201cwhether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come [sic] at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 488, 83 S.Ct. at 417, 9 L.Ed.2d at 455 (quoting MAGUIRE, EVIDENCE OF GUILT, 221 (1959)). The burden is on the defendant to show the evidence should be suppressed. Specifically,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">[a] defendant seeking shelter under the umbrella of the \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 doctrine has to prove each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>two propositions: 1) the primary illegality, to wit, that the tree was poisonous; and 2) the cause and effect relationship between the primary illegality and the evidence in issue, to wit, that the evidence was, indeed, the identifiable fruit of that particular tree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-5\"><em>Gibson v. </em>State, 138 Md.App. 399, 404, 771 A.2d 536, 539 (2001). The Court of Special Appeals has pointed out, however, that evidence is not excluded \u201cmerely because it would not have been discovered \u2018but for the illegal actions of the police.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cox, </em>194 Md.App. 629, 655, 5 A.3d 730, 745 (2010) (quoting <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 488, 83 S.Ct. at 417). Rather, there are three ways to \u201cpurge the taint\u201d of the illegality. <em>Miles v. State, </em>365 Md. 488, 520-21, 781 A.2d 787, 806 (2001). We explained the three methods in <em>Miles v. State:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">First, evidence obtained after initial unlawful governmental activity will be purged of its taint if it was inevitable that the police would have discovered the evidence. <em>See Nix v. Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 444, 104 S.Ct. 2501, 2509, 81 L.Ed.2d 377, 387 (1984). Second, the taint will be purged upon a showing that the evidence was derived from an independent source. <em>See United States v. Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 239-242, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1938-1940, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149, 1164-1166 (1967). The third exception ... will allow the use of evidence where it can be shown that the so-called poison of the unlawful governmental conduct is so attenuated from the evidence as to purge any taint resulting from said conduct. <em>See Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 488, 83 S.Ct. at 417, 9 L.Ed.2d at 455.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\"><em>Miles, </em>365 Md. at 520-21, 781 A.2d at 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">In the present case, the State relies on the third exception, the attenuation doctrine, to argue that Mr. West\u2019s testimony has been \u201cpurged\u201d of the \u201ctaint\u201d of the illegal search and arrest. We described the attenuation analysis in <em>Miles: </em>\u201c[A]n analysis of attenuation also requires consideration of the following factors: 1) the proximity between the actual illegality and the evidence sought to be suppressed; 2) the presence of intervening factors; and 3) the flagrancy of the governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>misconduct involved in the case.\u201d <em>Miles, </em>365 Md. at 522, 781 A.2d at 806 (citing <em>Brown v. Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 603-04, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 2261-62, 45 L.Ed.2d 416, 427 (1975)). We have also explained that the analysis involves a balancing test, and \u201cno single factor is dispositive on the issue of attenuation.\u201d <em>Cox v. State, </em>397 Md. 200, 219, 916 A.2d 311, 322 (2007) (citing <em>Ferguson v. State, </em>301 Md. 542, 553, 483 A.2d 1255, 1260 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The first factor to be considered under the <em>Miles </em>attenuation analysis is the \u201cproximity between the actual illegality and the evidence.\u201d There is no \u201cmathematically precise test\u201d to determine how much time must pass in order to purge the taint. <em>Miles, </em>365 Md. at 527, 781 A.2d at 810 (quoting <em>Ferguson, </em>301 Md. at 550, 483 A.2d at 1259). In <em>Brown, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a confession made two hours after an illegal arrest had not been purged of the taint of the primary illegality. <em>Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 604-05, 95 S.Ct. at 2262; <em>see also Taylor v. Alabama, </em>457 U.S. 687, 691, 102 S.Ct. 2664, 2667, 73 L.Ed.2d 314 (1982) (finding six hours insufficient to purge the primary taint); <em>Dunaway v. New York, </em>442 U.S. 200, 218-19, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 2259-60, 60 L.Ed.2d 824 (1979) (finding two hours insufficient). Further, in <em>Ferguson v. State, </em>we held that an identification made 20 minutes after an illegal arrest was insufficient as well. <em>Ferguson, </em>301 Md. at 550, 483 A.2d at 1259.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">In contrast, while the passage of minutes or hours may weigh against a finding of attenuation, other courts have found that a lapse of time approaching one day weighs in favor of a finding of attenuation. The State argues that, in the present case, sufficient time passed between the primary illegality and the evidence sought to be suppressed to purge the taint of the illegal action. For this proposition, the State cites <em>State v. Blackman, </em>246 Conn. 547, 716 A.2d 101, 106 (1998) (statements made 14 hours after stop \u201clacked temporal proximity to the allegedly illegal police action\u201d), <em>State v. Serrato, </em>424 So.2d 214, 218 (La.1982) (challenging a confession made 21 hours after illegal arrest was \u201cfairly distant\u201d), and <em>State v. Belton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>150 N.H. 741, 846 A.2d 526, 538 (2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1028, 125 S.Ct. 674, 160 L.Ed.2d 509 (2004) (noting the passage of 24 hours was a \u201csignificant period of time which reduces the possibility that the defendant\u2019s statements were the product of the illegal detention as opposed to his own free will\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In this case, Petitioner and Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements were made approximately 20 hours after Petitioner\u2019s illegal arrest. Although certainly not dispositive, we agree with the State and the Court of Special Appeals that this amount of time provides sufficient separation between the illegal activity and the challenged statements to weigh in favor of a finding of attenuation. We stress, however, that, \u201c[bjecause a lengthy detention can be used to exploit an illegal arrest at least as easily as a brief detention, the temporal proximity factor has been labeled \u2018ambiguous,\u2019 and \u2018relatively unimportant,\u2019 \u201d and therefore our attenuation analysis does not end here. <em>Ferguson v. State, </em>301 Md. at 550, 483 A.2d at 1259 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The second <em>Brown </em>factor is the presence of intervening circumstances. An intervening circumstance is any event that \u201cbreaks the causal connection between the unlawful conduct and the derivative evidence.\u201d <em>Myers, </em>395 Md. at 288, 909 A.2d at 1064 (quoting <em>Ferguson, </em>301 Md. at 551, 483 A.2d at 1259). When conducting this analysis, \u201cthe focus should more appropriately be on the accused to determine whether there was any event that contributed to his ability to consider carefully and objectively his options and to exercise his free will.\u201d <em>Ferguson, </em>301 Md. at 551, 483 A.2d at 1259 (citing <em>Taylor, </em>457 U.S. at 691, 102 S.Ct. at 2668, 73 L.Ed.2d at 320). Thus, we consider \u201cthe voluntariness of a person\u2019s actions ... as an intervening factor....\u201d <em>Miles, </em>365 Md. at 525, 781 A.2d at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Although neither this Court nor the Supreme Court have ruled on this particular set of facts, the State points out that other jurisdictions have held that the voluntariness of a statement made to another inmate while the defendant was illegally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>detained is sufficient to support a finding of attenuation. <em>See State v. Ostroski, </em>201 Conn. 534, 518 A.2d 915, 923 (1986) (holding that the inmate \u201cwas not an agent of the police\u201d and that, balancing all three <em>Brown </em>factors, the defendant\u2019s confession to a fellow inmate \u201cwas not the product of police exploitation of any prior illegality but was a totally unexpected voluntary admission by the defendant\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Houle, </em>620 F.2d 164, 165-66 (8th Cir.1980) (holding that statements the defendant made to his cellmates two hours after his illegal arrest were admissible because they \u201cwere not prompted by coercion or interrogation and were voluntarily made under [the defendant\u2019s] control\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In this case, Mr. West\u2019s testimony at the hearing suggests that he was unaware of the murder before Mr. Johnson made his statements, and that Mr. Johnson and Petitioner were not responding to questioning by Mr. West. In response to questions by Petitioner\u2019s counsel, Mr. West testified that \u201cwhen [Johnson] first told me about it I couldn\u2019t believe who had got, who had killed [sic].\u201d The fact that Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements, and Petitioner\u2019s acceptance thereof, were purely voluntary, unprompted by police interrogation or action, or any interrogation at all, is an intervening circumstance which weighs heavily in favor of allowing the evidence to be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The third and final <em>Brown </em>factor is the purposefulness of the police misconduct. This factor cuts to the heart of the purpose behind the exclusionary rule: to \u201cprovide[] an incentive for police to engage in lawful conduct.\u201d <em>Ferguson, </em>301 Md. at 552, 483 A.2d at 1260. As a result, police misconduct with \u201ca quality of purposefulness,\u201d <em>Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 605, 95 S.Ct. at 2262, will weigh in favor of exclusion of the resulting evidence. Petitioner argues that Mr. West\u2019s presence to hear the confession combined with Mr. West later reporting the confession to the police \u201cseem[ed] more than simply coincidental,\u201d and therefore created \u201ca reasonable inference that West was working as an informant for the police.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals held that \u201cthis claim is unpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>served.\u201d <em>Cox v. State, </em>194 Md.App. 629, 660 n. 16, 5 A.3d 730, 748 (2010).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Nevertheless, we .point out that the hearing court in this case specifically found as a fact that \u201cMichael West [was] not a law enforcement officer and that this was not a statement given in any way that could be characterized to a law enforcement [sic] since he\u2019s nothing but a citizen himself detained at the central booking facility.\u201d We are persuaded, however, by the reasoning of the court in <em>Ostroski, </em>518 A.2d at 923, where the Supreme Court of Connecticut determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqd\">the defendant\u2019s voluntary conduct in admitting the killing to his friend was not the product of police exploitation of any prior illegality but was a totally unexpected voluntary admission by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Neither the police conduct surrounding the illegal detention, search, and arrest, nor the circumstances which led to Petitioner and Mr. Johnson\u2019s admissions in the presence of Mr. West were flagrant or purposeful. Thus, all three factors in the attenuation analysis weigh in favor of admitting the evidence. There was significant time between the initial taint and when the statements were made, the voluntariness of Mr. Johnson\u2019s statements constituted an intervening factor, and there does not appear to be any indication that Mr. West was serving as an inserted informant. Therefore, we shall hold that the trial court did not err in denying Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">C. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">This Court reviews a question regarding the sufficiency of the evidence in a jury trial by asking \u201cwhether \u2018after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Allen v. State, </em>402 Md. 59, 71, 935 A.2d 421, 428 (2007) (quoting <em>Rivers v. State, </em>393 Md. 569, 580, 903 A.2d 908, 915 (2006)). We \u201cmust give deference to all reasonable inferences [that] the fact-finder draws, regardless of whether [the appellate court] would have chosen a different reasonable inference.\u201d <em>Bible v. State, </em>411 Md. 138, 156, 982 A.2d 348, 358 (2009) (quoting <em>State v. Suddith, </em>379 Md. 425, 430, 842 A.2d 716, 719 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">\u201c[I]t is, of course, well settled that an extrajudicial confession of guilt by a person accused of crime, unsupported by other evidence, is not sufficient to warrant a conviction.\u201d <em>Woods v. State, </em>315 Md. 591, 615, 556 A.2d 236, 248 (1989) (quoting <em>Bradbury v. State, </em>233 Md. 421, 424, 197 A.2d 126 (1964)). Rather, \u201cthe extrajudicial confession must be supported by evidence, independent of the confession, which relates to and tends to establish the <em>corpus delicti, i.e., </em>the facts that are necessary to show that a crime has been committed.\u201d <em>Woods, </em>315 Md. at 615-16, 556 A.2d at 248 (quoting <em>Bradbury, </em>233 Md. at 424, 197 A.2d at 126). But \u201cit is not necessary that the evidence independent of the confession be full and complete or that it establish the truth of the <em>corpus delicti </em>beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance of proof.\u201d <em>Woods, </em>315 Md. at 616, 556 A.2d at 248 (quoting <em>Cooper v. State, </em>220 Md. 183, 190, 152 A.2d 120 (1959)). Rather, \u201c[t]he supporting evidence ... \u2018may be small in amount\u2019 and is sufficient to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>\u2018if, when considered in connection with the confession or admission, it satisfies the trier of facts beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense charged was committed and that the accused committed it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller v. State, </em>380 Md. 1, 46, 843 A.2d 803, 829 (2004) (quoting <em>Bradbury, </em>233 Md. at 424-25, 197 A.2d at 128; <em>Woods, </em>315 Md. at 616, 556 A.2d at 248).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In a murder case, \u201c \u2018the proof of the <em>corpus delicti </em>is sufficient if it establishes the fact that the person for whose death the prosecution was instituted is dead, and that the death occurred under circumstances which indicate that it was caused criminally by someone.\u2019 \u201d Woods, 315 Md. at 617, 556 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>A.2d at 249 (citing <em>Jones v. State, </em>188 Md. 263, 272, 52 A.2d 484 (1947)). Petitioner does not dispute these standards, but argues that \u201c[o]ther than Michael West\u2019s testimony, there was nothing to establish the Petitioner\u2019s participation in the crimes charged.\u201d As we held in <em>Ballard, </em>however, the <em>corpus delecti </em>need not connect the defendant to the act. <em>Ballard v. State, </em>333 Md. 567, 578, 636 A.2d 474 (1994) (explaining that when the charged crime is homicide, \u201cthe <em>corpus delecti </em>consists of proof that the victim died and that the death was caused by a criminal act, but it need not tend to connect the defendant on trial with that act\u201d). Further, in Woods, we found that the defendant\u2019s statements confessing to the murder of Michael Boyd were sufficiently corroborated by a medical examiner\u2019s testimony that the victim was dead and that the cause of death was gunshot wounds. We explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">The gunshot wounds were enough to show that the manner of death was homicide\u2014that Boyd\u2019s death was not by accident or suicide but was caused criminally by someone. With this corroboration the confession was enough to meet the test for the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction of murder in the first degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Woods, 315 Md. at 617, 556 A.2d at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">In the present case, Dr. Vincenti, an assistant medical examiner, testified that she performed an autopsy on the body of Todd Dargan, that Mr. Dargan was dead, and that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head. Although this is sufficient corroboration to support Petitioner\u2019s conviction for murder, the State, however, provided additional direct corroboration of Mr. West\u2019s testimony. Both Officer Keitz and Detective McDermott testified to finding a bullet casing at the scene of the murder and Natalie Hoban, the crime lab technician, testified that it came from a nine-millimeter round. This corroborated Mr. West\u2019s testimony that Petitioner and Mr. Johnson told him that Petitioner had given Mr. Johnson a \u201cnine\u201d to use in the murder. Additionally, Detective Phyall testified about conducting a traffic stop of Petitioner\u2019s vehicle, putting Petitioner and Mr. Johnson within 12 blocks of the scene of the murder, within an hour of its occurrence. Detec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>tive Phyall also testified that Mr. Johnson was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and that he \u201cwas shaking uncontrollably.\u201d This again corroborated Mr. West\u2019s testimony that Mr. Johnson told Mr. West that he was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and that Petitioner said that the police, when conducting the traffic stop, noticed that Mr. Johnson was nervous. This additional corroboration, combined with Mr. West\u2019s and Dr. Vincenti\u2019s testimony, was sufficient to support all of Petitioner\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS IS AFFIRMED. PETITIONER TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-10\">. The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b667-6\">. The court ruled, without objection from the State, that any testimony about the victim\u2019s involvement in another murder was to be suppressed as hearsay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b668-6\">. Md. Rule 5-803 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Rule 5-803. Hearsay exceptions: Unavailability of declarant not required</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-9\">(a) Statement by parly-opponent. A statement that is offered against a party and is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-11\">(2) A statement of which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\">. Affirming the Circuit Court, the Court of Special Appeals held that the statements were \u201cadmitted as a tacit admission ... that the defendant has adopted as his or her own.\u201d <em>Cox v. State, </em>194 Md.App. at 652, 5 A.3d at 743. Ultimately, we conclude that the admission of Mr. Johnson's statements satisfies the Confrontation Clause. Because Petitioner does not challenge the admissibility of Mr. Johnson's statements on the grounds that they were not properly classified as tacit admissions, we need not, and do not, evaluate the statements under relevant hearsay considerations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\">. In his petition for writ of certiorari filed in this case, Petitioner does not challenge the intermediate appellate court\u2019s holding with respect to preservation. Therefore, the question is not properly before this Court. <em>See Gonzales </em>v. <em>State, </em>322 Md. 62, 69, 585 A.2d 222, 226 (1991) (noting that an issue not in the petition for writ of certiorari or in an order granting the writ is \"not before us, and we need not address it\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
