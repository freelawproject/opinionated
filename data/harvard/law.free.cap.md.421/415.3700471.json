On March 4, 2010, this Court ordered that the charges against Respondent \u201cbe heard and determined by Judge Dennis M. Sweeney, of the Fifth Judicial Circuit [the Hearing Judge], in accordance with Maryland Rule 16-757[.]\u201d The Hearing Judge filed \u201cFINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\u201d in which he concluded that Respondent \u201cviolated Rules 1.15(a) and 8.4(d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct [ (MRPC) ], [Maryland] Rule 16-604, Md. Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof.Code Ann., Sec. 10-304 and 10-306.\u201d Petitioner (in the words of the EXCEPTIONS it filed in this Court) \u201ctakes exceptions to the failure of the trial court to find that respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(c) and Maryland Rule 16-609[.]\u201d For the reasons that follow, we shall overrule Petitioner\u2019s exceptions, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>impose a thirty day suspension for the violations that were proven by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The Hearing Judge\u2019s FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW included the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">22. On November 12, 2007, the date that Jill Lee retained Mr. Tauber to represent her in the divorce, she through her father paid respondent $8,500.00 as a retainer against which Mr. Tauber was to bill $245.00 per hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">23. On that date, Mr. Tauber did not have a trust account for the purpose of receiving such funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">24. Mr. Tauber deposited the funds into his operating account and thereafter drew against the funds after he deposited them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">25. Mr. Tauber prepared the divorce action and filed it on June 17, 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">26. On June 20, 2008, Ms. Lee, again through her parents, paid Mr. Tauber an additional $2,500.00 against which he was to bill at $245.00 per hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-11\">27. Mr. Tauber also deposited these funds into an operating account and drew on them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-12\">28. Sometime at the end of June 2008, Mr. Tauber prepared a bill for Ms. Lee and sent it to her. The bill indicated that he had worked 19.4 hours on her case, earning a total of $4,753.00. The bill also showed that Mr. Tauber had paid a filing fee of $115.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-13\">29. On July 29, 2009, after becoming dissatisfied with Mr. Tauber\u2019s representation and after filing a complaint about Mr. Tauber -with the Commission, Ms. Lee sent Mr. Tauber a letter dismissing him as her attorney and requesting the return of the unused retainer which she calculated as $1,247.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>30. On September 11, 2009, Mr. Tauber refunded Ms. Lee the $1,247.00 balance of the retainer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\">34. Mr. Tauber admitted that Bar Counsel \u201cwas correct in terms of the non-deposit into the trust account.\u201d ... but explained \u201cbecause whether it\u2019s ignorance on my part or basically my practice prior to the incident was not knowing the need for that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">35. Mr. Tauber stated that he \u201cdid have some difficulty I guess in terms of the trust account, and I\u2019ve readily admitted that. I\u2019ve readily admitted that to Mr. Hirschman, and part of it was based, Your Honor, in terms of what sort of law I engaged in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">36. Mr. Tauber explained that his usual legal work doing insurance defense work, work for the Office of the Public Defender and in Child in Need of Assistance matters meant that he never was paid money \u201cup front\u201d and that he always billed after the fees were earned and was paid after the billing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">37. Afer Mr. Tauber had a discussion with Mr. Hirschman about the need for such an account[,] he set one up, but has not utilized it since he has \u201cgiven up practicing law and have [sic] moved to the state of Delaware.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">\n<em>Conclusions of Law</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">By placing the retainer fees in his operating account rather than a trust account and drawing on the funds prior to earning them, the clear and convincing evidence establishes that Mr. Tauber violated Rules 1.15(a) and 8.4(d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 16-604, and Md. Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof.Code Ann., Sec. 10-304 and 10-306.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">It is undisputed that Mr. Tauber deposited the initial advance fee payment of $3,500.00 in his operating account after he received it on November 12, 2007. The reason he deposited it in his operating account was that he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>have a trust account at the time and he apparently was not aware of the need to deposit the funds in a trust account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\">In the Commission\u2019s Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, it asserts that the conduct here is \u201cdishonest conduct\u201d under 8.4(c).... In the context of this case, however, the court does not conclude that Mr. Tauber was engaged in conduct that was \u201cdishonest\u201d conduct as 8.4(c) specifies. It is clear that Mr. Tauber was wrong not to have placed the funds in an escrow account and that he should have known of the need to do so. Mr. Tauber had admitted that he did not handle the funds as they should have been handled and as the court reads his testimony and filings with the court he has conceded his error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">However, the court cannot conclude by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Tauber acted with the intent to be \u201cdishonest\u201d as is alleged by the Commission. The court concludes that at the times he received the funds, he believed that he was handling the funds received in an appropriate [manner] and that his failure to place the funds in a trust account was not done with any intent to be dishonest in his dealings \"with Ms. Lee, the client in the case. There is no indication in this record that Mr. Tauber had any intent to be dishonest or fraudulent in his dealings with Ms. Lee or her parents or that he engaged in deceit or misrepresentation. The court therefore does not conclude by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Tauber has violated 8.4(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">On the other hand, the court does find by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Tauber has engaged in conduct that is \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d by failing to know about and have in place a system that would protect his client\u2019s funds until they could either be earned or returned to the client. It was incumbent upon him as a lawyer to know the proper procedures to follow in dealing with new clients and his failure to know the requirements for properly handling client\u2019s funds entrusted to him as a retainer does not excuse him from a finding that his actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>or omissions were prejudicial to the administration of justice. The court therefore concludes by clear and convincing evidence that he violated 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\">Other than the violations found above, the court cannot conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence of any other violation of the provisions cited in the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action filed in the action before the Court of Appeals. As noted above, the Commission has abandoned all allegations except those pertaining to the handling of the funds Mr. Tauber received.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">I. Petitioner\u2019s MRPC 8.4(c) Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The mishandling of a retainer fee may or may not constitute \u201cdishonest\u201d conduct proscribed by MRPC 8.4(c). While it is obvious that MRPC 8.4(c) is violated when a lawyer deliberately places into the lawyer\u2019s operating account funds that the lawyer has a duty to place into an escrow account, that rule is not violated when a lawyer <em>mistakenly </em>places into the operating account funds that should have been placed into an escrow account. In the case at bar, Respondent testified that (1) he placed the retainer into his operating account out of the mistaken belief that he was entitled to do so, and (2) opened an escrow account as soon as he realized that he was required to have an escrow account. The Hearing Judge was entitled to accept Respondent\u2019s explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ugwuonye, </em>405 Md. 351, 952 A.2d 226 (2008), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">\u201cThis Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings\u201d in Maryland. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Adams, </em>349 Md. 86, 93, 706 A.2d 1080, 1083 (1998). Even though conducting an independent review of the record, we accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless they are found to be clearly erroneous. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zdravkovich, </em>375 Md. 110, 126, 825 A.2d 418, 427 (2003). This Court gives deference to the hearing judge\u2019s assessment of the credibility of wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>nesses. <em>Id. </em>Factual findings by the hearing judge [that the Commission has satisfied its burden of persuasion] will not be interfered with if they are founded on clear and convincing evidence. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Monfried, </em>368 Md. 373, 388, 794 A.2d 92, 100 (2002). All proposed conclusions of law made by the hearing judge, however, are subject to <em>de novo </em>review by this Court. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. O\u2019Toole, </em>379 Md. 595, 604, 843 A.2d 50, 55 (2004).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 368, 952 A.2d at 235-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Walter, </em>407 Md. 670, 967 A.2d 783 (2009), while overruling the petitioner\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that the respondent had not violated MRPC 8.4, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">Although the Commission\u2019s evidence was sufficient as a matter of law to generate the issue of whether Respondent had violated Rule 8.4, in its assessment of the credibility of witnesses, the hearing judge was entitled to accept\u2014or <em>reject\u2014all, part, </em>or <em>none </em>of the testimony of any witness, including testimony that was not contradicted by any other witness. In making the finding of fact \u201cthat Respondent did not intend to cheat or deceive either his client or his firm,\u201d the hearing judge was entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the facts that the judge found to be true. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">There is nothing mysterious about the use of inferences in the fact-finding process. Jurors routinely apply their common sense, powers of logic, and accumulated experiences in life to arrive at conclusions from demonstrated sets of facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\"><em>Robinson v. State, </em>315 Md. 309, 318, 554 A.2d 395, 399 (1989). Hearing judges do the very same thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">The hearing judge\u2019s finding \u201cthat Respondent did not intend to cheat or deceive either his client or his firm\u201d was not erroneous\u2014clearly or otherwise\u2014merely because she did not find it appropriate to draw one or more \u201cpermissible inferences which might have been drawn from the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>by another trier of the facts.\u201d <em>Hous. Opportunities Comm\u2019n of Montgomery County v. Lacey, </em>322 Md. 56, 61, 585 A.2d 219, 222 (1991).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 678-79, 967 A.2d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">As was the situation in <em>Walter, </em>the Petitioner\u2019s evidence in the case at bar was sufficient to generate the issue of whether Respondent\u2019s handling of the retainer fee constituted \u201cdishonest\u201d conduct under MRPC 8.4(c). The Hearing Judge, however, found \u201cno indication ... that [Respondent] had any intent to be dishonest or fraudulent in his dealings with Ms. Lee or her parents or that he engaged in deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d This Court shall give deference to that finding, which is based upon the Hearing Judge\u2019s assessment of Respondent\u2019s credibility, and shall therefore overrule Petitioner\u2019s exception to the Hearing Judge\u2019s failure to find that Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">II. Petitioner\u2019s Md. Rule 16-609 Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Maryland Rule 16-609(a), in pertinent part, provides that \u201c[a]n attorney ... may not ... use any funds [required by the Maryland Rules to be deposited in an attorney trust account] for any unauthorized purpose.\u201d This rule is not violated whenever an attorney deposits into an operating account funds that are required by Md. Rule 16-604 to be deposited in an attorney trust account.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is clear that Respondent (1) deposited into his operating account the funds paid to him on behalf of Ms. Lee, and thereafter (2) \u201cdrew against\u201d funds in that account. Petitioner, however, did not produce evidence that any of the funds that Respondent \u201cdrew against\u201d necessarily included the funds paid on behalf of Ms Lee. Under these circumstances, no reasonable trier of fact could find by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent actually made any unauthorized use of the funds paid on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>behalf of Ms. Lee. We shall therefore overrule Petitioner\u2019s exception to the Hearing Judge\u2019s failure to find that Respondent violated Md. Rule 16-609.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">III. Respondent\u2019s Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Although the cases in which this Court has imposed sanctions on attorneys who have committed misconduct are perhaps not yet \u201cas numerous as the sands of the sea,\u201d there are three reasons why many of those cases cannot be easily reconciled.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, as this Court has repeatedly stated, \u201ceach attorney grievance case rests on its own merits.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Garcia, </em>410 Md. 507, 529, 979 A.2d 146, 159 (2009). Second, \u201cthe purpose of attorney disciplinary proceedings is not to punish the erring attorney, only to protect the clients whom attorneys serve.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Elmendorf, </em>404 Md. 353, 363, 946 A.2d 542, 548 (2008). Third, as this Court stated in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Taylor, </em>405 Md. 697, 955 A.2d 755 (2008):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">The public is best protected when sanctions are imposed commensurate with the nature and the gravity of the misconduct and the intent with which it was committed. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. 209, 223, 892 A.2d 533, 541 (2006).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">The severity of the sanction depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case, taking account of any particular aggravating or mitigating factors. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm. v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 484, 671 A.2d 463, 480 (1996). In determining the appropriate sanction, we have often looked to the American Bar Association\u2019s <em>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, </em>reprinted in LAWYERS\u2019 MANUAL ON <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT (2003) <em>(ABA Standards). Id. </em>at 488, 671 A.2d at 483. These standards create an organizational framework that calls for a consideration of four questions: (1) What is the nature of the ethical duty violated?; (2) What was the lawyer\u2019s mental state?; (3) What was the extent of the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct?; and (4) Are there any aggravating or mitigating circumstances? <em>See ABA Standards, </em>Standard 3.0, at 17. Also relevant are the following [\u201cmitigating\u201d] factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">\u201cAbsence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 488-89, 671 A.2d at 483 (quoting ABA Standards, Standard 9.32, at 41-42).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 720-21, 955 A.2d at 768-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">As to what constitutes an \u201caggravating factor,\u201d in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bleecker, </em>414 Md. 147, 994 A.2d 928 (2010), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">In determining the appropriate sanction, we often look to the aggravating factors found in Standard 9.22 of the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions. These include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">(a) prior disciplinary offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">(b) dishonest or selfish motive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-11\">(c) a pattern of misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-12\">(d) multiple offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-13\">(e) bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>(f) submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\">(g) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">(h) vulnerability of victim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">(i) substantial experience in the practice of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">(j) indifference to making restitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 176-77, 994 A.2d at 945-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">The question of whether a lawyer\u2019s misconduct was intentional or negligent is obviously of significant consequence to the issue of what the appropriate sanction should be. In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 697 A.2d 446 (1997), while determining the appropriate sanction for the \u201crespondent\u2019s total ineptness concerning the handling of the business aspects of his practice,\u201d this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">To be sure, every lawyer is deemed to know the Rules of Professional Conduct, and is charged with the knowledge that along with the duty to maintain adequate records, an attorney must maintain a separate trust account with a title that includes the name of the attorney or law firm and that clearly designates the account as \u201cAttorney Trust Account\u201d or the equivalent. Rule BU6. Claimed ignorance of ethical duties and bookkeeping requirements is not a defense in disciplinary proceedings. Although ignorance does not excuse a violation of disciplinary rules, a finding with respect to the intent with which a violation was committed is relevant on the issue of the appropriate sanction. This is consistent with the purpose of a disciplinary proceeding: to protect the public, as well as to promote general and specific deterrence. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sliffman, </em>330 Md. 515, 529, 625 A.2d 314, 321 (1993); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Berger, </em>326 Md. 129, 131, 604 A.2d 58 (1992) <em>(citing Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v.

Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 773 A.2d 463 (2001), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Unlike matters relating to competency, diligence and the like, intentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse. Honesty and dishonesty are, or are not, present in an attorney\u2019s character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">Disbarment ordinarily should be the sanction for intentional dishonest conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">The mere fact that an attorney steals or commits other serious criminal conduct, coupled only with evidence of mental impairment, whether arising out of alcoholism or out of other factors, that does not arise to the level of [\u201ca serious and debilitating mental condition ... that ... in a sustained fashion, affected the ability of the attorney in normal day to day activities, such that the attorney was unable to accomplish the least of those activities in a normal fashion\u201d], generally will not be sufficient to establish that degree of mental incompetency that warrants a lesser sanction than the sanction that is otherwise appropriate for such misconduct involving stealing, intentional misappropriation of the funds of another, and the like, or other serious criminal conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 418-19, 773 A.2d at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

We must also consider the following mitigating factors: (1) absence of a prior disciplinary record; (2) absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; (3) timely good faith efforts to rectify consequences of misconduct; (4) full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; (5) inexperience in the practice of law; and (6) remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>In \u201cunintentional misappropriation\u201d cases, this Court has imposed indefinite suspensions, \u201cwith the right to reapply\u201d after a period of time. In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. 341, 872 A.2d 693 (2005), that period of time was thirty days. <em>Id. </em>at 379, 872 A.2d at 716.

As the case at bar does not involve misappropriation, we conclude that an indefinite suspension\u2014 even with the right to reapply within a short period of time\u2014 is too harsh a sanction. We also conclude, however, that a reprimand would be an inadequate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The public will be protected by the imposition of a sanction that emphasizes the importance of <em>strict compliance </em>with the statutes and the Rules of Professional Conduct that pertain to the handling of client funds.

The judge also concluded that Tauber engaged in conduct that is \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d\u2014that is, \u201cfail[ed] to know about and have in place a system that would protect his client\u2019s funds\u201d\u2014and thus violated MRPC 8.4(d). Nonetheless, the hearing judge did not conclude that Tauber acted with dishonest or fraudulent intent. Perhaps Tauber \u201cwas not aware of the need to deposit [client] funds in a trust account\u201d and \u201cbelieved that he was handling the funds ... in an appropriate [manner],\u201d as the hearing judge concluded. Regardless, he conducted his law practice in disregard of the MRPC, the Maryland Rules, and the Maryland Code. These behavioral standards are designed to protect the public and the decency of the legal profession. <em>See Awuah, </em>346 Md. at 435, 697 A.2d at 454. Such haphazard treatment of client funds should not (and is not usually) taken lightly, as our jurisprudence demonstrates. In view of the precedential and factually-similar body of law cited <em>swpra, </em>I would impose the more fitting and consistent sanction of indefinite suspension, with the right to apply for reinstatement no sooner than ninety days after the effective date of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Judge BATTAGLIA authorizes me to state that she joins the views expressed here.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-9\">. The AGC takes exception to the hearing judge\u2019s failure to conclude that there was a violation of Maryland Rule 16-609, which states that \"[a]n attorney ... may not ... use any funds for any unauthorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>purpose.\" To sustain the exception, we would need to conclude that Tauber not only deposited client funds into his operating account, but then used those client funds for some unauthorized purpose. In this case, there appears to be scant evidence\u2014i.e., checks, bank statements, and the like\u2014demonstrating clearly that Tauber (1) used actually client funds, as opposed to already existing funds to which he was entitled, in his operating account (2) for an unauthorized purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\">.

A misappropriation necessarily occurs whenever the attorney withdraws funds from a co-mingled account for his or her own purpose and, as a result, leaves the account insufficient to cover all client funds, and such a misappropriation is never innocent.

In those cases explained <em>supra, </em>where the Court determined that a \"misappropriation\u201d occurred, neither we nor the hearing judges went so far as to find related violations of MRPC 8.4(c), which would implicate a more deliberate and reprehensible intent.
