The employee, Tyrone Lawson, was a seventeen-year veteran of the Bowie State University Police Department (\u201cthe Department\u201d) until his termination for violating the Department\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>chain of command policy. Specifically, Lawson had drafted a letter disclosing potential abuses by his fellow officers and, feeling unable to report these violations to the Department\u2019s Chief of Police, he presented the letter to the school\u2019s Vice President of Student Affairs. The Vice President notified the Department Chief of the contents of Lawson\u2019s letter, leading the Department Chief to fire Lawson for, among other things, insubordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Following his termination, Lawson sought relief through the administrative channels, arguing that he was entitled to whistleblower protection because the letter constituted a \u201cprotected disclosure\u201d as contemplated by Section 5-305 of the Maryland State Personnel and Pensions Article. An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) considered the matter, and concluded that Lawson\u2019s letter was not a \u201cprotected disclosure\u201d because it was drafted as part of Lawson\u2019s personal \u201ccrusade\u201d to improve the Department, rather than for the purpose of notifying a higher authority of a potential violation. The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision, and Lawson appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Before argument in that Court, however, we issued a writ of certiorari to determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">Whether the ALJ erred in failing to find that [Lawson] made a protected disclosure under State Personnel and Pensions Section 5-305[.]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We shall hold that the ALJ improperly conflated Lawson\u2019s personal motivation for disclosure with the statutory requirement that an employee have a reasonable belief that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>information disclosed evidences a violation. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court affirming the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"A7T\">A. The Alleged Abuse of Power</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">In February 2007, following concerns about a \u201clack of leadership\u201d within the Bowie State University (\u201cthe University\u201d) Police Department, Dr. Artie Travis, the University\u2019s Vice President of Student and Academic Affairs, offered to meet individually with University police officers to give them an opportunity to discuss the Department\u2019s strengths and weaknesses \u201coutside of the chain of command.\u201d Travis informed Department officers that he would not discuss the content of the individual meetings with the Department Chief \u201cunless there [was] something that [was] very clear\u201d that needed to be brought to the Chiefs attention. Dr. Travis assured the officers that the meetings were not in violation of the \u201cchain of command\u201d rules of the Department\u2019s Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">After receiving Dr. Travis\u2019s general invitation, Lawson attempted to set up a meeting to discuss his concerns about the Department. At first, Travis\u2019 secretary had difficulty accommodating Lawson\u2019s request \u201cto be one of the last [officers] to ... have a discussion with Dr. Travis.\u201d Later, Lawson spoke to Travis informally at a basketball game around February 25, 2008 and arranged to meet with him on March 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">. Two days after the basketball game, but still before Lawson and Dr. Travis\u2019s scheduled meeting, Lawson learned of an arrest conducted by Department officers Corporal Marc Ducellier and Sergeant David Blue, where the officers took into custody a non-student during their foot patrol earlier in the day. Lawson was first alerted to the arrest when Police Department Chief Ernest Waiters sent out a Department-wide e-mail congratulating the officers. Waiters\u2019 e-mail explained that Ducellier and Blue had been on a \u201cproactive foot patrol[ ]\u201d of Christa McAuliffe Residence (\u201cCMRC\u201d), a University residence hall, when they found the suspect in a dormitory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>room with glass vials stored with marijuana and \u201cmoney packaged in a manner [indicating] \u2018Possession With Intent to Distribute.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">According to Lawson, he became concerned about the propriety of the arrest during a later discussion with Ducellier and Blue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lawson claimed that Ducellier told him that the officers had actually been doing an inspection of CMRC, and were \u201cturning the door knobs to our resident student rooms and pushing on the doors to see if the doors were unlocked or slightly ajar ... [and then] walking] uninvited inside[.]\u201d Lawson alleged that Ducellier and Blue laughed and joked about waking up residents, and about how \u201csome of the female residents came out of their bedrooms and into the living room half dress[ed] and partially nude.\u201d Lawson claims that Ducellier explained to him that they had found the suspect in Suite 405 of CMRC after the door \u201cjust came fully open\u201d in response to his knock, and that they smelled marijuana only after they entered the room. Following his conversation with the officers, Lawson conducted his own independent investigation of CMRC, and he discovered that the doors automatically shut on their own when residents left their rooms, such that it would be impossible for a door to be left ajar or to be opened by the force of a knock.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Lawson also spoke with two other officers, Corporal Mike Milburn and Sergeant Anina Brown, about the arrest. According to Milburn and Brown, at the end of their shift on the morning of the arrest, they encountered Ducellier and Blue in a parking lot with a prisoner in their vehicle. Both would later testify that Ducellier and Blue did not respond when asked about what prompted the arrest, but sarcastically told them that, \u201cthe guy was arrested for standing around and acting stupid.\u201d Milburn testified that he was surprised when he saw the prisoner, since normal procedure is to alert the Department dispatcher when an arrest has been made and Milburn had not heard of the arrest \u201cover the air[.]\u201d Like<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>wise, Brown testified that officers would usually send out a request call for help before making an arrest at CMRC because of the building\u2019s size and history of violent incidents. Brown alleged that she was annoyed by Blue\u2019s sarcasm in the parking lot, and when she approached him about it later, he apologized and \u201csaid that he just didn\u2019t want to say anything in front of [Milburn] because [Ducellier\u2019s probable cause related to the CMRC arrest] was weak.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">B. Lawson\u2019s Letter to Dr. Travis</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">After speaking with Milburn and Brown and investigating the doors into CMRC himself, Lawson wrote a letter to Travis with the subject line \u201cRe: Alleged University Police Corruption and Misconduct.\u201d The letter detailed Lawson\u2019s concerns about the arrest, namely that Blue and Ducellier had apparently made the arrest after entering the room without probable cause. Lawson expressed his belief that the arrest had violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as Department policy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (E.21, 23) Lawson also alleged that Waiters and his deputy, Lieutenant Djakarta Hall, had been delinquent in failing to investigate the arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0k\">Both [Waiters and Hall] had a duty and responsibility to recognized [sic] and identify that the fact [sic] and circumstances of the incident obviously indicates that both [Blue and Ducellier] were violating our resident student\u2019s Fourth Amendment Rights guaranteed under the United States Constitution Bill of Rights when they entered our resident student\u2019s rooms, uninvited, without consent, without a warrant and without any exigent circumstances. [Blue and Ducellier] repeatedly did this to many resident students prior to the both of them approaching and entering Room 405 and making the arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Lawson showed the letter to Milburn, who advised him to send the letter to Travis rather than Waiters because Waiters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>had already praised the arrest. Lawson also sought the advice of Dorothy Holland, the University\u2019s Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and Judicial Coordinator. Holland testified that, during their meeting, Lawson became significantly upset when he began talking about the letter and his concerns about the Department:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">[WJhen he first started talking ... it was obvious that he was upset, he was concerned, he was angry. And at one point during the meeting he actually got upset, emotional.... I\u2019ve known Lawson for a long time and I\u2019ve never seen him get emotional that way....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Holland then told Lawson, \u201c[I]f you don\u2019t trust the Chief of Police, you need to be having this conversation with Dr. Travis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Lawson followed the advice of Milburn and Holland and delivered a copy of the letter in person to Travis on March 5, 2007. Lawson also attached a cover page in which he requested that Travis keep the letter and its contents confidential until he had an opportunity \u201cto present suggested strategies for handling this situation to [University President Mickey Burnim] and [Travis].... I believe I have some good suggestions that are effective, proper and right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Upon receiving the letter, Travis called Lawson to tell him that he would have to notify Waiters because the letter \u201cwas outside the chain of command.\u201d After discussing the letter with Waiters, Travis assigned Glen Isaac, the University\u2019s Labor Relations Manager, to investigate Lawson\u2019s allegations. Following his investigation, Isaac concluded that Ducellier and Blue had properly conducted the arrest; thus, Lawson\u2019s Fourth Amendment concerns were unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">C. The University\u2019s Discipline of Lawson</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">On March 13, 2007, the Department suspended Lawson on an emergency basis for (1) violating the Department\u2019s chain-of-command policy by submitting the letter to Travis and, (2) unrelated to the letter, his suspected involvement in the theft of University computers. Waiters conducted a suspension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>hearing on March 15 and delivered a Notification of Charges to Lawson on May 16. With regard to Lawson\u2019s letter, the Department accused Lawson of violating seven different Department regulations. The Department also announced other unrelated charges against Lawson, none of which pertained to the alleged computer theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The Department\u2019s Administrative Hearing Board conducted a hearing regarding the charges. In its decision issued on January 18, 2008, the Hearing Board sustained four of the charges related to the letter, as well as a charge of \u201cUnbecoming Conduct\u201d concerning an unrelated incident. The Board\u2019s recommendation of Lawson\u2019s penalty for the letter included suspension without pay, demotion in rank, and a written reprimand. The Board also recommended a written reprimand and loss of two leave days for the unrelated \u201cUnbecoming Conduct\u201d charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">On January 25, 2008, Waiters informed Lawson that he intended to increase the Board\u2019s recommended penalty and that he was giving Lawson the opportunity to respond in a hearing conducted by Waiters. Waiters wrote that his decision to increase the penalty was supported by his review of Lawson\u2019s past job performance, the Hearing Board\u2019s administrative record, and the investigation. Attached to this notification was a list of sixteen additional charges of misconduct, none of which had ever been brought to the attention of Lawson or the Hearing Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Three days after meeting with Lawson regarding the penalty increase, Waiters terminated Lawson\u2019s employment with the Department. Waiters wrote in his termination letter to Lawson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">Our meeting on February 11, 2008 was your opportunity to explain why these serious charges should not result in your termination.... [You did not] express any understanding or willingness to accept the chain of command in the police department.... Based on your inability to understand the seriousness of your refusal to follow the chain of command, and your statements that confirm you are unwilling to follow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the chain of command, you have made it clear that you truly believe you are not accountable to the police command structure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">D. Lawson\u2019s Whistleblower Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">On September 4, 2007, Lawson sought relief from Waiters\u2019s decision to terminate his employment by filing a Whistleblower Complaint against the University Police Department with the Maryland Department of Budget and Management (\u201cDBM\u201d) pursuant to Section 5-301 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Personnel and Pensions Article (\u201cSPP\u201d) of the Maryland Annotated Code. Md.Code (1993, 2004 Repl.Vol.) (the \u201cWhistleblower Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">On January 8, 2008, the Office of Statewide Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinator (\u201cOSEEOC\u201d) denied the complaint, and Lawson appealed to the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d). Following a hearing, the OAH Administrative Law Judge affirmed the OSEEOC\u2019s denial on July 11, 2008. The ALJ ruled that Lawson\u2019s letter to Travis was not a protected disclosure because Lawson did not reasonably believe that the disclosed information contained \u201cevidence of abuse of authority, gross mismanagement, gross waste of money, a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or a violation of law[.]\u201d The ALJ found that Lawson not to be credible because his statements were motivated by a \u201ccrusade to make changes to the department himself.\u201d The ALJ dismissed Lawson\u2019s concerns related to the arrest on the grounds that \u201c[Ducellier and Blue] credibly testified as to the events of that night, and [Waiters], a man with substantial experience in narcotics cases, also credibly testified that he felt nothing untoward went on that night.\u201d The ALJ did not reach the issue of whether the Department would have terminated Lawson notwithstanding the disclosure because he had already dismissed Lawson\u2019s complaint on the grounds that the letter was not a protected disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Lawson appealed to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, which affirmed the OAH decision. Lawson then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>sought review by the Court of Special Appeals, and this Court issued a writ of certiorari <em>sua sponte </em>before a decision by the intermediate appellate court. 417 Md. 500, 10 A.3d 1180 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AqyT\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Lawson asks only one question on appeal: Did the ALJ err in finding that Lawson did not make a protected disclosure under Maryland\u2019s Whistleblower Act? On review, we look \u201cthrough the circuit court\u2019s ... decision[ ], although applying the same standard of review, and evaluate[] the decision of the agency.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v. Loyola College in Md., </em>406 Md. 54, 66, 956 A.2d 166, 173 (2008) (citations omitted). Our role is thus \u201climited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the [ALJ\u2019s] findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Board of Physician Quality Assur. v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67-68, 729 A.2d 376, 380 (1999). In applying the substantial evidence test to the ALJ\u2019s factual findings, we ask \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 729 A.2d at 380. We treat the ALJ\u2019s decision as prima facie correct and presumed valid, as \u201cit is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence and to draw inferences from that evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 729 A.2d at 381 (citations omitted). With respect to an ALJ\u2019s conclusions of law, however, \u201cwe have often stated that a court reviews <em>de novo </em>for correctness.... [I]t is always within our prerogative to determine whether an agency\u2019s conclusions of law are correct, and to remedy them if wrong.\u201d <em>Schwartz v. Maryland Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>385 Md. 534, 554, 870 A.2d 168, 180 (2005) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Maryland\u2019s Whistleblower Act, contained in Sections 5-301 through 5-313 of the State Personnel and Pensions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Article, prohibits reprisal against a State employee for making a protected disclosure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> SPP Section 5-305 defines a protected disclosure as \u201cinformation that the employee reasonably believes evidences: (i) an abuse of authority, gross mismanagement, or gross waste of money; (ii) a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety; or (iii) a violation of law....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, the protected disclosure must \u201cevidence an intent to raise an issue with a higher authority who is in a position to correct the alleged wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources v. Heller, </em>391 Md. 148, 170, 892 A.2d 497, 510 (2006) (citations omitted). The employee must also show a causal connection between the disclosure and the adverse personnel action. <em>Id. </em>Once the employee meets these requirements, the burden shifts to the employer to show that it \u201cwould have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the protected disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 892 A.2d at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Here, the ALJ dismissed Lawson\u2019s appeal on the grounds that Lawson\u2019s letter was not a protected disclosure. Specifically, the ALJ concluded that Lawson did not have a \u201creasonable belief that evidenced abuse of authority, gross mismanagement, gross waste of money, a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or a violation of law.\u201d Having determined that Lawson did not meet the statutory criteria, the ALJ did not reach the issue of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Lawson \u201cwas terminated because of his letter or whether he would have been terminated notwithstanding any disclosure he may have made.\u201d Thus, on appeal, we are concerned only with whether the ALJ erred in concluding that Lawson did not satisfy the \u201creasonable belief\u201d requirement of the Whistle-blower Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Our Whistleblower statute is \u201cpatterned after the \u2018whistle-blower provisions\u2019 of the federal Civil Service Reform Act [of 1978.]\u201d Hearings on H.B. 616 before the Senate Constitutional and Public Law Comm. (March 11, 1980) (statement of Delegate Joan B. Pitkin, sponsor of HB 616). The federal Civil Service Reform Act provided certain protections to federal employees who made disclosures that could often be \u201cgenerally embarrassing to the government[.]\u201d <em>Heller, </em>391 Md. at 169, 892 A.2d at 509. Later, in 1989, Congress enacted the Whistleblower Protection Act (\u201cWPA\u201d), codified in 5 U.S.C. Section 2302(b)(8),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which provided federal employees with even greater protection against retaliation for protected disclosures. <em>Montgomery v. Eastern Corr. Inst., </em>377 Md. 615, 627, 835 A.2d 169, 177 (2003). Maryland\u2019s Whistleblower Act closely tracks this language, and we have thus advised Maryland courts to \u201clook to the federal courts applying the Federal [WPA] because the purpose and language of the statutes are substantially similar.\u201d <em>Heller, </em>391 Md. at 170, 892 A.2d at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The Civil Service Reform Act and subsequent WPA were borne out of \u201cCongressional concern over protecting taxpayers from illegality, waste and abuse[.]\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 274, 100th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Cong., 1st Sess. 17 (1987). From the beginning, the Act had \u201cbroad bipartisan support\u201d because the whistleblower protections contained therein were \u201cessential if Government employees [were] to adequately serve the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18. Thus, whistleblowers are \u201cencouraged\u201d to report \u201cincidences of illegal or wasteful activities[,]\u201d and when doing so, \u201cwill be guaranteed confidentiality and protected against reprisals[.]\u201d President Ronald Reagan, Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States, 1981, p. 359 (Government Printing Office 1982), reported in H.R.Rep. No. 274, <em>supra, </em>at 18. <em>See also </em>S.Rep. No. 413, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 12-13 (1988) (\u201cThe [Governmental Affairs Committee] intends that disclosures be encouraged.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In accordance with this clear legislative preference for disclosure, federal courts have broadly interpreted the statute in favor of protecting whistleblowers. <em>See, e.g., Reid v. MSPB, </em>508 F.3d 674, 677 (Fed.Cir.2007) (\u201cThe language of the statute indicates Congress\u2019s intent to legislate in broad terms, and we conclude that, absent some exclusionary language, a cramped reading of the statute ... would be counter to that intent.\u201d). With regard to the \u201creasonable belief1\u2019 requirement of the WPA, federal courts apply an objective test. <em>See Giove v. Dep't of Transp., </em>230 F.3d 1333, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]he test for whether a belief is reasonable is an objective one.\u201d); <em>see also Lachance v. White, </em>174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed.Cir.1999) (\u201cA purely subjective perspective of an employee is not sufficient even if shared by other employees.\u201d). Specifically, federal courts ask, \u201ccould a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee reasonably conclude that the actions of the government evidence [a violation of the WPA]?\u201d <em>Lachance, </em>174 F.3d at 1381. Following this federal approach, Maryland courts also apply an objective test, with the burden falling upon the employee to prove \u201cthat a reasonable person in his position would believe the disclosure evidence[d] a violation.\u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>377 Md. at 641, 835 A2d 169, 185 (2003) (quoting <em>Ramos v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>72 M.S.P.R. 235, 240 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Although an employee must prove that a reasonable person would believe the disclosure exposes a violation, the employee need not prove that a violation actually occurred. <em>See Kahn v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>618 F.3d 1306, 1312-1313 (Fed. Cir.2010) (\u201cThe petitioner need not prove an actual violation of law, rule, or regulation.\u201d). For example, in <em>Drake v. Agency for Int\u2019l Dev., </em>543 F.3d 1377 (Fed.Cir.2008), the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals reversed an ALJ\u2019s finding that petitioner\u2019s disclosure, regarding alleged intoxication of other employees, was not protected, because the ALJ erroneously required petitioner to prove those employees were actually intoxicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">By requiring Mr. Drake to prove that the agency personnel were intoxicated, the AJ erroneously required Mr. Drake to prove that an actual violation occurred. This is in direct conflict with the standard set forth in <em>Lachance </em>.... The test is not whether Mr. Drake was able to prove intoxication, but rather could a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by Mr. Drake reasonably conclude that agency personnel were intoxicated and that a violation did occur. Applying the proper legal test, the undisputed findings of the ALJ lead to but one conclusion\u2014Mr. Drake made a protected disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\"><em>Drake, </em>543 F.3d at 1382 (some citations omitted). Federal courts have reasoned that requiring a violation of law, rule, or regulation to occur before the employee could make a protected disclosure \u201cwould place such whistleblowers in the position of either making a disclosure to avert the potential harm without statutory protection, or waiting until the waste or wrongdoing had occurred, and possibly incurring responsibility thereby.\u201d <em>Ward v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>67 M.S.P.R. 482, 488 (M.S.P.B.1995). Because such a requirement would interfere with the WPA\u2019s purpose of promoting disclosure, federal courts have declined to adopt it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">We find that, rather than promoting the congressional intent that disclosures be encouraged, such an interpretation would have a serious \u2018chilling effect\u2019 on would-be whistle-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>blowers whose disclosures could avert or prevent governmental wrongdoing.... [Accordingly,] we find that the disclosure of such potential violations may be protected where they evidence a reasonable belief of wrongdoingf.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">When evaluating whether a disclosure satisfies the objective test, the critical evidence is the disclosure itself. For example, an examination of the disclosure may reveal that the employee\u2019s knowledge is based upon unsubstantiated rumors or that the employee lacked a firm belief that a violation had occurred. <em>See Huffman v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>92 M.S.P.R. 429, 434-36 (2002) (although concluding that the employee had successfully alleged that he had a reasonable belief violations occurred, the court observed that statements such as \u201cWhile I could be incorrect, I have a hazy recollection of a meeting\u201d and \u201cI have no substantiated knowledge of wrongdoing\u201d weigh against such a finding). Or the allegations contained therein may be facially insufficient to support a finding of reasonable belief. <em>See Herman v. DOJ, </em>193 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed.Cir.1999) (memorandum expressing prison psychologist\u2019s concern about the possible effect that copying his telephone logs may have on the confidentiality of the program was not a protected disclosure because he never disclosed that any confidential \u201ccounseling information\u201d was copied.). When analyzing the disclosure, an ALJ should take into account the employee\u2019s experience to determine whether a reasonable person in the employee\u2019s position would view the disclosure as evidencing wrongdoing. <em>See Haley v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>977 F.2d 553, 557 (Fed.Cir.1992) (governing statute granted broad discretion to agency officials; thus, the employee, an agency examiner for 13 years, could not have reasonably believed that the exercise of that discretion violated the statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Here, the ALJ found that Lawson did not have a reasonable belief because the ALJ believed Lawson\u2019s disclosure was motivated by \u201ca crusade to make changes to the [BSU Police Department] himself\u201d rather than for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>of \u201calerting a higher authority to a pattern of wrongdoing[.]\u201d While we generally defer to the ALJ\u2019s credibility assessments, <em>see Anderson v. Department of Pub. Safety &amp; Correctional Servs., </em>330 Md. 187, 216, 623 A.2d 198, 212 (1993) (a reviewing court \u201cshould give appropriate deference to the opportunity of the examiner to observe the demeanor of the witnesses\u201d), we recognize that these determinations are not without limits. Both the WPA and Maryland\u2019s Whistleblower Protection statute require only that the employee have a reasonable belief that he is reporting a violation, not that the employee possess a purely altruistic motive for the disclosure. This distinction was articulated in the legislative history of the federal Civil Service Reform Act, which indicated a congressional intent to overrule a prior, appellate decision in a whistleblower case that focused on the personal motive of an employee. <em>See, e.g., Horton v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>66 F.3d 279 (1995) (describing legislative history). Specifically, the Senate Committee for Governmental Affairs described a change<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to the WPA as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">In <em>Fiorillo v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>795 F.2d 1544, 1550 (Fed. Cir.1986) an employee\u2019s disclosures were not considered protected because the employee\u2019s \u201cprimary motivation\u201d was not for the public good, but rather for the personal motives of the employee. The court reached this conclusion despite the lack of any indication in CSRA that an employee\u2019s motives are supposed to be considered in determining whether a disclosure is protected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">The Committee intends that disclosures be encouraged. The OSC, the Board and the courts should not erect barri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ers to disclosures which will limit the necessary flow of information from employees who have knowledge of government wrongdoing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">S.Rep. No. 413, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 12-13 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">As a result of this legislative history, the same appellate court later held that an ALJ erroneously considered an employee\u2019s motives when denying the employee whistleblower relief. In <em>Horton, </em>66 F.3d 279, an employee alleged that his civilian service had been terminated because of a letter he had written to the head of his department in which he disclosed that, among other things, \u201cthere was inadequate supervision of employees, chronic tardiness, [and] falsification of time cards[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281. The ALJ found Horton not to be credible because his \u201cmotivation in writing the letter was primarily an attempt to shift blame, create discord, and evade imminent disciplinary action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282 (quotation marks omitted). The Federal Circuit, however, refused to accept the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination because \u201cit was intertwined with the finding that Mr. Horton\u2019s motivation was personal and vindictive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283. The Court acknowledged that credibility is \u201cindeed relevant in determining [an employee\u2019s] reasonable belief[,]\u201d but that consideration of an employee\u2019s motives for making the disclosure is improper in light of the Congressional response to <em>Fiorillo. Id. </em>The ALJ had improperly conflated these two concepts such that reversal of \u201c[his] reliance on Mr. Horton\u2019s motivation, [meant that] the accompanying credibility determination lost its support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283. Accordingly, the Court only considered the letter on its face, and ultimately held that it was a protected disclosure. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">A review of the ALJ\u2019s decision in this case presents the same problem addressed in <em>Horton. </em>Here, instead of adhering to the objective test articulated in <em>Montgomery, </em>the ALJ attacked Lawson\u2019s motive for making the disclosure. Specifically, the ALJ found Lawson\u2019s statements were not protected disclosures because they were \u201cindicative of an overall pattern on the part of [Lawson] that he is not making his disclosures with the purpose of alerting a higher authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>to a pattern of wrongdoing in the BSU Police Department, but rather he is on a crusade to make changes to the department himself.\u201d According to the ALJ, this \u201ccrusade\u201d was evident from Lawson\u2019s repeated discussions of the potential \u201cfallout\u201d and \u201cembarrassment\u201d that might result if the public were to learn of the violations, and Lawson\u2019s \u201csuggestions for remedying the problems[.]\u201d The ALJ concluded that Lawson\u2019s \u201cpressing concern, throughout his letter, with potential civil liabilities [was] inconsistent with the nature of the Whistle-blower statute as a statute to permit disclosures of illegal activity.\u201d It is clear to us that this preoccupation with Lawson\u2019s motives improperly shaped the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination: \u201cI note an overall pattern in [Lawson\u2019s] behavior that speaks to a personal quest to improve aspects of the police department he does not like, and this belies [his] credibility.\u201d As in <em>Horton, </em>the ALJ\u2019s use of an improper standard has undermined his credibility finding. Because we agree with <em>Horton </em>that a motivation to make changes in the department is not a ground for denying whistleblower protections, we hold that the ALJ erred.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In its brief, Bowie State University makes a passing argument that, even if Lawson made one protected disclosure, his letter contained other allegations that would clearly not be protected disclosures.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The ALJ, however, did not distinguish between Lawson\u2019s allegations when concluding that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>part of his \u201ccrusade,\u201d and thus applied the incorrect legal standard to each of Lawson\u2019s allegations. Moreover, it is not at all clear that a communication containing a protected disclosure will always lose its protected status simply because it also includes some unprotected material. <em>See Chambers v. DOI, </em>602 F.3d 1370, 1379-1380 (Fed.Cir.2010) (referring to one or more conversations with a Washington Post reporter and stating: \u201c[w]e do not find it necessary for present purposes to examine all of Chambers\u2019 statements to the Washington Post reporter as we agree with Chairman McPhie that Chambers\u2019 first statement ... was protected under the WPA as evidencing a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.\u201d). <em>Huffman v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>263 F.3d 1341, 1351 (Fed.Cir.2001) (remanding for determination of whether certain statements made by employee were protected, even though employee made other disclosures that were not protected).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">In sum, the ALJ must apply the appropriate, objective standard to determine the reasonableness of Lawson\u2019s belief, and then, if necessary, proceed to a consideration of the remaining requirements under the Whistleblower statute. We reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s affirmance of the ALJ\u2019s decision, and remand to that court with instructions to vacate the ALJ decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED.

For instance, in this case, Waiters predicated Lawson\u2019s termination on the latter\u2019s unwillingness to \u201caccept the chain of command in the police department.\u201d Whistleblower protections would override this consideration because protected disclosures are often made to people outside the normal chain of command. For example, in <em>Huffman v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>263 F.3d 1341 (Fed.Cir.2001), the Federal Circuit, using a hypothetical situation strikingly similar to the case at hand, explained that the purposes of the federal Whistleblower Protection Act are furthered by permitting disclosure to persons other than an immediate supervisor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">An example is a law enforcement officer who is responsible for investigating crime by government employees who, feeling that the normal chain of command is unresponsive, reports wrongdoing outside of normal channels.
