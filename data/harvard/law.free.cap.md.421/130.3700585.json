We granted certiorari prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">1. Can an actuarial funding recommendation for a state pension system, even one that contains an error, cause damages when it is undisputed that the funding recommendation resulted in contributions being received by the pen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>sion system that always met or exceeded statutory funding goals?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">2. In determining the measure of damages, what is the legal relationship between the State of Maryland (the \u201cState\u201d) and the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System (the \u201cSystem\u201d): are they separate, so that future contributions and earnings made by the State to the System must be considered in assessing damages to the System, or are they related so that any loss to the System must be offset by the gain retained by the State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">3. When applying the contributory negligence doctrine, must a trier of fact consider only expert testimony, or should factual evidence showing that the plaintiff contributed to the harm be considered and evaluated under a reasonable person standard?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The State Retirement and Pension System presented a conditional cross-petition, which we also granted, in which one question was posed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">Did the MSBCA [Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals] correctly assess damages, and did the circuit court erroneously reduce the MSBCA\u2019s damage award by $34,200,000 by employing an incorrect standard of review and adopting a theory that departs from well-established principles of Maryland law to find that the State of Maryland must pay the contribution portion of the damages caused by Milliman\u2019s breach, even if doing so would require the State to pay far more in contributions than it would have had to pay if Milliman had not breached its contracts?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK8\"><em>Milliman, Inc. v.

We shall hold that Milliman is liable to the System for repeatedly misinterpreting a data code associated with survivors\u2019 benefits, irrespective of whether the System met funding goals during the contracts. We shall further hold that because the State was not a party before the Board of Contract Appeals, whether the measure of damages should reflect the State\u2019s use and benefit of contributions not made to the System as a result of Milliman\u2019s errors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>is not properly before us. In addition, we shall hold that the System was not negligent in the development or transmission of data provided to Milliman and, therefore, contributory negligence does not bar the System\u2019s recovery. Penally, we shall hold that the Circuit Court erroneously reduced the Board\u2019s damage award by $34,200,000, representing lost contributions, and therefore, shall vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court and shall direct that the Board\u2019s decision be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">A state or local government retirement system is designed, fundamentally, to fund the long term cost of providing benefits to employees. Thomas P. Bleakney, <em>Retirement Systems for Public Employees </em>33 (Univ. of Penn. Press 1972). The latter is so, because, \u201cthere is a time lag between the accruing of pension lights and the payment of benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. Retirement benefits are funded by the interplay of three sources, namely, contributions from the employer, contributions from the employee, and investment income. Employer contributions are calculated, moreover, so that over the long run, annual contributions plus investment earnings are sufficient to pay out the promised benefits. <em>The Top 10 Advantages of Maintaining Defined Benefit Pension Plans, </em>http://www.macrs.org/news/96-the-top-10-advantages-ofmaintaining-defined-benefit-pension-plans.html (last visited July 16, 2011). In this way, the financial workings of a public employee retirement system have been compared to a water network, with the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">Inputting to this reservoir are three flows: employee money, employer money, and earnings on the investments of the fund. The outflow is for benefit payments and administrative expenses. So long as the reservoir is not empty, the system will continue to operate. Because the input from employee contributions and investment earnings is not easily altered, proper design of the system requires anticipation of the expected outflow in advance, so that the demands on the employer can be scheduled. This is the essential scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>of financing techniques-measuring the anticipated outflow and regulating the rate of input of employer contributions into the fund.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Bleakney, <em>supra, </em>at 106-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Actuaries come into a retirement process because they focus primarily on \u201canalyzing the financial consequences of future uncertain events.\u201d Michael A. Bean, <em>Probability: The Science of Uncertainty </em>6 (American Mathematical Society 2001). In the pension context, actuaries perform complex calculations to ensure that employer contributions are sufficient to fully satisfy the liabilities of a fund over time, despite fluctuations in investments and the steadily growing number of retirees. <em>The Top 10 Advantages of Maintaining Defined Benefit Pension Plans, </em>http://www.macrs.org/news/96-the-top-10-advantagesof-maintaining-defined-benefit-pension-plans.html (last visited July 16, 2011). In formulating estimates of employer contributions, \u201cplanning for error is part of the calculation,\u201d and actuaries often employ \u201ca degree of conservatism in [their] assumptions,\u201d erring on the side of over-funding rather than under-funding. <em>Rhoades, McKee &amp; Boer v. United States, </em>43 F.3d 1071, 1075 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In Maryland, the State Retirement and Pension System is composed of ten independent retirement systems,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>only three were the subject of the challenge initiated by the State against Milliman, those being the Judge\u2019s Retirement System, the State Police Retirement System, and the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Pension System, all of which are managed by a Board of Trustees, which includes the Secretary of Budget and Management, the State Comptroller, the State Treasurer, and elected or appointed representatives of each retirement system. Pursuant to Section 21-125(a) of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, Maryland Code (1993, 2004 Repl.Vol.),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Board of Trustees \u201cshall designate an actuary\u201d to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">(1) give technical advice to the Board of Trustees on the operation of the funds of the several systems; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">(2) perform other related duties that the Board of Trustees requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The designated actuary is required to make an annual \u201cvaluation of the assets ... of the funds of the several systems,\u201d upon which the State\u2019s (the employer\u2019s) contributions to the System are based:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">(b) <em>Annual </em>valuation.\u2014(1) On the basis of actuarial assumptions that the Board of Trustees adopts, each year the actuary shall make a valuation of the assets and liabilities of the funds of the several systems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">(2) Each year the Board of Trustees shall certify to the Secretary of Budget and Management and to the Governor the rates of employer contributions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Section 21-125(b) of the State Personnel and Pensions Article. Moreover, Section 21-304 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article establishes a statutory goal for the System to have its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>obligations to participants fully funded by the year 2020, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\">(d)(1) Beginning July 1, 2001, each year the Board of Trustees shall set contribution rates for each State system that shall amortize:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">(i) all unfunded liabilities or surpluses accrued as of June 30, over 20 years; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">(ii) any new unfunded liabilities or surpluses that have accrued from July 1 of the proceeding fiscal year over 25 years to reflect:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">1. experience gains and losses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">2. the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">3. the effect of legislation effective on or after July 1, 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">Milliman contracted with the System beginning in 1982 to provide actuarial valuations for each of the State\u2019s retirement and pension systems and continued to serve as actuary by additional contracts effective July 1, 1990, July 1, 1993, and August 5, 1998, to terminate as they did, August 4, 2006. The contracts required Milliman to perform valuations of the various funds, as well as an \u201cannual certification of the employer contribution rate required to fund each retirement system for the coming year.\u201d Milliman assured the System that the actuary \u201csubscribed] to the concept that the annual actuarial valuations are the cornerstone of all financial planning of a retirement system. As such we take great care in assuring that all technical aspects of the valuation are completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">In 2004, Milliman discovered, through a \u201creplication audit,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a coding error affecting the three retirement systems, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>which the actuary failed to include in its calculations benefits payable to surviving spouses of judges and police officers. Thereafter, Milliman reported its discovery of the valuation errors to the System and indicated that liabilities for the three affected systems had been understated by more than $130 million. To provide expert advice concerning the longstanding actuarial error, the System retained the Hay Group, \u201ca global human resource management consulting firm,\u201d which examined Milliman\u2019s work and determined that \u201cMilliman\u2019s errors did result from their failure to apply reasonable standards of care as would have been expected of an actuary at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">By formal authorization of its Board of Trustees, the System approved the filing of an administrative claim against Milliman pursuant to Section 15-219.1 of the State Finance and Procurement Article, Maryland Code (2001, 2006 Repl.Vol.).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Retirement System Procurement Officer determined that Milliman had breached its actuarial responsibility, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>resulting in $73 million in losses to the System, and Milliman appealed to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The Board of Contract Appeals determined that Milliman substantially breached its contracts with the System by failing to exercise reasonable care and diligence in interpreting data in connection with the three affected retirement systems, in contravention of the professional actuarial standard of care:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">76. As actuarial customs and practices have evolved and become generally accepted standards of care, they have been reduced to writing and adopted by appropriately accredited professional associations as statements of duties and responsibilities required to be employed by actuaries in the course of rendering reasonable actuarial care and advice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">77. The actuarial <em>Guides to Professional Conduct </em>originally written in 1969 was replaced in 2005 by the actuarial <em>Code of Professional Conduct </em>and in addition to those learned treatises expressing accepted written statements of actuarial professional standards, since the late 1980s, the generally accepted professional standards of care for the actuarial profession have been established, written and promulgated by the Actuarial Standards Board (ASB), the successor professional organization to the American Academy of Actuar\u00edais.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">78. In addition to the officially adopted and promulgated written standards of care for the actuarial profession, there are also generally accepted standards of practice for actuaries which are unwritten but nonetheless constitute professional standards of care which contribute to expert assessment of how the requisite standard of professional care must be exercised in particular actuarial settings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">79. The following written expressions of standards of professional actuarial care in these Findings of Fact were applicable at all times relevant to the issues presented in this appeal even though they may not have been formally written and adopted until after the time at which breach of the written standard is here alleged to have occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>80. The historic Guides to Professional Conduct adopted by the American Academy of Actuaries states: \u201cThe actuary will act for each client or employer with scrupulous attention to the trust and confidence that the relationship implies and ... [t]he actuary will exercise his best judgment to ensure that any calculations or recommendations made by him or under his direction are based on sufficient and reliable data.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\">81. Actuarial Standard of Practice (ASOP) No. 4 pertaining to recommended practices for data analysis, developed by the Pension Committee of the Actuarial Standards Board, and adopted by the full Actuarial Standards Board in October 1993 provides, \u201c5.2.2\u2014All provisions of the plan adopted and effective on or before the start of the plan year should be taken into account in measuring pension obligations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">82. ASOP No. 4 further provides: \u201c5.2.3(a)\u2014The actuary will generally rely on the plan administrator, plan sponsor or other qualified third party for asset and participant information. While not responsible for auditing the information, the actuary should verify its reasonableness both directly and against other available information, such as prior years\u2019 data and reported benefit payments. If the actuary is not satisfied as to the reasonableness of the information, further inquiry should be made until the actuary is so satisfied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">83. ASOP No. 23 pertaining to data quality was initially written in the mid 1990s, refined by the General Committee of the Actuarial Standards Board, and adopted by the full Actuarial Standards Board in December 2004 to apply to all actuarial practice areas, stating: \u201c3.4\u2014Reliance on Other Information Relevant to the Use of Data\u2014In many situations, the actuary is provided with other information relevant to the appropriate use of data such as contract provisions, plan documents and reinsurance treaties. The validity and comprehensiveness [as contrasted to clarity] of such information are the responsibility of those who supply such information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>The Board also found that Milliman had misinterpreted retirement code \u201c00,\u201d resulting in an understatement of contributions necessary to fund three of the State\u2019s ten retirement and pension funds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\">108. Code \u201c00\u201d was in fact a straight life annuity form of benefit payment for most MSRPS participants, but not for employees enrolled in the judges or police retirement systems, who also were provided a 50% surviving spousal benefit in addition to the single life annuity enjoyed by other retirees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">109. At the hearing in this appeal, a competent, qualified, practicing actuarial professional offered expert testimony to support the legal conclusion that the foregoing incorrect interpretation of MSRPS codes constituted a breach of the applicable standard of professional care on the part of Milliman as the expert actuarial consultant retained by MSRPS for actuarial advice and support in 1982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">110. Milliman was provided by MSRPS with a booklet describing the benefits payable under the State police pension plan in which it was stated, \u201cA member of the Maryland State Police Retirement System with a spouse as of the date of retirement must elect the maximum retirement allowance ... At the retiree\u2019s death, one-half of the monthly retirement allowance will be paid to the surviving spouse for life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">112. Because the nature of the retirement benefit identified by code \u201c00\u201d varied depending on the particular retirement system in which the participant was enrolled, \u201c00\u201d on the retirement coding tape meant a straight life annuity for teachers, for example, but for judges and State Police \u201c00\u201d meant a straight life annuity plus a 50% benefit for surviving spouses as the maximum or normal form of payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiB\">113J In its evaluation methodology Milliman failed to recognize that the code \u201c00\u201d for retired judges and State Police included a 50% benefit for surviving spouses in addition to a straight life annuity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>114. In the course of Milliman\u2019s calculations from 1982 until 2004, Milliman regarded the code \u201c00\u201d as meaning only a straight life annuity for all of the State\u2019s retirement systems even though Milliman should have known that the code \u201c00\u201d actually was not just a straight life annuity for judges and State Police but also included a continuing 50% benefit for surviving spouses of participants enrolled in those two (2) particular retirement systems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">173. Milliman discovered in 2004 that it made a coding error in its methodology for evaluating the Maryland State Police retirement system initiated 22 years earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">174. As a result of Milliman\u2019s discovery in September 2004 of the coding error for the Maryland State Police due to the replication audit conducted by Milliman\u2019s Philadelphia office, Milliman reviewed its methodology on other of Maryland\u2019s retirement systems and learned that the same error was made for LEOPS [Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Pension System], judges and legislators, which, like the State Police, had been evaluated on the assumption of recipients\u2019 entitlement only to straight life annuity rather than the more costly benefits associated with dual lifetime benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">175. Milliman admits that it made a coding error in 1982 on a small fraction of the named beneficiaries and that that coding error was subsequently replicated each year until October 17, 2004, when the error was discovered and promptly reported to MSRPS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">176. As a result of the aforementioned coding error, the MSRPS police and judges retirement and pension plans were underfunded from 1982 until 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">182. Each year from 1982 until discovery of the coding error in 2004, the contribution rates certified by Milliman to MSRPS were not set in compliance with Maryland\u2019s statutory requirements for funding the retirement systems enjoyed by judges and State Police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Specifically, the Board found that the affected retirement systems were not on track to achieve full funding by the statutory 2020 date, but instead, that \u201cthe State Police retirement system was funded at a level of 84% of liability, judges at 74%, and local law enforcement at 60%,\u201d so that increased contributions to make up for those deficiencies became necessary. The Board determined that the sum \u201cneeded to make [the System] whole from the losses sustained as a result of Milliman\u2019s errors,\u201d included approximately $84 million in deficient contributions plus $88.8 million in lost interest on those contributions during the twenty-two year period:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">223. Calculated on the basis of the sum needed to make MSRPS whole from the losses sustained as a result of Milliman\u2019s errors, and determined within a reasonable degree of certainty, the damages incurred by MSRPS to the three (3) affected systems totaled $72,965,148 as of 2005, that figure representing all funding contribution deficiencies since 1983 resulting from Milliman\u2019s actuarial calculation errors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">224. The aforesaid $72,965,148 total loss incurred by MSRPS includes $34,208,960 in deficient contributions over the course of the 22-year period during which the coding error was made plus $38,756,188 in lost interest on the investment return on that deficiency during the period involved, each year compounded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">In so doing, the Board rejected Milliman\u2019s argument that the System was not damaged insofar as the taxpayers would fund any deficiency, because that \u201cperspective subverted] the entire function and purpose of actuarial analysis\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">An additional one of Milliman\u2019s alternative arguments against the award of any damages in the face of a determination of breach and liability is that MSRPS is not harmed, because, notwithstanding 22 years of Milliman\u2019s actuarial errors, it is undisputed that ultimately the retirement and pension systems will be fully funded in accordance with law. Of the $132 million shortfall of which $73 million needs to be repaid over time in order to accrue with interest and restore the full amount of that $132 million deficiency by the year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>2030, nearly $20 million has already been paid to make up for that deficit. This position has some merit in that State tax revenue is used to achieve future full funding of MSRPS liability, whether or not the allocation of those State funds is or was made at the appropriate time, or at some other time. However, this perspective subverts the entire function and purpose of actuarial analysis, which is to determine how much to contribute and when.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-4\">If the Board were to accept this argument, an actuary could satisfy its contractual obligations to a client by training a monkey to punch random keys on a calculator. MSRPS, the Governor, and Legislature could agree to appropriate the amount thus randomly determined to be allocated toward pension funding, with the understanding that some group of State taxpayers sometime in the future would make up the difference in the event of a deficit or reap the rewards in the event of a surplus, and the actuary would always be held harmless for any calculation error, no matter its basis or magnitude. Certainly, this is not an acceptable standard of professionalism for actuaries, nor is it the one in force, nor would its adoption benefit any actuarial firm, nor does such a lax standard characterize the usual excellent work of the competent, impressive, highly trained, skilled, and careful actuarial experts engaged by Milliman. Instead, the approval of such an argument would render actuarial calculations pointless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">Adopting this position would also undermine the extremely important statutory objectives of leveling contributions, protecting inter-generational equity, and pre-funding defined benefits. That the losses incurred by MSRPS have now been amortized and already partially restored is irrelevant to Milliman\u2019s responsibility because the reimbursement made to date is from a collateral source, namely budgets adopted in years subsequent to the years and in different amounts than the appropriations that should have been made and would have been made but for Milliman\u2019s error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"As\">The Board also concluded that, because the State was not a party to the proceeding, Milliman\u2019s contention that any losses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>sustained by the System as a result of Milliman\u2019s calculation errors must be offset by assets that purportedly remained in the State\u2019s General Fund, was without merit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">A more persuasive position on the question of damages was posited by [Timothy F.] Maloney, explained during his testimony using a \u201cright pocket/left pocket\u201d analogy referenced in Milliman\u2019s brief as the \u201cunitary creditor doctrine.\u201d By this argument, Milliman asserts that the State is a single entity comprised of many constituent agencies like MSRPS. Funds that are taken from the General Fund, or right pocket, and deposited into sub-entities like MSRPS, the left pocket, do not result in any gain or loss to the entity itself, only transfers from one pocket to another in a single pair of pants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">This conception is accurate to the extent that MSRPS is an appendage of the State of Maryland. MSRPS is indeed a component of the State. It is created by State law. MSRPS carries out an important State function upon which State employees, retirees and their families rely. The full faith and credit of the State stands behind MSRPS liabilities. The State lists and includes MSRPS funds as a part of its fiduciary assets. The State is guarantor of MSRPS obligations. The Governor of the State authorizes state revenue to be allocated to MSRPS as a part of the annual State budget in accordance with State law and that appropriation is authorized by approval of the State Legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">However, the State of Maryland is not a party to this proceeding. As fully substantiated by examples and succinctly but effectively expressed by counsel for Milliman in its brief at page 68, \u201cThe System [MSRPS] cannot be heard here to complain on behalf of the State. The claim before the Board is a claim by the System on behalf of the System. The System has been adamant in the position that the State is not a party to this proceeding and has repeatedly taken the position in pleadings and correspondence that the State is not a party to the claim and plays no role in this case.... The Board heard no evidence from the State, or any witness purporting to speak on behalf of the State____\u201d and at page <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>21 of its reply brief, \u201cthe System does not speak for the State, or the taxpayers, neither of whom are parties to this case.\u201d Or as one might assert using Maloney\u2019s pants pocket analogy, only the left pocket is a party to this proceeding. Impact of the instant decision upon the right pocket, the General Fund, is irrelevant to the specifically and deliberately limited claim of the left pocket, MSRPS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">As a matter of law, funds held by MSRPS are quite distinct from all other State funds. As Maloney intimates, the State maintains many funding pools for which various program supporters are inclined to view such funds as separate and independent from the General Fund, sacrosanct from expenditures other than those for which revenue has been specifically directed and restricted, the Transportation Trust Fund or Program Open Space, for example. Yet, Maloney would correctly assert, whenever the Legislature is in session, it is conceivable and possible to change the rules, repeal restrictions and raid funds intended for one purpose in order to use them for another. In this sense restricted pots of revenue are all part of the State\u2019s assets and may legally be transferred for General Fund use should the Governor and Legislature so desire and therefore facilitate enactment of a change in law, irrespective of whether or not such action would constitute good public policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay5\">Finally, the Board concluded that the System was not contributorily negligent, because it was ultimately Milliman\u2019s professional obligation to \u201cunderstand the data\u201d and seek clarification from the System:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">The only qualifying obligation on the part of MSRPS as plan sponsor is accurately to reflect the meaning of its codes as a part of its data dictionary, which MSRPS achieved when it provided to Milliman its written Annual Valuation Record and Codes and Flags memorandum. Those documents, viewed in light of the pertinent statutes and employee brochures describing retirement payment provisions, were sufficient to notify Milliman fully and fairly of the meaning of relevant MSRPS codes. Milliman has undoubtedly seen and continues to encounter innumerable variances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>in the meaning of a multitude of alphanumeric codes used by disparate pension plan sponsors. Indeed, as more elaborately discussed above in this Decision, to the extent that the coding used by MSRPS was confusing to Milliman, the actuary bore the obligation of soliciting further clarifying information until it accurately understood the information provided to it by its client. Having previously asserted, \u201cthe data furnished to us are, in our opinion, sufficient and reliable for the purposes of our calculations,\u201d Milliman is estopped from asserting today that the data furnished to it by MSRPS was deficient. Though it is certainly true that MSRPS might have done a different and even a better job with its data dictionary, it cannot be said as a fair or fitting legal conclusion that MSRPS was negligent in the development or transmission of the coded data it provided to its actuary. As a consequence, Millimaris breach of contract is not excused by any conduct on the part of MSRPS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">After Milliman sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the judge affirmed the Board\u2019s decision involving Millimaris breach, but determined that the Board erred in calculating damages to include both lost contributions and lost interest on those contributions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">[T]he State\u2019s argument is right and the Court agrees that in fact the obligations in total should not be that of the State and should be primarily and for the purpose of damages, the obligation of the true obligor, which is the beaching party which was not the State legislative body. It was the actuary. And that in so doing, it is that the said systems did not have the ability to contribute the funds and the responsibility of the Legislature or the State legislative body is not to make up what in fact would have been the investment flowing therefrom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">And therefore, the question becomes as to what would have been the actual investment returns or use benefit to the systems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">The Court again states that we cannot nor could the Board speculate as to what investment interest would yield in the future. However, in this case, we are not looking at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>whether or not in fact the interest in the future would have been 18 percent profit we all wish as we get older, close to retirement. Nor is it reasonable to speculate that it would be at 0.25 percent as in some of the local credit unions, if you would, please\u2014not that we have any knowledge of those things. That under the circumstances in this case the finding of the Board was that there was $89 million in lost use of the funds based on looking at that which occurred between 1982 and 2005.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\">While the Court recognizes that the systems may believe and so argue that the party responsible for both of those should be that of Milliman, this Court finds as a matter of law that in fact Milliman did breach and is responsible for damages and defined damages is lost use of those funds for the systems. And the lost use by the evidence is $39 million.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">The Court finds that it reaches that conclusion as a matter of law, that by substantial evidence in applying the law on contracts it is the same figure of $39 million. The Court therefore affirms in part the decision of the Board that Milliman did breach its contract and breached its standard of duty as required under the actuarial standard operations procedure. Not quoting each of those, but it\u2019s definitely in the long list of findings of the said Board; that under the circumstances, the Court reverses as a matter of law as to the damages and does find as the substantial evidence that the amount of damage is $39 million plus all costs in this case to date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Our role in reviewing the final decision of an administrative agency, such as the State Board of Contract Appeals, is \u201climited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Maryland Aviation Admin. v.

In addition to numerous exhibits supporting its underfunding contention, the System also called various individuals including Major Morris Krome, an elected member of the Board of Trustees representing the Maryland State Police Retirement System, who testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">[Counsel]: Can you tell the members of the Board whether or not the Milliman actuaries told the Board that liabilities had to be increased because of the error?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">[Major Krome]: They did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">[Counsel]: And looking at the chart on page 2, can you tell the Board by how much did liabilities increase as a result of this issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">[Major Krome]: I believe the figure is $87.2 million.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aan\">[Counsel]: And that\u2019s for the State Police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">[Major Krome]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">[Counsel]: And for the Judges\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">[Major Krome]: $24.8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">[Counsel]: And for the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 System?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A35\">[Major Krome]: S 16.1 million.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-12\">[Counsel]: And the total amount they increased liabilities as a result of this error?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\">[Major Krome]: $131.7 million.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">In addition, Brent Mowery, an actuary versed in pension matters employed by the Hay Group, testified that Milliman\u2019s errors caused each of the affected systems to be underfunded pursuant to the statutory funding goals, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-15\">[Counsel]: My question is how does knowing what the funding goals are play into the valuation process? Again, if simply, you can just explain that to the Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-16\">[Mr. Mowery]: The actuary in developing the funding requirement for the upcoming year must take the funding goals, in this case statutorily established, and prepare a result which is consistent with those goals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>[Counsel]: So, for example, there was testimony earlier from Treasurer Kopp that in 1982 the statutory funding goals for the systems in the Maryland State System was to be fully funded by the year 2020. In your mind, is that a funding goal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\">[Mr. Mowery]: What we learned early on from reading the 1982 evaluation results was that in 1980 it was established that there would be a goal of reaching full funding over a 40 year period with respect to the unfunded accrued liability that existed in 1980 which, in essence, does take it to 2020, and we did understand that was [the] statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">[Counsel]: And my follow-up question then is how would a reasonable professional actuary doing the valuation in 1982 have to factor that funding goal into the valuation process? [Mr. Mowery]: If came in the form of Milliman recognizing that with two years down and 38 to go, the remaining amortization period for the unfunded accrued liability was 38 years, and they calculated valuation results on that basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">[Counsel]: And in your opinion, would payment by Milliman of the approximately $73 million that you calculated place the systems in the positions they would have been in 2005 absent Milliman\u2019s mistake in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">[Mr. Mowery]: Yes. If this number, approximately $73 were deposited by Milliman as of June 30, 2005, my belief would be that the System was made whole or would have recovered the loss associated with the Milliman errors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">[Counsel]: Can you explain conceptually why the $73 million would have been sufficient to amortize as of 2004, 2005 $128 million in additional liabilities?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">[Mr. Mowery]: Yes. That has to do with the fact that Milliman\u2019s measurement of the error in October 2004 was measuring a liability that had not up until then been accounted for. The fact is that that liability had it have been recognized from the start back in 1982 would have been partially funded through these annual amortization of un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>funded liability payments. And what has occurred by the point in time of 6/30/05 is part of the $128 million liability has been funded. Part of it through the contributions and part of it through, you know, net favorable investment returns over that period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\">[Counsel]: Is, is the size of the amount of damages here, the $73 million, a result of the nature of the mistake or of the time it was allowed to continue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">[Mr. Mowery]: It\u2019s both. It\u2019s a combination of the two. And we, by virtue of observing that the average return on investment over that 22-year period was as high as 11 percent, whereas the actuarial investment return assumption over those years was below that, well below that, there has been factored in here an influence that actually raises the level of shortfall or loss suffered by the systems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq5\">[Counsel]: If the mistake had been caught any time prior to 2004, would the financial consequences to the systems have been significantly different?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">[Mr. Mowery]: Yes. And it\u2019s kind of proportionate. The earlier it might have been caught and corrected, the lower the cumulative impact. So, yes, it\u2019s true the number would not be nearly this high if the error had been applicable over a shorter period of time and had been corrected earlier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Finally, Dr. Ann Melissa Moye, a member of the System\u2019s Board of Trustees in 2004, testified that the three affected retirement systems were significantly underfunded at levels ranging from 60 percent to 84 percent, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">[Counsel]: Dr. Moye, you\u2019ve said that but for Milliman\u2019s error in this case, the System would have collected additional contributions from '84 through 2005. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">[Dr. Moye]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">[Counsel]: And what was the amount?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">[Dr. Moye]: Right. It would be $34 million.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>[Counsel]: And with regard to the systems at issue in this case, do you have a knowledge of their funded status?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\">[Dr. Moye]: I do although not at, you know, as of after the market drop, they would be components of that broad range I gave you of between 60 percent and 70 percent. As of the last actuarial valuation that we received, June 30th of last year\u2014well, the State Police, for example, is at 84 percent having dropped from about 88 percent. LEOPS, the Law Enforcement Officers is less than that, it\u2019s in the 60s. And the Judges is around 74,1 think it is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Milliman asserts, relying on the testimony of Dr. TCim Nicholl, an actuary employed by Price, Waterhouse, Coopers, that the \u201cSystem was not damaged because the coding issue resulted in it having made slightly fewer contributions in the past, because Milliman\u2019s funding recommendations over its tenure as actuary led the State to make more contributions than were necessary to the System.\u201d Dr. Nicholl testified that Milliman\u2019s recommended contribution rates fell within \u201cthe range of reasonableness.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">[Dr. Nicholl]: What this graph shows is the contribution rate for the State Police from 1982 through 2004, and there\u2019s two lines. It\u2019s hard to see up on the wall, but there\u2019s a purple line and an orange line, or a blue line and an orange line. And the blue line is the contribution rate that Milliman recommended to the Board for the State Police. And the orange line is what the contribution rate would\u2019ve been with the liability for the retirees added on. And it\u2019s my opinion that these lines are so close together that, really, they\u2019re equivalent as far as actuarial reasonableness is concerned, that the numbers are so close together that you can\u2019t say one is right and the other is wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE4\">[Board Member]: And you\u2019re referring to the comparison between the actual\u2014the actual funding recommendation that was made by Milliman during that time, and then Mr. Mowery\u2019s corrected version?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">[Dr. Nicholl]: That\u2019s right. My opinion is that the two are\u2014if you look at these two lines, they are very close. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>fact, you know, the orange line just sits on top of the blue line. It\u2019s not even\u2014it just\u2014they\u2019re so close together that I have to say these are equivalent, and both of them fall in the range of reasonableness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-4\">[Counsel]: And again, if you could just briefly describe this chart and the information that\u2019s conveyed on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">[Dr. Nicholl]: This is a chart very similar to the police, State Police chart. It shows the contribution rate from 1984 through 2004 for the Judge\u2019s plan. And again, the blue line is the total contribution rate that Milliman\u2019s valuation produced, and the orange line is what that rate would\u2019ve been had the coding error not been\u2014had the coding issue been included in the contribution rate. And, you know, similar to the police, you can see that the two lines are right next to each other. In my opinion, they are both within the range of reasonableness. I would say that the blue line falls clearly within a range of reasonableness, and that the plan has\u2014you know, the contribution rate, while it hasn\u2019t declined like we sae the police plan decline, it has gone down a little bit over the years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">[Counsel]: And this is a similar chart for LEOPS?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">[Dr. Nicholl]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The Board, however, credited the testimony and evidence presented by Major Krome, Mr. Mowery, and Dr. Moye rather than that of Dr. Nicholl regarding whether Milliman erred or not. Clearly, there was substantial evidence upon which the Board relied to support its finding that the System had suffered losses totaling $73 million and that the affected systems were thereby underfunded as a result of Milliman\u2019s coding errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">To address the second question, namely, how to measure damages caused by errors in actuarial recommendations related to pensions systems, we lack statutory guidance as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>well as precedent. As a result, we turn to analogous decisions from our sister states to seek assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">In <em>Dardaganis v. Grace Capital Inc., </em>889 F.2d 1237 (2d Cir.1989), the Trustees of the Retirement Fund of the Fur Manufacturing Industry entered into an agreement with Grace Capital, Inc., in which Grace became investment manager of the assets of the retirement fund and promised to \u201cmanage the [Fund\u2019s] Account in strict conformity with the investment guidelines promulgated by the Trustees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1239. Pursuant to the investment guidelines, Grace was prohibited from investing more than fifty percent of fund assets in common stocks. During an eight month period, however, Grace invested more than fifty percent of fund assets in common stock, exceeding the fifty percent ceiling each month by an average of fifteen percent. The Trustees refused to increase the ceiling above fifty percent, and Grace was fired when the common stock holdings increased to approximately eighty percent of the portfolio.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Thereafter, the Trustees brought suit, alleging that Grace had breached a fiduciary duty embodied in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(D),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> by failing to adhere to the common stock ceiling. The federal district court granted the Trustees\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability, holding that Section 1104\u2019s requirement that fiduciaries abide by the plan documents together with the agreement\u2019s provision that Grace manage the fund \u201cin strict conformity with the investment guidelines,\u201d required the court to conclude, as a matter of law, that \u201c[a]ny violation of the terms of [the] [a]greement constitute^] a breach of Grace Capital\u2019s fiduciary duty under \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(D) and ereate[d] liability to the Fund.\u201d <em>Darda</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>ganis, </em>889 F.2d at 1239. The district court awarded damages by comparing what the plan actually earned with what it would have earned had Grace invested only fifty percent of the fund\u2019s account in equities.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">On appeal, Grace asserted that \u201ceven if [it] breached a duty, there were no \u2018losses\u2019 to the plan, because the sum of the Fund\u2019s assets and the cash withdrawn to meet Fund obligations increased during their tenure.\u201d <em>Dardaganis, </em>889 F.2d at 1243. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court, reasoning that the Fund has suffered losses as a result of Grace\u2019s breach, and any award of damages should take into account the financial position the beneficiaries would have occupied, but for the breach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">[A]n \u201cappropriate remedy in cases of breach of fiduciary duty is the restoration of the trust beneficiaries to the position they would have occupied but for the breach of trust.\u201d <em>[Donovan v. Bierwirth,] </em>754 F.2d [1049, 1056 (2d Cir.1985) ]. If, but for the breach, the [f]und would have earned even more than it actually earned, there is a \u201closs\u201d for which the breaching fiduciary is liable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1243. In <em>Dardaganis, </em>therefore, an investment manager was required to compensate a fund for losses stemming from a breach of the standard of care, no matter whether the fund\u2019s assets grew as a whole, to place the fund in the position it would have been in but for the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">We also find helpful to our analysis an unpublished opinion of the California intermediate appellate court, <em>Board of Trustees v. Mercer, </em>2003 WL 21481021, 2003 Cal.App. Unpub. LEXIS 6236 (Cal.Ct.App.2003), in which the Board of Trustees for the San Luis Obispo County Pension Trust as well as the County of San Luis Obispo filed a claim against their former actuary, Mercer, for professional negligence. In the case, presenting factual circumstances remarkably similar to the present case, the trust paid a defined benefit and was funded by contributions from the county and its employees and income from the investment of trust assets. Mercer was the trust actuary from 1980 through 1996, when the actuary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>discovered errors in the computer program it used in preparing actuarial valuations for the trust, including an assumption that plan participants would have no surviving spouses. As a result, Mercer failed to account for the payment of survivors\u2019 benefits, such that \u201cthe trust\u2019s future liabilities were underestimated and its assets were overestimated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *1, 2003 Cal.App. Unpub. LEXIS 6236 at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">At trial, Mercer admitted breaching the actuarial standard of care, but disputed liability, because \u201cin spite of its errors, the trust was fully funded\u201d and therefore, \u201csuffered no damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *2-3, 2003 Cal.App. Unpub. LEXIS 6236 at *6-7. The trial judge determined that the trust suffered a loss of investment income on the nearly $11 million the county under-contributed to the fund. The appellate court affirmed, rejecting Mercer\u2019s contention that the award of lost interest would amount to \u201can impermissible windfall.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *4, 2003 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 6236 at *12. Instead, the court recognized that although the \u201ccounty may derive an incidental benefit from Mercer\u2019s payment of damages to the trust, as will county employees and all taxpayers living within the county,\u201d awarding damages for lost investment income would place the county in the position it would have been in had Mercer properly valued the pension\u2019s assets and liabilities. <em>Mercer </em>suggests that whether a pension fund is fully funded is immaterial in calculating damages, when an actuary has miscalculated pension obligations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In the present case, Milliman breached its contracts with the System by misinterpreting the \u201c00\u201d code over a period of twenty-two years, thereby causing the System to inadequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>plan for the costs of retirement benefits to surviving spouses of judges and police officers. Milliman attempts to diminish its culpability for the errors because the System has met its funding goals, as in <em>Dardaganis </em>and <em>Mercer; </em>the reality is, however, that but for Milliman\u2019s miscalculations, the three affected systems would have been more robust. We agree with the Board that to accept Milliman\u2019s argument would enable a highly trained, skilled professional to escape liability on the basis of fortuitous economic changes and better than anticipated investment returns, rather than suffer the consequences of the breach of its standard of care.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">In this regard, the Board relied upon four standards applicable to actuaries during the contract term, including the historical Guides to Professional Conduct adopted by the American Academy of Actuaries, which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">[t]he actuary will exercise his best judgment to ensure that any calculations or recommendations made by him or under his direction are based on sufficient and rehable data[,]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">and also Actuarial Standard of Practice (ASOP) No. 4, pertaining to recommended practices for data analysis, which states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">[a]ll provisions of the plan adopted and effective on or before the start of the plan year should generally be taken into account in measuring pension obligations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">ASOP No. 4 further provides that the actuary should verify the reasonableness of plan data:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>The actuary -will generally rely on the plan administrator, plan sponsor or other qualified third party for asset and participant information. While not responsible for auditing the information, the actuary should verify its reasonableness both directly and against other available information, such as prior years\u2019 data and reported benefit payments. If the actuary is not satisfied as to the reasonableness of the information, further inquiry should be made until the actuary is so satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Finally, the Board relied upon ASOP No. 23, pertaining to data quality:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">In many situations, the actuary is provided with other information relevant to the appropriate use of data such as contract provisions, plan documents and reinsurance treaties. The validity and comprehensiveness [as contrasted to clarity] of such information are the responsibility of those who supply such information. The actuary may rely on such information supplied by another, unless it is or becomes apparent to the actuary during the time of the assignment that the information contains material errors or is otherwise unreliable....A review of data may not always reveal existing defects. Nevertheless, whether the actuary prepared the data or received the data from others, the actuary should review the data for reasonableness and consistency....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">We agree with the Board that Milliman breached the articulated standards of care by failing to verify the reasonableness of the information provided regarding the code through inquiry of the System, as early as 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Milliman also advances two arguments regarding the relationship of the System and the State, in order to limit its exposure in the present case. Milliman initially contends that the System and the State are the same entity, such that any award of damages \u201cmust reflect that the State always retained the use and benefit of contributions not made to the System.\u201d The State, however, was not a party before us, nor before the Board, which noted the absence of the State as a party. In an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>analogous scenario, in <em>Hashmi v. Bennett, </em>416 Md. 707, 7 A.3d 1059 (2010), we precluded a physician who had been adjudicated as negligent from seeking contribution from three alleged \u201cjoint tortfeasors\u201d who were not joined as parties in the original action, because the latter did not have an opportunity to participate in the primary case. In the present case, we similarly cannot countenance Milliman\u2019s assertion of \u201coffset\u201d against the State, for the retention of \u201cthe use and benefit of contributions not made to the System,\u201d because the State was not joined as a party in the proceeding before the Board.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Alternatively, Milliman argues that if the State and the System are regarded as distinct bodies, then the System has failed to demonstrate damages, because the State is obligated to \u201cpay the accrued unfunded liability relating to the coding issue over a period of years.\u201d Essentially, Milliman asserts that taxpayers are obligated to fund the retirement systems, so that despite the actuary\u2019s repeated errors, outstanding pension liabilities will be funded.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">We agree with the Board\u2019s assessment that the System and the State are certainly interrelated, because, inter alia, the State serves as guarantor of System pension liabilities, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">(a) <em>Obligations of the </em>State.\u2014The following are obligations of the State:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">(1) the payment of all allowances and other benefits payable under this Division II;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">(2) the creation and maintenance of reserves in the accumulation funds of the several systems;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">(3) the crediting of regular interest to the annuity savings funds of the several systems; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">(4) the payment of the expenses for administration and operation of the several systems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Section 21-302 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article. As further emphasized by the Board, however, funds held by the System are wholly distinct from other State funds. Because we have never had occasion to consider the identity of the System and the State, we again find succor in decisions from other jurisdictions which have faced analogous scenarios.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">In <em>Day v. New Hampshire Retirement System, </em>138 N.H. 120, 635 A.2d 493 (1993), Day was diagnosed as having \u201cwork-related tendinitis in both wrists\u201d while working as a toll attendant for the Department of Transportation. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Day received workers\u2019 compensation benefits, she was denied \u201caccidental disability retirement benefits\u201d from the retirement system. <em>Id. </em>at 494. Day petitioned for a hearing and the retirement board again denied her benefits, reasoning that she had failed to demonstrate that her injury was work-related and that she was permanently incapacitated from performing her duties. When Day sought judicial review in the trial court, the trial judge determined that the retirement system and the department of labor were in \u201cprivity,\u201d so that the retirement system was collaterally estopped from relitigating the issues that had already been determined in the workers\u2019 compensation proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 494-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">On appeal, the retirement system asserted that it was not in privity with Day\u2019s employer, the Department of Transportation, and the New Hampshire Supreme Court agreed, reversing the judgment of the trial court. In so doing, the court held that \u201cbecause of the distinct identity, constituency and interests of the retirement system, it is not in privity with executive agencies of the State, including the [Department of [Transportation,\u201d noting salient features of the retirement system, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">First, the statute makes clear that the retirement system is a qualified pension trust within the meaning of the United States Internal Revenue Code, and as such holds all funds in trust for its members. The retirement system is administered by a thirteen-member board, including two teachers, two permanent police officers, two permanent firefighters, and two employees. Membership is not limited to employees of the State, but also may include employees of counties, cities, towns, school districts, school administrative units, and other political subdivisions. The retirement system is a contributory one to which both employers and employees are required to contribute. The contribution rate for employees is currently fixed by statute, but the employer contribution rate is periodically adjusted by the board in response to biennial actuary reports on the assets and liabilities of the fund. The state treasurer has historically been the custodian of retirement system funds, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>board retains the power to appoint whomever it chooses to hold that position. Even though the state treasurer may serve as custodian, the funds are not part of the State\u2019s general treasury and may only be used for providing retirement benefits. The board has the power to invest the funds in accordance with the limitations placed upon any domestic life insurance company, and may charge the fund for the advice of investment advisors and actuaries whom it is empowered to employ. The board may always engage legal counsel for investment, federal, and tax matters and, with the approval of the attorney general, may engage counsel for all other matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><em>Day, </em>635 A.2d at 496-97 (citations omitted). The court further emphasized that because the retirement system is a contributory one, the impact of disbursements may be felt by all participating employers and employees, so that even if the State\u2019s interests were well represented in the workers\u2019 compensation proceedings, \u201cthe same cannot be said of the interests of the members of the retirement system, nor of the many contributing employers other than the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Similarly in <em>Traub v. Board of Retirement of the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association, </em>34 Cal.3d 793, 195 Cal.Rptr. 681, 670 P.2d 335 (1983), a probation officer employed by Los Angeles County sought a service-connected disability pension, claiming psychiatric disability. The Retirement Board determined that the probation officer was disabled, but granted only the lesser retirement allowance for \u201cdisability that is not service-connected,\u201d and a referee affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. <em>Id., </em>195 CaLRptr. 681, 670 P.2d at 337. Thereafter, the probation officer sought judicial review in the trial court, which also affirmed the Board\u2019s decision, reasoning that the officer\u2019s \u201cpsychiatric condition\u201d arose out of his wrongful termination, \u201cnot from the job activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the probation officer argued that \u201cthe required connection between disability and employment was conclusively established, under res judicata principles, by a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board,\u201d which awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>him benefits for \u201cinjury to his emotional state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of California rejected that argument, because \u201cthe requisite privity between the county, against which the award was made, and the county Retirement Board, appear[ed] to be lacking.\u201d <em>Id., </em>195 Cal.Rptr. 681, 670 P.2d at 338. The court reasoned that a Retirement Board does not act as an agent for the county, but as administrator of the county retirement system, \u201can independent entity established pursuant to [county law].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court also emphasized that funding for the system comes from both governmental employers and from employees, so that any adjudication of a claim for benefits \u201cmay have economic impact upon the membership of the association,\u201d as well as upon the county. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">As in <em>Day </em>and <em>Traub, </em>the Board in the present case recognized that the System and the State are distinct entities, so that the State\u2019s General Fund is not just a pot in which the System may dip:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">MSRPS funds are unique in several ways. All of the State\u2019s retirement and pension system funds are assets held in trust as governmental plans under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401(a) and 414(d), which confer tax benefits under IRC \u00a7 \u00a7 414(h)(2) and 501(a) to such qualifying funds held not on behalf of the State but instead, on behalf of the participating members and their beneficiaries. MSRPS funds are held not for public use as other special funds are held to be used to build or acquire such public amenities as roads or newly purchased park property, for example. MSRPS holds its funds strictly in a fiduciary capacity to be paid to private individuals for use as they please, upon the occurrence of a certain future condition, namely employee retirement, presumably as set forth in current law and employment contract provisions establishing binding contractual obligations. Legislative encumbrance of vested retirement benefits or those promised to become vested at a future time certain, could well be subject to effective court challenge and reversed as retroactive impairment of contract. This Board does not reach such a conclusion today, but only notes that assets held by MSRPS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>are not assets of the State in the ordinary meaning of State assets. Instead, they are uniquely held by MSRPS in fiduciary trust on behalf of others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Thus, we agree with the Board that the State and the System are distinct entities for the purpose of calculating damages as both lost contributions and lost interest on those contributions due the System as a result of Milliman\u2019s contractual breaches.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Finally, Milliman argues that the System was eontributorily negligent in providing a \u201cconfusing\u201d definition of the \u201c00\u201d code. Initially, Milliman asserts that the Board\u2019s finding that the System accurately reflected \u201cthe meaning of its codes as a part of its data dictionary\u201d was not supported by substantial evidence. The System presented testimony by Brent Mowery, a pension actuary employed by the Hay Group, regarding Milliman\u2019s obligation to carefully review the System\u2019s data and correct any misunderstandings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">[Mr. Mowery]: I\u2019d like to share something that I think is relevant from my early days as an actuarial student back in the time frame of 1975 to 1982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">I remember guidance from the senior actuaries that I worked for saying we can\u2019t let the client fool us with respect to their data. We need to be able to detect if there\u2019s a problem with their data, but we don\u2019t have time to go through and read every record for the 10,000 lives that they\u2019ve submitted. Your challenge, Mowery, is to figure out if this data makes sense. Can we buy it and run with it \u2019cause we\u2019re going to waste a whole lot of time if there\u2019s a problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>So I just share that because, you know, reliance on the client to give clean data\u2014and it was a struggle, a balancing act, because clients wanted inexpensive valuations. They wanted you to take their data and run with it. No questions asked. That was the way to get the cheapest valuation. That\u2019s a dangerous thing for an actuary to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">[Counsel]: You were aware that Milliman in this appeal says that it failed to value these liabilities because it misunderstood the Agency\u2019s coding systems. Are you aware of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">[Mr. Mowery]: Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">[Counsel]: And in your opinion, does any misunderstanding on Milliman\u2019s part of the Agency\u2019s coding system excuse it\u2019s failure to meet this professional responsibility?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">[Mr. Mowery]: No, it does not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">[Counsel]: And why is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-10\">[Mr. Mowery]: That\u2019s an aspect of an actuarial valuation that a pension actuary needs to get right, cannot be misled. It\u2019s too important. And in my experience and what I believe reasonable actuaries in 1982 would say is by all means, you\u2019ve got to properly capture the normal form of payment applicable to a pension system in performing your valuation, and you can\u2019t be misled. You\u2019ve got to overcome any kind of temptations to be taken down the wrong path and get it right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-11\">[Counsel]: If the actuary is confused about data relating to the normal form of payment, in your view, what would be expected of a reasonable professional actuary in that circumstance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-12\">[Mr. Mowery]: To seek the truth and make sure you\u2019re confident that you found it. And, you know, actuaries have alternatives as to how they get to the facts. Probably the most reliable way is to go to the legal plan document or legal section of the Code that would spell this out. Seek something that is, you know, in writing and can\u2019t be misinterpreted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Alternative ways to seek this information would be talk to the client, try to get clarification directly from your client. An alternative in this instance would have been for the Milliman actuary to talk with the [previous actuary] who handled the valuation in the preceding year and see what the [previous actuary] has to say. But there are multiple ways to get to the determination of the normal form of payment that applies and a way has to be found to get to the correct answer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Milliman also offered evidence regarding its allegation that the System was contributorily negligent, in the form of testimony by Dr. Thomas Delutis, a consultant in the area of \u201cbusiness process improvement\u201d and \u201ccomputing solutions,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfO\">[Counsel]: Have you concluded to a reasonable degree of professional certainty\u2014have you reached a conclusion to a reasonable degree of professional certainty as to whether the Agency exercised reasonable care in documenting and communicating the meaning of the 00 code?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">[Dr. Delutis]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">[Counsel]: And what is your opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">[Dr. Delutis]: That they did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">[Board Member]: Dr. Delutis, what should they have done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6T\">[Dr. Delutis]: All that this says\u2014if you provide this information, 00 through 05, to a computer programer or to anybody else, it is 00 through 05. There is nothing that says what 00, how it ties back to the election that a retiree has. It\u2019s just 00 through 05. That\u2019s all it says. Therefore, something else, especially in programming, something else had to be known and provided to the programmer to take that code, and to do something with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">Now, if you look at what\u2019s done here, says ah, 00 has different meanings based on which system you\u2019re in. So it means one thing for one system; something else for another system. So not only did you have to know the code value, the value that was in there, but also the system that it was being applied to. And oh, by the way, you also have to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>know, for certain systems, if he\u2019s married or not, or she is married or not. So there was another set of criteria.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">All that needed to be explained in some document someplace for a programmer to take that in there and, essentially, use it to calculate whatever benefit payment stream was being calculated. So somehow on the master tape, there was a program someplace that had, in addition to those values, 0006, some other additional information that it used. Remember, the program is like a beautiful child. It does exactly what you tell it to do. So somebody had to tell how to use and interpret those data values in order to come up with a payment stream. That was not sufficient. That documentation didn\u2019t do the job.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The Board credited the testimony of Mr. Mowery, an actuary versed in the pension arena, rather than that of Dr. Delutis, who was not an actuary, regarding whether the data provided by the System was sufficient. Clearly there was substantial evidence upon which the Board relied to support its finding that the System was not contributorily negligent in providing the code to Milliman, given Milliman\u2019s professional obligation to review and interpret the data.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In asserting that the System was contributorily negligent as a matter of law, Milliman principally relies upon <em>Wegad v. Howard Street Jewelers, Inc., </em>326 Md. 409, 605 A.2d 123 (1992), in which the jewelry store was seeking damages against an accountant for failing to detect the embezzlement of funds by a store employee. The jewelry store sought a specific jury instruction indicating that a client \u201ccan rely on the accountant\u2019s knowledge and skill\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is not contributory negligence for a client to follow an accountant\u2019s instructions, or rely on his advice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412, 605 A.2d at 125. We disagreed and reasoned that the jewelry store owners were uniquely situated to uncover the criminal actions of their employee, such that the \u201cjury could have found that the extent of the [owner\u2019s] reliance on [the accountant] was not reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422, 605 A.2d at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>Wegad </em>is wholly distinguishable, because unlike the jewelry store owners who were uniquely situated to uncover their employee\u2019s embezzling, Milliman, rather than the System, was the entity that was in a better position to detect and correct the coding error. The Board found that Milliman should have detected the coding error when it compared its 1982 calculations with the previous year\u2019s performed by another actuary and noted that \u201calthough the number of State Police retirees increased from 288 to 339 or 341, their total retirement liability decreased from $67 million to $65 million.\u201d Similarly, as the Board noted, Milliman should have discovered the error when the actuary \u201cperformed its first valuation for DNR police, a system established July 1,1990, but instead, Milliman merely duplicated its earlier coding error.\u201d Unlike the jewelry store owners in Wegad, Milliman had a professional obligation to interpret the data provided by the System.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">More apt to our analysis is <em>Hill v. Wilson, </em>134 Md.App. 472, 760 A.2d 294 (2000), in which our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals considered whether a patient was negligent in his claim against a physician, for the physician\u2019s alleged failure to properly diagnose and treat a serious infection. The physician contended that the patient was contributory negligent, because the patient was directed to return for treatment if his condition worsened and had failed to do so. The intermediate appellate court held that the trial judge did not err in denying the physician\u2019s motion for summary judgment, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>physician failed to demonstrate \u201csome prominent and decisive act [by the patient] which directly contributed to the accident and which was of such a character as to leave no room for difference of opinion thereon by reasonable minds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492, 760 A.2d at 305, quoting <em>Campbell v. Montgomery County Bd. of Educ., </em>73 Md.App. 54, 64, 533 A.2d 9, 14 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">In the present case, although the Board noted that the System may have employed greater clarity in defining the various codes, the Board determined that the System provided ample explanation of the \u201c00\u201d code involving the three affected retirement systems when it provided to Milliman \u201cits written Annual Valuation Record,\u201d as well as \u201cemployee brochures describing retirement payment provisions.\u201d To the extent that the coding may have been confusing, Milliman bore an express duty, as the Board opined, to solicit \u201cfurther clarifying information until it accurately understood the information provided to it by the client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Our final task is to consider the System\u2019s certiorari question, namely whether the Circuit Court erred in reducing the Board\u2019s damage award for lost contributions in the amount of $34,200,000. In an oral opinion, the Circuit Court determined that the System failed to demonstrate that the $34,200,000 in lost contributions \u201cno longer exist[s]\u201d so that the Legislature could not fund the losses sustained by the System as a result of Milliman\u2019s breach. Because the State was not a party to the proceeding before the Board, or for that matter, before the court, whether any damage award by Milliman should be offset by an amount retained by the State was not properly before the Circuit Court. <em>See Hashmi, </em>416 Md. at 707, 7 A.3d at 1059. Therefore, the Circuit Court erred in reducing the Board\u2019s award of damages to the System by $34,200,000 in lost contributions. As a result, we shall vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court and direct that the Board\u2019s decision be affirmed in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>DECISION OF THE STATE BOARD OF CONTRACT APPEALS.

The case does not, though, embrace a unitary creditor doctrine, as the federal courts have done, but in the language cited, merely recognizes that the Retirement System and the Comptroller are agencies under the State\u2019s control, and that the statute at issue permitted garnishment of state retirement funds by the Comptroller. Where the unitary creditor doctrine has been embraced, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>it has been in explicit terms: \"[T]he United States is treated as a unitary creditor, and agencies of the United States government ... may set off debts owed by one agency against claims that another agency has against a single debtor.\u201d <em>Turner v.

This argument is based upon an assumption that the State is presently obligated to compensate the affected systems for losses sustained as a result of Milliman\u2019s actuarial errors, which we will not consider because the State is not a party before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b200-5\">.

The present case is wholly distinguishable, because as the Board opined, Milliman had numerous opportunities to detect and correct the coding error and also had a professional obligation to review and interpret the data provided by the System.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b202-4\">HARRELL, J., dissenting, in which MURPHY and ADKINS, JJ., join.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The Maryland Code requires the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System (\u201cthe System\u201d) to employ the services of an actuary to \u201cgive technical advice ... on the operation of the funds,\u201d among other duties.

The State bases these contributions on the actuary\u2019s estimates.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In the present case, the actuary hired by the System, Milliman, Inc. (\u201cMilliman\u201d), committed a long-running mathematical error that caused a contribution shortfall of $34 million. In addition to this shortfall, the System alleges (and the Board of Contract Appeals\u2019s and the Majority\u2019s opinions agree) that the total damages should include an additional $39 million, representing the interest the System would have reaped through investment of the contribution shortfall. That total\u2014$73 million\u2014is not a proper or accurate calculation of damages as a matter of law, as I see it. Although I grant that the System is a \u201cspecial\u201d appendage of State government, vested with a somewhat unique degree of independence, for purposes of calculating damages here (if not more), there is no legally- or logically-sound reason to treat the System and the State as separate entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Because the System and Milliman did not specify how damages should be calculated in the instance of a breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the contract, we should put the parties in the position they would have been but for the breach. To do so, we should not blind ourselves to the reality that the State and the System are part of a single government and that, together, they did not suffer a contributory loss, as the State continued to collect and enjoy the same amount of revenue, irrespective of Milliman\u2019s error. The fact that the System was unable to invest the $34 million simply leaves open the possibility of limited damages\u2014the difference in the rate of investment return attributable to the two governmental units. According to Milliman, that amounts to $24.7 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Before this Court, Milliman argues that any damages calculation should take into account that the State and the System are one entity, even though the State, as such, was not a named party to this litigation. The facts of the present case indicate that the State did not change its behavior, save for retaining the $34 million in other areas of the government and not the System. Stated another way, the State collected the same amount of revenue, but simply used the money in other contexts, outside the retirement system. Thus, Milliman posits that there must be more limited damages than was awarded by the Board of Contract Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">A.

Although the Legislature created an uncompensated Board of Trustees to run much of the System, it retained significant managerial oversight and discretion. Maryland State Retirement and Pension System, Comprehensive Annual Financial Report 24 (2010), http://www.sra.state.md.us/Agency/Downloads/CAFR/CAFR-2010.pdf (\u201cThe System is fiscally dependent on the State by virtue of the legislative and executive controls exercised with respect to its operations, policies, and administrative budget.\u201d).

To that end, the Governor and the Legislature require the Board to submit an annual budget report, \u00a7 21-109, which they consult discretionarity in their preparation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>State Budget.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, while the Board is empowered to hire an actuary, like Milliman, the General Assembly reserved the power to hire its own \u201cLegislative Auditor\u201d to \u201cconduct an annual or biennial fiscal and compliance audit of the [System\u2019s] accounts and transactions....\u201d \u00a7 21-127.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The State\u2019s paternal role with regard to the System does not end there. The General Assembly designated the State Treasurer, not the Board of Trustees, \u201cfa]s the custodian of ... the accumulation, annuity savings, and expense funds of the several systems ... and the assets of the Board of Trustees.\u201d Payments from these funds must follow regulations formulated by the Board, but approved ultimately by the State Treasurer. \u00a7 21-124(a)(2). The Legislature also entrusted the State Treasurer with the job of physically \u201csafeguarding]\u201d the System\u2019s assets. \u00a7 21-124(b). The State discloses these assets in its own financial statements. <em>See </em>Comprehensive Annual Financial Report at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Such oversight and reservation of authority is understandable, given that the General Assembly\u2014rather than the Board of Trustees, employees, or any other group(s)\u2014is responsible for the welfare of the System. The State pays into the System not only as an \u201cemployer,\u201d but also as the only guarantor of risk and loss. Indeed, as a last resort, the statute requires the State to \u201cpay to the accumulation fund ... at least an amount that when combined with the amount in the accumulation fund ... is sufficient to provide the allowances and other benefits payable out of the fund .... \u201d \u00a7 21-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>302(c). The System does not have a separate power to raise funds, outside of investing profitability the State\u2019s- and employees\u2019 contributions. \u00a7 21-108(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">This scheme reveals that the System is merely an extension of the State (i.e., part of a single government), not simply because it was created by the Legislature, but because of the close, ongoing, and managerial presence of the State in the activities of the System. To refer to the System at large is to refer to the State, at least for the purpose of calculating damages. <em>Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association v. Towers, Perrin, Forster &amp; Crosby, </em>2002 WL 32919576, at *15, 2002 U.S. Dist.

The Extent of the System\u2019s Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Any measure of damages resulting from a contractual breach must be based on the facts at hand and the realities of the parties\u2019 situations. In the present case, Milliman misstated the amount that the State should provide to the System under statutory contribution formulae. As a result, the State did not contribute an extra $34 million, spread out over twenty-two years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For purposes of context, those contributions would be $1.5 million per year if spread out evenly. In response to Milliman\u2019s faulty underestimation, the State did not seem to change accordingly its revenue-collection practices. This is not surprising, considering that the State, in the same timespan, contributed many billions of dollars\u2014$1.3 <em>billion </em>in fiscal year 2010 alone. Such a minuscule annual amount of \u201cmissing\u201d contributions did not affect the System\u2019s target funding goal and, therefore, did not alter the State\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Although an appendage of the State, i.e., the System, did not possess for its immediate use the $34 million, the State at large did. The true impact of the calculation error was that the State, and not the System, retained and invested (or applied) the $34 million elsewhere. Thus, proper damages would be the difference in the investment return only.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The story of damages would be written differently, of course, if the error had caused the employee-members not to make $34 million worth of contributions. In that instance, no one would enjoy the use of the $34 million\u2014that is to say, the State\u2019s financial statements would be missing $34 million. That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">When calculating damages flowing from a contractual breach (absent a contractual agreement governing the calculation of damages in the event of breach), courts endeavor to put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the parties in the position that they would have been but for the breach. <em>St. Paul at Chase Corp. v. Manufacturers Life Ins. Co., </em>262 Md. 192, 250, 278 A.2d 12, 40 (1971) (\u201cThe Court should endeavor to place the injured person, so far as possible, by monetary award, in the position he would have been if the contract had been properly performed.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). As this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">The damages which a plaintiff is entitled to recover for a breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered as either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract as the probable result of a breach of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-5\"><em>St. Paul at Chase Corp., </em>262 Md. at 240, 278 A.2d at 35 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To do so, we must judge not what the non-breaching party wants to recover, but what he/she/it should recover in light of the facts at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In the present case, the parties did not establish in their contract how damages would be calculated in the event of a breach. As such, we must determine how to make the non-breaching party whole, in light of what \u201cmay reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given that the State, as a single government, was not deprived of the use of the $34 million, the proper damages amount\u2014i.e., the amount needed to fulfill the State\u2019s expectations\u2014is the difference in the investment return. Such a calculation has the added benefit of approximating what the parties would have expected reasonably. Milliman was being paid $100,000 a year for its actuarial services and would not have expected reasonably to pay for damages, totaling almost $100 million, for damages not suffered actually as a result of its actions. If the State/System thought a breach should lead to a windfall, whereby the actuary would match sums already in the State coffers, then it should have specified as much in the contract; it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>II.

The Majority finds supportive in this regard a medical malpractice case in which, according to the Majority opinion, \u201cwe precluded a physician who had been adjudicated as negligent from seeking contribution from the three alleged \u2018joint tortfeasors\u2019 who were not joined as parties in the original action, because the [three tortfeasors] did not have an opportunity to participate in the primary case.\u201d Majority op. at 163, 25 A.3d at 1007 (analyzing <em>Hashmi v. Bennett, </em>416 Md. 707, 7 A.3d 1059 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The instructive value of <em>Hashmi </em>is far from evident. Here, we confront a breach of contract, involving a government claim against a private contractor. <em>Hashmi </em>was also a medical malpractice case, involving only private and distinct (legally and biologically) parties. Moreover, in <em>Hashmi, </em>we held that a tortfeasor-physician could not seek contribution from other alleged tortfeasors primarily because the hospital release protected them. <em>See Hashmi, </em>416 Md. at 724-25, 7 A.3d at 1069-70. We then stated in the alternative (and, thus, arguably in dicta) that a post-trial \u201cjudicial determination\u201d of contribution would deprive the alleged tortfeasors of \u201cnotice or ... an opportunity to defend,\u201d in violation of the Maryland Rules. <em>Hashmi, </em>416 Md. at 725, 7 A.3d at 1070 (\u201cEven if we were to determine that the ... [r]elease was ambiguous, we would not countenance the separate, post-trial proceeding Dr. Hashmi proposes [of the other alleged tortfeasors]....\u201d); <em>Hashmi, </em>416 Md. at 729, 7 A.3d at 1072 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In the present case, Milliman is not trying to reduce possible damages by seeking contribution from the State as a joint tortfeasor; it is arguing that there are little to no damages in the first instance, given the fact that the non-breaching party did not suffer, in fact, an actual loss. Indeed, Milliman is asking this Court (fairly in my estimation) and the Board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Contract Appeals not to blind itself to certain facts when determining the proper measure of damages to make a non-breaching party whole. Ordinarily, I would rebuff contentions that the State lacked notice and an opportunity to defend itself, but doing so credits <em>Hashmi </em>with an unjustifiable amount of applicability\u2014comparing the present case to <em>Hash-mi </em>is like forcing a round peg into a square hole. Rather, I will address the premise of the Majority opinion\u2019s damages calculation\u2014that the State and the System are not part of a single entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">B. The State and the System Are Not One Legal Entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Acknowledging that \u201cwe have never had occasion to consider the identity of the System and the State,\u201d the Majority opinion considers in depth two foreign <em>cases\u2014Day v. New Hampshire Retirement System, </em>138 N.H. 120, 635 A.2d 493 (1993), and <em>Traub v. Board of Retirement of the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association, </em>34 Cal.3d 793, 195 Cal.Rptr. 681, 670 P.2d 335 (1983). Both cases involve a government employee who was awarded, by an administrative adjudication, workers\u2019 compensation benefits and then attempted to use that decision to estop collaterally the retirement system from denying similar benefits. <em>Day, </em>635 A.2d at 494; <em>Traub, </em>195 Cal.Rptr. 681, 670 P.2d at 337. In each case, the respective court concluded that, <em>for purposes of collateral estoppel, </em>the workers\u2019 compensation board and the retirement system were not \u201cin privity.\u201d <em>Day, </em>635 A.2d at 497; <em>Traub, </em>195 Cal.Rptr. 681, 670 P.2d at 338. They noted that any payout to the government employee would come not just from the State, but also the employees who contributed to the retirement system. <em>Day, </em>635 A.2d at 497; 670 P.2d at 338. Those employees were not represented in the initial workers\u2019 compensation decision. <em>See Day, </em>635 A.2d at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The present case does not involve the sometimes perplexing world of collateral estoppel. Rather, we confront the issue of contractual damages flowing to the State/System (including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>employees, who contributed voluntarily to a State-created and -managed fund). We need not concern ourselves with \u201cprivity\u201d; we need only determine (as we did supra) that the State and System are one entity for purposes of evaluating the true financial injury in this case. <em>See A.S. Abell Pub. Co., </em>297 Md. at 35, 464 A.2d at 1072. Nevertheless, even if the \u201coneness\u201d of the State and System\u2014for purposes of calculating damages\u2014depends on a finding of privity, such evidence exists in the record. The State, System, and employees all possessed the same interest in the $34 million. The State is obliged to make up any shortfalls in the System; the System has a duty to govern toward fiscal solvency; and, the employees want to secure their retirement future.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In short, their interests are aligned sufficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>C. Maryland Has Not Adopted the \u201cUnitary Creditor\u201d Doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Milliman argues that the State and the System are one legal entity and that, as a result, it \u201cshould be allowed to recoup or <em>offset </em>the benefit of the funds retained by the State against any damages claimed by the System....\u201d (Emphasis added.) As part of this claim, Milliman refers to the federal \u201cunitary creditor\u201d doctrine, a principle which allows federal agencies to \u201cset off debts owed by one agency against claims that another has against a single debtor.\u201d <em>Turner v. Small Bus. Admin., </em>84 F.3d 1294, 1296 (10th Cir.1996) (en banc). A classic illustration is where Agency 1 owes money to a person, but that person owes money simultaneously to Agency 2. The agencies and individual debtor are permitted to setoff those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Transposed to the present context, such a claim fits awkwardly, as we are not dealing with a company that simply owes money to the government, whether we define that government as the State or the System. I believe that the \u201cset-off\u2019 claim may be better understood under ordinary contract law and damages canons, as explained <em>swpra. </em>Nonetheless, the argument may be made that, should the System receive a judgment for all contributions and investment interest, Milliman would be able to assert a claim against the State. Thus, Milliman should be able to skip a step and simply have its own claim heard in the same action.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Indeed, in a case remarkably similar to the one at bar, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California allowed an actuary who committed mathematical errors, which caused a county government to underpay its retirement system, to argue for such a setoff. <em>Towers, Perrin, Forster &amp; Crosby, </em>2002 WL 32919576, at *9, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27916, at *29. The actuary, in particular, claimed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">[A]ny recovery by [the retirement system] must be reduced based on the amounts that allegedly should have been contributed by the [c]ounty but were not, because [the retirement system] and the [c]ounty are effectively a \u201cclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>system.\u201d [The actuary] contends that it is ... entitled to offset ... any funds, including any earnings on such funds, the [cjounty did not contribute ... and thus retained for other uses____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><em>Towers, Perrin, Forster &amp; Crosby, </em>2002 WL 32919576, at *1, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27916, at *3. \u201cEven in the absence of the precise articulation of the claim to be setoff against [the one at hand],\u201d the court held that a setoff defense is appropriate in light of the ultimate goal of \u201celiminatf ing] a superfluous exchange of money between the parties.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">To so conclude, the court needed to find sufficient mutuality between the actuary and the government\u2014enter the unitary creditor doctrine. This reliance, the Majority opinion concludes, renders the decision whofly-inapplicable to the present case, as \u201cwe have not ascribed\u201d to that doctrine. Majority op. at 163, 25 A.3d at 1008 n. 10.1 disagree respectfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In <em>Lomax v. Comptroller of Treasury, </em>323 Md. 419, 420, 593 A.2d 1099, 1100 (1991), we considered a case where a state school teacher, Mary Lomax, received retirement benefits from the System. The Comptroller of the Treasury (\u201cComptroller\u201d) obtained a judgment and lien against Lomax for unpaid income tax. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn an attempt to satisfy this judgment against Lomax, the Comptroller filed with the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County a request for writ of garnishment to be served on the ... System[ ]....\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that the State could effectuate such an inter-governmental maneuver, explaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">In the instant case, the Retirement System and the Comptroller are both agencies under the control of the same sovereign, the State. Maryland Code (1957, 1988 Repl.Vol., 1990 Cum.Supp.), Art. 73B, \u00a7 16 provides that payment of all pensions, as well as all expenses for the administration and operation of the state retirement systems are obligations of the State. The [administrative] inconveniences enumerated in <em>City of Baltimore [v. Comptroller, </em>292 Md. 293, 439 A.2d 1095 (1982) ] and <em>Hughes [v. Svboda, </em>168 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>440, 178 A. 108 (1935), dealing with a local government paying benefits to the State rather than local-government employees] clearly do not apply here since the Comptroller and the Retirement System work within the same governmental unit and both are even represented by the same attorney, the Attorney General. The public affairs of the State government would in no way be disrupted if these two agencies of the same government were permitted to cooperate in the garnishment of Lomax\u2019s pension benefits. <em>City of Baltimore </em>is clearly inapposite.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">It is a fundamental principle of creditors\u2019 rights that creditors have a right to <em>set-off </em>and may apply moneys owed to debts due. See <em>United States v. Munsey Trust Co., </em>332 U.S. 234, 67 S.Ct. 1599, 91 L.Ed. 2022 (1947): \u201cThe government has the same right \u2018which belongs to every creditor, to apply the unappropriated moneys of his debtor, in his hands, in extinguishment of the debts due to him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239, 67 S.Ct. at 1602, 91 L.Ed. at 2027 (quoting <em>Gratiot v. United States, </em>40 U.S. (15 Peters) 336, 370, 10 L.Ed. 759, 771 (1841)). We doubt that the Legislature intended to extinguish the State\u2019s right to accomplish through the legal process of garnishment that which it might be entitled to do by a self-help mechanism such as set-off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\"><em>Lomax, </em>323 Md. at 426-27, 593 A.2d 1099 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">This is the most classic form of the unitary creditor doctrine, where one agency (i.e., the System) owes money to a debtor, but that debtor owes money to another agency (i.e., the Comptroller). Indeed, these were similar to the facts of the case in which the U.S. Supreme Court adopted originally the unitary creditor <em>doctrine\u2014Cherry Cotton Mills v. United States, </em>327 U.S. 536, 105 Ct.Cl. 824, 66 S.Ct. 729, 90 L.Ed. 835 (1946). <em>See Turner, </em>84 F.3d at 1296-97 (\u201c[T]he Court\u2019s language [in <em>Cherry Cotton Mills </em>] clearly indicates that agencies of the United States government are deemed a unitary creditor.... \u201d); <em>Turner, </em>84 F.3d at 1296 (\u201c[I]n <em>Cherry Cotton Mills ... </em>the Supreme Court made clear that the United States has a right to effect interagency setoffs.\u201d).

When a party claims a loss, it must demonstrate the reality of that loss\u2014the State asks for another $84 million, despite previously collecting and enjoying the same. Moreover, I fail to see how the set-off and unitary creditor principles\u2014if necessary to bring into focus the full damages issue\u2014are not applicable to the present case. I harbor also some hesitation regarding our eagerness to declare agencies, especially those that depend on State Government funds, as separate and unique entities, approximating corporate subsidiaries. <em>But see Maryland Transportation Authority v. Maryland Transportation Authority Police Lodge </em># <em>34 of the Fraternal Order of Police, </em>420 Md. 141, 21 A.3d 1098 (2011) (holding that the Maryland Transportation Authority did not have total autonomy such that it could bargain collectively, even though the Legislature delegated to it a great deal of authority, including the ability to raise revenues through tolls).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In my opinion, we should direct a remand to the Board of Contract Appeals with instructions to recalculate damages to reflect the fact that the State and the System are a single entity. Practically speaking, the Board of Contract Appeals should determine and then limit damages to the difference between what the State earned, in fact, and what the System would have earned, with respect to a return on investment of the $34 million in \u201cmissing\u201d contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Judge Murphy and Judge Adkins authorize me to state that they join the views expressed in this dissenting opinion, except that Judge Adkins does not subscribe to footnote 8.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-8\">.
