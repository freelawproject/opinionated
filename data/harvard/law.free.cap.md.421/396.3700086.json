State, </em>418 Md. 397, 15 A.3d 298 (2011), on our own initiative. Before us, the State responds, asserting the following question as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-9\">To the extent preserved, should this Court affirm Green-berg\u2019s convictions either because the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege made the challenged testimony admissible or because any error in the trial court\u2019s waiver rulings was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ace\">Greenberg was indicted and tried before a jury in Montgomery County on five counts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> related to the care of Evelyn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Zucker, to whom Greenberg had been married. After the marriage, on November 26, 2008, but prior to Greenberg\u2019s indictment, in July of 2009, Robert M. McCarthy was appointed as guardian for Ms. Zucker. Thereafter, Mr. McCarthy initiated proceedings seeking to annul Greenberg\u2019s marriage to Ms. Zucker, void a deed prepared by Mr. Hessel that conveyed a tenancy by the entireties interest in Ms. Zucker\u2019s home to Greenberg, invalidate a will (prepared for Ms. Zucker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>and drafted by Mr. Hessel), which would benefit Greenberg, and to remove Greenberg as Ms. Zucker\u2019s healthcare agent. During the annulment hearing, Mr. McCarthy called Green-berg and Mr. Hessel as witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">During the subsequent criminal proceeding against Greenberg, the State sought to call Mr. Hessel as a witness in its case-in-chief. Greenberg\u2019s attorney moved to exclude Mr. Hessel\u2019s testimony on the basis of attorney-client privilege, asserting that Mr. Hessel \u201cwas at one point in 2008 representing both ... Ms. Zucker and Mr. Greenberg\u201d and that there was \u201ccertainly the issue of attorney-client privilege.\u201d Whether this invocation was sufficient to trigger the need for the Circuit Court to conduct an exploration is the first impediment raised by the State,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> based upon our comment in footnote seven of <em>Newman v. State, </em>384 Md. 285, 863 A.2d 321 (2004) that, \u201cthe party seeking the protection of the [attorney-client] privilege bears the burden of establishing its existence,\u201d and that, \u201c[o]nce the privilege is invoked, the trial court should \u2018make a preliminary inquiry and hear testimony relative thereto out of the presence of the jury, looking at the surrounding facts and circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313 n. 7, 863 A.2d at 337 n. 7 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The embodiment of the common law attorney-client privilege is contained in Section 9-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Vol.), which succinctly provides that \u201c[a] person may not be compelled to testify in violation of the attorney-client privilege.\u201d The privilege operates as a \u201crule of evidence [to] preven[t] the disclosure of a confidential communication made by a client to his attorney for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.\u201d <em>Newman, </em>384 Md. at 302, 863 A.2d at 330 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In <em>Newman, </em>we explored the deep historical roots of the attorney-client privilege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">The Supreme Court has recognized the attorney-client privilege as \u201cthe oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">The attorney-client privilege dates back in the common law to the reign of Elizabeth I (1558-1603) and probably originated in the compulsion of witnesses to testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 300-301, 863 A.2d at 330, quoting <em>Upjohn Co. v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S.Ct. 677, 682, 66 L.Ed.2d 584, 591 (1981). Even before Elizabeth I\u2019s reign, the \u201cnotion that the loyalty owed by the lawyer to his client\u201d operated to disable the lawyer as \u201ca witness in his client\u2019s case [was] deep-rooted in Roman law,\u201d a notion which may have greatly influenced English common law. Kenneth S. Broun, McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 87, at 386-87 (6th ed.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">In <em>Newman, </em>we also pointed out that, initially, the attorney-client privilege was a right held solely by the attorney, not the client, as a \u201cpoint of honor.\u201d 384 Md. at 301, 863 A.2d at 330 (\u201cUntil 1776, it was not deemed to be a right of the client but rather was that of the attorney as a point of honor as an element of professional behavior.\u201d). In 1776, however, the ideology underlying the privilege underwent a dramatic shift when the House of Lords compelled an attorney to testify in the Duchess of Kingston\u2019s trial, despite the fact that the attorney raised the point of honor, effectively ending it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">In that year, \u201cthe House of Lords in the Duchess of Kingston\u2019s Trial (20 Howell, State Trials 355, 386 (1776)) ruled that her attorney, whom she had exempted from secrecy, was required to respond to questions about his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>conversations with her some three decades earlier, even though the attorney had demurred, raising the point of honor.\u201d This development ended the use of the \u201cpoint of honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 301, 863 A.2d at 330 (citations omitted). Thereafter, the attorney-client privilege was conceived as one held by the client:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">During the latter half of the eighteenth century another theory evolved which recognized that the client held a privilege which prohibited the disclosure of client secrets by the attorney, rather than simply permitting the attorney to keep \u201cthe client\u2019s confidences as a professional prerogative.\u201d This theory rose to the forefront as the \u201cpoint of honor\u201d receded and soon was in use throughout the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABy\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Indeed, at least as far back as 1862, we have characterized the attorney-client privilege as one protecting confidential communications between a client and his or her lawyer that \u201cshall not be disclosed, unless by the consent of the client for whose protection the rule was established.\u201d <em>Fulton v. Maccracken, </em>18 Md. 528, 543 (1862).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">We have also explained that, though not given \u201cexpress constitutional protection,\u201d the attorney-client privilege is \u201cessential\u201d to the \u201cexercise of constitutional guarantees\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">The attorney-client privilege is basic to a relation of trust and confidence that, though not given express constitutional security, is nonetheless essentially interrelated with the specific constitutional guarantees of the individual\u2019s right to counsel and immunity from self-incrimination....The essential policy of the privilege is grounded in the subjective consideration of the client\u2019s freedom from apprehension in consulting his legal advisor, assured by removing the risk of disclosure by the attorney even at the hands of the law.... [T]he freedom of confidential communication between lawyer and client is [pjerhaps as valuable as the privilege against self-incrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-9\"><em>Harrison v. State, </em>276 Md. 122, 133-34, 345 A.2d 830, 837 (1975) (citations omitted) (internal quotations omitted). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>privilege, however, is not impregnable and must be strictly-construed to protect \u201conly those attorney-client communications pertaining to legal assistance and made with the intention of confidentiality.\u201d <em>Newman, </em>384 Md. at 302, 863 A.2d at 331, quoting <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours v. Forma-Pack, </em>351 Md. 396, 415-16, 718 A.2d 1129, 1138 (1998). A client may waive the privilege, whether intentionally or unintentionally, if the client\u2019s \u201cconduct touches a certain point of disclosure\u201d when \u201cfairness requires\u201d the privilege to cease. <em>Parler &amp; Wobber v. Miles &amp; Stockbridge, </em>359 Md. 671, 692, 756 A.2d 526, 537 (2000); 6 McLain, Maryland Evidence State and Federal \u00a7 503:15, at 63 (West Group, Second ed. 2001) (\u201cWaiver may be effected by the client\u2019s testifying to a significant part of the privileged confidential information.\u201d). The proposition, stated plainly, is that \u201cwhat a client chooses to tell the world, he cannot later prevent his attorney from telling the court.\u201d <em>Agnew v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 614, 651, 446 A.2d 425, 445 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In the case before us, at the outset of trial,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> out of the presence of the jury, Greenberg\u2019s lawyer made a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the testimony of Mr. Hessel, proffering that Mr. Hessel had represented both Greenberg and Ms. Zucker in a legal capacity when the events underlying the instant case took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">[GREENBERG\u2019S COUNSEL]: [0]n the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s witness list is a gentleman whose name is Mark Hessel. Mark Hessel is a lawyer in Montgomery County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">[COURT]: I know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">[GREENBERG\u2019S COUNSEL]: He was at one point in 2008 representing both, I think both Ms. Zucker and Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Greenberg. And I think the State is intending to call [Mr. Hessel] as a witness in their case. He\u2019s on their witness list. And inasmuch as he was Mr. Greenberg\u2019s lawyer, there\u2019s certainly the issue of attorney-client privilege, which only Mr. Greenberg could waive, and he is not choosing to waive that privilege. And so therefore, I\u2019m not certain that the State can in fact call Mr. Hessel as a witness or what they believe he is going to testify to that would be admissible evidence if there\u2019s evidence outside of the privilege that they\u2019re trying to admit.... I\u2019d like to hear what the State thinks is admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">Later during trial, when the State called Mr. Hessel to the witness stand, Greenberg objected, claiming that there had been an attorney-client relationship between Mr. Hessel and Greenberg, and that the \u201cthings that they discussed\u201d or \u201ctalked about\u201d with each other were privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Since our brief reference to invocation of the attorney-client privilege in <em>Newman, </em>we have not had occasion to discuss its quantum nor quality. Few of our sister states also have <em>directly </em>considered the issue of what threshold showing is necessary, although the Supreme Court of Illinois has opined that the privilege is properly invoked, presumptively, if the proponent shows that \u201cthere [was] an attorney-client relationship in which an attorney and client have communicated in a professional capacity.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Decker, </em>153 Ill.2d 298, 180 Ill.Dec. 17, 606 N.E.2d 1094, 1109 (1992). In <em>In re Marriage of Decker, </em>an appeal arising from a child custody and visitation dispute, a mother filed a motion to compel the father\u2019s attorney to \u201cdisclose information concerning [the father\u2019s] whereabouts,\u201d and certain other details. <em>Id. </em>at 1097. The father\u2019s attorney asserted the attorney-client privilege, explaining that, as the father\u2019s attorney, the mother\u2019s motion was \u201cvery broad in its scope\u201d so as to necessitate a violation of the attorney-client privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 1098. The trial judge determined that the attorney-client privilege was not invoked with sufficient specificity, but the appellate court reversed, concluding that \u201cwhen there is an attorney-client relationship in which an attorney and client have communicated in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>professional capacity,\u201d then \u201cthere is a rebuttable presumption that their communication is privileged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1108-1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Various of the federal courts also have considered the attorney-client privilege presumptively invoked upon a showing that an attorney and a client communicated in a professional capacity. In <em>Steiner v. United States, </em>134 F.2d 931 (5th Cir.1943), for example, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit determined that the attorney-client privilege was invoked upon a proffer that a witnesses\u2019s testimony was \u201cbased on [a] statement] made to [the proponent] by [his former lawyer] at a time when the relationship of attorney and client existed\u201d and that the statement was \u201cprivileged and inadmissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">In <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena: Under Seal, </em>415 F.3d 333 (4th Cir.2005), the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit similarly determined the attorney-client privilege was invoked once the proponent showed \u201cthat he is a client or that he affirmatively sought to become a client.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339. In <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena, </em>America Online\u2019s legal team interviewed several of America Online\u2019s employees as a part of an ongoing internal investigation. Shortly thereafter, a grand jury issued a subpoena demanding any \u201cwritten memoranda and other written records reflecting interviews conducted\u201d by the investigating attorneys. <em>Id. </em>at 337. Several of America Online\u2019s employees asserted that information obtained from the interviews were protected by the attorney-client privilege, a claim the district court rejected. The Fourth Circuit agreed, opining that privilege may be invoked only where a \u201cfinding that the [proponent\u2019s] subjective belief\u2019 an attorney-client relationship existed would be \u201cminimally reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339. The employees unsuccessfully invoked the privilege, the court reasoned, because there was no reasonable indicia that they had \u201cever sought personal legal advice\u201d from the investigating attorneys, that the investigating attorneys ever \u201crendered personal legal advice\u201d to the employees, that the investigating attorneys ever \u201ctold the [employees] that they represented them,\u201d or \u201cthat the [employees] asked the [investigating attorneys] to represent them.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>In the case before us, Greenberg\u2019s proffer of the privilege was more than mere speculation that Greenberg was a client of Mr. Hessel. Greenberg\u2019s counsel advised the court that Mr. Hessel was \u201cat one point in 2008 representing\u201d Ms. Zueker and Mr. Greenberg, and that \u201cinasmuch as [Mr. Hessel] was Mr. Greenberg\u2019s lawyer, there\u2019s certainly the issue of attorney-client privilege.\u201d Later in the trial, Green-berg\u2019s counsel again informed the court that Greenberg had been involved in an attorney-client relationship with Mr. Hessel, and that the \u201cthings that they discussed\u201d or \u201ctalked about\u201d with each other were privileged. As a result, the attorney-client privilege was sufficiently invoked to trigger further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Whether what was done to explore the nature and extent of the privilege and any commensurate waiver is the next question. Our opinion in <em>Newman, </em>again in footnote seven, explored what type of inquiry is appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">Once the privilege is invoked, the trial court should \u201cmake a preliminary inquiry and hear testimony relative thereto out of the presence of the jury, looking at the surrounding facts and circumstances.\u201d In this preliminary inquiry, the trial court will decide as a matter of law whether the elements of the privilege are present and if so, whether the communication, absent an exception, is privileged. This threshold question must be determined without requiring the disclosure of the communication at issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 313 n. 7, 863 A.2d at 337 n. 7 (citations omitted). Greenberg has asserted that, once he invoked the privilege, the judge should have inquired, through an evidentiary hearing or through proffers, into the \u201csurrounding facts and circumstances\u201d of Mr. Hessel\u2019s representation of Greenberg, the \u201ccomplete circumstances related to [Greenberg\u2019s] possible waiver of privilege,\u201d and \u201cthe scope of the prosecution\u2019s proposed use of the evidence at trial.\u201d The State has responded that, because the parties\u2019 privilege arguments were made in \u201cbroad strokes,\u201d \u201ctrial tactics,\u201d and not trial error, were to blame for the lack of a more detailed preliminary inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>When the attorney-client privilege was invoked, the judge heard a proffer from the State that \u201c[Greenberg] already testified in a hearing for the annulment procedure annulling the marriage between [Ms. Zucker] and [Greenberg] about the relationship that he had with [Mr. Hessel].\u201d The judge then heard legal argument on waiver and reviewed a transcript of Greenberg\u2019s testimony at the annulment hearing before ruling that Greenberg \u201cwaived the privilege when he testified at a judicial hearing regarding the very matters that he now seeks to stand behind the attorney-client privilege.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The process by which privilege is determined is governed by Maryland Rule 5-104(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which requires a preliminary determination, but <em>not </em>an evidentiary hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">(a) Questions of admissibility generally. Preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness, the existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court, subject to the provisions of section (b). In making its determination, the court may, in the interest of justice, decline to require strict application of the rules of evidence, except those relating to privilege and competency of witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">(b) Relevance conditioned on fact. When the relevance of evidence depends upon the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court shall admit it upon, or subject to, the introduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>of evidence sufficient to support a finding by the trier of fact that the condition has been fulfilled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Maryland Rule 5\u2014104(a)\u2014(b). We have instructed that the \u201cparty seeking the protection of the privilege\u201d ultimately \u201cbears the burden of establishing its existence.\u201d <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours, </em>351 Md. at 415, 718 A.2d at 1138; <em>In re Criminal Investigation 1/242Q, </em>326 Md. 1, 11, 602 A.2d 1220, 1225 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In <em>Harrison, </em>276 Md. at 122, 345 A.2d at 830, we adopted Wigmore\u2019s test for deciphering the existence and scope of an attorney-client privilege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">(1) Where legal advice of [any] kind is sought, (2) from a professional legal adviser in his capacity as such, (3) the communications relating to that purpose, (4) made in confidence, (5) by the client, (6) are at his insistence permanently protected, (7) from disclosure by himself or by the legal adviser, (8) except the protection [may] be waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 135, 345 A.2d at 838, quoting 8 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 2292, at 554 (McNaughton rev. ed. 1961). These essential elements of the attorney-client privilege are the subject of the preliminary inquiry identified in <em>Newma,n </em>about which the trial court must make its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Obviously, an evidentiary hearing is not required under Maryland Rule 5-104, but what appears to be required by courts, at least on the federal level, addressing attorney-client privilege, are findings to satisfy not only the existence, but the non-existence and waiver of the attorney-client privilege. In <em>In re Sealed Case, </em>737 F.2d 94, 97 (D.C.Cir.1984), for example, the General Counsel of a company testified before the grand jury and was asked about certain conversations and \u201chunches\u201d the attorney had, including private conversations with the company president aboard a commercial aircraft. The General Counsel invoked the attorney-client privilege. After conducting a preliminary inquiry, the federal district court ruled that the attorney-client privilege did not exist, based upon the court\u2019s opinion that, \u201cit seemed \u2018rather incongruous\u2019 that confidential information would be discussed in the course of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>commercial flight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, reasoning, in part, that the district court\u2019s finding as to the confidentiality element of attorney-client privilege was \u201cwithout foundation in the record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Further, in <em>United States v. Schwimmer, </em>892 F.2d 237 (2d Cir.1989), the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had occasion to consider the effect of a district court judge\u2019s failure to make findings as to the essential elements of the attorney-client privilege. Once the privilege was invoked, the trial judge reviewed a transcript of the allegedly privileged grand jury testimony, and summarily concluded that the privilege did not apply, stating that any privileged information was \u201cnegligible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245. The Second Circuit remanded for more \u201cdetailed findings,\u201d concluding that \u201cthe record [was] insufficient to support the perfunctory findings of the district court with respect to the privilege issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239. Later, after detailed findings were made by the district court on remand, the appellate court affirmed, reasoning that no \u201cviolative use of privileged information had occurred.\u201d <em>United States v. Schwimmer, </em>924 F.2d 443, 447 (2d Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied Schwimmer v. United States, </em>502 U.S. 810, 112 S.Ct. 55, 116 L.Ed.2d 31 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In the case before us, Greenberg\u2019s counsel proffered that Mr. Hessel\u2019s testimony implicated confidential attorney-client communications and that Greenberg was \u201cnot choosing to waive\u201d his privilege. In response, the State proffered that Mr. Hessel\u2019s testimony involved \u201cacts\u201d and not \u201ccommunications,\u201d and that Greenberg waived the privilege when he and Mr. Hessel testified at the annulment hearing, all of which was reiterated two days into trial. Although the judge did review the transcript of Greenberg\u2019s testimony at the annulment hearing prior to the time that he determined waiver, he did not determine the nature and scope of privileged communication, nor did he explore with specificity what testimony the State sought to solicit from Mr. Hessel, as well as utilize those details to determine the extent of any waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>We do know from the record now what the State sought to elicit from Mr. Hessel, although the information comes only from an opening statement given after waiver of the privilege was determined by the court; the State stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: You will then hear testimony that Roger Greenberg in early December hires a lawyer and asks him, Mark Hessel, to draft a <em>deed </em>that will make Roger Greenberg the recipient of Evelyn Zucker\u2019s house upon her death. And it will also allow him to avoid a transfer <em>tax </em>of $11,000. You\u2019ll hear that Mark Hessel in the early days of December also is hired by Roger Greenberg to drive Roger and Evelyn to various banks to check on the amounts in her <em>bank accounts, </em>to lift various restrictions that would allow him to access her money, and to get debit cards in his name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">You\u2019ll also hear, ladies and gentlemen, that on the day, the very day that she is discovered by adult protective services, the attorney, the same attorney who was hired by Roger Greenberg gets Evelyn Zucker to sign a <em>power of attorney </em>and a document that will allow Roger Greenberg to make medical decisions for [Ms. Zucker].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">These assertions, however, regarding the nature and extent of the communication between Greenberg and Mr. Hessel that the State sought to plumb, were not known to the trial court when it determined waiver and did not come close to being commensurate with what was disclosed by Greenberg at the annulment hearing, nor did Greenberg\u2019s annulment hearing testimony serve as a foundation for the trial testimony of Mr. Hessel, as shown below:__</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">Greenberg Mr. Hessel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">\n<em>Annulment Hearing Trial</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-11\">\n<em>THE DEED</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-12\">Q: [D]id you contact Mr. Hessel first?

Now, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>remember what happened. Okay. We wanted to put the house in both our names.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Q: [W]ere there any other details he gave you at that time about what he wanted to do in terms of the deed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhQ\">A: [IJnitially, I spoke with Mr. Greenberg on the phone and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>then he came to my office. At one of those two times <em>he told me that, that someone wanted to give him her </em>house._</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">\n<em>TAX CONSEQUENCES OF MARRIAGE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">Q: [S]o Mr. Hessel told you it would be about $11,000 in taxes to put your name on the deed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">A: [I]t\u2019s really foggy in my brain, which I\u2019m not going to, yeah, I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-11\">Q: [Did] Mr. Hessel [tell] you [that] if you were married there would be no tax, no transfer tax (unintelligible) your wife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-12\">A: It\u2019s a possibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">Q: [Y]ou told him that if he was not married that there would be $11,000 in taxes, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">A: Not exactly.... I asked him what the value of the property was and he told me, I think, roughly a half a million dollars. And I said that the transferred record agent taxes would be about $11,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-13\">He later told me that they were [married] and showed me the marriage certificate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-14\">I told him that it was $11,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARa\">He said, \u2018Would that still be the case if the two people are married and not unmarried?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes.

I don\u2019t know how to handle these things. He needed to find out everything that was going on and straighten the mess out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">A: Yes....After Roger had given me the deed, he said, \u201cAnd my wife has this other issue that maybe you can help us with.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">He said that her sister had died, that the attorney handling the estate they didn\u2019t trust. They weren\u2019t able to get access to her bank accounts and they were afraid that the attorney was stealing from her.

Generally, married couples will have power of attorney and appointment of healthcare agent for each other.\u201d Appointment of healthcare agent, it\u2019s kind of like a medical power of attorney. And I suggested that would be appropriate for me to draft that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-13\">Q: Did there come a point in time where you did actually draft those documents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-14\">A: Yes. I believe I did it Monday evening or early Tuesday and I brought them with me on Tuesday so that we could execute those documents before we went Citibank in Silver Spring.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">What the trial court had before it with respect to Greenberg\u2019s testimony at the annulment hearing was not sufficient to be able to determine the nature and extent of the attorney-client privilege, nor its waiver. The judge\u2019s premature determination of waiver cannot be affirmed on this sparse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>record and precludes any ability to determine whether any other exception to the privilege existed, such as the crime-fraud exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The State, nevertheless, asserts that we should conclude that any error was harmless. We may declare a trial error harmless only where, on an independent review of the record, we are \u201cable to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>Bellamy v. State, </em>403 Md. 308, 332, 941 A.2d 1107, 1121 (2008), quoting <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976). In the case before us, Mr. Hessel\u2019s testimony was an important part of the State\u2019s introductory statement to the jury and discussed in closing. Mr. Hessel testified not only about the benefit that Greenberg would receive under the newly drafted will, but also the lengths to which Greenberg went to determine the extent of Ms. Zucker\u2019s assets. Mr. Hessel\u2019s testimony coupled with the State\u2019s references to it in opening and closing can in no way be viewed as harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">As a result, due to the error in the determination of the waiver of the attorney-client privilege, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY VACATED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL.

The State initially has questioned whether Greenberg properly preserved the issues of the existence and scope of attorney-client privilege, asserting that Greenberg's counsel \"first broached the attorney-client privilege on the second day of trial.'' Greenberg sufficiently preserved this issue, because he raised the issue of attorney-client privilege at the oulset of trial, stating that \"inasmuch as [Mr. Hessel] was [Greenberg\u2019s] lawyer, there\u2019s certainly the issue of attorney-client privilege, which only Mr. Greenberg could waive, and he is not choosing to waive that privilege,\u201d as well as at the time Mr. Hessel was called. Greenberg\u2019s counsel also requested a continuing objection to the questioning of Mr. Hessel, which the trial judge granted, adding \"I\u2019m satisfied that [Green-berg has] clearly stated the basis\u201d of his \"objection on the record.\u201d Under these circumstances, we believe Greenberg has sufficiently preserved the issues underlying this case for our review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b432-12\">. The State has contended that Greenberg's counsel did not sufficiently \"broach\u201d the issue of attorney-client privilege at the outset of trial. To the contrary, Greenberg\u2019s counsel moved to exclude Mr. Hessel\u2019s testimony at the outset of trial specifying that \"inasmuch as [Mr. Hessel] was Mr. Greenberg's lawyer, there\u2019s certainly the issue of attorney-client privilege, which only Mr. Greenberg could waive, and he is not choosing to waive that privilege.\u201d The docket entry indicates that \"defendant\u2019s oral motion in limine as to the testimony of Mr. Mark [Hessel]\u2014denied. \u2019'</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\">. We adopted Maryland Rule 5-104 in 1993, modeling it substantially upon Federal Rule of Evidence 104(a). <em>Newman, </em>384 Md. at 313 n. 7, 863 A.2d at 337 n. 7. Federal Rule 104 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">(a) Questions of admissibility generally.
