Viglas, 297 U.S. 672, 56 S.Ct. 615, 80 L.Ed. 971, decided by the Supreme Court March 30, 1936), and being further of the opinion that the appellant is not by the judgment estopped from making timely claim for disability benefits, if any, which have accrued and remain unpaid, it is ordered that the judgment be, and it is hereby, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
