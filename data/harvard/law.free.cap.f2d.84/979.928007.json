The plaintiff sued as administrator of James A. Van Derveer, a freight conductor on the defendant\u2019s road, killed while engaged in interstate commerce. The accident happened in the defendant\u2019s yard at Secaucus, New Jersey, on February 3, 1935, at about six-thirty o\u2019clock in the morning while it was still dark. The deceased was in charge of engine 145, and was to take to Harrison two meat cars coming in from the west. The train, No. 52, in which these were, was made up of fifty-eight cars, and came in on \u201cRunning Track No. 1,\u201d which ran east and west, and from which \u201cLead Track No. 1\u201d branched in a southwest direction. From the \u201cLead Track\u201d \u201cTracks No. 4 and 5\u201d branched to the west, Number Four being north of Number Five. The orders were that Gardiner, the head brakeman of Train No. 52, should cut off the first twenty-one cars of that train and haul them east of the switch between \u201cRunning Track No. 1\u201d and \u201cLead Track No. 1,\u201d while Engine No. 145, with the deceased on board, waited on \u201cTrack No. 5.\u201d That engine was then to enter \u201cLead Track No. 1,\u201d back west on \u201cRunning Track No. 1,\u201d and couple to the meat cars, which, being the twenty-second and twenty-third in the train, would then form the east end of the main string. This was all done, and while Engine No. 145 stood on \u201cRunning Track No. 1,\u201d Gardiner, in further compliance with his orders, backed the first twenty-one cars of Train No. 52 west along \u201cLead Track No. 1\u201d and into \u201cTrack No. 5.\u201d Nineteen of the twenty-one were then cut off and left there, and the locomotive with the remaining two cars immediately started east on \u201cTrack No. 5,\u201d passed through the switch between it and \u201cLead Track No. 1\u201d and along \u201cLead Track No. 1.\u201d While so moving the locomotive \u201cside-swiped\u201d the meat car nearest locomotive No. 145, which was then backing along \u201cLead Track No. 1\u201d and into \u201cTrack No. 4.\u201d Van Derveer was standing on the south- side of this car and was killed. What had happened was this. After he saw the locomotive of Train No. 52 with its twenty-one cars backing along \u201cLead Track No. 1,\u201d Van Derveer moved east on \u201cRunning Track No. 1\u201d past the switch between it and \u201cLead Track No. 1\u201d; and then backed along \u201cLead Track No. 1\u201d and into \u201cTrack No. 4,\u201d intending to move west along that track and pick up way-bills for the meat cars. The cje'w of the locomotive of Train No. 52 were negligent in not seeing Van Derveer\u2019s train as it approached, and the only question is whether he was also not only at fault, but so much so that all recovery must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-15\">The road had a rule, No. 56, which reads as follows: \u201cSwitches lined up for the movement of a train of engine must not be changed by another crew without first having an understanding with crew of engine or train for which the switches have been lined up, or making sure that the train or engine has been stopped.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>switches between \u201cRunning Track No. 1\u201d and \u201cLead Track No. 1,\u201d between \u201cTrack No. <em>4\u201d </em>and \u201cLead Track No. 1,\u201d and between \u201cTrack No. 5\u201d and \u201cLead Track No. 1\u201d had all been lined up by the crew of Train No. 52, when it went into \u201cTrack No. 5,\u201d and were to be used again when the locomotive returned to \u201cRunning Track No. 1.\u201d' Van Derveer changed two of, these switches without coming to any understanding with the crew of Train No. 52, and this was prima facie a fault. In excuse the plaintiff urges that Train No. 52 had come to a \u201cstop\u201d on Track No. 5. Literally it had, because that was necessary in order to cut off the rear nineteen cars of the string, which was to be left behind on \u201cTrack No. 5.\u201d But the evidence is uncontradicted that the pause was only long enough to make the cut, \u2014 less than a minute. The judge held that this pause was not a \u201cstop\u201d within the meaning of the rule, and that Van Derveer\u2019s negligence was so primary a cause of his death that it defeated the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">The plaintiff insists that there was a question of fact about the meaning of the rule; that is, that the jury might have found that Train No. 52 had \u201cstopped.\u201d But the meaning is perfectly plain; it is that unless the movement for which the switches have been \u201clined-up\u201d shall be over, so that that \u201cline-up\u201d will not be needed any more, they shall not be touched without consent. That is so plainly the common-sense of the matter that no jury should be allowed to find otherwise. We do not indeed find in the record explicit testimony that Van Derveer knew that the locomotive was to drop the rear nineteen cars and go back to \u201cRunning Track No. 1.\u201d But the fact was so and for that reason he could not have \u201cmade sure\u201d of the contrary. Besides, the operation was plainly drilling in the yard and the locomotive would normally go back to the thirty-five cars on the running track. Indeed the plaintiff has not argued otherwise. Therefore the only question is whether Van Derveer\u2019s breach of the rule bars the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">When an injury to one employee results from the combined fault of himself and a fellow-worker, the damages are divided (section 53, title 45, U.S.Code [45 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 53]); but an exception has grown up when the injured employee\u2019s fault is the violation of a rule or an express instruction. Great Northern R. Co. v. Wiles, 240 U.S. 444, 36 S.Ct. 406, 60 L.Ed. 732, is scarcely an instance, though sometimes cited as such. It is better classed as a case where the injured person, having before him the consequences of another\u2019s fault, does not do what he can to avoid them. The exception first appeared, so far as we can find, in Frese v. Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co., 263 U.S. 1, 44 S.Ct. 1, 68 L.Ed. 131, where a locomotive driver failed to stop his train at a crossing, as required by a rule of the road. He was of course on the right side of his cab and his fireman was on the left, whence came the colliding train; the court seemed to think it doubtful whether the fireman had kept a bad lookout, but went on to say that since the duty was primarily the driver\u2019s, it was irrelevant whether he had or not. It has at times been questioned whether the decision should not be limited to- situations where the injured person is the superior of the other employee on whose fault he must rely to recover. That would explain not only Frese v. Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co., supra, but Unadilla Valley Ry. Co. v. Caldine, 278 U.S. 139, 49 S.Ct. 91, 73 L.Ed. 224, because the deceased conductor directed the driver to go on, contrary to the rule. True, the despatcher was also negligent in that case in failing to tell the conductor that the train with which he collided was approaching, but the court said that the message would have merely given the conductor another motive to obey the rule. It is a little hard to see why that might not have been enough to have induced obedience, but if the contrary was intended, the decision is consistent with the supposed gloss. When the same accident was before us in Unadilla Valley Ry. Co. v. Dibble, 31 F.(2d) 239, we applied the doctrine to the driver whom the conductor had directed to break the rule; and that was plainly wrong if the doctrine is limited as suggested. In Davis v. Kennedy, 266 U.S. 147, 45 S.Ct. 33, 69 L.Ed. 212, it did not appear that the negligent fellow workers were under the driver\u2019s authority, and almost certainly they were not; therefore it also seems contrary to the limitation. The Sixth Circuit held the same thing in Southern Ry. Co. v. Hylton (C.C.A.) 37 F.(2d) 843, and we did so again in Paster v. Pennsylvania R. R., 43 F.(2d) 908. Southern Ry. Co. v. Youngblood, 286 U.S. 313, 52 S.Ct. 518, 76 L.Ed. 1124, turned upon the absence of any other negligence than the deceased\u2019s. In Rocco v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., 288 U.S. 275, 53 S.Ct. 343, 77 L.Ed. 743, the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>ceased had failed to ask the position of a train that he was to meet as required by .a rule, though had he learned where it was he might rightfully have gone on to meet it. T\u00cdiis fault was treated as only an element in determining his general negligence; but if the rule had directed him to wait where he was, Roberts, J. says (288 U.S. 275, at page 279, 53 S.Ct. 343, 77 L.Ed. 743), that the action would have failed. Thus there is no such gloss as that we have been discussing, and the doctrine is merely that if the injured employee has contributed to his injury by the breach of a rule or an instruction ad hoc, he cannot recover. By reason of the phrase, \u201ccontributory negligence,\u201d in section 53 (45 U. S.C.A.), it might have been possible to put such an exception on the ground that indiscipline is not \u201cnegligence,\u201d a word more properly confined to inattention to one\u2019s safety. But that has never been suggested as the reason, and we should hesitate to ascribe it to the court. Moreover, it is not in any case our province to do more than ascertain the extent of the doctrine. We are satisfied that it speaks generally, whatever the reason, and that the judge was right to direct a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
