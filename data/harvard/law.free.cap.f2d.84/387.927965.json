Suit was brought against Macy\u2019s Drug Store, Inc., Irving H. Bernett, and Irvin Rosenfeld, by R. H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc., for an injunction to restrain them from using the name \u201cMacy\u201d in their business.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">In its own extensive business the plaintiff company conducts a retail department store in New York City, and does a large volume of interstate business in the United States and very considerable business in the city of Philadelphia. One of its departments deals in drugs, medicines, cosmetics, toilet preparations, cigars, cigarettes, and other articles commonly sold in drug stores. The plaintiff is commonly referred to as \u201cMacy\u2019s,\u201d and its drug department is operated under the name Macy\u2019s Drug Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The defendants, whose names are Bernett and Rosenfeld, operate a drug store in the city of Philadelphia, and have registered the name \u201cMacy\u2019s Drug Store\u201d under the Fictitious Names Act (54 P.S. \u00a7 21 et seq.). They also use signs on their store stating it is Macy\u2019s Drug Store. No one connected with the defendants store is named Macy. The defendants\u2019 explanation is that they innocently used the last two syllables of the word \u201cpharmacy\u201d in their slogan,. \u201cThe last word in pharmacy\u201d as the basis for their use of the name \u201cMacy.\u201d This contention does not deceive this court as to what their real purpose is; namely, to appropriate the good will and trade of the Macy Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The District Court refused to find that the defendants were guilty of unfair competition and, therefore, denied the injunction. We think, however, that the word \u201cMacy\u2019s\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning and referred to the plaintiff\u2019s business ; that its application to the defendants\u2019 business was misleading; that its use was intended to, and had a tendency to, mislead and deceive the public into the belief that the defendants\u2019 business was connected with that of the plaintiff. Indeed, the entire atmosphere surrounding the acquisition of the name \u201cMacy\u2019s\u201d by the defendants justifies a conclusion that there was a palpable attempt to make use of the plaintiff\u2019s reputation and good will, acquired through many years of advertising, and appropriate it to the benefit of the defendants and deceive the public. Such holding is in accord with Macy &amp; Co. v. Colorado Clothiftg Mfg. Co. (C.C.A.) 68 F.(2d) 690, and Wall v. Rolls-Royce, 4 F.(2d) 333, 334, where this court said: \u201cWe feel the court below, sitting in equity, was justified in preventing the defendant from veiling his business under the name of \u2018Rolls-Royce,\u2019 for he had, and could have had, but one object in view, namely, to commercially use as his own a commercial asset that belonged to others, the continued use and abstraction of which is so fraught with such possibilities of irremediable injury that the only way to remedy it is to stop it at the start.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">So holding, the decree below is vacated and the .record remanded, with instructions to reinstate the bill and grant a permanent injunction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
