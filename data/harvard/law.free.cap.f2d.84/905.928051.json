Cause No. 5728 relates to the taxes for the first two years, which are governed by the Revenue Act of 1928 (45 Stat. 791), and Cause No. 5729 relates to the taxes for 1930 and involves the Revenue Act of 1932 (47 Stat. 169).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-27\">Appellant- is an individual and a resident of Illinois. During the years in question his net income exclusive of capital net losses, his capital net losses, and his charitable contributions were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-31\">Year</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-28\">Net Income Exclusive of Capital Net Losses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abqk\">Capital Net Losses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKW\">Charitable Contributions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-32\">1930 ........ $156,812.46 $128,299.75 $ 86,937.79</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-33\">1931 ........ 393,194.85 \u25a0 199,059.58 105,236.35</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-34\">1933 ........ 377,799.79 797,717.89 64,921.34</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-35\">The questions here presented arise over the amounts of deductions to be allowed for petitioner\u2019s charitable contributions. In computing the deficiencies, the Commissioner allowed a deduction of fifteen per cent of the difference on account of the charitable contributions for each year when the petitioner\u2019s net income, exclusive of capital net loss, exceeded his capital net loss. For the year 1932, when the capital net loss exceeded the net income, exclusive of capital net loss, no deduction for charitable contributions was allowed. Upon petitions for review, the Board sustained the rulings of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-36\">It is contended by petitioner that in determining the deductions for charitable con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>tributions, his capital net losses should be disregarded in computing his net income. The provisions of the applicable sections of both acts involved are identical, and for brevity we shall refer only to the Act of 1928. 45 Stat. 791.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">In Helvering v. Bliss, 293 U.S. 144, 55 S.Ct. 17, 19, 79 L.Ed. 246, 97 A.L.R. 207, the question was presented whether deductions on account of charitable contributions should be taken from net income as defined by section 21 (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 21 and note) or from ordinary net income as defined by section 101 (c) (7) of this act (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 101 note). Section 21 defines net income as gross income computed under section 22 (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 22 and note), less the deductjons allowed by section 23 (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23 and note). The computation under section 22 includes capital gains and losses. The Court there held that the base for computing the fifteen per cent deduction for charitable contributions under section 23 (n) was the net income defined by section 21, and included capital net gain, even though the taxpayer elected to be taxed on capital net gain at the reduced rate prescribed by section 101 (a). It said, \u201cFor \u2018net income,\u2019 the base specified in section 23 (n) * * * the petitioner would substitute \u2018ordinary net income\u2019 as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>defined in section 101. So to read the act would violate its plain terms and run counter to the history of the legislation. * * * By the express words of section 23 (n) charitable contributions are to be deducted to ascertain net income as defined in section 21; and nothing in section 101, which prescribes merely a method for segregating a portion of that net income for taxation at a special rate, in any wise alters the right of the taxpayer to take the deduction in accordance with section 23 (n).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">It is true that in that case capital net gain was involved under section 101 (a) , while in the case at bar, capital net loss is involved under section 101 (b), and for this reason the petitioner contends that the case is not applicable here. It will be noted, however, that the Court stated that nothing in section 101 in any wise altered the right of the taxpayer to take the deduction in accordance with section 23 (n). Of course, section 101 (b) was not directly involved in that controversy, but the language employed includes both subsections (a) and (b). If, however, we consider the statement as dictum with respect to section 101 (b), yet we think its application to that subsection is logically sound, and we perceive no reason why the computation base in one section should be different from that in the other. When the taxpayer chooses to accept the benefit of his charitable contributions, he must accept the computation base provided by statute, regardless of the application of any other statute which merely segregates a portion of his net income for taxation at a special rate, or limits his losses in the computation of his tax. We think the Bliss Case is controlling here and that the Board correctly held that petitioner\u2019s capital net losses should be taken into account in computing his net income.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">It is further contended by petitioner that both Acts are invalid, as we have construed them, because they require the deduction of capital net losses from gross income in determining the deduction under section 23 (n), while all such losses may not be deducted in determining the taxable net income under sections 22 and 23. He further contends that section 101 (b) is invalid insofar as it denies a taxpayer the right to deduct his capital net losses in full in determining taxable net income. The first point deals primarily with the question whether the statute as we have construed it is fatally arbitrary and discriminatory. The second point involves the question whether Congress, in levying a general income tax, can wholly deny any deduction on account of losses resulting from the sale or conversion of capital assets. The respondent suggests that the petitioner in his petition before the Board at no time questioned the constitutionality of the Acts, and for that reason he urges that that question can not be presented here. The petitioner, however, counters with the statement that, although his petition did not specifically allege that fact, yet it was orally argued without objection from either respondent or the Board, but it was not discussed in the opinion. Under these circumstances, we feel that the matter is properly presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">We are convinced, however, that neither contention is tenable. Section 208 (c) of the Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 262 (26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 101 note) was held to be constitutional in Keusch v. Commissioner, 23 B.T.A. 216. That section is substantially identical with section 101 (b) now under consideration. The ruling was affirmed by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in a per curiam decision, 60 F.(2d) 481, and certiorari was denied, 287 U.S. 641, 53 S.Ct. 89, 77 L.Ed. 555. The per curiam decision does not disclose that the constitutional question was presented or passed upon. The briefs here, however, disclose without denial that that question was raised in the Circuit Court of Appeals and was raised and discussed in the briefs upon petition for certiorari. Be that as it may, we are in accord with the opinion of the Board in this respect. Under the Sixteenth Amendment all income, whether net or gross, may be taxed by Congress, and the deductions allowed from gross income are given as a matter of grace. New Colonial Ice Co. v. Helvering, 292 U.S. 435, 54 S.Ct. 788, 78 L.Ed. 1348; Helvering v. Independent Life Insurance Co., 292 U.S. 371, 54 S.Ct. 758, 78 L.Ed. 1311. The limited exercise of a lawful authority is not objectionable. Denman v. Slayton, 282 U.S. 514, 51 S.Ct. 269, 75 L.Ed. 500; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., 240 U.S. 1, 36 S.Ct. 236, 60 L.Ed. 493, L.R.A.1917D, 414, Ann.Cas.1917B, 713. The rule with respect to losses is not different from that of other deductions, and they may not be reflected in an income tax return unless authorized by statute. Clarke v. Haberle Crystal Springs Brewing Co., 280 U.S. 384, 50 S.Ct. 155, 74 L.Ed. 498: Renziehausen v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>Lucas, 280 U.S. 387, 50 S.Ct. 156, 74 L.Ed. 501; Mente v.
