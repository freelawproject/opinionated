A. Peterson for the year 1926. Judgment for said sum was duly entered, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-24\">P. A. Peterson will hereinafter be referred to as the deceased. He died June 9, 1927, before filing his 1926 income tax return. Appellee is his widow and was named as executrix of his estate, which was closed June 21, 1929. The claim sued upon was assigned by said estate, and, if a recovery be had, appellee\u2019s right thereto is unchallenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-25\">The 1926 income of deceased as reported showed a net taxable income of $115,-990.66 and a tax liability of $14,839.63. This tax was paid. In computing the net. income the taxpayer reported a loss growing out of investments in the Stonefield Evans Shoe Company, hereinafter called Stonefield. The Commissioner allowed a deduction of $138,678.41, the amount of deceased\u2019s investment in the capital stock of Stonefield, but disallowed the balance of the alleged loss, to-wit lohns to Stonefield. The Commissioner determined a deficiency tax of $7,611.16 and assessed the same to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>gether with interest amounting to $2,060.61 against the estate of deceased, and the same was thereafter paid. A claim for refund was thereafter made and rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The transactions out of which the alleged losses arose occurred in the calendar year 1926. Stonefield, a shoe company in which deceased was the principal stockholder, holding approximately 75% of the outstanding stock, became financially embarrassed. In addition to holding the majority of the stock, Peterson was also a creditor in the sum of $295,598.62. Stone-field also owed banks $89,926.19, which indebtedness was guaranteed by deceased. In June, 1926, the company was insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Deceased proposed to the other stockholders that he would take the assets and pay the losses as far as the assets would go. This seemed to be acceptable to the other stockholders, but the plan was changed before it was effectuated. The stockholders of Stonefield met and remet and authorized the directors to dispose of the company\u2019s assets to such persons \u201cas will assume to pay and will pay all the indebtedness of the company.\u201d Following said meeting a new corporation was organized, known as Certified Shoe Corporation, hereinafter called Certified. It proposed to purchase all of the assets of Stonefield and in payment thereof to assume and pay all of its indebtedness. The Board of Directors of Stonefield authorized the officers to convey its property to Certified \u201cin consideration of * * * Certified * * * assuming and _ agreeing to pay all of the debts and obligations and liabilities of this company * * * due to any and all of its creditors.\u201d Incorporation of Certified followed. Certified accepted the offer of Stonefield and agreed to purchase the property \u201cin accordance with said proposal.\u201d Deceased subscribed for 3,000 of the 3,140 shares. At or about the same time deceased made a proposal to the Board of Directors of Certified that he would assume and agree to pay all of the bank\u2019s and <em>\"all other indebtedness of Stonefield to him\u201d </em>for fully paid up capital stock in this company at par. This proposal was accepted by Certified. 3000 shares of its stock were duly issued to deceased, and the $295,000 indebtedness to deceased was satisfied. The bank\u2019s obligations were reduced by Certified in 1926, but not all of said indebtednesses were paid that year. Certified continued to operate until 1930 when it liquidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Controversy is over the year when the loss occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">The District Court found:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">\u201cIn 1926, P. A. Peterson ascertained $161,999.27 of indebtedness owing him by Stonefield Evans Shoe Co. to be worthless and in 1926 charged off said amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">Appellant insists that: neither fact set forth in this finding is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">If there be any substantial evidence to support this finding, the judgment must be affirmed. .</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">The difficulty which this case presents is, however, traceable not to disputed facts but to reaching the proper conclusion from undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">It is not hard to visualize the reasoning of the learned District Judge. He brushed aside the forms of corporate instrumentalities through which the deceased conducted the shoe business and charged him with assets of Stonefield and credited him with the debts of said corporation which he assumed. The balance he permitted the deceased to deduct from his 1926 income. The process is not without support of appealing reasons. Appellee argues: Deceased suffered a bona fide loss. Why not allow it? The loss really occurred in 1926, although as in many similar ventures the investor did not realize it until years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">The \u25a0 reasoning of the court was partly right and partly wrong. That there was a loss must be, and is, admitted. That the amount of the loss equaled the sums claimed as deductions in deceased\u2019s 1926 income tax return is likewise not questioned. It is also true that the loss of the stotk on Stonefield occurred in 1926. The Commissioner permitted that deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">The narrow question then is: Did the deceased also lose his- loans to Stonefield or part of them in 1926?</p>\n<p id=\"b349-17\">The error in the reasoning of appellee\u2019s counsel is due to his failure to appreciate that deductions from a taxpayer\u2019s income are governed by statute. Losses are permitted as deductions from taxable income only because of the statute. The year when such deductions may be made is determined by actualities, and neither the taxpayer nor the Commissioner may make facts fit theories. Applicable statutes and regulations must be determined by the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Section 214 (a), Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 26), provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u201cIn computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions: * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u201c(7) Debts ascertained to be worthless and charged off within the taxable year (or, in the discretion of the Commissioner, a reasonable addition to a reserve for bad debts); and When satisfied that a debt is recoverable only in part, the Commissioner may allow such debt to be charged off in part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Regulations 69, Article 151, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\"><em>\"Bad debts. </em>\u2014 Bad debts may be treated in either of two ways\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">\u201c(1) By a deduction from income in respect of debts ascertained to be worthless in whole or in part, or</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">\u201c(2) By a deduction from income'of an addition to a reserve for bad debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">\u201cTaxpayers were given an option for 1921 to select either of the methods mentioned for treating such debts. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">\u201cWhere all the surrounding and attending circumstances indicate that a debt is worthless, either wholly or in part, the amount which is worthless and charged off or written down to a nominal amount on the books of the taxpayer shall be allowed as a deduction in computing net income. There should accompany the return a statement showing the propriety of any deduction claimed for bad debts. * * * Before a taxpayer may charge off and deduct a debt in part, he must ascertain and be able to demonstrate, with a reasonable degree of certainty, the amount thereof which is uncollectible. * * * In determining whether a debt is worthless in whole or in part the Commissioner will consider all pertinent evidence, including the value of the collateral, if any, securing the debt and the financial condition of the debtor. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">\u201cWhere the surrounding circumstances indicate that a debt is worthless and uncollectible and that legal action to enforce payment would in all probability not result in the satisfaction of execution on a judgment, a showing of these facts will be sufficient evidence of the worthlessness of the debt for the purpose of deduction. Bankruptcy is generally an indication of the worthlessness of at least a part of an unsecured and unpreferred debt. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-15\">When deceased offered to accept 3000 shares of Certified stock in payment of his debt, he made it impossible for the Commissioner or the court to hold that the debt thereupon became a bad or a worthless debt <em>and </em>was charged off that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-16\">When Certified was organized it acquired all the assets of Stonefield Company. The capital stock of Stonefield was thus wiped out. Deceased\u2019s loss in Stone-field\u2019s stock was then and there fixed and was properly allowed as a deduction. But, through the elimination of Stonefield as a corporate entity and the loss of the Stone-field stock, Certified came into existence and became a going concern with deceased the principal stockholder. Acceptance of the fully paid Certified stock of the par value of $290,600 in exchange for debts against Stonefield aggregating $295,000, negatives the suggestion that the latter were \u201cascertained to be worthless and charged off\u201d that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-17\">If deceased ascertained the debt was - worthless and was charged off in 1926 he proceeded in a most non-understandable and unusual manner to do so. Organization of .a $300,000 corporation and the payment of stock therein through the satisfaction of a debt which said corporation had assumed, hardly indicates that the deceased was charging off a worthless debt as specified in section 214 (a) (7). A contrary conclusion is unavoidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-18\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the cause remanded with directions to proceed further in .accordance with the views here expressed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
