Commissioner of Internal Revenue (C.C.A.) 84 F.(2d) 441. The parties have stipulated that if liable as transferee, Delacroix\u2019s liability is that fixed as Acme\u2019s deficiency in that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">Organized to take over Acme\u2019s assets by the owners of the Acme shares, it is in substance and effect a continuation of Acme, with the same officers. Acme before the organization owned the property and now owns the shares in Delacroix. In such a situation it may not be doubted that Delacroix took Acme\u2019s property subject to and charged with Acme\u2019s liabilities, including those for taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">The order of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
