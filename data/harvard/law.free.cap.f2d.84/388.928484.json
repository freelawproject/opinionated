The purchase price was $15,000 of which $6,000 has been paid. On October 16, 1934, a petition was filed under section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 207) for the reorganization of debtor. Appellee was named trustee after a ruling that the petition showed jurisdiction and was filed in good faith. Notice to creditors was given, but appellant filed no claim. Later it filed a petition for reclamation \u2014 the immediate possession of the equipment. The court denied the relief sought and dismissed the petition and ruled that appellant should not participate in any plan of reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">This order was erroneous. Appellant was not required to file a claim against debtor. Title to the machinery was in the vendor, the appellant. In re Abell (C.C.A.) 19 F.(2d) 965; Reardon v. Rock Island Plow Co.
