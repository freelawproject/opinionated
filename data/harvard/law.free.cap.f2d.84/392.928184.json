Appellant has filed opposition thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-25\">The petition first states, in substance, that the only issue of the case is whether the marks are confusingly similar, and alleges that our decision reversing the decision of the Commissioner of Patents denying the registration sought by appellant, whether so intended or not, will inevitably be construed to overrule or disapprove a long line of decisions by this and other courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-26\">Two points are then set forth, the first of which comprises a list of marks which this and other courts have held to be deceptively similar, it being claimed that, in most instances, the resemblance between such competing marks is less than the resemblance between the \u201cBayer\u201d and \u201cSkram\u201d marks (the respective arrangements of which are described in our original opinion) here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-27\">The second point challenges the soundness of our comments with respect to the \u201ccasual observer,\u201d and, as we understand it, it is this part of the opinion which ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>pellant particularly alleges will inevitably be construed to overrule a long line of decisions of this and other courts. As will be seen from the former opinion, we said:</p>\n<p id=\"A2i\">\u201cIt is true that there is a physical resemblance between the marks when visualized with the eye only, and, as said in the decision of the commissioner, they might impress the <em>\u2018casual observer </em>as being the same.\u2019 (Italics ours.) One of the witnesses for opposer, who was its general sales manager, in answer to an inquiry as to why he believed the registration of appellant\u2019s mark would be injurious to op-poser, said:</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u201c \u2018For the reason that the words crossed as they are in a circle might indicate to the casual observer that this product was the product of the Bayer Company.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u201cWe do not find in the statute (TradeMark Act 1905, \u00a7 5, as amended [15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 85]) any reference to \u2018the casual observer.\u2019 The statute refers to confusion or mistake \u2018in the mind of the public\u2019 and to the deception of \u2018purchasers.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"A7D-\">\u201cIt is probable that an observer looking casually at packages bearing the respective marks, located side by side upon the shelf of a dealer in such merchandise, and noting only the cruciform arrangement of the words in a circle, without observing the difference in the words themselves, would be impressed with a resemblance in the appearance of the marks; but it is well-nigh inconceivable that any purchaser, or any member of the public, able to read who gave even ordinary attention to the marks, would be led to the belief that the goods are of common origin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The petition for rehearing says: \u201cThe testimony in this case quoted by the Court is to the effect that the marks in issue might be confused by the casual observer. In holding that no confusion was likely, the Court remarked that the statute does not refer to \u2018the casual observer.\u2019 The statute does not need to be so specific. It contemplates confusion or mistake in the mind of the public, which includes the casual observer as well as the careful purchaser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">It is then urged that in limiting the likelihood of confusion by the test of \u201cany purchaser, or any member of the public, able to read, who gave even ordinary attention,\u201d the court took too narrow a view; that the law of trade-marks is but a part of the broader law of unfair competition, and that \u201cThe trade-mark statute was not intended to be less liberal than the common law, certainly not to abrogate it.\u201d Numerous authorities are cited in support of this point, which point we construe the petition to allege was, in the language of our rule VII, \u201coverlooked or misapprehended by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">The court recognizes the fact that that part of our opinion above quoted, taken as a whole, is subject to an interpretation or construction which might place it in conflict with many prior decisions upon the question of law involved. While it is true that the statute itself, as is stated in the former opinion, \u201cmakes no reference to the casual observer,\u201d it is also true that in many decisions of this and other courts confusion, or probability of confusion, of the casual observer has been recognized as an important element to be considered in construing and applying the statute. In view of this, and in order that there may be no misunderstanding of the court\u2019s decision, it is deemed proper that the portion of our opinion above quoted be, and the same is, withdrawn.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nothing therein stated shall be regarded as constituting a reason for the conclusion reached, nor will it be taken as a precedent in the consideration of future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">To the conclusion itself, however, we adhere upon the ground that the marks of the respective parties are not confusingly similar. Upon this issue, the Examiner of Interferences said:</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">\u201cIn applicant\u2019s as well as in opposer\u2019s marks there is but a single spoken symbol available to purchasers for use in distinguishing the products of the parties from each other or from those of other traders. This, obviously, is \u2018Skram,\u2019 in the case of applicant\u2019s mark, and \u2018Bayer\u2019 in the case of opposer\u2019s marks. These features are deemed to be the dominating features of the marks and, in the opinion of the examiner, neither look alike, sound alike nor have the same significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">\u201cThe goods, although they may possess the same descriptive properties, are nevertheless specifically different. The dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>ferences in the marks and these properties are cumulative. It is believed that confusion would not be likely to result from the concurrent use of these marks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">We concur in the foregoing, and, since the petition for rehearing presents nothing relative to confusing similarity which was overlooked or misapprehended during our consideration of the case that affects our conclusion, there is no occasion for a rehearing, and the petition therefor is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-9\"> The opinion having been published in a number of publications prior to the time when consideration could be given to the petition for rehearing, it was not found practicable physically to delete the sub<em>jeot matter. </em>See 82 F.(2d) 615, <em>29 V.S. </em>P.Q. 142, 26 T.M.R. 290. Hence this opinion in the nature of a supplemental statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
