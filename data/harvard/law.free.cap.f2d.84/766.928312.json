The bill prays specific performance of the alleged agreements, and that appellees be enjoined from assigning said inventions to any one other than appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Appellees Strong, Bristow, Jackson, and Ultra Violet Corporation, Ltd., filed separate answers, setting up various defenses. Appellees Brooks and Stock did not answer. The District Court concluded, after hearing the case, that no relief should be granted and accordingly, entered a decree dismissing the bill. This appeal is from that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The question arises whether the District Court had jurisdiction of this case. Though not raised by the parties, this question is necessarily before us and must be. decided. Mitchell v. Maurer, 293 U.S. 237, 244, 55 S.Ct. 162, 79 L.Ed. 338; Southern Pacific Co. v. McAdoo (C.C.A.9) 82 F.(2d) 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">This is not a suit arising under the patent laws or any law of the United States. Marsh v. Nichols, Shepard &amp; Co., 140 U.S. 344, 355, 11 S.Ct. 798, 35 L.Ed. 413. It is a suit of a civil nature, in equity, and is between citizens of different states, but was not within the jurisdiction of the District Court unless the matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $3,000. Judicial Code, \u00a7 24, as amended (28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 41).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">The bill alleges that the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $3,-000, exclusive of interest and costs. The answers filed by appellees state that they have \u201cno knowledge - or information as to the actual value of the matter here in controversy and will, at the time of trial, require strict proof\u201d of appellant\u2019s allegation in reference thereto. Appellant made no such proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">The matter in controversy is the right which appellant asserts and seeks to have protected and enforced, namely, the right to have the inventions above referred to assigned to appellant, and to no one else. The District Court\u2019s jurisdiction is to be tested by the value of that right. McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U.S. -, 56 S.Ct. 780, 80 L.Ed. -, decided May 18, 1936. That value depends, of course, on the value of the inventions. The precise nature of the inventions cannot be ascertained from the record. The evidence shows that they have not been patented. There is no proof that they are patentable, or that their value, if any, exceeds $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">The burden of proving the jurisdictional facts rested on- appellant. McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., supra. That burden was not sustained. The trial court\u2019s finding, that the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $3,000, has no support in the evidence. The bill should have been dismissed, not on the merits, but for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">The decree is modified accordingly and, as modified, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
