The motion in arrest of judgment made the day after sentence was pronounced and based on the insufficiency of the descriptive allegations of the indictment was properly overruled. The objection, particularly after conviction and sentence, is technical. The record makes it plain that he well knew what he was charged with. A new trial is not authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
