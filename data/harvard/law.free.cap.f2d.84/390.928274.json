The petitioner received a pecuniary legacy of $600,000 by the will of her husband. The will contained no provision in respect to interest upon this legacy. Pursuant to the Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Act of 1917, \u00a7 21 (20 P.S. \u00a7 633), the executors paid the petitioner $29,300 as interest on her legacy. The petitioner did not include this sum in her income tax return and the commissioner assessed a deficiency. The board sustained the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-22\">The petitioner relies upon section 22 (b) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 22 (b) (3) and note), which provides that \u201cthe value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance\u201d is to be excluded from gross in- \" come. The same section, however, expressly provides that the income from such property shall be included in gross income. The Pennsylvania Act (20 P.S. \u00a7 633) provides \u201cthat where a pecuniary legacy is bequeathed to or for the use of the widow of the testator, * * * interest shall, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>unless a contrary intention appear by the will, begin to run from the date of the death of the testator.\u201d It would therefore seem that the $29,300 was income to the petitioner from the property acquired by the bequest to her and should have been included in her gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">We think the interest allowed by statute was income and taxable as such. The statutory interest allowed her was not legacy or part of her legacy and was not provided for in the will, but was attributable to the statute of the state. It would be captious to adhere strictly to the narrow definition of the word \u201cinterest\u201d as is urged by the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">So holding, the action of the Tax Board if affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
