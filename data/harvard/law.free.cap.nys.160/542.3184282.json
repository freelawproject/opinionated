Proc. \u00a7 1925, to test the legality of the resolution of the trustees of the village of Tarrytown on January 4, 1916, by which they voted to increase the salary of defendant William B. Moorhouse, as village police justice. Mr. Moorhouse had been elected on March 16, 1915, to take office on January 1st following, for a term of four years. His official oath was on March 22d, and on December 21, 1915, he filed the required bond. Under a resolution of the village trustees, which had been-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>passed December 12, 1911, the salary of the police justice had been fixed at $55 a month to begin January 1, 1912, which had been thereafter paid to the incumbent of the office of police justice. On January 1, 1916, Justice Moorhouse entered on his new official term. On January 4, 1916, the village board of trustees voted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">\u201cResolved, that the salary of the police justice for the term beginning January 1, 1916, be and the same is hereby fixed at $1,000 a year, to be paid in the same manner as other salaries axe paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The Village Law (Consol. Laws, c. 64) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">\u201cSec. 184. <em>Compensation of Village Police Justice. </em>If the police justice of a village shall not he paid a salary, he shall be entitled to receive for his services the same fees as a justice of the peace for like services, to be paid in like manner, except that his fees in proceedings on account of violations of the village ordinances shall be paid by the village. The board of trustees may determine that Ihe police justice shall be paid a salary instead of fees, and may fix the amount thereof, and such salary shall not be increased or diminished during his term of office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Counsel point out that this limit on the power of the village does not designate the time when the salary is to be fixed, or even prescribe that this shall be done before the beginning of the official term, as is often inserted in such enactments (see Laws 1881, c. 557) ; likewise are cited statutes defining the minimum period before beginning of the term, when the salary shall be fixed (Laws 1875, c. 461; Laws 1877, c. 436, \u00a7 5). From which it is suggested that the village might fix this salary after the term began, if such increase was passed before any salary payments for that term had been actually made. Acts changing official compensation from fee system to a fixed salary are also referred to, where the Legislature leaves to the town board, or to the board of supervisors, to vote such change during the incumbent\u2019s official term. County Law (Consol. Laws, c. 11) \u00a7 12; L. 1915, c. 11, adding section 107a to the Town Law (Consol. Laws, c. 62). Unless otherwise provided by the Constitution, this is clearly within the power of the Legislature. 1 Dillon, Mun. Corp. \u00a7 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> So long, however, as the vote of December 12, 1911, remained in force, the office of village police justice had attached to it the monthly salary of $55, which remained the law of that village until repealed or lawfully amended, and warranted the payment of this salary to successive incumbents of the office of police justice. People ex rel. Woods v. Crissey, 91 N. Y. 616. Hence on the 1st of January, and during the four days before this meeting, Justice Moorhousc\u2019s legal salary was at the rate of $55 per month, even if not payable until the end of January. Therefore this attempted raise to $1,000 a year, voted on January 4th, was an increase during the term of office, contrary to the prohibition of Village Law, \u00a7 184. Ries v. West New York, 79 N. J. Law, 164, 74 Atl. 337; Lowry v. City of Lexington, 113 Ky. 763, 68 S. W. 1109; Devers v. York City, 150 Pa. 208, 24 Atl. 668; 1 Dillon, Mun. Corp. \u00a7 424n. Such increase of judicial salary would be a waste and injury to the funds and property of the village of Tarry town, which may be redressed by taxpayer\u2019s suit under Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">I advise, therefore, to affirm the judgment, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
