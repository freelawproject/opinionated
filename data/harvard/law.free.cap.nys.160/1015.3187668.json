Rosenthal v. American Bonding Co., 207 N. Y. 162, 107 N. E. 716, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 561. Therefore the complaint, to which the contract of insurance is annexed, fails to disclose a cause of action. Facts which are absolutely essential to a recovery must be pleaded. They are not included in the classification of \u201cevidentiary facts\u201d merely because they have to be proved. \u201cEvidentiary facts,\u201d the pleading of which is dispensed with, are not those essential to the existence of a cause of action. It might as well be claimed that the allegation of a loss is evidentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-18\">The order is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs, with leave to the plaintiff to amend the complaint within six days on payment of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
