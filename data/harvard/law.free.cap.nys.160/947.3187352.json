This, however, is only applicable to criminal cases. No such exception was known to the common law. See Cent. Dig. \u201cWitness,\" \u00a7\u00a7 97, 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-16\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Although our Code of Civil Procedure (section 850) provides for a preliminary examination of an infant to ascertain his capacity and extent of his knowledge, this does not permit the court to cast off the safeguard of an oath, which the law has placed on testimony. The trial court should have ascertained whether this plaintiff, 9 years old at the time of hearing, was of sufficient capacity to comprehend the obligation of an oath, and, if so, should have had him sworn. Unsworn testimony of a child is inadmissible in a civil case. Neustadt v. New York City Ry. Co., 104 N. Y. Supp. 735; Gehl v. Bachmann-Bechtel Brewing Co., 156 App. Div. 51, 141 N. Y. Supp. 133; Chamberlayne on Evidence, \u00a7 3639.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-17\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Although this objection was not taken below, or urged upon this appeal, we cannot ignore such error, or regard the silence of counsel as a waiver. Hence the recovery based so largely on this unsworn testimony cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-18\">The judgment and order of the county court of Kings county is therefore reversed, and a new trial ordered, costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
