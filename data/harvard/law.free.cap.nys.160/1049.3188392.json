Hearn &amp; Son were sued for damages for personal injuries arising out of an alleged joint tort, namely, the negligence of their respective employ\u00e9s in the conduct of two automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-16\">It developed at the trial that the action had during the course thereof been discontinued as against Hearn &amp; Son. Appellant Levy was permitted to ask plaintiff\u2019s counsel whether the discontinuance was under an agreement with the attorney of Hearn &amp; Son, to which an affirmative answer was given. He then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-17\">\u201cWill you tell us whether under that agreement any sum of money was paid or promised to be paid to plaintiff?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-18\">An objection to this question was sustained and appellant\u2019s counsel excepted. Objections to two other questions to the same general effect were similarly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-19\">As I understand respondent\u2019s brief, he concedes that plaintiff could have but one satisfaction for his injury. He does not answer appellant\u2019s claim that the amount, if any, received from one of the joint tortfeasors, should be taken into account by the jury in its award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-20\">It is evident, therefore, that the testimony excluded was relevant, material, and competent, and that its exclusion constituted such important error as that the judgment must be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
