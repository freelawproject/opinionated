The plaintiff and the intervening stockholders have appealed from the entire judgment. Defendants appeal from only so much of it as decrees that the plaintiff and the interveners recover the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>shares of stock referred to, and also in so far as it awards to defendants only one-half the c\u00f3sts.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-3\">The action is brought by the holder of 90 shares of the preferred stock of an outstanding issue of over 58,000 shares of the defendant International Cotton Mills Corporation of New York\u2014(a) to set aside a dissolution of the New York corporation, which was consummated under section 221 of the General Corporation Law of New York (Consol. Laws, c. 23); (b) to declare void and set aside a sale of the assets of the New York corporation to the International Cotton Mills Corporation of Massachusetts; (c) to direct a retransfer to the New York corporation of the assets transferred; (d) to require the Massachusetts corporation to account for the property received; and (e) to enjoin the Massachusetts corporation and its officers from selling or incumbering the property transferred to it by the New York corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">The trial was a long one, and the record on appeal is voluminous. It would serve no useful purpose to review the evidence. It is sufficient to say we are of the opinion that the same fairly sustains the findings and conclusions of the referee, and we are entirely satisfied with the judgment entered upon his report, and the reasons assigned in his opinion therefor, except we think the plaintiff and the interveners should have an option, if they so desire, to take in cash the value of their stock in the New York corporation, at the time the consolidation took effect, instead of the stock of the Massachusetts corporation directed in the judgment to be tendered to them. In case they elect to take such value, then the same to be determined by an appraisal, as provided in section 17 of the Stock Corporation Law (Consol. Laws, c. 59).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">The judgment appealed from, therefore, is modified, as indicated in this memorandum, and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs to either party. Settle order on notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
