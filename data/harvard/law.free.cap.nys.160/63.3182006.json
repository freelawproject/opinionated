The principal complaint of the railroad company is that the establishment of this station, which is seven-tenths of a mile distant from the main Jamaica station, and eight-tenths of a mile from the Cedar Manor station, will cause a delay in the express service of the railroad, and that as the Long Island Railroad is a steam railroad, and not a street surface or interurban road, the regulation of its commutation traffic is peculiarly within the powers of the railroad and not of the state\u2014citing People ex rel. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 215 N. Y. 241, 254, 109 N. E. 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\"><bracketnum>[1-3]</bracketnum> That case related to commutation tickets and the increase of rates, and is not applicable in any way to the present case. The establishment of stations, requiring adequate facilities for the traveling public, is peculiarly within the power of the Public Service Commission delegated by the Legislature. See section 50, Public Service Commissions Law. Unless this discretion is abused, and the order is clearly unreasonable, the commission\u2019s determination should not be disturbed. This order does not attempt to regulate the time within which trains must stop at this station, but merely requires the establishment of the station, and leaves the details of operation entirely within the control of the railroad company.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">In our opinion the company has not shown that this requirement is unreasonable or unjust, and the writ should be dismissed, and the determination of the commission affirmed, with $50 costs and disbursements. Order filed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
