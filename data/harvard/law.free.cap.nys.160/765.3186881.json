Noveck &amp; Co., shirt manufacturers, kept a door locked in the factory of his employers during working hours. The eighth floor loft is bisected by a wooden partition, in which the door in question is placed; Noveck &amp; Co. occupying the front half of this loft as a factory, and one V. Luciano maintaining a laundry in the remainder of the loft. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>are distinct and separate factories, adjacent to each other. The door is used at times by Noveclc &amp; Co. in passing into and from Luciano\u2019s place to serve their business purposes, and when the door is not so used the defendant keeps the door bolted as stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">This violates section 79c3 of the Labor Law, which provides that all means of egress shall be maintained in an unobstructed condition, and that no door leading into or out of any factory or any floor thereof shall be locked, bolted, or fastened during working hours. See, also, section 79b 1, Labor Law. The purposes of this statute are obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The people have sustained the burden of proof, and I vote to find the defendant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">O\u2019KEEFE, P. J., and MOSS, J., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
