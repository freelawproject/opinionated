Instead of filing the affidavit necessary to procure the adjournment, defendant\u2019s counsel, to whom the favor had been extended, answered \u201cReady,\u201d and procured the dismissal of the complaint on default caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>by the natural inability of plaintiff\u2019s counsel to proceed without witnesses that would have been on hand, but for the representations made by defendant\u2019s counsel. Nevertheless, on opening the default thus brought about by defendant\u2019s counsel, and without any fault on the part of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the court required the plaintiff to pay a full bill of costs, thus rewarding a method of practice which, unexplained, seemingly merited discipline instead. No terms should have been imposed upon a party that was not only innocent but deceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">The order, in so far as appealed from, is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.
