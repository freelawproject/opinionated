The controversy centers about subdivision <em>7. </em>The wife died, leaving an estate of some $9,000, and the trial court has decided that the husband is entitled to it. The parties separated in January, 1910, and made the agreement in November. Each had a lawyer. Counsel for the husband drew a contract with subdivisions 6 and 7. Counsel for the wife objected to it and proffered sections 6 and 7 as they now are, which brought into the contract the provisions under discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">It is the decision th\u00e1t husband and wife each promised the other that the survivor should have such interest in the estate of the -other as accrues in case of intestacy; but the wife\u2019s taking was to be measured by the laws of Pennsylvania, and the husband\u2019s sharing by the laws of New York. The appellant\u2019s contention is that the agreement means only that the fact that the parties were separated under agreement that he should pay her $8 per week should not be deemed such willful neglect to provide for her, or such desertion as under the laws of Pennsylvania would work a forfeiture of his interest in her estate if she died intestate, and that the object was to preserve the status quo that would obtain in case either died intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The reason suggested for the provision for the husband does not account for the similar provision for the wife. The wife got tlie&lt; stipulation as her lawyer deemed best for her, viz., that the $8 payment should cease on the husband\u2019s death, as it would, and that the wife, in lieu of it, should \u201creceive such interest in\u201d his estate \u201cas provided by the intestate laws * * * of Pennsylvania as though there had not been an agreement.\u201d The words \u201cas though there had not been an agreement\u201d may have been inserted from some conception of necessity or caution, but do not seem to have any use. However, I think that we should consider the suggestion that, irrespective of its necessity, the wife\u2019s lawyer feared that if the husband died intestate it might be asserted that the agreement would operate to exclude the widow from sharing in the estate. By such interpretation the agreement would mean that, in case the husband died intestate, the wife should take the normal share of a widow in his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">But that would be a slight assurance to the woman, whose weekly payment of $8 per week would cease, and I cannot believe that her lawyer took so much pains for no useful purpose. It seems more probable that he sought to have her \u201creceive such interest\u201d as the intestacy laws provide. The husband could do what he would do with his property while he lived, but at death he could not exclude her, as his probable feelings towards her would influence him to do. But the wife could hardly expect a bargain that would insure her an interest in her husband\u2019s estate in case of his earlier death, and yet exclude him from participating in her estate if he survived her. So it was provided that he should \u201chave such interest in\u201d her estate \u201cas provided for in intestacy under the laws of the state of New York, as if no agreement had existed and the parties hereto lived together, except the same be absolved by proceedings in divorce.\u201d The stip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>ulation is that the husband, surviving, shall receive an interest In his wife\u2019s estate. What interest? Such as the intestacy laws provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">But appellant says that, if the wife wills it all away, the law gave him nothing, and that it was intended so to leave h. That construction makes the agreement impotent. She willed him $5, and the rest of the property elsewhere. It chances that she left only personalty, and in the absence of children he takes it all; but, had she left real estate, he would have taken, nothing. I conclude that the essence of the contract was that the parties could do what they would with their properties, but that neither could exclude the other from taking what the law would give in case of intestacy. The mutual promises furnished the consideration, and the agreement was not against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, but without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
