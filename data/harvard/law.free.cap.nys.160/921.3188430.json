On Mr. Quinby\u2019s decease the widow (sister of the incompetent), with her brother\u2019s concurrence, petitioned for Mr. Opdyke\u2019s appointment as substitute committee of the person and of the estate. This recommendation was in view of Mr. Opdyke\u2019s having acted as legal adviser of the committee in this trust. His character <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>and capacity stand unquestioned. Under his wise management the estate has grown to about $819,000. However, as Mr. Quinby\u2019s estate has to account as such committee in respect to matters largely in Mr. Op dyke\u2019s hands, the learned Justice at Special Term apparently thought that to appoint Mr. Opdyke might expose him to the embarrassment of representing conflicting interests on such accounting. We cannot say that this conclusion followed by naming Mr. McGovern was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">The order appealed from is affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
