What the \u201cservices,\u201d either performed or to be performed, consisted of, what the plaintiffs did, what the plaintiffs were to do, and what the alleged full performance consisted of, are all left to conjecture. It would have been very simple to have stated the facts. It is only by considering facts alleged that the court can determine whether a complaint states a cause of action. Such a determination cannot be successfully avoided by merely pleading conclusions. The defendant having properly demurred, the order granting plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and demurrer sustained, with $10 costs, with leave to plaintiffs to file an amended complaint within six days after entry and notice thereof of this order in the City Court and upon payment of said costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-11\">BIJUR, J., concurring in the result. GUY, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
