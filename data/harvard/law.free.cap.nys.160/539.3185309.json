On April 10, 1916, an information was presented to a Magistrate\u2019s Court in said borough, in which appellant was charged with having, on Sunday, April 9, 1916, at his said place of business, publicly conducted \u201ca shoe factory by having the machines in operation, and the operators working, thereby making a loud noise, so as to interfere with the repose and religious liberty of the community, contrary to and in violation of the statute in such case made and provided, in violation of section 2143, Penal Law.\u201d The defendant was arrested, and upon his trial all of the elements constituting a violation of section 2143 of the Penal Law were proven without contradiction. *</p>\n<p id=\"b562-20\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The defendant testified that he never operated his factory on Saturday, which day he observed as his Sabbath, but kept his factory open and running on Sundays. He was convicted, and now contends that it was not proven that he personally \"labored\u201d on Sunday, April 9th. This contention is without merit: Concededly he was present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>at the factory and engaged in overseeing and carrying on his business, exactly the same as on weekdays, and this is sufficient to bring him within the prohibition of the statute. Conducting, overseeing, and carrying on of his business, in all its details, was engaging in and performance of \u201clabor,\u201d within the meaning of that word as used in section 2143 of the Penal Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> He further contends that, inasmuch as he uniformly kept Saturdays as holy time, and closed his factory and did not labor on Saturdays, he could not, because of the provisions of section 2144 of the Penal Law, be legally convicted of the offense with which he was charged; there being no proof \u201cthat the noises complained of caused a \u2018serious interruption of the repose and religious liberty of the community.\u2019 \u201d Section 2144 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201cIt is a sufficient defense to a prosecution for work or labor on the first day of the week that the defendant uniformly keeps another day of the week as holy time, and does not labor on that day, and that the labor complained of was done in such manner as not to interrupt or disturb other persons in observing the first day of the week as holy time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The answer to that contention is that two witnesses living in the immediate vicinity of the factory testified that they were disturbed and annoyed by the manner in which the work was done on Sundays, because of the noise arising therefrom, and that there was a Sunday school in the immediate vicinity. It was incumbent on the defendant, in order to bring himself within the exception contained in section 2144, not only to show that he uniformly keeps another day of the week as holy time and does not labor on such days, but he must go further and prove that the labor complained of was done in such manner as not to interrupt or disturb other persons in observing the first day of the week as holy time.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\"><bracketnum>[3, 4]</bracketnum> There is another reason why the appellant cannot succeed on this appeal. The information does not charge the defendant with performing servile labor on Sunday. On the contrary, it charges him with having publicly conducted a shoe factory on Sunday, using in the operation both machinery and individual labor, which is a violation of section 2146 of the Penal Law, which prohibits \u201call trades, manufactures, agricultural or mechanical employments upon the first day of the week,\u201d except works of necessity. The information charges an offense, so conducted as to interfere with the \u201crepose and religious liberty of the community,\u201d contrary to and in violation of the statute in such case made and provided, and is complete without the addition of the words \u201cin violation of section 2143, Penal Law,\u201d which may be disregarded as surplusage. The addition of these words did not prejudice the defendant, as the facts are fully and correctly charged, under either section constituting \u201cSabbath breaking.\u201d The defendant was advised of the acts relied upon to constitute the alleged \u201cviolation of the statute,\u201d and the unnecessary designation of the section did not limit the prosecution to the acts therein stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The acts prohibited by section 2146, as charged in the information, were proven, and the provisions of section 2144 have no application to such offense. They have reference only to the servile labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>specified in section 2143, and constitute no defense to the offense of conducting on Sunday \"trades, manufactures, agricultural or mechanical employments,\u201d prohibited by section 2146.
