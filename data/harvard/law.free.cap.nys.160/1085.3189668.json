Plaintiff continued in defendants\u2019 employment for a period of about three months when he was discharged, v Plaintiff claimed that when he was discharged he was told that his work was satisfactory, but that he was discharged because of business conditions. This was denied by the defendants, who claimed that they discharged the plaintiff because his work was unsatisfactory, and so informed him. Respondents\u2019 counsel states in his brief that \u201cthe sole issue in the case at bar was as to what was said at the time of the discharge.\u201d This is a wholly erroneous conception of the issue in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-9\"><bracketnum>[1-3]</bracketnum> What is said at the time of the discharge may, of course, be considered and given due weight; but the issue generally is in such a case, and clearly was in this case, whether the dissatisfaction was genuine or assumed. The employer is the sole judge of whether he has reason to be dissatisfied, and the jury have no right to speculate as to whether he ought to have been satisfied; but the question whether the employer was in fact dissatisfied and the dismissal was in good faith is a question of fact for the jury. Diamond v. Mendelsohn, 156 App. Div. 636, 141 N. Y. Supp. 775; Summers v. Colver, 38 App. Div. 553, 56 N. Y. Supp. 624. The case of Waldt v. Goodwin Mfg. Co., 165 App. Div. 244, 150 N. Y. Supp. 831, is not at all to the contrary, as is urged in behalf of the respondent. The refusal of the court in that case to charge \u201cthat if the jury find that the dissatisfaction of the defendant was assumed, and not real, and made for the purpose of reducing expenses, or any other cause than that of dissatisfaction, that they may find for the plaintiff,\u201d was because, as the opinion clearly indicates, that \u201cuncontradicted evidence showed that the plaintiff was discharged because defendant was dissatisfied with his services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-10\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> In the case at bar, the learned t-rial justice, after charging that \u201cthe defendants had the <em>arbitrary </em>right, whenever they were dissatisfied with the services of the plaintiff, to forthwith discharge him,\u201d and that the defendants were the sole judges as to whether they were dissatisfied, charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1108-11\">\u201cIn view of defendants\u2019 right to discharge the plaintiff in the exercise of the defendants\u2019 discretion, it is unimportant to consider the question whether defendants were actuated by some ulterior motive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1108-12\">The court then expressly refused to charge at the request of plaintiff\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>\u201cI ask your honor to charge that the defendants cannot discharge plaintiff for other ulterior reasons, and arbitrarily say that they were not satisfied with his services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">This refusal was directly contrary to the rule laid down in Summers v. Colver, supra, where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-6\">\u201cHe cannot discharge the plaintiff for the purpose of reducing expenses, and arbitrarily say that he was not satisfied with the artistic and financial management of defendant\u2019s press room by the plaintiff. The dissatisfaction must be real, and it must be sufficient to justify the dismissal of the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">Where the discharge is in fact because of dissatisfaction, and this is undisputed, as was the case in Diamond v. Mendelsohn, supra, any ulterior reason for the discharge is, of course, unimportant and irrelevant. Where, however, the issue is whether the cause assigned for the dismissal was real or assumed, it was error to refuse plaintiff\u2019s request to charge that the defendants could not discharge the plaintiff \u201cfor other ulterior reasons, and arbitrarily say that they were not satisfied with his services.\u201d Taken with the tenor of the charge, as indicated by the foregoing excerpts, this refusal to charge must have been prejudicial, for the jury would be quite likely to fall into the same error with regard to the issue that is exhibited in the respondents\u2019 brief, namely, that it depended upon which version was true as to what was actually said at tbe time plaintiff was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\">The judgment and order appealed from are reversed, and a new trial is ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
