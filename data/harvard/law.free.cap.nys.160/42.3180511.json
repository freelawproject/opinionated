Defendant\u2019s offer was withdrawn before plaintiffs had made their acceptance complete by mailing to defendant the required check. This we think defendant had the right to do and that there was no completed contract of sale. Defendant\u2019s motion for a nonsuit should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-15\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and judgment directed in favor of defendant, dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, with costs to defendant in this court and in the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
