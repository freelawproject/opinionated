The title to the land was in the corporation, which was party to the building and loan agreements mentioned in the complaint. Even had plaintiff wholly controlled the corporation by ownership of every share of its corporate stock, he would not thereby, as a natural person, have legally become the corporation so as 'to bring an independent suit to enforce a corporate right.
