One of the vehicles was owned and operated by Carmen Chilcote, the second owned and operated by Amos Webb, and the third vehicle owned by Von Der Ahe Van Lines and operated by its agent, servant and employee, Eiber Vincent, Jr. Carmen Chilcote and his wife, Gloria May Chilcote, appellants herein, filed suit in the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County against Von Der Ahe, Vincent, and Webb, claiming that all three were liable for appellants\u2019 losses. Von Der Ahe thereupon filed a crossclaim against Webb.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">Appellants executed a Joint Tortfeasor Release in favor of Webb on or about May 25, 1982, releasing him in exchange for $18,500. The relevant portion of that release is set forth in a footnote below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consequently, appellants dismissed their claims against Webb, although Webb still remained in the action as a cross defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>A jury trial was held and on November 9, 1982 the jury returned special verdicts that both Vincent and Webb operated their vehicles in a negligent manner, proximately causing the appellants\u2019 losses and awarded damages of $85,000 to Carmen Chilcote and $25,000 to Carmen and Gloria May Chilcote for loss of consortium. When the trial judge considered the effect of Webb\u2019s release on the verdicts, he ruled that the awards were to be reduced by 50%. Appellants had contended that the verdicts should have been reduced by either the consideration paid for the release ($18,500) or by one-third. Final judgment in the case was entered on February 3, 1983 in favor of Carmen Chilcote against Von Der Ahe Van Lines,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Eiber Vincent, Jr. in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the amount of $42,500 and in favor of Carmen Chilcote and Gloria May Chilcote against Von Der Ahe Van Lines and Eiber Vincent, Jr. in the amount of $12,500. An appeal was noted and the parties have filed, pursuant to Maryland Rule 1029, a joint election for an expedited appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Appellants ask two questions of this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">1. What is the legal effect on the verdicts of the joint tortfeasor\u2019s release given by appellants to Amos E. Webb? and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">2. Did the trial court err in reducing the jury verdicts in favor of appellants by one-half?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Perceiving no error in the lower court proceedings, we shall affirm the judgment of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Md. Ann. Code art. 50, \u00a7 16 <em>et seq. </em>represents the adoption in this State of the Uniform Contribution Among Tort-Feasors Act. When two or more persons are jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property, the right of contribution exists among the two or more joint tortfeasors under the Act. The effect of a release given by the injured party to one of the joint tortfeasors on the other tortfeasors is set forth in Article 50, \u00a7 19:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">A release by the injured person of one joint tort-feasor, whether before or after judgment, does not discharge the other tort-feasors unless the release so provides; but reduces the claim against the other tort-feasors in the amount of the consideration paid for the release, or in any amount or proportion by which the release provides that the total claim shall be reduced, if greater than the consideration paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Further, the effect of a release given by the injured party to one of the joint tortfeasors on the right of contribution is codified in Article 50, \u00a7 20:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>A release by the injured person of one joint tort-feasor does not relieve him from liability to make contribution to another joint tort-feasor unless the release is given before the right of the other tort-feasor to secure a money judgment for contribution has accrued, and provides for a reduction, to the extent of the pro rata share of the released tort-feasor, of the injured person\u2019s damages recoverable against all other tort-feasors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">We recently held that \u00a7 19 applies only in those cases in which a joint tortfeasor released from liability <em>is not relieved </em>from liability to make contribution and that \u00a7 20 applies only in those cases where a joint tortfeasor released from liability to the injured person <em>is relieved </em>from liability to make contribution to another tortfeasor. <em>See, Martinez v. Lopez, </em>54 Md. App. 414, 458 A.2d 1250 (1983). <em>See also, Jones v. Hurst, </em>54 Md. App. 607, 459 A.2d 219 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Thus, we must initially determine whether Webb, as the released joint tortfeasor, was relieved from liability to make contribution to the other tortfeasors. Significantly, and dispositive of the question, the release stated that it was given \"to relieve the said Amos. E. Webb from any liability to make contribution to any other alleged tortfeasor.. .\u201d On this basis, we conclude that Article 50, \u00a7 20 is the operative statutory provision under which the case should be decided. We must therefore determine whether the trial judge properly interpreted the term \"pro rata share\u201d as used in that statute. Appellant\u2019s attempt to rely on the language in \u00a7 19 is entirely misplaced. Pro rata, under \u00a7 20, does not mean a reduction by the amount of consideration paid for the release as contemplated under \u00a7 19. The question of a definition of \"pro rata\u201d has been considered in the past and this Court, appellants\u2019 argument to the contrary notwithstanding, believes those prior decisions are fundamentally sound and controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>In <em>Lahocki v. Contee Sand and Gravel Co., Inc., </em>41 Md. App. 579, 398 A.2d 490 (1979), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>286 Md. 714, 410 A.2d 1039 (1980), we were called upon to provide a definition of \"pro rata share.\u201d Judge Lowe, after first observing that a definition of \"pro rata share\u201d was intentionally left undefined in the statute, opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\">[W]e now hold that the term \"pro rata share\u201d as used in \u00a7 20 does, and will continue to, mean that which <em>Swigert </em>exemplified it to be, <em>i.e., </em>in numerical shares or proportions based on the number of tortfeasors. That interpretation has been accepted and utilized, and because there is no way to determine whether it has, in fact, deterred rather than encouraged settlements, we will not upset the stability of its understood use over three decades.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">41 Md. App. at 621. <em>See, Swigert v. Welk, </em>213 Md. 613, 133 A.2d 428 (1957); <em>Jones v. Hurst, supra, </em>slip op. at 1, n.1. Appellant, however, contends that our reliance and interpretation in <em>Lahocki, supra, </em>on the decision in <em>Swigert, supra, </em>and a paper read before the Barristers Club of Baltimore on March 30, 1948 by Wendell D. Allen entitled \"Joint Tortfeasors; Contribution, Indemnity and Procedure\u201d was misplaced when considered in light of <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>242 Md. 185, 218 A.2d 184 (1966). We have once again reviewed our decision in <em>Lahocki </em>and find it to be well founded both in law and logic. Accordingly, we choose to follow the analysis and holding of that case as it concerns the correlation between pro rata shares and numerical shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Appellants have attempted to have Vincent (the agent) and Von Der Ahe (the principal) viewed as separate tortfeasors for purposes of determining the percentage by which the jury verdict should have been reduced. This issue does not appear to have been decided before in this jurisdiction. For these limited purposes, we hold that Van Der Ahe arid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Vincent stand as one, and as such are accountable for but 50 percent of the fault, along with the 50 percent attributable to Webb. In this type of situation, under a <em>Lahocki </em>numerical pro rata share analysis, both the principal and agent must be counted together in determining the number of tortfeasors. Other jurisdictions which have considered the issue have reached similar results. <em>See, e.g, Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. v. Philadelphia Elec. Co., </em>443 F. Supp. 1140 (E.D. Pa. 1977); <em>Jones v. Harrisburg Polyclinic Hospital, </em>410 A.2d 303 (Pa. 1979), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>437 A.2d 1134 (Pa. 1981); <em>Schnebly v. Baker, </em>217 N.W.2d 708 (Ia. 1974); <em>Reese v. Henke, </em>174 N.W.2d 690 (Minn. 1970); <em>Larsen v. Minneapolis Gas Co., </em>163 N.W.2d 755 (Minn. 1968); <em>Zeglen v. Minkiewicz, </em>191 N.E.2d 450 (N.Y. 1963). <em>Accord, Wassel v. Eglowsky, </em>399 F.Supp. 1330, 1370 (D.Md. 1975), <em>aff'd, </em>542 F.2d 1235 (4th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Further, our position is supported by Section 2 of the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">In determining the pro rata shares of tortfeasors in the entire liability, (a) their relative degrees of fault shall not be considered; (b) if equity requires!,] the collective liability of some as a group shall constitute a single share; and (c) principles of equity applicable to contribution generally shall apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The Commissioners\u2019 Comment to this Uniform Act also sheds some light on the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">[This provision] invokes the rule of equity which requires class liability, including the common liability arising from vicarious relationships, to be treated as a single share. For instance, the liability of a master and servant for the wrong of the servant should in fairness be treated as a single share.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Unif. Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act \u00a7 2, 12 U.L.A. 87 (1955). <em>See also, </em>18 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Contribution </em>\u00a7 56 (1965); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 886A, comment h; W. Prosser, <em>Handbook on the Law of Torts </em>(4th ed. 1971) \u00a7 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Therefore, when contribution among joint tortfeasors is sought, a distinction between primary and derivative liability is recognized for purposes of determining the pro rata share of contribution among the parties found liable. <em>See, Jones v. Harrisburg Polyclinic Hospital, supra, </em>410 A.2d at 1141. Our holding in this respect is strictly limited to an Article 50, \u00a7 20 type of situation. It is no way intended to upset the fundamental and well established principle that a principal remains jointly and severally liable for the torts of his agents committed within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">There was no error committed when the trial judge reduced the jury award by 50 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellants to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-12\">.
