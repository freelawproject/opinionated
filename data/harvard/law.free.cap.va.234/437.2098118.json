Furman sued Linda Marie Thomas Call, alleging that Furman was injured as a result of Call\u2019s negligent operation of a motor vehicle. At the close of Furman\u2019s evidence before a jury, the trial court struck her evidence and entered summary judgment in favor of Call. The court concluded that Furman \u201cfailed to yield the right-of-way, which she was required to do.\u201d Furman has assigned error to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Furman, a podiatrist, had an office in a condominium office complex consisting of 12 offices. A parking area, maintained by the Condominium Association, surrounds the buildings of the complex. Although the complex fronts on a major highway, access to it is limited to two entrances from side streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">The parking area exists for use by \u201c[t]he owners and/or tenants, and their employees, or guests.\u201d A sign at each entrance reads: \u201cPrivate Property, No Soliciting.\u201d The roads around and in the complex, however, have never been closed to the public; the complex is open for vehicular traffic 24 hours a day, seven days a week. No guard or barricade system prevents the public from driving at will through the complex. If a member of the public, as opposed to an owner, tenant, or invitee, parks in the area, the license number of the car is recorded and \u201ca ticket is put on his car.\u201d A second violation results in a \u201cpaper warning\u201d being placed on the windshield. If a third violation occurs, the car is towed away.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">On May 19, 1982, both Furman and Call were leaving the parking area, intending to leave by the same exit. The collision occurred at an intersection of two ways within the complex. The two vehicles approached the intersection approximately the same time and were almost at right angles to one another when they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>collided, with Call\u2019s vehicle to the right of Furman\u2019s. Call\u2019s vehicle collided with the front of Furman\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Relying upon Code \u00a7 46.1-221, the trial court ruled that Call\u2019s vehicle, which was to the right of Furman\u2019s, had the right-of-way and that Furman had failed to yield it. Code \u00a7 46.1-221 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cwhen two vehicles approach or enter an intersection at approximately the same time, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the vehicle on the right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The crucial question, therefore, is whether Code \u00a7 46.1-221 applies to the intersection in the condominium\u2019s parking area. Because the statutory rules of the road only apply to highways, the answer turns on the underlying question whether the parking area is a \u201chighway.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.1-1(10) defines \u201chighway\u201d as \u201c[t]he entire width between the boundary lines of every way or place of whatever nature open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel.\u201d Thus, the test for determining whether a way is a \u201chighway\u201d depends upon the degree to which the way is open to public use for vehicular traffic. <em>See Kay Management </em>v. <em>Creason, </em>220 Va. 820, 831-32, 263 S.E.2d 394, 401 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Furman contends that the evidence established that the parking area was a \u201cprivate road or driveway\u201d as defined by Code \u00a7 46.1-1(22)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; therefore, she says, \u201cThe Rules of the Road,\u201d Article 4, Chapter 4, Title 46.1, including Code \u00a7 46.1-221, do not apply. Furman relies upon <em>Parker </em>v. <em>DeBose, </em>206 Va. 220, 142 S.E.2d 510 (1965), and <em>Prillaman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 401, 100 S.E.2d 4 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\"><em>Parker </em>involved an accident that occurred in a shopping center parking lot. 206 Va. at 221, 142 S.E.2d at 511. However, counsel for both parties had stipulated prior to trial that the collision occurred on private property, that the statutory Rules of the Road were inapplicable, and that the only duty imposed upon both drivers was a duty of reasonable care under the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 222, 142 S.E.2d at 511. Based upon this stipulation, we held that the trial court committed reversible error in giving an instruction based on the statutory Rules of the Road. <em>Id. </em>at 225, 142 S.E.2d at 513. Thus, <em>Parker </em>is inapposite, and Furman\u2019s reliance upon it is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>In <em>Prillaman, </em>we reversed the misdemeanor conviction of a defendant accused of driving on a highway after his license had been revoked. The evidence there showed that Prillaman had driven his car from the rear to the front of a service station lot across service station property. 199 Va. at 402, 100 S.E.2d at 5. We held that the premises were not open to the public\u2019s use for vehicular traffic purposes and, therefore, did not constitute a \u201chighway\u201d within the statutory definition. <em>Id. </em>at 408, 100 S.E.2d at 9. Although the <em>Prillaman </em>Court discussed public maintenance and common enjoyment in evaluating whether a way is a \u201chighway,\u201d that language is dicta. The case was decided solely on the basis of the statutory definition of \u201chighway,\u201d which requires only that the way be \u201copen to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel.\u201d <em>Id. See also Kay Management, </em>220 Va. at 831, 263 S.E.2d at 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">We believe the present case is controlled by our holding in <em>Kay Management. </em>There, the roadways or streets in an apartment complex were privately owned and maintained. However, no evidence showed that the streets were \u201crestricted exclusively to the private use of the apartment dwellers or those persons who visited them,\u201d or that \u201caccess was denied to the public by security guards, gates, or warning signs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 830, 263 S.E.2d at 401. A \u201csingle short paved street or roadway\u201d provided the only entrance to the apartment complex from the public highway. <em>Id. </em>Although the streets \u201cmay have been intended for the primary purpose of providing parking areas for apartment tenants,\u201d the streets \u201ccarried traffic along the travel portions,\u201d and the evidence did not show that they were constructed solely to provide parking spaces. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In <em>Kay Management, </em>we held that \u201cthe evidence of accessibility to the public for free and unrestricted use gave rise to a prima facie presumption that the streets of [the apartment complex] were highways within the definition of Code \u00a7 46.1-1(10).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 832, 263 S.E.2d at 402. Once this presumption arises, the opposing party has the burden \u201cto rebut the presumption by showing that the streets were used for vehicular travel exclusively by the owners and those having either express or implied permission from the owners.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">In the present case, the evidence is undisputed that the roads around and in the condominium complex have always been open to the public 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Access by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>public has never been denied by guards, gates, or any other device. The only signs read: \u201cPrivate Property, <em>No Soliciting </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Clearly, the purpose of the signs is to prohibit soliciting, not the entry of motor vehicles operated by members of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Because Furman has not rebutted this evidence and the resulting presumption that the public has full and unrestricted access to the parking area, we hold that the area is a \u201chighway\u201d as defined by Code \u00a7 46.1-1(10). The trial court, therefore, properly applied Code \u00a7 46.1-1(10) by ruling that Call had the right-of-way and that Furman failed to yield it.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-8\"> Code \u00a7 46.1-1(22) defines a \u201cprivate road or driveway\u201d as \u201c[ejvery way in private ownership and used for vehicular travel by the owner and those having express or implied permission from the owner, but not by other persons.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
