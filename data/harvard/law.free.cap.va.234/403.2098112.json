The trial court imposed the punishment fixed by the jury of 40 years in the penitentiary, entering judgment on November 5, 1984. On March 18, 1986, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court, after considering a number of issues raised by the defendant. <em>Royal </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va. App. 59, 341 S.E.2d 660 (1986). Because of the view we take of the case, we will consider only one of those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">On the day of the crime, the victim, a bilateral amputee fitted with artificial legs, went to the home of a friend. When the victim arrived, defendant and her child, the friend and her two children, and another adult male were present. The victim sat in a chair near the living-dining area and the four adults proceeded to drink wine for approximately an hour. During this period, the victim and defendant were \u201cplaying\u201d and \u201cpassing licks back and forth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">After some time, the adults, except the victim, left the immediate area where the victim was sitting. The victim remained seated in the living room area with defendant\u2019s daughter and another child, Arnita Woods. The victim then drew a pocketknife, displayed it to the children, and said, \u201cI told you nobody\u2019ll be hitting on me.\u201d Defendant\u2019s daughter ran to her mother and indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the victim was threatening the daughter with a knife. Defendant then went to the kitchen, obtained a knife, and plunged the knife into the victim\u2019s chest while he remained seated, according to the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Defendant maintained she killed in self-defense. She testified that the victim, while standing, approached her with a knife in his hand as she returned to the living room area.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">At trial, Arnita Woods, age 10, while testifying as a witness for the Commonwealth, stated that she thought the victim arose from his chair, was standing when stabbed, and then fell back into the chair. This statement conflicted with a tape-recorded statement the child gave the police just after the crime in which she positively stated the victim was seated when stabbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Claiming surprise, the prosecutor sought to use a transcript of the taped statement to \u201crefresh [the witness\u2019] memory.\u201d In the presence of the jury, the witness admitted she had previously stated to the police that the victim \u201cwas sitting down\u201d when he was stabbed. Also, the trial judge, in the presence of the jury, stated that \u201cit is up to the jury to determine whether\u201d the witness\u2019 trial testimony or the extrajudicial statement \u201cis the facts of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Because of the disclosure of the prior statement and because of the trial judge\u2019s remark, the defendant tendered a cautionary instruction. The instruction would have told the jury that the purpose for which the prior statement could be considered was for impeachment purposes only and that the statement was not proof that what the witness said earlier was true. The trial court refused the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Aifirming the trial court, the Court of Appeals held, \u201cThe statement was not admitted for the \u2018purpose\u2019 of \u2018bearing on the witness\u2019 credibility.\u2019 It was for the limited purpose of refreshing the witness\u2019 memory.\u201d 2 Va. App. at 64, 341 S.E.2d at 663. The Court of Appeals erred; the cautionary instruction should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">A prior inconsistent statement is received in evidence exclusively to attack the credibility of the witness who has given different accounts of the facts at different times. The prior statement is not evidence of the truth of the earlier account and the trial court, upon request, must instruct the jury accordingly. <em>Pugh </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 369, 375, 355 S.E.2d 591, 595 (1987). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>In the present case, while the prosecutor used the prior statement ostensibly to \u201crefresh\u201d the witness\u2019 memory, the content of the statement was revealed to the jury. The effect of the revelation was to present to the jury the earlier conflicting assertion that the victim was seated when stabbed, a crucial fact in the case. The prejudicial effect of the revelation, as far as the defendant was concerned, was accentuated by the trial judge\u2019s comment in the presence of the jury that the jury must choose which statement recited the true facts. This was a clear invitation for the jury to decide the truth of the extrajudicial statement, a suggestion that is contrary to the foregoing settled principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Under these circumstances, the trial court had a duty to give a cautionary instruction as requested by the defendant. The court\u2019s failure to do so constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction will be vacated, the order appealed from reversed, and the case remanded to the Court of Appeals with direction to remand the same to the trial court for a new trial, if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
