On April 30, 1986, that Court overturned Turner\u2019s death sentence, but not his conviction, for the trial court\u2019s failure to question prospective jurors about possible bias resulting from the fact that Turner was black and his victim white. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>476 U.S. 28 (1986). The Court remanded the case for further proceedings, and the matter was ultimately returned to the trial court in Southampton County for a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Upon return of the case, the trial court ordered a change of venue to Prince Edward County. In January 1987, a jury drawn from that county heard evidence on the issue of punishment and returned a verdict fixing Turner\u2019s sentence at death, based upon the \u201cvileness\u201d predicate established by Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following receipt of the report of a probation officer, the trial court imposed the death sentence upon Turner. He is here for automatic review of his sentence, as required by Code \u00a7 17-110.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Because the jury based its sentence solely upon the \u201cvileness\u201d predicate, we will recite only the evidence relating to that predicate. The murder in question occurred about 11:30 a.m. on July 12, 1978, at the store of Smith Jewelers in the City of Franklin. Turner entered the store carrying a sawed-off shotgun concealed under a green towel. Brandishing the gun, he forced several customers to line up against a counter and \u201cmotioned\u201d the proprietor, W. Jack Smith, Jr., to place money and jewelry in bags. Smith complied, but surreptitiously activated a silent alarm to police headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Answering the call, Officer Alan D. Bain, Jr., entered the store and announced to Smith that his \u201calarm was on.\u201d In response, Turner pointed his shotgun \u201cright at [Bain\u2019s] face\u201d and directed the officer to remove his revolver from its holster and place it on the floor. When Bain complied, Turner picked up the weapon and put it in his pocket. Again brandishing the shotgun, Turner ordered Smith, to turn off the alarm and to fill more bags with jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">When the telephone rang, Turner directed a customer to answer it and held his shotgun \u201csix to eight inches from [her] ear.\u201d Then, removing Bain\u2019s revolver from his pocket, Turner fired a shot toward the rear of the store and announced that \u201cif he saw or heard any more police officers he was going to start killing.\u201d At that time, Bain heard \u201ca siren go off.\u201d Turner then walked over to the counter where Smith was standing and \u201cjust pointed [Bain\u2019s revolver] and fired.\u201d Smith fell to the floor, bleeding from a wound to his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Bain remonstrated with Turner not to shoot anyone else and \u201coffered to take him out of the store [and] to carry the stuff and take him anywhere he wanted to go.\u201d Turner said that he \u201cwasn\u2019t going to hurt [Bain]\u201d but that he was \u201cgoing to kill [Smith] for snitching on [him].\u201d As Smith lay \u201cgurgling\u201d on the floor behind the counter, Turner \u201creached over the counter,\u201d pointed Bain\u2019s revolver at Smith, and fired twice into his chest. Smith \u201cjumped\u201d as he was shot and did not move \u201cany more after that.\u201d Bain then disarmed Turner and held him at bay until help arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Medical testimony showed that Smith died from the bullet wounds to his chest, either one of which would have been fatal independently. While the wound to the head was not sufficient by itself to cause death, it did produce \u201cbleeding on the coverings of the brain\u201d and bruising of \u201cthe brain surface.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\n<em>JURY SELECTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Before the sentencing hearing began, the prosecution and the defense agreed that prospective jurors should be advised that Turner had been sentenced to death previously for Smith\u2019s murder. The court so advised the prospective jurors and cautioned them that Turner\u2019s prior sentence should not \u201caffect [the] verdict in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">When prospective juror Samuel Lambert was examined individually on voir dire, Turner moved to strike him for cause on the ground his responses indicated that knowledge of the prior death sentence would \u201caffect his deliberations\u201d in the present case. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Turner cites the following exchange between Lambert and defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">MR. SNOOK [defense counsel]: Now the Judge . . . told you that Mr. Turner had been sentenced to death one time in an earlier trial.... How are you going to feel about knowing that he\u2019d been sentenced to death once before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">JUROR LAMBERT: Well, it wouldn\u2019t make me feel good about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">MR. SNOOK: Could you really put it out of your mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">JUROR LAMBERT: Well, I don\u2019t know about that. That\u2019s a hard thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-11\">MR. SNOOK: Do you think it might continue to affect you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-12\">JUROR LAMBERT: Probably will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-13\">MR. SNOOK: You say you think you can [put everything else aside and base your sentence on what you hear in this courtroom?] You have some doubt about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-14\">JUROR LAMBERT: Well .... [a]fter ... you hear the lawyers and I guess that\u2019s what I think about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-15\">MR. SNOOK: [I]f you\u2019re going to continue to think about what happened in that other trial and if that might still affect your decision, then ... we need to have you be honest with us and tell us that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-16\">JUROR LAMBERT: Well, it might affect me .... You know, I\u2019ll be thinking about it, I guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>MR. SNOOK: And so the Judge would tell you that you\u2019re not supposed to do that but you think you might anyway [?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">JUROR LAMBERT: Well, I might.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">MR. SNOOK: Do you think you probably would [let it affect you?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">JUROR LAMBERT: Well, I would think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">MR. SNOOK: You probably would be thinking about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">JUROR LAMBERT: Probably would be thinking about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Turner argues that the foregoing exchange shows Lambert \u201ccould not unequivocally state that he could put aside . . . knowledge\u201d of Turner\u2019s prior death sentence. Hence, Turner concludes, he was deprived of a jury \u201cable to \u2018stand indifferent in the cause.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">We disagree with Turner. While the foregoing excerpt from Lambert\u2019s voir dire examination might tend to indicate some doubt concerning this prospective juror\u2019s objectivity, we must view the voir dire as a whole, rather than in isolated parts. <em>See Pruett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 266, 281, 351 S.E.2d 1, 10 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>482 U.S. __, 107 S.Ct. 3220 (1987). When the examination of Lambert is so viewed, any doubt about his impartiality is removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">Other parts of Lambert\u2019s voir dire show that he felt the death penalty was appropriate in some cases, but not in all, and that \u201c[n]ot every case\u201d of murder in an armed robbery warranted imposition of the extreme penalty. Whether death should be imposed, Lambert opined, \u201cdepend [s] on how [the murder] happened.\u201d Lambert also said that he would not give Turner the death sentence \u201cmerely because [he was] charged with . . . and convicted of murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">Lambert\u2019s voir dire responses demonstrated further that he would \u201cbe able to consider voting for a sentence less than death such as the alternative sentence of life imprisonment.\u201d He responded affirmatively when asked whether he would feel \u201cfree to make [his] own mind up based on what [he heard in the courtroom] . . . and not [on] what. . . happened before.\u201d And, importantly, he gave an affirmative response to the specific question whether he could refrain from considering \u201cthe fact that [Turner had] been sentenced [to death] in a prior hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>All in all, we think that Lambert\u2019s voir dire examination produced nothing that \u201cwould prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.\u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>448 U.S. 38, 45 (1980); <em>Boggs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 229 </em>Va. 501, 515, 331 S.E.2d 407, 417 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1031 (1986). The question whether a prospective juror stands indifferent in the cause is basically factual, and its resolution requires the exercise of judicial discretion. <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 469, 480, 331 S.E.2d 422, 431 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1099 (1986). We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s refusal to strike prospective juror Lambert for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">\n<em>RESENTENCING AUTHORITY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Turner argues that the trial court had no authority to resentence him. He states that under <em>Wm. Patterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 222 </em>Va. 653, 283 S.E.2d 212 (1981), he had the right to be sentenced by the same jury that convicted him and that since this was no longer possible, the only recourse was for the trial court to sentence him to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In <em>Patterson, </em>we overturned the defendant\u2019s death sentence because the trial court had failed to question prospective jurors about their predisposition to impose the death penalty. 222 Va. at 659, 283 S.E.2d at 216. We held further that because Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3(C) did not permit resentencing by a new jury, we were compelled to commute the defendant\u2019s sentence to life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 660, 283 S.E.2d at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Turner acknowledges that following the <em>Patterson </em>decision, the General Assembly in 1983 amended Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3(C) to permit resentencing of a capital defendant by a different jury where a prior sentence of death has been set aside or declared invalid. Turner also acknowledges that in <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 468, 475-76, 323 S.E.2d 114, 118 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1025 (1985), we upheld the 1983 amendment against the contention that it constituted an <em>ex post facto </em>law.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Turner argues, however, that we wrongly decided in <em>Evans </em>that the 1983 amendment represented a procedural rather than a substantive change. He opines that in deciding the change was procedural and not an <em>ex post facto </em>violation, we incorrectly relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>upon <em>Dobbert </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>432 U.S. 282 (1977), when <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>170 U.S. 343 (1898), was the controlling authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">In <em>Dobbert, </em>the law in effect at the time the capital offense was committed made a jury\u2019s recommendation of mercy binding upon the court. By the time of trial, the law had been changed to make the jury\u2019s recommendation merely advisory. The jury recommended a life sentence, but the trial court rejected the recommendation and sentenced the defendant to death. The Supreme Court affirmed, holding that \u201cthe changes in the law [were] procedural, and on the whole ameliorative, and that there [was] no <em>ex post facto </em>violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In <em>Thompson, </em>the alleged offense of grand larceny was committed when Utah was still a territory, at which time the law required a 12-member jury for the trial of a felony. The defendant was tried after Utah was admitted to the Union, and he was convicted by an 8-member jury, as permitted by the new state\u2019s constitution. The Supreme Court held that the change from a 12-member to an 8-member jury constituted an <em>ex post facto </em>violation. 170 U.S. at 355. In reaching its decision, the Court characterized the change in law as substantive, rather than procedural, and as one altering the situation to the defendant\u2019s disadvantage. <em>Id. </em>at 352-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">We think that <em>Thompson </em>is inapposite and that <em>Dobbert </em>is controlling. The distinguishing features between <em>Thompson, </em>on the one hand, and <em>Dobbert </em>and the present case, on the other, are expressed in <em>Dobbert </em>in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">In the case at hand, the change in the statute was clearly procedural. The new statute simply altered the methods employed in determining whether the death penalty was to be imposed; there was no change in the quantum of punishment attached to the crime. The following language from <em>Hopt </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>[110 U.S. 574 (1884)], applicable with equal force to the case at hand, summarizes our conclusion that the change was procedural and not a violation of the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">\u201cThe crime for which the present defendant was indicted, the punishment prescribed therefor, and the quantity or the degree of proof necessary to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>his guilt, all remained unaffected by the subsequent statute.\u201d 110 U.S., at 589-590.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">432 U.S. at 293-94. We reaffirm <em>Evans, </em>and hold that the 1983 amendment to Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3(C) did not constitute a violation of the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">\n<em>PAROLE ELIGIBILITY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Before the sentencing hearing began, Turner moved the trial court to permit evidence, argument, or instructions on the subject of his eligibility for parole. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Turner contends this denial was error. He acknowledges the rule in Virginia that evidence or comment concerning parole eligibility is improper, and he admits the rule is designed to benefit defendants. He maintains, however, that in practical effect the rule is detrimental to capital defendants because \u201cjurors know that life termers are eligible for parole\u201d and that to refuse the admission of \u201ctruthful information about parole eligibility is to cause the jury to err on the side of fear.\u201d Hence, Turner concludes, the rule barring evidence of parole eligibility \u201cimproperly increases the risk that the jury would impose [the] death [penalty]\u201d in violation of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">In <em>Turner I, </em>we rejected as without merit a contention that \u201cthe jury should have been given an instruction concerning the possibility of parole.\u201d 221 Va. at 531, 273 S.E.2d at 48. As authority for our ruling, we cited <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 201, 214, 257 S.E.2d 784, 792 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1049 (1980), and <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 220 </em>Va. 260, 278, 257 S.E.2d 808, 821 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980). Since <em>Turner I, </em>we have rejected similar contentions in other capital murder cases, including <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 289, 296-97, 302 S.E.2d 520, 525, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 865 (1983), <em>Poyner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 401, 433, 329 S.E.2d 815, 828, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 888 (1985), and <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 168, 178-79, 360 S.E.2d 361, 367-68 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. ___ 108 S.Ct. 733 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">We perceive no reason to depart from this line of cases. Neither <em>California </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>463 U.S. 992 (1983) (instruction on power of governor to commute life sentence without possibility of parole constitutionally permissible but not constitutionally required), nor <em>Skipper </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>476 U.S. 1 (1986) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>(evidence of defendant\u2019s past good behavior relevant and admissible as indicative of probable future conduct), cited by Turner, requires a different result. Accordingly, we again reject Turner\u2019s contention regarding parole eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">\n<em>VILENESS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Turner maintains that the murder involved in this case \u201cwas not \u2018vile\u2019 within any constitutional meaning of the Virginia capital sentencing statute.\u201d He apparently does not base his complaint upon the facial unconstitutionality of the statute, but upon the proposition that the statutory language defining \u201cvileness\u201d is \u201cintrinsically vague and overbroad.\u201d If we read him incorrectly on this point and he does complain of facial unconstitutionality, we find the complaint without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">In the very first case we decided under the present death penalty statute, we held that the statutory definitions of the two predicates for imposition of the death penalty, <em>viz., </em>\u201cdangerousness\u201d and \u201cvileness,\u201d are not \u201cso vague as to vest the sentencing authority with standardless sentencing power.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 477, 248 S.E.2d 135, 148 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979) (rejecting defense argument of facial unconstitutionality). We have maintained this view consistently since <em>Smith, </em>without reversal, and we see no reason to change our view now.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Turner does argue, citing <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>446 U.S. 420 (1980), that Virginia is constitutionally required to restrict the use of its \u201cvileness\u201d test to cases that \u201clie at the core.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429. He then asserts that his case does not \u201clie at the core\u201d of death penalty cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">The statutory basis for the \u201cvileness\u201d test is found in Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2. This section states in pertinent part that a sentence of death may not be imposed unless the court or jury finds the defendant\u2019s conduct in committing the offense \u201coutrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind <em>or </em>an aggravated battery to the victim.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">The trial court in its instructions permitted the jury to consider the elements of depravity of mind and aggravated battery. In its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>verdict, the jury found that Turner\u2019s conduct in committing the offense \u201cinvolved depravity of mind; aggravated battery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Turner says the court should not have permitted the jury to consider depravity of mind. He argues that we \u201cdid not approve [the jury\u2019s] finding of depravity of mind\u201d in <em>Turner I </em>and that the trial court should have been bound in the present case by our \u201cearlier opinion on the subject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The fact is that we neither approved nor disapproved the depravity-of-mind finding in <em>Turner I. </em>We found the evidence sufficient to establish that \u201cTurner committed an \u2018aggravated battery.\u2019 \u201d 221 Va. at 527, 273 S.E.2d at 45. As indicated <em>supra, </em>the terms \u201cdepravity of mind\u201d and \u201caggravated battery\u201d are used in Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2 in the disjunctive. It was not necessary, therefore, to discuss depravity of mind in <em>Turner I. See Watkins, </em>229 Va. at 489, 331 S.E.2d at 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">We could take the same course here because we again find the evidence sufficient to establish an aggravated battery. In <em>Smith, </em>we defined the term \u201caggravated battery\u201d as one \u201cwhich, qualitatively and quantitatively, is more culpable than the minimum necessary to accomplish an act of murder.\u201d 219 Va. at 478, 248 S.E.2d at 149. We think that the evidence of Turner\u2019s conduct in killing his victim meets this definition clearly and completely.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">It would be well, however, to put the depravity-of-mind problem to rest because Turner suggests the jury may have been misled by including this element in instructions when, he says, the element was unsupported by evidence. In <em>Smith, </em>we defined the term \u201cdepravity of mind\u201d to mean \u201ca degree of moral turpitude and psychical debasement surpassing that inherent in the definition of ordinary legal malice and premeditation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We think that the evidence of Turner\u2019s conduct in killing his victim also meets this standard clearly and completely.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">\n<em>CLOSING ARGUMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">During closing argument, defense counsel told the jury that the \u201creverence for . . . human life\u201d made difficult the decision \u201cto put Willie Turner to death.\u201d Continuing, counsel stated that the jury\u2019s decision was not merely to put Turner \u201caway for a few years\u201d but \u201cto execute him, to have him electrocuted . . . [t]o strap him in an electric chair and have twenty-five hundred volts \u2014.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">At this point, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney objected, and the trial court sustained the objection. Defense counsel apologized to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>the court, but then made a statement to the jury about having Turner \u201cin the electric chair [to] be electrocuted.\u201d Again, the prosecutor objected, and the court stated, \u201cI sustain the objection to any reference of how electrocution can be carried out.\u201d When defense counsel persisted, the trial judge said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s proper argument and I would ask the jury to disregard any method of execution, which may change from time to time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">On appeal, Turner says that \u201c[i]t is the sustaining of the second objection, and the ruling that prohibited any further argument mentioning electrocution, that is the error complained of.\u201d Turner maintains the ruling was erroneous for two reasons: First, it is proper in a capital case for defense counsel \u201cto mention electrocution and the electric chair in asking the jury ... to exercise their discretion to sentence the defendant to life imprisonment\u201d; second, the argument was a proper response to the prosecutor\u2019s actions in asking prospective jurors on voir dire whether they could vote to send someone to the electric chair and in stating to the jury during closing argument that if there was any doubt Turner deserved \u201cthe chair,\u201d the doubt would have \u201cto come from [the] evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">We reject Turner\u2019s arguments out of hand. Turner admits on brief: \u201cTo remind the jury that the method of execution prescribed in this state (as it has been for 79 years) is electrocution is only reminding them of something they surely already knew.\u201d Hence, if there was any error in the trial court\u2019s ruling prohibiting further mention of electrocution, a matter we do not decide, the error was certainly harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">\n<em>INSTRUCTIONS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Turner argues the trial court erred in refusing to grant his tendered instructions 1A, IB, 1C, ID, and IE. Turner says he merely wanted, through these instructions, to have the jury told that it could return a verdict for a life sentence even though it found aggravating circumstances but no mitigating factor, that the burden was upon the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the death penalty should be imposed, and that the death penalty is reserved for the most outrageous or wantonly vile, horrible, and inhuman murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The difficulty with Turner\u2019s argument is that the trial court in other instructions informed the jury fully of all the essential elements it must find beyond a reasonable doubt before fixing Turner\u2019s punishment at death. Yet, the court\u2019s instructions left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>the jury free to fix the sentence at life imprisonment if it found neither \u201cdangerousness\u201d nor \u201cvileness\u201d had been proven, or if it believed the death penalty was not justified, or if it found any matter concerning the offense or the offender which extenuated or reduced the degree of moral culpability or blame. On the other hand, the instructions offered by Turner tended to be repetitive and argumentative and to misstate the law. We find no error, therefore, in the trial court\u2019s refusal of Turner\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">\n<em>DEATH PENALTY DISCRIMINATORILY BASED UPON RACE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In the trial court, Turner proffered \u201ccertain statistical evidence concerning the discriminatory impact of the death sentence in Virginia.\u201d Turner told the court he was proffering the evidence in anticipation of the decision in <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>then pending in the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Since Turner\u2019s proffer in the trial court, the Supreme Court has decided <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>rejecting a statistical study of alleged racial discrimination in death penalty cases in Georgia. 481 U.S. __, 107 S.Ct. 1756 (1987). Turner admits that, as a result, \u201ca capital defendant cannot adduce statistical evidence of disparate impact to prove that an entire statutory scheme is invalid.\u201d He asks this Court, however, \u201cto hold to the contrary.\u201d We decline the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">\n<em>SENTENCE REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">Under Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C), this Court must determine whether \u201cthe sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\u201d We must also determine whether the sentence is \u201cexcessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">Turner makes no direct contention that his death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor, but says that \u201c[imposition of the death sentence in this case would be disproportionate to the crime, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, and would be evidence of passion or prejudice.\u201d In any event, we find no evidence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor involved in Turner\u2019s sentence and will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>confine our consideration, therefore, to the question of excessiveness or disproportionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">In making our proportionality review, we have accumulated \u201cthe records of all capital felony cases ... as a guide in determining whether the sentence imposed in the case under review is excessive.\u201d Code \u00a7 17-110.1(E). Where, as here, the basis of the imposition of the death sentence is \u201cvileness,\u201d we give particular attention to those cases in which the death penalty was based upon the same predicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Turner cites prior cases where the \u201cvileness\u201d involved was admittedly greater than the \u201cvileness\u201d present here. <em>E.g., Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 615, 292 S.E.2d 798 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1228 (1983) (rape-robbery-murder victim cut at least 184 times with machete and knife). But no concept of proportionality requires that each new capital murder case equal in horror the worst possible scenario yet encountered, else the death penalty may not be imposed. As we said in <em>Turner T. </em>\u201cWhile the atrociousness involved in Turner\u2019s murder does not rise to the level evidenced in Stamper,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>James Dyral Briley,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>or <em>Coppola,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> T</em>urner\u2019s murder is just as brutal as the murders in <em>Linwood Earl Briley</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Clark</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>. . . .\u201d 221 Va. at 530, 273 S.E.2d at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">In a proportionality review, we inquire whether \u201cjuries in this jurisdiction generally approve the supreme penalty for comparable or similar crimes.\u201d <em>Stamper, </em>220 Va. at 284, 257 S.E.2d at 824. Considering both \u201cthe crime and the defendant\u201d (Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(2)), we can say with confidence that juries in this jurisdiction generally approve the supreme penalty for offenses comparable to the murder committed by Turner. Indeed, recently, we cited <em>Turner I </em>in demonstrating that a death sentence imposed upon a different defendant was not \u201cexcessive or disproportionate to sentences generally imposed by juries in Virginia for similar crimes.\u201d <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 130, 139, 360 S.E.2d 196, 203 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. _, 108 S.Ct. 763 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>(1988) (\u201cvileness\u201d found in murder of store owner shot three times during struggle with robber).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Finding no error in the record or any other reason to disturb Turner\u2019s death sentence, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-12\"> Although Turner had a record of serious crimes of violence and the trial court\u2019s instructions included the \u201cdangerousness\u201d predicate, the jury did not base the sentence of death upon that predicate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b574-10\"><em> </em>Turner argues that we must apply stricter standards for determining \u201cvileness\u201d or else face the risk of having the present standards declared unconstitutional.
