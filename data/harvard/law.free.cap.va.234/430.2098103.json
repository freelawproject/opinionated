West sued Kensington Associates (Kensington) and its employee, Willis Chittum, to recover damages for personal injuries West incurred when he was accidentally shot by Chittum. A jury returned a verdict for West in the amount of $200,000 against both Kensington and Chittum, and the trial court entered judgment on the verdict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kensington alone appeals, contending that Chittum, as a matter of law, acted outside the scope of his employment when he shot West.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">West was employed by United Services Industries (United Services). Kensington, owner of the former Johnston-Willis Hospital building in Richmond, contracted with United Services to renovate the hospital building. United Services provided on-site living quarters for its construction workers, including West.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">Kensington employed Chittum as a security guard at the site. Chittum was responsible for protecting Kensington\u2019s property, securing the building, and preventing vandalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>While on duty, Chittum carried a pistol in a holster. Kensington\u2019s officials knew that Chittum carried a pistol and acknowledged that he was armed for Kensington\u2019s benefit. Kensington\u2019s officials had told Chittum to call the police if any trouble arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">On various occasions before West was shot, Chittum had engaged in horseplay with Willie Archie, another United Services construction worker. On those occasions, Chittum had removed the pistol from the holster and waved it around to scare Archie.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">West was shot on the night of May 13, 1981. That night, while on duty and after completing his rounds through the building, Chittum stopped in the hallway outside the workers\u2019 recreation room. He believed that Archie was in the room; Chittum, however, did not know that West was there. As Chittum was in the act of removing his pistol from the holster, the pistol discharged and the bullet struck West in the foot. Chittum testified that the shooting resulted from \u201chorseplay.\u201d He said he pulled the pistol to have \u201cfun\u201d with Archie, not to protect Kensington\u2019s property. Chittum also stated that he had drunk a \u201ccouple of beers\u201d at the time, although drinking while on duty was prohibited by Kensington. Kensington\u2019s officials had instructed Chittum not to bother the construction workers and not to go into the recreation room.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>an employer is liable for the tortious act of his employee if the employee was performing his employer\u2019s business and acting within the scope of his employment. <em>McNeill </em>v. <em>Spindler, </em>191 Va. 685, 694, 62 S.E.2d 13, 17 (1950). Generally, an act is within the scope of the employment if (1) it was expressly or impliedly directed by the employer, or is naturally incident to the business, and (2) it was performed, although mistakenly or ill-advisedly, with the intent to further the employer\u2019s interest, or from some impulse or emotion that was the natural consequence of an attempt to do the employer\u2019s business, \u201cand did not arise wholly from some external, independent, and personal motive on the part of the [employee] to do the act upon his own account.\u201d <em>Broaddus </em>v. <em>Standard Drug Co., </em>211 Va. 645, 653, 179 S.E.2d 497, 503-04 (1971); <em>Cary </em>v. <em>Hotel Rueger, Inc., </em>195 Va. 980, 984, 81 S.E.2d 421, 423 (1954); <em>Tri-State Coach Corp. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>188 Va. 299, 307, 49 S.E.2d 363, 367 (1948); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>133 Va. 69, 77, 112 S.E. 628, 630-31 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">When an employer-employee relationship has been established, \u201cthe burden is on the [employer] to prove that the [employee] was <em>not </em>acting within the scope of his employment when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>he committed the act complained of, and ... if the evidence leaves the question in doubt it becomes an issue to be determined by the jury.\u201d <em>Broaddus, </em>211 Va. at 653-54, 179 S.E.2d at 504 (emphasis added); <em>Alvey </em>v. <em>Butchkavitz, </em>196 Va. 447, 453, 84 S.E.2d 535, 539 (1954); <em>McNeill, </em>191 Va. at 695, 62 S.E.2d at 18. <em>Accord Bivens </em>v. <em>Manhattan Car Corp., </em>156 Va. 483, 159 S.E. 395 (1931); <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>145 Va. 489, 134 S.E. 576 (1926). Moreover, when the undisputed evidence shows that an employee\u2019s deviation from his employer\u2019s business is slight and not unusual, or, on the other hand, great and unusual, a court shall determine, as a matter of law, whether the employee was acting in the scope of his employment. When, however, the evidence places the case between these two extremes, the issue is for a jury. <em>E.g., Broaddus, </em>211 Va. at 653-54, 179 S.E.2d at 504; <em>Alvey, </em>196 Va. at 454, 84 S.E.2d at 539; <em>McNeill, </em>191 Va. at 695, 62 S.E.2d at 18; <em>Bivens, </em>156 Va. at 495, 159 S.E, at 399; <em>Drake </em>v. <em>Laundry Corp., </em>135 Va. 354, 363-64, 116 S.E. 668, 671 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Applying the foregoing principles, we held in <em>Broaddus </em>that the trial court properly submitted to the jury the issue of whether a security guard had acted within the scope of his employment when he shot a person whom a policeman was attempting to subdue. 211 Va. at 655-56, 179 S.E.2d at 505-06. The evidence presented in <em>Broaddus </em>did not show as a matter of law that the guard\u2019s deviation from his assigned duties was either slight or marked and unusual. <em>Id. </em>at 655, 179 S.E.2d at 505. We said the jury reasonably could have found that the guard\u2019s shooting of the person was either an independent venture of his own or done from some impulse or emotion that naturally grew out of or was incident to an attempt to perform his master\u2019s business. <em>Id. </em>at 656, 179 S.E.2d at 506. <em>Accord United Brotherhood </em>v. <em>Humphreys, </em>203 Va. 781, 787-88, 127 S.E.2d 98, 102-03 (1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>371 U.S. 954 (1963) (question whether assaults committed by striking union members were personally motivated or incident to performance of strike activities directed by international union properly left to jury\u2019s resolution); <em>Slaughter </em>v. <em>Valleydale Packers, </em>198 Va. 339, 345, 94 S.E.2d 260, 265 (1956) (reversing and remanding on ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that instruction did not permit jury to consider whether defamatory statements were made out of impulse or emotion that naturally grew out of or was incident to attempt to perform master\u2019s business); <em>Tri-State Coach Corp., </em>188 Va. at 308-09, 49 S.E.2d at 368 (question whether bus driver\u2019s use of \u201cvocal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>insistence and physical force\u201d to clear a path to move his bus resulted from impulse or emotion arising out of prosecution of master\u2019s business properly submitted to jury). <em>Cf. Davis, </em>133 Va. at 77-78, 112 S.E. at 630-32 (jury could reasonably conclude that railroad gateman was acting within scope of employment when he shot plaintiff following dispute over raising gates at late hour of night).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">In a similar vein, we held in <em>Alvey </em>that conflicts in the evidence presented a jury question about whether the night manager of a service station was engaged in the owner\u2019s business when the manager accidentally shot the plaintiff while cleaning a loaded pistol. 196 Va. at 454, 84 S.E.2d at 539. The evidence concerning ownership of the gun was in direct conflict, and we said the jury reasonably could have inferred that the owner provided the manager with the gun for \u201cprotection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455, 84 S.E.2d at 540. <em>See also Bryant </em>v. <em>Bare, </em>192 Va. 238, 247, 64 S.E.2d 741, 747 (1951) (question whether employee permitted to use employer\u2019s truck for both personal benefit and employer\u2019s benefit had abandoned employer\u2019s business at time of accident properly submitted to jury); <em>Crowell, </em>145 Va. at 505, 134 S.E. at 580 (question whether taxi driver engaged in personal or master\u2019s business one for jury\u2019s resolution where evidence showed driver, who had complete discretion in operation of owner\u2019s taxi, was operating marked taxi during business hours in usual field of operations at high rate of speed when he ran into plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">On the other hand, we upheld a trial court\u2019s ruling in <em>McNeill </em>that the undisputed evidence established a deliveryman\u2019s deviation from his employer\u2019s business so great that, as a matter of law, the deliveryman was not acting within his scope of employment at the time he collided with another vehicle. 191 Va. at 695-96, 62 S.E.2d at 18. There, the uncontradicted evidence showed that the employer had entrusted the deliveryman with a truck to run a specific errand and had given him specific instructions where to return it. The employee had disobeyed the instructions and driven the truck to another part of town to carry out a personal matter. <em>Id. </em>We there noted that a marked deviation was shown. There was a complete stepping aside from the employer\u2019s business that was in no way related to the employer\u2019s affairs and was completely contrary to the employer\u2019s instructions. <em>Id. Accord Master Auto Serv. Corp. </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>179 Va. 507, 511, 19 S.E.2d 679, 680-81 (1942); <em>Kavanaugh </em>v. <em>Wheeling, </em>175 Va. 105, 117, 7 S.E.2d 125, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>130 (1940); <em>Western Union Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>160 Va. 674, 682, 169 S.E. 574, 577 (1933); <em>Bivens, </em>156 Va. at 487, 159 S.E. at 396; <em>Kidd </em>v. <em>DeWitt, Jr., </em>128 Va. 438, 448, 105 S.E. 124, 127 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">In <em>Cary, </em>we held as a matter of law that an argument between a hotel bellboy and two hotel guests that resulted in the bellboy\u2019s fatally shooting one of the guests did not arise out of anything connected with the hotel\u2019s business. 195 Va. at 986-87, 81 S.E.2d at 424. The undisputed evidence in <em>Cary </em>established that the argument arose over whether the bellboy owed money to the guests for activities involving the trafficking of women and liquor \u2014 conduct that was illegal and prohibited by the hotel. Thus, we held the bellboy\u2019s shooting of one of the guests \u201carose from an independent and personal motive on [his part] to do the act upon his own account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 987, 81 S.E.2d at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Similarly, in <em>Abernathy </em>v. <em>Romaczyk, </em>202 Va. 328, 334, 117 S.E.2d 88, 92-93 (1960), we reversed a court-approved jury verdict and held as a matter of law that a deliveryman was not acting within the scope of his employment when he participated in a scuffle over who had caused a traffic accident. We drew a distinction between the facts of <em>Abernathy </em>and <em>Tri-State Coach Corp. </em>on the basis that the altercation in <em>Tri-State Coach Corp. </em>arose over the manner in which the bus driver was operating the bus and over who had the right to proceed. In <em>Tri-State Coach Corp., </em>the turn of the bus had not been negotiated and both vehicles stood close together, resulting in a stalemate about which vehicle should move first. In <em>Abernathy, </em>however, the undisputed evidence showed that after the accident occurred and as the other driver was returning to his vehicle following an inspection of the damage, the deliveryman alighted from his truck, approached the other driver before he had entered his car, and engaged in an argument that resulted in the scuffle. Thus, we held that the deliveryman\u2019s participation in the fracas was \u201can independent venture of his own to gratify his personal feelings, and the relation of master and servant was for a time suspended.\u201d 202 Va. at 334, 117 S.E.2d at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">We are of opinion that the present case falls within the ambit of <em>McNeill, Cary, </em>and <em>Abernathy. </em>Kensington\u2019s officials had given Chittum specific instructions not to \u201cbother\u201d the construction workers. The undisputed evidence established, however, that Chittum engaged in horseplay in an attempt to scare Archie when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>he injured West. In addition, Chittum had been drinking at the time, which Kensington officials strictly prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The shooting occurred immediately after Chittum had completed his security check of the building, during which time he found no evidence of vandals or trespassers. Following the completion of the security check, Chittum\u2019s next duty was to return to his desk and let employees and construction workers in and out of the building. Instead, he tarried, intending to have a little \u201cfun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Neither the \u201chorseplay\u201d nor the resulting shooting was done to further Kensington\u2019s interests, but arose wholly from an independent, external, and personal motive on Chittum\u2019s part to perform an act upon his own account. When Chittum undertook to draw his pistol, he embarked upon an independent venture to satisfy his own personal desire to have \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cplay\u201d around, thus suspending for a time the employer-employee relationship. We hold, therefore, that his reckless act was such a great and unusual deviation from Kensington\u2019s business that the question whether he acted outside the scope of his employment was one of law for the court rather than one of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Deciding that question against West, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter final judgment here for Kensington.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-13\"> West also sued United Services Industries. The jury, however, returned a verdict in favor of this defendant, which the trial court affirmed. West did not assign cross-error to this ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b453-14\"> Although West\u2019s pleadings contain allegations of Kensington\u2019s primary negligence, the case was tried and appealed on only the <em>respondeat superior </em>theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
