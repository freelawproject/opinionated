Jones filed a petition for a writ of mandamus requesting the trial court to compel Beryl T. Carter, Director of Personnel for the City of Richmond; Jack W. Fulton, the City\u2019s Director of Public Safety; and Frank S. Duling, the City\u2019s Chief of Police (collectively, the officials), to promote Jones to the rank of captain in the City\u2019s Bureau of Police, retroactive to December 31, 1983, and to compensate him with back pay from that date. The City\u2019s Personnel Board (the Board) had ordered such relief for Jones. The trial court, adopting the officials\u2019 contention that the Board\u2019s order exceeded the Board\u2019s authority, dismissed the petition. In this appeal, we consider whether the Board was empowered to order the challenged remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">The facts are undisputed. Jones was one of seven police lieutenants certified as eligible for promotion to two vacant captain positions in the Bureau of Police. Of those certified, Jones was the only black person. Two white persons were promoted. The candidates had been ranked numerically. The two men promoted were ranked first and third, respectively, and Jones was ranked seventh.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">Jones subsequently filed a complaint under the City\u2019s grievance procedure, alleging that he had been denied the promotion because of his race. His complaint ultimately reached the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">Following an evidentiary hearing, the Board unanimously found that Jones was one of the two best-qualified candidates for the rank of captain, that he had been discriminated against on the basis of his race, and that the City\u2019s policies and procedures had been violated in the promotion process. Based upon these findings, the Board ordered Fulton to promote Jones to the rank of captain, effective retroactively to December 31, 1983, and to compensate him with back pay from that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>The City\u2019s Acting Director of Personnel concluded that the remedy ordered was contrary to law. Consequently, the officials refused to carry out the Board\u2019s order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The dispositive question in this appeal, therefore, is whether the Board had the power to order retroactive promotion and back pay for Jones upon a finding of racial discrimination and violation of the City\u2019s policies and procedures in the promotion process.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">The City\u2019s grievance procedure is mandated by Code \u00a7 15.1-7.1, which provides in pertinent part that \u201cthe governing body of every . . . city . . . which has more than fifteen employees shall have a grievance procedure . . . that affords an immediate and fair method for the resolution of disputes which may arise between [the] public employer and its employees . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The powers of the Board are set forth in Section 9.05 of the City\u2019s charter, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">The personnel board shall have the power and shall be required:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">(b) To hear appeals from any action pertaining to classification, reclassification and allocation of positions and from any disciplinary action suspending, reducing in rank or pay or removing any officer or employee in the classified service, as hereinafter provided, and to report in writing its findings and decisions on such appeal to the officer whose action is the subject of the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Code \u00a7 15.1-7.2 requires that the City\u2019s grievance procedure shall \u201cfully and closely complfy] with the definition of a grievance and the minimum provisions of the state grievance procedure as described in \u00a7 2.1-114.5:1.\u201d In determining the Board\u2019s powers, therefore, we must look not only at the City\u2019s grievance procedure, but at the Commonwealth\u2019s as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Code \u00a7 2.1-114.5:1 sets forth the Commonwealth\u2019s grievance procedure and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">[T]he grievance procedure shall afford an immediate and fair method for the resolution of disputes which may arise be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>tween an agency and its employees. The grievance procedure shall include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">A. <em>Definition of grievance. </em>\u2014 A grievance shall be a complaint . . . including . . . (iv) complaints of discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed, political affiliation, age, handicap, national origin or sex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">B. <em>Management responsibilities. </em>\u2014 Management reserves the exclusive right to manage the affairs and operations of state government. Accordingly, the following complaints are nongrievable: . . . (iv) failure to promote except where the employee can show established promotional policies or procedures were not followed or applied fairly; . . . (vii) the hiring, promotion, transfer, assignment and retention of employees within the agency ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">D. <em>Grievance procedure steps </em>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">4. . . . The decision of [the grievance] panel shall be final and binding and shall be consistent with provisions of law and written policies ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">F. Either party may petition the circuit court having jurisdiction ... for an order requiring implementation of the decision of the panel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Code \u00a7 2.1-114.5:6 charges the Director of the Department of Employee Relations Counselors with the responsibility of administering the Commonwealth\u2019s grievance procedure. That section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">The Director shall have the following general powers:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">7. The Director of the Department of Employee Relations Counselors: (i) is responsible for establishing the grievance procedure, (ii) shall make and disseminate interpretations of the grievance procedure, (iii) shall promulgate rules of conduct for panel hearings, (iv) shall have the authority to rule on grievability of issues at the management steps of the grievance procedure, and (v) shall exercise authority to direct full compliance with the grievance procedure process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Pursuant to its statutory authority, the Department of Employee Relations Counselors (the Department) has promulgated Rules for the Conduct of Panel Hearings \u201cto assist grievance panels in preparing for and conducting panel hearings.\u201d Included in these rules is the following pertinent language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\">A panel\u2019s responsibility is to insure the proper application of state and agency policies and procedures. Panels do not have the authority to formulate or to change policies or procedures; however, they may consider mitigating circumstances and modify agency action concerning discipline. Panels do not have the authority to consider matters which the grievance procedure makes nongrievable. A panel by a majority vote may uphold or reverse the action of the agency or, in appropriate circumstances, may choose a modified remedy. Panel decisions, however, must be consistent with provisions of law and written policy. While in appropriate cases a panel might determine that a grievant is entitled to reinstatement, from which back pay and a restoration of benefits might flow, in no case does a panel have authority to award damages or attorney fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Department of Employee Relations Counselors, <em>Grievance Procedure for State Employees </em>18 (Rev. July 1, 1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">An examination of the City\u2019s and the Commonwealth\u2019s grievance procedure provisions reveals no mention of a panel\u2019s remedial powers. Only the Department\u2019s Rules for the Conduct of Panel Hearings address the specific remedial powers of a grievance panel, and then only in terms of the power to determinean employee\u2019s entitlement to <em>reinstatement </em>and back pay. The Rules are silent on the authority of a panel to <em>promote </em>an aggrieved employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">We will not infer the power to promote in the face of such a conspicuous silence. The determination whether a grievance panel has the authority to promote clearly is best left to the wisdom of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the General Assembly and the state officials charged with the administration of the grievance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">We hold, therefore, that the Board was without authority to award Jones a retroactive promotion and compensation for back pay. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-11\"> Jones has been promoted since this appeal was filed, but the City has not made his promotion date retroactive nor compensated him for back pay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b647-8\"> The Rules for the Conduct of Panel Hearings were revised, effective July 1, 1985, adding the following pertinent language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">Where a panel decision directs reinstatement of an employee, the panel has the authority to award full, partial or no back pay for the period of separation as determined to be appropriate based on the circumstances of the case.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
