Carter and Charles F. Bass, Jr., agreed to sell and Gary L. Smith agreed to buy a tract of land. The sellers\u2019 wives did not join in the contract. Smith filed a bill of complaint, ultimately amended to demand specific performance, against Carter and Bass. The chancellor heard evidence and concluded that Smith was entitled to specific performance. Advised by Smith\u2019s counsel that the sellers\u2019 wives were unwilling to join in a deed to Smith, the chancellor ruled that \u201cit would be totally inequitable to allow the wives of the [sellers] to refuse to sign and claim a dower interest.\u201d In a final decree, the chancellor granted Smith specific performance and ordered \u201cthat [sellers] and their spouses sign a proper deed of conveyance . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">On appeal, the sellers raise two questions keyed to their several assignments of error. We need consider only one. The sellers contend that the chancellor erred in ordering their wives to sign the deed. We agree. Because the wives were not party-litigants, the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction to enter such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">In response to questions from the bench, Smith\u2019s counsel insisted that, notwithstanding this error, we should affirm the decree without modification. Hence, it appears that Smith is unwilling, as he was in the trial court, to perform his part of the contract unless he receives a deed conveying title unencumbered by the inchoate dower interests of the sellers\u2019 wives. In such case, Smith is not entitled to a decree for specific performance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-8\">Generally when a vendor of real estate is unable to convey all he has agreed to sell, a purchaser may force the vendor specifically to perform the contract to the extent of the vendor\u2019s ability to convey, with an abatement in the purchase price for the deficiency .... But this general principle is not applicable to cases where a husband contracts to sell land and the wife refuses to join in the conveyance to release her inchoate dower right. Under such circumstances, unless the purchaser is willing to pay the <em>full purchase price, </em>deducting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>nothing on account of the wife\u2019s failure to release her dower, the husband cannot be compelled to convey at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-4\"><em>God </em>v. <em>Hurt, </em>218 Va. 909, 913, 241 S.E.2d 800, 803 (emphasis in original), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>219 Va. 160, 247 S.E.2d 351 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">We will reverse the decree and enter a final decree in this Court dismissing the bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final decree.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
