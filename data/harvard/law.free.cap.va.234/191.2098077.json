The three parties memorialized their agreements in form contracts published by the American Institute of Architects (AIA), each of which was modified in part. Insofar as relevant to this appeal, paragraph 11.4 of the architect\u2019s contract provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>11.4 The Owner and the Architect waive all rights against each other and against the contractors, consultants, agents and employees of the other for damages covered by any property insurance during construction .... The Owner and the Architect each shall require appropriate similar waivers from their contractors, consultants and agents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Both the contractor\u2019s and the architect\u2019s contracts with the owner incorporated by reference the provisions of AIA Document A201 entitled \u201cGeneral Conditions of the Contract for Construction\u201d. For purposes of interpretation, paragraph 1.1.3 of that document defined the term \u201cthe Work\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">The Work comprises the completed construction required by the Contract Documents and includes all labor necessary to produce such construction, and all materials and equipment incorporated or to be incorporated in such construction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The term thus defined appears in two paragraphs of the general conditions that are crucial to the determination of the waiver issue framed on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">11.3.1 Unless otherwise provided, the Owner shall purchase and maintain property insurance upon <em>the entire Work </em>at the site to the full insurable value thereof. This insurance shall include the interests of the Owner, the Contractor, Subcontractors and Sub-subcontractors in <em>the Work </em>and shall insure against the perils of fire and extended coverage and shall include \u201call risk\u201d insurance for physical loss or damage including, without duplication of coverage, theft, vandalism and malicious mischief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">11.3.6 The Owner and Contractor waive all rights against (1) each other and the Subcontractors, Sub-subcontractors, agents and employees each of the other, and (2) the Architect and separate contractors, if any, and their subcontractors, sub-subcontractors, agents and employees, for damages caused by fire or other perils to the extent covered by insurance obtained pursuant to this Paragraph 11.3 or any other property insurance applicable to <em>the Work </em>.... The Owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>or the Contractor, as appropriate, shall require of the Architect, separate contractors, Subcontractors and Sub-subcontractors by appropriate agreements . . . similar waivers each in favor of all other parties ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The parties agree that the building was substantially complete on September 2, 1981 and that, pursuant to a temporary certificate of occupancy, the owner occupied and began using the building on September 7, 1981. On January 11, 1982, the water in a pipe in the third-floor ceiling sprinkler system froze and the pipe burst. As appears from the parties\u2019 stipulation of facts, \u201c[t]he \u2018Work\u2019 to be performed . . . had been substantially, although not fully, completed at the time of the freezing and bursting\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Pursuant to its commitment under the contract documents, the owner had acquired two policies of property insurance on the building. One, a policy containing a builder\u2019s risk endorsement, was in effect from December 1, 1979 to October 1, 1981. Coverage under the other began October 1, 1981 and was in effect on and after January 11, 1982. The loss was one covered by the latter policy, and the insurer paid the owner $109,116.54 in satisfaction of its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The City of Roanoke issued a final certificate of occupancy dated February 10, 1982. The contractor submitted an application March 17, 1983 for final payment for the \u201cPeriod from: 2-28-83 to: 3-17-83\u201d. The owner made final payment by check dated April 8, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">In a motion for judgment filed in the name of the owner, the plaintiff claimed damages in contract and in tort against the contractor, the architect, and others.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The principal defendants filed special pleas of waiver and estoppel, and the parties submitted a stipulation of facts and memoranda of law. The stipulation contained no reference to extrinsic evidence of contractual intent. Construing the provisions of the contract documents and applying them to the facts at bar, the trial court ruled that the owner con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>tractually had waived its rights against the contractor and the architect and dismissed the motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">As framed on appeal, the dispositive issue is whether the trial court misconstrued and misapplied the contract documents. Preliminarily, the owner complains that the language is ambiguous, that \u201c[t]he architect and contractor should be considered the drafters of the documents because they submitted the forms\u201d, and that the trial court should have applied the rule that ambiguous contracts must be construed strictly against the author.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We have applied the rule the owner invokes against \u201cthe party who supplied . . . printed forms\u201d when \u201cthe language as a whole arguably supports two antithetical interpretations.\u201d <em>Bank of Martinsville </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>219 Va. 942, 946, 252 S.E.2d 354, 357 (1979). The rule applies, however, only when the contract is ambiguous on its face. When, as here, the language is plain and unambiguous, this Court must give effect to the plain meaning of that language. <em>Amos </em>v. <em>Coffey, </em>228 Va. 88, 92, 320 S.E.2d 335, 337 (1984); <em>accord Berry </em>v. <em>Klinger, </em>225 Va. 201, 208, 300 S.E.2d 792, 796 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">On appeal, the owner contends that the waiver provision in paragraph 11.4 of the architect\u2019s contract applies only \u201cduring construction\u201d; that the loss in issue \u201coccurred after substantial completion and therefore not \u2018during construction\u2019 \u201d; and that \u201cthe insurance and the waiver must lapse simultaneously at substantial completion and occupancy.\u201d The owner reasons that \u201c[t] he risk of casualty damage ... is on the contractor until the date of substantial completion, at which time the risk shifts to the owner\u201d, that the contractor then has no insurable interest in the project, and, consequently, that the only claim contemplated by the waiver provision was a claim covered by \u201cbuilder\u2019s risk insurance\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">We are of opinion that both the contractor and the architect had insurable interests subject to the property insurance in effect on the date of the loss. Former Code \u00a7 38.1-331 (now \u00a7 38.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>303(B)) defined the term \u201cinsurable interest\u201d as \u201cany lawful and substantial economic interest in the safety or preservation of the subject of insurance free from loss, destruction or pecuniary damage.\u201d Although the building was substantially complete and occupied, until final payment was made, the property constituted inchoate security for the payment of contract debts due the contractor and the architect for performance of the entire work. Thus, at the time the loss occurred \u2014 three months before the date of final payment \u2014 both the contractor and the architect had a substantial economic interest in preserving the building from loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">And we do not agree with the owner\u2019s view that the only claim contemplated by the waiver provisions was a claim covered by \u201cbuilder\u2019s risk insurance\u201d. We find no mention of that term in any contract and nothing that limits the operation of the insurance and waiver provisions to the time of substantial completion or occupancy. On the contrary, paragraph 11.3.1 of the general conditions, incorporated by reference in the principal contracts, required the owner to \u201cpurchase and maintain property insurance upon the entire Work\u201d insuring \u201cthe interests of . . . [all parties] in the Work\u201d against \u201call risk[s]\u201d. The waiver clause in paragraph 11.3.6 of the general conditions applied not only to claims \u201ccovered by insurance obtained pursuant to this Paragraph\u201d but also to claims covered by \u201cany other property insurance applicable to the Work\u201d. Paragraph 1.1.3 of the general conditions defined \u201cthe Work\u201d as \u201cthe <em>completed </em>construction required by the Contract Documents [including] <em>all </em>labor necessary to produce <em>such </em>construction, and <em>all </em>materials and equipment incorporated or to be incorporated in <em>such </em>construction.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">As we read this language, part of both principal contracts, the loss suffered by the owner occurred while \u201cthe Work\u201d was still in progress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> True, the insurance policy containing the builder\u2019s risk endorsement had expired. But the waiver clause provides that it applies to claims for losses covered by any property insurance applicable to \u201cthe Work\u201d, and the owner\u2019s second policy of property insurance was in effect when the loss occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Read together, the insurance and waiver provisions in the three contract documents signify a consensus among the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>tracting parties to exempt themselves from liability <em>inter se. </em>Said differently, the contracts show that the parties agreed to shift the risk of loss from themselves to a commercial insurer by acquiring policies insuring their own interests and the interests of subcontractors and sub-subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">As those contracts were construed and applied by the trial court to the facts stipulated by the parties, the waiver provisions contemplated the kind of loss that occurred in this case, the time it occurred, and the kind of insurance policy in effect at that time. We agree with the interpretation underlying the court\u2019s conclusions, and we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-9\"> In oral argument, counsel for the appellant acknowledged that the owner\u2019s unnamed subrogee-insurer was the real party-plaintiff in interest. Those named as individual parties-defendant were (then or formerly) partners doing business as the architect, <em>viz., </em>H. Boyd Dickenson, Byrd H. Barksdale, Jr., John R. Hildebrand, Eric T. Naschold, Jr., Fletcher F. Rush, J. Oliver Stein, James M. Strickland, Jr., John P. Bradshaw, Jr., Cecil G. Doyle, and T. Howard Noel. Other parties-litigant were dismissed by orders of nonsuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\"> Pursuing such reasoning, the owner insists that the contract implicitly provided that \u201cthe required insurance coverage would terminate upon total occupancy of the building.\u201d Referring to paragraph 11.3.9 of the general conditions, the owner says that \u201c[t]he provision relating to partial occupancy clearly states that partial occupancy will not cause the insurance coverage to lapse, and, by implication, suggests that full occupancy . . . would cause a lapse.\u201d We decline to draw the inference the owner urges, because it has no predicate in the stipulated facts. Paragraph 11.3.9 applies to occupancy \u201cprior to Substantial Completion\u201d; the owner occupied the building after substantial completion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\"> As the owner acknowledged in the court below, work was being conducted to repair defects in the heating system in the building on the morning of January 11, 1982, the day the pipe froze and burst.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
