The dispositive question on appeal is whether the trial court correctly ruled that the Act did not apply because the plaintiff was an independent contractor, not an \u201cemployee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">In 1981, appellee Gary Daniel Smith, the plaintiff below, was injured in Alexandria on the premises of appellant Intermodal Services, Inc. (the Services Company), a defendant below. The injuries resulted from a collision between a motor vehicle owned and operated by the plaintiff and a motor vehicle owned by the Ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>vices Company and operated by appellant Steve Clark, its agent and the other defendant below.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">In 1983, the plaintiff filed this damage suit, alleging defendants\u2019 negligence caused his injuries. In 1984, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that the claim was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Industrial Commission of Virginia under the Act. Following an ore tenus hearing, the court denied the motion. The court, in a letter opinion, ruled that \u201cthe plaintiff was not an \u2018employee,\u2019 but rather an independent contractor, not subject to the provisions of [the Act].\u201d Accordingly, the court held, the plaintiff could maintain his common-law negligence action against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In a 1984 jury trial, the plaintiff recovered a verdict and judgment against the defendants in the amount of $100,000. We awarded the defendants this appeal to consider the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the jurisdictional plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we will view the facts, many of which are conflicting, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff who prevailed below. The plaintiff was a self-employed truck driver who owned several pieces of heavy equipment including a tractor-trailer unit. He operated from his home in the Northern Virginia area as a sole proprietor under the name, \u201cSmith\u2019s Fleet Service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">At the time of the accident in question, the plaintiff had leased the tractor portion of his tractor-trailer unit to Intermodal Transportation Services, Inc. (the Transportation Company), an Ohio-based corporation with an office in Alexandria.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The Transportation Company was in the long-haul trucking business. Under the contract with the Transportation Company, the plaintiff moved freight between Alexandria and points in the Northeast, as well as in the local Alexandria area, using his tractor to pull trailers not owned by him. The plaintiffs assignments for the Transportation Company were made by that Company\u2019s Alexandria dispatcher who worked from a location within a city block of the property of the Services Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">The Services Company was a Georgia corporation that had a contract with the Southern Railway Company to operate a rail-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>highway exchange facility in Alexandria. The Services Company was engaged in the loading and unloading of trailers on and off railroad cars from a \u201cpiggyback yard\u201d adjacent to railroad tracks. The Railway Company supplied the ramp for the process and the Services Company provided \u201cthe people and the equipment to run the ramp.\u201d The Services Company had the responsibility to shift the trailers around the yard and to assure they were properly parked or \u201cspotted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">At times, the piggyback yard became filled with trailers. The Railway Company had leased a vacant parcel of land to receive the overflow. This satellite yard was one-tenth of a mile along a public highway from the piggyback yard. The Services Company used its own yard tractor for work within the piggyback yard but, because that unit was not insured for use on a public highway, obtained properly licensed and insured tractors to pull trailers from the piggyback yard, along the public highway, to the satellite yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">On the day of the accident, the plaintiff had reported to the Transportation Company\u2019s dispatcher in the morning and announced that he was ready to be assigned a trip to haul freight with his tractor. A train had just been unloaded at the piggyback yard and the plaintiff wished to be sent on a trip to Boston. Because there would be a delay due to \u201cpaperwork\u201d before the dispatcher could release the plaintiff for the out-of-state trip, the dispatcher asked the plaintiff if he would be willing in the meantime to drive to the piggyback yard to move trailers to the satellite yard \u201crather than sit around the office\u201d until he could leave for Boston. The plaintiff agreed and, upon inquiry, the dispatcher indicated that the plaintiff would be paid at the \u201cflat\u201d rate of $10 to $12 per trailer moved. Previously, as was the custom, the terminal manager for the Services Company had advised the dispatcher for the Transportation Company of the need for \u201croad drivers\u201d to move trailers along the public highway from the piggyback yard to the satellite yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">After the plaintiff had transferred approximately a dozen trailers from one yard to the other, he was involved in the accident in question. At the time of the injury, the plaintiff was pulling a trailer on the piggyback yard en route to the satellite yard when his tractor collided with the yard tractor. The plaintiff received workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the accident under coverage through the Transportation Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>On appeal, the defendants contend the trial court erred in denying the jurisdictional plea. In a three-pronged argument, they contend that the plaintiff was an \u201cemployee,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 65.1-4 of the Act, of the Services Company; or that the plaintiff was a \u201cstatutory employee,\u201d within the provisions of \u00a7 65.1-29 or \u00a7 65.1-30 of the Act, of the Services Company; or that, even if the plaintiff was not in an employee relationship with the defendant, the defendants were not \u201cother parties\u201d under the Act against whom the plaintiff could maintain a tort action. We reject these contentions; the defendants have misinterpreted the settled law applicable to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The Act protects \u201cemployees,\u201d as defined in the Act. Nowhere does an independent contractor who himself is injured in an industrial accident come within the terms of the Act. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Nussman, </em>152 Va. 293, 302, 147 S.E. 246, 249 (1929). In other words, independent contractors or subcontractors may not be \u201cemployees\u201d within the meaning of the Act. <em>Stover </em>v. <em>Ratliff, </em>221 Va. 509, 511, 272 S.E.2d 40, 42 (1980). \u201cThis result obtains because the Act applies to the contractual relationship of master and servant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Act \u201cdoes not undertake to change, as between themselves, the rights of owners and independent contractors\u201d; it \u201cleaves that relationship as it was at common law and we must look to [the common law] in determining who is master and who is servant.\u201d <em>Crowder </em>v. <em>Haymaker, </em>164 Va. 77, 79, 178 S.E. 803, 804 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">\u201cWhat constitutes an employee is a question of law; but, whether the facts bring a person within the law\u2019s designation, is usually a question of fact.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>152 Va. at 298, 147 S.E. at 247. The worker\u2019s status \u201cmust be determined from the facts of the particular case in the light of well settled principles.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>189 Va. 509, 516, 54 S.E.2d 109, 113 (1949). Thus, the initial inquiry here is whether the trial court correctly applied the law and the facts to reach the conclusion that the plaintiff was an independent contractor, not an employee. If the plaintiff was an \u201cemployee,\u201d he was covered by the Act and his rights under the Act are exclusive. If, however, he was an independent contractor, the Act is inapplicable and maintenance of this action against defendants was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Under Code \u00a7 65.1-4, as pertinent here, \u201cevery person ... in the service of another under any contract of hire or apprenticeship, written or implied,\u201d is an \u201cemployee\u201d for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>the Act. Generally, \u201ca person is an employee if he works for wages or a salary and the person who hires him reserves the power to fire him and the power to exercise control over the work to be performed.\u201d <em>Richmond Newspapers </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>224 Va. 92, 98, 294 S.E.2d 840, 843 (1982) (route carrier of newspapers held to be an independent contractor not covered by the Act). The right of control is the determining factor in ascertaining the parties\u2019 status in an analysis of an employment relationship. <em>Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>A.I.M. Corp., </em>225 Va. 338, 347, 302 S.E.2d 534, 539 (1983). And the right of control includes not only the power to specify the result to be attained, but the power to control \u201cthe means and methods by which the result is to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Gill, </em>224 Va. at 98, 294 S.E.2d at 843. An employer-employee relationship exists if the party for whom the work is to be done has the power to direct the means and methods by which the other does the work. \u201c[I]f the latter is free to adopt such means and methods as he chooses to accomplish the result, he is not an employee but an independent contractor.\u201d <em>A.I.M. Corp., 225 </em>Va. at 347, 302 S.E.2d at 540; <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>179 Va. 526, 531, 19 S.E.2d 675, 677 (1942). The extent of the reserved right of control may be determined by examining the performance of the parties in the activity under scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">As we shall demonstrate, there is abundant evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s ruling that the plaintiff was not an employee and that the corporate defendant reserved only the power to control the result to be attained in this job assignment, and not the means and methods by which the result was to be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">When the plaintiff reported to the Services Company\u2019s dispatcher at the piggyback yard, while passing time until departure on the trip to Boston, he asked \u201cwhere the trailers were that they wanted moved across the street.\u201d He was told where on the yard those trailers were located and he \u201cwent back there and started moving trailers.\u201d After \u201chooking up\u201d a trailer, the plaintiff would pull it to the Services Company\u2019s \u201cdispatch shack\u201d near the entrance to the piggyback yard. A Services Company employee \u201ccame out and walked around it, wrote the number down and [the plaintiff] took it across the street.\u201d Upon reaching the satellite yard, the plaintiff drove into the lot, \u201cfound an open spot, picked up a couple of [oak] boards, put them under the landing gear, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>unhooked and came back to get another.\u201d The plaintiff did not see any employees of the Services Company at the satellite yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">No one instructed the plaintiff how to \u201chook up\u201d the trailers. No one \u201cchecked in\u201d the trailers at the satellite yard. No person employed by the Services Company ever discussed terms of employment with the plaintiff, or told him when to go to lunch, or told him when to begin or cease work. No one gave the plaintiff \u201cany direction whatsoever except go get the trailers and move them across the street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The plaintiff never was asked by the corporate defendant to complete any forms for payroll deductions. He was paid at a \u201cflat rate\u201d for each trailer moved. No deductions were made from his compensation, which was not paid by the corporate defendant. The plaintiff believed he would be paid by the Transportation Company, but he received his pay from the Southern Railway Company for transferring the trailers.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">In sum, the evidence shows that the plaintiff was not selected, supervised, or paid wages by the corporate defendant. Significantly, the Services Company did not reserve the right to control the means and methods by which the plaintiff performed the work; it only retained the right to control the result to be attained.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The foregoing decision ordinarily would dispose of the appeal because, as we have said, the Act does not apply to an independent contractor. Nevertheless, we must touch briefly on the defendants\u2019 other two contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Relying on a host of cases, all of which involve claims by employees of independent contractors or subcontractors, defendants contend that the plaintiff was a \u201cstatutory employee\u201d of the corporate defendant within the meaning of \u00a7 65.1-29 or \u00a7 65.1-30 of the Act. Defendants argue that the language of the statutes demonstrates an intention by the General Assembly that independent contractors shall be considered \u201cstatutory employees,\u201d even though they do not qualify as \u201cemployees\u201d under the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">We do not agree with that contention. This Court already has ruled to the contrary in the line of cases discussed earlier in this opinion \u2014 <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Nussman, Crowder </em>v. <em>Haymaker, Craig </em>v. <em>Doyle, Stover </em>v. <em>Ratliff, </em>and <em>Richmond Newspapers </em>v. <em>Gill. </em>The language of the respective statutes fails to support such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">Section 65.1-29 provides, as pertinent here, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>\u201cWhen any person (in this section . . . referred to as \u2018owner\u2019) undertakes to perform or execute any work . . . and contracts with any other person (in this section . . . referred to as \u2018subcontractor\u2019) for the execution or performance by or under such subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such owner, the owner shall be liable to pay to any workman employed in the work any compensation under this Act which he would have been liable to pay if the workman had been immediately employed by him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Section 65.1-30 contains similar language and deals with the contractor-subcontractor relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Defendants urge that the proper construction of the statutory language is that \u201cany workman employed in the work,\u201d to whom compensation benefits are owed, includes work performed \u201cby\u201d a self-employed person himself, acting as a subcontractor, and not just those employees working \u201cunder\u201d a subcontractor. The defendants misconstrue the statutory language, which was considered in detail in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Nussman. </em>There, we said that the statutes in issue \u201cnever [were] intended to affect the status of a sub-contractor. [They] only took in a class of employees (employees of a subcontractor) and made them eligible to compensation just as the employees of the owner or contractor are eligible under the definition of employees as defined in . . . the Act.\u201d 152 Va. at 302, 147 S.E. at 249. In other words, the phrase \u201cworkman employed in the work,\u201d to whom compensation benefits are owed, refers to employees, not the subcontractor himself. \u201cA sub-contractor does not, anywhere, come within the terms of the Act as entitled to compensation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Also, defendants contend that to refuse to include independent contractors as persons covered by the Act leaves a \u201cgap\u201d in the statutory scheme and would permit \u201can owner or contractor to. escape the responsibilities of the Act by the simple expediency of positioning an individual workman as an independent contractor, even though such workman is engaged in performing part of the trade business or occupation of the owner.\u201d Even assuming such a subterfuge could become a reality, this argument should be addressed to the General Assembly. We are unwilling to create, by judicial fiat, liability under the Act to a class of persons not presently covered by its provisions. In some states, legislative amendments have achieved this objective by specifically extending pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>tection of the Act to nonemployees. 1C A. Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 49.21 at 9-88 (1986). For example, one state has enacted legislation making newsboys under the age of 18 years the employees of the corporation that caused the papers to be delivered. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 49.22 at 9-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Finally, defendants contend that even if the plaintiff is not deemed to be a common-law employee or a statutory employee, neither defendant is an \u201cother party\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 65.1-41 of the Act against whom a tort action can be maintained. Defendants say that regardless of the plaintiffs employment status with the Services Company, at the time of the accident he was engaged in a part of the normal work activity of that company and, thus, they were not \u201cother parties\u201d who could be sued in tort. The obvious answer to this contention is that because the Act as a whole does not apply to the plaintiff under these circumstances, no individual section of the Act is applicable either.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of the trial court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b620-9\"> According to counsel, the term \u201cintermodal\u201d means a combination of rail/highway traffic.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b626-7\">THOMAS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ayzk\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">At the time he was injured, Smith was unquestionably engaged in Intermodal Services, Inc.\u2019s (the Services Company\u2019s) trade, business, or occupation. Yet, the majority concludes that Smith has the right to sue the Services Company in tort. This conclusion is contrary to the unequivocal requirements of Code \u00a7 65.1-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">The Services Company was engaged in the trade, business, or occupation of operating \u201ca rail-highway exchange facility.\u201d Ante at__As part of its work, the Services Company \u201cengaged in the loading and unloading of trailers on and off railroad cars from a \u2018piggyback yard\u2019 adjacent to railroad tracks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Services Company was also responsible for shifting tractors around the yard to insure they were properly parked. When the piggyback yard became full, the Services Company \u201cobtained properly licensed and insured tractors to pull trailers from the piggyback yard\u201d to a satellite yard. <em>Id. </em>When Smith was injured, he was in the piggyback yard, in the process of pulling a trailer to the satellite yard. He collided with the yard tractor. As a matter of fact then, there can be no dispute that, at the time he was injured, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Smith was engaged in the Services Company\u2019s trade, business, or occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Code \u00a7 65.1-29 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">When <em>any person </em>(in this section . . . referred to as \u201cowner\u201d) undertakes to perform or execute <em>any work </em>which is part of his trade, business, or occupation and contracts with <em>any other person </em>(in this section . . . referred to as \u201csubcontractor\u201d) for the execution or performance <em>by </em>or <em>under such subcontractor </em>of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such owner, the owner shall be liable to pay to any workman employed in the work any compensation under this Act which he would have been liable to pay if the workmen had been immediately employed by him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">(Emphasis added.) Applying Code \u00a7 65.1-29 directly to the facts of this case, it is plain that the General Assembly has required that when the Services Company undertook to perform part of its trade, business, or occupation by contracting with Gary Daniel Smith for Smith to perform, either by himself or through Smith\u2019s employees, all or part of the work of the Services Company then the Services Company became liable to pay Smith, or anyone Smith employed to do the Service Company\u2019s work, compensation under the Act just as if Smith or Smith\u2019s employees worked directly for the Services Company. In my opinion, by the direct application of the language of Code \u00a7 65.1-29, it is plain that Smith is a statutory employee and that his exclusive remedy is under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The majority avoids this obvious conclusion by stating that the phrase \u201cworkman employed in the work\u201d which is contained in Code \u00a7 65.1-29 refers to employees of a subcontractor but not to the subcontractor himself. By this argument, if an employee of Smith\u2019s had been operating Smith\u2019s truck and was injured, that employee would be covered by the Act, but if Smith himself operated his own truck and was injured, as happened here, then he would not be covered by the Act. The majority\u2019s exclusion of the subcontractor himself from coverage under the Act ignores other language in Code \u00a7 65.1-29 which precedes the phrase focused upon by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">First, the provision refers to \u201ccontracts with any other person.\u201d Smith is certainly included in that broad language. Second, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>provision refers to \u201cperformance <em>by </em>or <em>under </em>such contractor\u201d of the whole or any part of the owners work. (Emphasis added.) Performance <em>by </em>the contractor refers to the contractor himself. Performance <em>under </em>the contractor refers to employees of the contractor. Third, the phrase \u201cworkman employed in the work\u201d refers to anyone hired by the owner \u2014 which may either be a single contractor or a contractor with employees. Thus, the phrase \u201cworkman employed in the work,\u201d when read in context, could not possibly mean, as the majority suggests, workman employed by the subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The gravamen of the majority opinion is that if an owner hires an independent contractor to do work, then that independent contractor cannot receive worker\u2019s compensation benefits because an independent contractor is simply not covered by the Act. The majority thus takes the position that if a person is an independent contractor no further analysis is needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">I disagree. In my opinion, the fact that a person is an independent contractor does not end the inquiry, it begins the inquiry. Where a person is a traditional employee, he or she is protected by the Act if his or her injuries arise out of or in the course of employment. But where a person is said to be an independent contractor there is a risk that the owner may be using that label to obscure the fact that the injured party is in truth an employee. It is precisely in the case where an injured party is said to be an independent contractor that the difficult questions of coverage arise. An independent contractor not engaged in the owner\u2019s trade, business, or occupation is not entitled to protection under the Act. But the opposite result obtains when even an independent contractor is engaged in the owner\u2019s trade, business, or occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The cases relied on by the majority are of little or no help in the present problem because most of them did not focus upon Code \u00a7 65.1-29 or its predecessor provisions. <em>See e.g., Va. Emp. Comm. </em>v. <em>A.I.M. Corp., </em>225 Va. 338, 302 S.E.2d 534 (1983) (not a worker\u2019s compensation case; no discussion of the worker\u2019s compensation statute); <em>Richmond Newspapers </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>224 Va. 92, 294 S.E.2d 840 (1982) (injured deliveryman held to be independent contractor; no mention of whether claimant was engaged in the trade, business, or occupation of the newspaper at the time of injury); <em>Stover </em>v. <em>Ratliff, </em>221 Va. 509, 272 S.E.2d 40 (1980) (the issue was whether defendant had enough employees to fall within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>the scope of the Act; focus was upon control; no analysis of whether various persons claimed to be employees were engaged in defendant\u2019s trade, business, or occupation); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>189 Va. 509, 54 S.E.2d 109 (1949) (claimant held not to be an independent contractor; no analysis of whether the claimant was engaged in defendant\u2019s trade, business, or occupation); <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>179 Va. 526, 19 S.E.2d 675 (1942) (claimant held <em>not </em>to be an independent contractor; no consideration given to whether he was engaged in owner\u2019s trade, business, or occupation); and <em>Crowder </em>v. <em>Haymaker, </em>164 Va. 77, 178 S.E. 803 (1935) (claimant held to be an independent contractor; no analysis of whether claimant was engaged in defendant\u2019s trade, business, or occupation). Not one of the foregoing cases states that an independent contractor who is engaged in the owner\u2019s trade, business, or occupation is <em>not </em>entitled to coverage under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">The majority relies principally upon <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Nussman, </em>152 Va. 293, 147 S.E. 246 (1929), in support of its conclusion that \u00a7 65.1-29 provides coverage for employees of subcontractors but not for contractors themselves. <em>Baker </em>does reach that conclusion. But there, as here, no mention is made of the language in the statute which refers to \u201ccontracts with any other persons\u201d and to \u201cperformance <em>by </em>or <em>under </em>such subcontractor.\u201d In my opinion, <em>Baker </em>is not well reasoned and should not be followed by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">In going back 59 years in time to follow <em>Baker, </em>the majority inexplicably ignores two recent opinions of the Court which, in my opinion, should have been followed. In <em>Carmody </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co., </em>234 Va. 198, 361 S.E.2d 128 (1987), the claimant was an employee of Photo Corporation of America (PCA). Woolworth granted a license to PC A to operate a portrait photography department in Woolworth\u2019s store. Carmody was assigned by PCA to run that department at Woolworth. He was injured when he slipped on a dolly and fell to the floor. He sued Woolworth\u2019s in tort. The trial court held that he was Woolworth\u2019s statutory employee. We affirmed. We made clear that simply because Carmody was an employee of an independent contractor did not entitle him to sue Woolworth. We said the issue was whether Carmody was engaged in Woolworth\u2019s trade, business, or occupation at the time he was injured. Because we concluded that he was, we held that his exclusive remedy was under the Act. To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>same effect is <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Central Telephone Co., </em>233 Va. 377, 355 S.E.2d 596 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Admittedly, in <em>Carmody </em>and <em>Henderson, </em>the claimants were employees of subcontractors and not the subcontractors themselves. Yet, my reading of Code \u00a7 65.1-29 convinces me that the distinction should not lead to a different result. I would hold, as the statute requires, that even though Smith was an independent contractor because, at the time he was injured, he was engaged in the Services Company\u2019s trade, business, or occupation, he was entitled to worker\u2019s compensation coverage from the Services Company and, therefore, could not sue the company in tort.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
