At the conclusion of the first stage of the bifurcated trial, the jury fixed his punishment at life imprisonment for robbery, ten years for attempted robbery, twenty years for malicious wounding, and four years for each of the four firearm offenses. At the penalty stage, the jury heard evidence of the defendant\u2019s history and evidence in mitigation. After further deliberation, the jury returned a unanimous verdict fixing Pope\u2019s punishment at death for capital murder, based on the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate of the statute. After reviewing a pre-sentence report and after a further hearing, the court entered judgment on the jury verdicts by final orders entered September 3, 1986. Pope\u2019s appeal of his capital murder conviction has been consolidated with the automatic review of his death sentence required by Code \u00a7 17-110.1. We have also certified from the Court of Appeals of Virginia the record of Pope\u2019s related convictions, pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-116.06, and have given all the related appeals priority on our docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">I. THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Pursuant to established principles of appellate review, the evidence will be stated in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. On the evening of January 12, 1986, Marcie Ann Kirchheimer was a passenger in the front seat of a two-door \u201clittle Sunbird\u201d owned and driven by her sister, Cynthia Gray. Cynthia drove to \u201cNick\u2019s Pool Hall\u201d in downtown Portsmouth in search of a man named James Taylor. When they arrived, Marcie left the car and knocked on the door of the pool hall, but found the establishment closed. As Marcie returned to the car, Pope, who was across the street, called to them to ask if they were looking for Taylor. He walked to the car, identified himself as \u201cCarl,\u201d and told them that Taylor had left the pool hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Pope asked Cynthia if she would give him a ride home. She agreed, and Pope got into the back seat of the car, where he sat on the right side, behind Marcie. Cynthia first drove to James Taylor\u2019s mother\u2019s house, where Marcie left the car to talk with Taylor\u2019s mother for a few minutes. Taylor was absent, and Marcie told his mother that they would return in ten or fifteen minutes. Marcie then rejoined Cynthia and Pope in the car. Pope directed Cynthia to Bagley Street. During the drive, Cynthia was drinking from a bottle of wine. She passed the bottle back to Pope, who also drank from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>When the car arrived at Bagley Street, Pope told Cynthia to stop on the left side, \u201cthe wrong side of the road as [they] were travelling.\u201d Marcie opened the passenger door and pulled the seat forward to let Pope out. Immediately after emerging from the car, Pope turned toward the women, pointed a pistol at them, and said, \u201cgive me all your money.\u201d Startled, the women made no immediate response and Pope fired a shot into Cynthia\u2019s head. Marcie reached up and grappled with Pope for the gun. Pope \u201cpulled free\u201d and \u201cstarted to run off, and took two or three steps off, and turned around.\u201d Pope then shot Marcie in the back of the head and \u201ctook off running.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Cynthia was bleeding from the head and was slumped over the steering wheel. Marcie, knowing that she, too, had been shot, \u201chalfway sat on [Cynthia] in the middle of the car,\u201d turned on the car\u2019s emergency blinkers and drove as fast as she could to Portsmouth General Hospital. Marcie drove to a door she thought was the emergency entrance, jumped out of the car and ran to the door. Finding the door locked and that entrance no longer in use, she ran back past Cynthia\u2019s car and entered the front lobby of the hospital. There, she encountered two police officers, William Mutter and George Vick. The officers heard Marcie\u2019s screams and followed her as she ran back to the car. They found Cynthia dead from a gunshot wound to the right temple. The bullet had passed through the brain and exited in front of the left ear. Marcie was admitted to the hospital. She had a bullet wound behind the right ear. The same bullet had subsequently passed through her left shoulder and exited under her left arm. Later, in court, Marcie positively identified Pope as the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Upon arriving at the car, the police officers called for assistance and preserved the condition of the car until it could be examined. The wine bottle from which Cynthia and Pope had been drinking was found on the driver\u2019s seat and was turned over to a fingerprint examiner who found that it bore a print which positively matched a fingerprint taken from Carlton Pope.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Marcie had had no purse, and testified that Pope had taken nothing from her, but Cynthia\u2019s purse was missing after the shooting. Cynthia had been carrying a clutch-type purse with a zipper closure which she left open. It was lying \u201cright in between the bucket seats\u201d as the women drove to Nick\u2019s Pool Hall. During that drive, Cynthia took her checkbook out of the purse momentarily and then replaced it in the purse, which remained between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>bucket seats. After the shooting, the purse was missing but the police found the checkbook on the floor of the car between the passenger seat and the door on the passenger side, through which Pope had left the car. Marcie testified that it was not Cynthia\u2019s practice to leave the checkbook on the floor or to leave \u201cthings like that strewn about the car.\u201d Marcie last saw the purse between the bucket seats, and did not see it after the shooting. While she did not see Pope remove it, she testified that it was in his view and that he had ample opportunity \u201cto grab it without me seeing him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">II. PRE-TRIAL MOTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"A8u\">A. <em>Motion for Private Investigator</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Before trial, Pope moved the court to appoint an investigator to \u201ccomb the neighborhood\u201d for potential witnesses. The court denied the motion, noting that we have recently held that an indigent defendant has no constitutional right to the appointment, at public expense, of a private investigator. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 330, 356 S.E.2d 157, 166 (1987); <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 469, 478, 331 S.E.2d 422, 430 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1099 (1986); <em>Quintana </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 127, 135, 295 S.E.2d 643, 646 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1029 (1983). On appeal, Pope argues that the appointment of a private investigator is required by an analogy to the reasoning in <em>Ake </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. 68, 83-84 (1985). We do not agree. <em>Ake </em>applies only to the appointment of an independent psychiatrist to assist an indigent defendant who has made a preliminary showing that his sanity at the time of the offense is likely to be a significant factor in his defense, or where the prosecution intends to rely on psychiatric evidence to prove the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness. <em>See Pruett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 266, 275 n.3, 351 S.E.2d 1, 7 n.3 (1986); <em>Tuggle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 99, 104-108, 334 S.E.2d 838, 841-43 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>478 U.S. 1010 (1986). <em>Ake </em>is inapplicable here. We adhere to our holding in <em>Watkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">B. <em>Motion for Personal Inspection of Evidence by Defendant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Pope moved the court to permit him personally to inspect the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence before trial. The court ruled that defense counsel was entitled to view the physical evidence, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>that the defendant was not entitled to be present. When an accused is represented by counsel, the requirements of Rule 3A:11, as we construe it, are satisfied when defense counsel is afforded the opportunity to inspect the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. The record shows that defense counsel took full advantage of his opportunity to inspect the physical evidence before trial. No authority is cited, and none exists in Virginia, for the asserted right of a defendant, who is represented by counsel, to inspect the evidence personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">C. <em>Motion for Change of Venue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Pope made pre-trial motions for a change of venue and for sequestration of the jury, based on pre-trial publicity in Portsmouth concerning the offense. The court took the motions under advisement until <em>voir dire </em>had been completed in order to determine whether the veniremen had been affected by the publicity. After <em>voir dire </em>questioning disclosed that the publicity had had no substantial impact on the veniremen, the court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The court was able to select twenty prospective jurors and four alternates from thirty-three veniremen. Of the nine veniremen excluded on <em>voir dire, </em>eight were excused for reasons unrelated to pre-trial publicity and one had personal knowledge of the details of the case. Of the twenty-four remaining prospective jurors, six had been exposed to publicity concerning the case, but none of these was sensible of any bias toward the accused, none had formed an opinion of guilt or innocence, and all stated their willingness to decide the case solely upon the law and the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The relative ease with which an impartial jury was empaneled negates the \u201cwidespread prejudice\u201d which a defendant must show in order to justify a change of venue. <em>See Stockton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 124, 137, 314 S.E.2d 371, 380, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 873 (1984). The presumption is that the defendant can receive a fair trial in the locality in which the offense occurred, and the defendant has the burden of showing \u201cwidespread prejudice\u201d to rebut that presumption. <em>Id. </em>There is no showing on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in denying a change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>D. <em>Motion for Sequestration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Code \u00a7 19.2-264 provides that in felony cases \u201cthe jury shall not be kept together unless the court otherwise directs.\u201d Sequestration is not mandated by the mere fact that the offense has received coverage in the news media. <em>Stockton, </em>227 Va. at 138, 314 S.E.2d at 380. The defendant offers no evidence of prejudice resulting from the court\u2019s denial of his motion for sequestration, and the record shows no prejudice. We find no abuse of the court\u2019s discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">E. <em>Motion to Suppress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Pope moved the court to suppress the evidence of the wine bottle upon which his fingerprint was found, contending that the Commonwealth had failed to show a complete chain of custody from the car to the fingerprint examiner. The Commonwealth is not required to exclude every conceivable possibility of substitution, alteration, or tampering. <em>P. Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 554, 559, 248 S.E.2d 805, 808 (1978). All that is required in order to establish a chain of custody is that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence \u201cafford reasonable assurance that the exhibits at trial are the same and in the same condition as they were when first obtained.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The evidence here was more than sufficient to carry that burden. Marcie testified that the wine bottle was on the front seat of the car, between Cynthia\u2019s legs, before the shooting. When Cynthia\u2019s body was found in the car parked at the hospital, Officer Vick \u201cpreserved the scene\u201d until Officer Armstrong arrived. Armstrong found the bottle in the front seat of the car, still between Cynthia\u2019s legs. Armstrong removed the bottle, placed it on the sidewalk, and stood over it until Detective Harris arrived. Harris took the bottle into custody, took it to the fingerprint examiner, and kept it in his possession thereafter until trial. The court correctly denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">F. <em>Constitutionality of Death Penalty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">Pope raised at trial, and raises again on appeal, a challenge to the constitutionality of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-31 and 19.2-264.2-5. He contends that Virginia\u2019s death penalty statutes provide for cruel and unusual punishment, that they are vague and overbroad, and that there is no rational basis for the legislative classification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>capital offenses. We have considered and rejected these and similar claims in <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 320, 356 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1987); <em>Beaver </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 521, 527, 352 S.E.2d 342, 344-45 (1987); <em>Stockton, </em>227 Va. at 134-35, 314 S.E.2d at 378; <em>Whitley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 66, 77-78, 286 S.E.2d 162, 168-69, <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 882 (1982); <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 844, 851, 284 S.E.2d 844, 849 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 938 (1982); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 436, 439-40, 271 S.E.2d 123, 125-26 (1980); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 201, 212, 257 S.E.2d 784, 791 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1049 (1980); and <em>M. Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 476-78, 248 S.E.2d 135, 148-49 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979). We adhere to those holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">III. TRIAL, GUILT PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"A5r\">A. <em>Motions Relating to Jury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">At the beginning of the trial, Pope moved the court to empanel two separate juries, one to try the guilt phase and the other to determine his penalty in the event of conviction. When the court denied that motion, Pope moved the court to try the entire case without a jury. The Commonwealth opposed the motion and the court denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The court correctly denied both motions. We held in <em>Pruett, </em>232 Va. at 277, 351 S.E.2d at 7-8, and in <em>Watkins, </em>229 Va. at 479, 331 S.E.2d at 431, that Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3 requires that the same jury determine both guilt and punishment and that this statutory procedure is constitutional. We reaffirm those holdings. Code \u00a7 19.2-257 provides that an accused person who pleads not guilty may, with the advice of counsel, waive jury trial and may be tried by the court without a jury, but only with \u201cthe concurrence of the attorney for the Commonwealth and of the court entered of record.\u201d Thus, a jury may be waived only with the consent of the defendant, the Commonwealth, and the court. The statutory requirement of consent by the Commonwealth and by the court does not violate any constitutional right of the defendant. <em>Vines </em>v. <em>Muncy, </em>553 F.2d 342, 345-46 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 851 (1977) (applying Virginia law).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>B. <em>Voir Dire</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">During his <em>voir dire, </em>Glen Latham, a prospective juror, indicated by his answers that he believed that the defendant was required to prove his innocence. Defense counsel then asked him whether he could accept the court\u2019s instructions that the defendant was presumed innocent until the Commonwealth proved him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The juror answered that he did not understand the question. The court then questioned him directly and he responded: \u201cYes, sir. I may sound contradictory, but I feel, if he can\u2019t prove his innocence, I feel it\u2019s up to the Court to prove he is guilty, then.\u201d A further confused explanation followed. Defense counsel repeated the original question, and the juror responded that he did not know \u201chow to answer\u201d because he was not \u201cfamiliar with this procedure.\u201d The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney then examined him as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">Q. Let me try to clarify something Mr. Tayloe was asking you:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">You understand the burden of proof in this case is upon the Commonwealth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">Q. The Commonwealth has to prove Mr. Pope\u2019s guilty beyond a reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-10\">Q. You understand he has no burden to produce any evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-11\">A. Yes. I realize he doesn\u2019t have to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-12\">Q. He has no burden to prove himself innocent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-13\">A. Yes. I understand that. I maybe might have gotten mixed up in questioning about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-14\">Q. The burden is on the Commonwealth, and he has no burden to come forward and prove his innocence. Can you accept that and live with that proposition as the law in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-15\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-16\">The trial court properly evaluated Latham\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>in its entirety in ruling on Pope\u2019s challenge for cause. <em>Wise </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 322, 325-26, 337 S.E.2d 715, 717-18 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1112 (1986). Because the trial judge has the opportunity, which we lack, to observe and evaluate the apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>sincerity, conscientiousness, intelligence, and demeanor of prospective jurors first hand, the trial court\u2019s exercise of judicial discretion in deciding challenges for cause will not be disturbed on appeal, unless manifest error appears in the record. <em>Calhoun </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 256, 258-59, 307 S.E.2d 896, 898 (1983). The record here gives no support to Pope\u2019s contention that the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Pope also challenged Tricia Clifford, a prospective juror, who was employed as a purchasing agent for Portsmouth General Hospital. On <em>voir dire, </em>she testified that she had heard some of the details of the case from \u201cgossip through the hospital.\u201d She also stated that this information would not affect her impartiality, that she would remove \u201cwork gossip\u201d from her mind and that she would \u201conly accept that evidence which is from the witness stand.\u201d Considering her <em>voir dire </em>in its entirety, the court denied the challenge, and we uphold its ruling. We held in <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 535, 323 S.E.2d 577 (1984), that it is not necessary that prospective jurors be entirely ignorant of the facts and issues in the case. \u201cIt is sufficient if they can lay aside their impressions or opinions and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544, 323 S.E.2d at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">C. <em>Sufficiency of Proof of Robbery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Pope argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of robbery, and consequently was insufficient to establish the predicate for capital murder under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(d), which classifies as capital those killings which are perpetrated \u201cin the commission of robbery.\u201d The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence of robbery was circumstantial, based on the theory that Pope took Cynthia\u2019s purse. He contends that the evidence fails to exclude two reasonable hypotheses of innocence: (1) that someone other than Pope entered the car and removed Cynthia\u2019s purse from the area between the bucket seats while Marcie was running for help at the hospital; and (2) that Pope himself removed the purse surreptitiously before the shooting and concealed it on his person. In that event, he says, his underlying offense would be mere larceny, rather than robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Pope\u2019s first hypothesis framed a factual issue for determination by the jury. In that connection, the jury was entitled to consider the distance Marcie ran and the length of time the car, containing Cynthia\u2019s body, was out of her view. Officer Vick testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>fied that he ran the same route, which Marcie had covered at the time of the crime, in 27.8 seconds. The jury was entitled to conclude from the evidence, as it did, that Pope\u2019s hypothesis that a stranger stole the purse during that interval was neither reasonable nor persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Pope\u2019s second hypothesis is fallacious as a matter of law. We decided in <em>Linwood Earl Briley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 532, 273 S.E.2d 48 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1031-1032 (1981), that where a killing and a taking of property are so closely related in time, place, and causal connection as to make them parts of the same criminal enterprise, the predicates for capital murder under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(d) are established. Further, these relationships need not necessarily be jury questions. They may, in a proper case, be determined as a matter of law. 221 Va. at 543-44, 273 S.E.2d at 55-56. <em>See also LeVasseur </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 590-92, 304 S.E.2d 644, 658-59 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063 (1984); <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 1033, 1043-44, 243 S.E.2d 477, 483 (1978). The trial court\u2019s rulings here implicitly adopted the view that the taking of the purse, the killing of Cynthia, its owner, and the wounding of Marcie, the only other person in a position to resist the taking, were so closely related in time, place, and causal connection as to constitute a common criminal enterprise as a matter of law. We uphold that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">D. <em>Evidentiary Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Pope challenges five evidentiary rulings at trial: the court\u2019s admission of photographs of Cynthia\u2019s body, of the scene of the crime, the car, the wine bottle, and the hospital, as well as admission of Marcie\u2019s jacket containing bullet holes. Pope also objected to the introduction in evidence of the wine bottle itself and the checkbook. He argues on appeal that these exhibits are non-probative, that they duplicate the previous testimony of Marcie, and that they are inflammatory. These contentions are entirely without merit. The exhibits are relevant to the issues at trial, probative of the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of the case, corroborative of the other evidence, and no more likely to inflame the jury than oral descriptions of the circumstances of the crime. Their admission was within the court\u2019s discretion. <em>Wise, </em>230 Va. at 330, 337 S.E.2d at 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Pope objected at trial to Officer Vick\u2019s testimony that he had run over the same route that Marcie had run at the hospital, in order to measure the elapsed time required. As noted above, this evidence was relevant to refute the reasonableness of Pope\u2019s hypothesis that another person might have stolen Cynthia\u2019s purse while Marcie was out of the car. Pope argues that the evidence should have been excluded because of differences between Vick\u2019s and Marcie\u2019s strength and physical condition. We disagree. Those differences affect the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility. <em>See Washington, </em>228 Va. at 552, 323 S.E.2d at 588-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Pope argues on appeal that the trial court erred in precluding him from introducing evidence that James Taylor had a reputation as a drug dealer and that Nick\u2019s Pool Hall had a reputation as a place where drugs are distributed. He contends that this evidence would assist his efforts to impeach Marcie. Marcie had testified that although she was a user of drugs, she and Cynthia did not come to Portsmouth to buy drugs, and that she did not know Taylor was a drug dealer. Marcie testified that she had known Taylor and his mother for ten years and that Cynthia worked in Portsmouth and frequently took Taylor\u2019s mother, who had no car, to stores and on other errands. Marcie was never cross-examined concerning any knowledge of the reputations either of Taylor or of the pool hall. Consequently, the reputation evidence Pope sought to introduce would not have impeached Marcie\u2019s testimony in any respect. The court correctly excluded it as irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">IV. TRIAL \u2014 PENALTY PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"A1z\">A. <em>Evidence of Parole Status</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">During the penalty phase of the trial, Pope objected to evidence offered to show that he was, on the date of the offense, free on parole from a penitentiary sentence imposed for a prior crime. Pope concedes that his prior criminal record was admissible, and that prior unadjudicated criminal conduct might be used at the penalty phase to prove future dangerousness. He argues, however, that the parole system is \u201cnot part of a criminal prosecution, but is part of a separate administrative system,\u201d and that his parole status was therefore irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The objection was without merit. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4 requires the jury, as a prerequisite to imposition of the death penalty based on the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate, to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the \u201cprior history\u201d of the defendant. We upheld the constitutionality of that section in <em>LeVasseur, 225 </em>Va. at 593-94, 304 S.E.2d at 660, and in <em>Smith, </em>219 Va. at 477-78, 248 S.E.2d at 148-49. We relied on the reasoning of <em>Jurek </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262 (1976): \u201cWhat is essential is that the jury have before it <em>all possible relevant information </em>about the individual defendant whose fate it must determine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276 (emphasis added). In <em>Bassett, 222 </em>Va. at 852, 284 S.E.2d at 849, we held that future dangerousness could reasonably be inferred from the fact that a defendant had committed additional crimes within six months of his release on parole from a 99-year sentence for armed robbery. That fact, we noted, tended to show a predisposition to commit other crimes upon release from custody. The evidence here is equally relevant and probative on the issue of future dangerousness. In addition to showing a predisposition to commit acts of increasing violence after punishment for earlier crimes, it demonstrates that Pope was undeterred by the constraints of parole supervision. The court correctly overruled Pope\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">B. <em>Passion and Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">On appeal, Pope contends that the \u201ccumulative effect of the trial court\u2019s erroneous rulings and the overzealousness of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney so inflamed the passion and prejudice of the jury to cause them to award the death penalty.\u201d Because we have found no error in the trial court\u2019s rulings, we reject Pope\u2019s cumulative-effect argument. <em>See Wise, </em>230 Va. at 335, 337 S.E.2d at 723. Pope does not specify, nor does our independent review of the record disclose, any showing of prosecutorial \u201coverzealousness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">C. <em>Excessiveness and Proportionality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Pope argues, finally, that the death penalty, as applied here, is excessive and disproportionate to the penalty imposed in other capital murder cases. At the penalty phase of the trial, Pope\u2019s mother testified that he had had attendance and discipline problems in school as an adolescent, and that he dropped out of school and began having \u201cproblems with the law.\u201d His parole officer testified that Pope had been convicted of four misdemeanors when he was 18 years old: unlawful concealment of property, two petit larceny convictions, and carrying a concealed weapon. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>age of 19, Pope was convicted of felonious assault and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. He was sentenced to eight years for the shooting and two years for the firearm offense. He served 29 months of those 10 years, was released on parole in October 1985, and committed the present crimes three months later while still on parole. Pope\u2019s criminal record demonstrated an escalating tendency toward violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The jury heard the testimony of Pope\u2019s parents, who testified that he could become a good citizen; a corrections officer, who testified that Pope had been a good prisoner; and a psychiatrist, who opined that although Pope acted on impulse and did not know \u201chow to handle circumstances\u201d he could nevertheless \u201cfunction adequately in a structured environment.\u201d The jury also properly took into account the unprovoked and sudden nature of the violence Pope employed on the two victims in this case, who were unarmed and constituted no threat to him, as well as the unnecessary degree of deadly force he chose to employ to accomplish his purpose of robbery and to quell resistance. There was sufficient evidence before the jury to support its conclusion that there was \u201ca probability . . . that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Pursuant to the requirements of Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C), we have reviewed the record and have determined that the sentence of death was neither imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, nor is it excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant. In making the latter determination, we have accumulated and reviewed the records in all capital murder cases reviewed by this Court since the present statutes became effective, giving particular attention to those cases in which the death penalty was based solely upon the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate, <em>i.e., Peterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 289, 302 S.E.2d 520, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 865 (1983); <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 844, 284 S.E.2d 844 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 938 (1982); <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 222 </em>Va. 766, 284 S.E.2d 816 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1038 (1982); <em>Giarratano </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1064, 266 S.E.2d 94 (1980); and <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 257 S.E.2d 808 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980). From that review, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>we are satisfied that juries in Virginia generally impose the death penalty in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Finding no error in the record, we decline to commute the death sentence and will affirm the several convictions and the judgments appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
