Sateren against Montgomery Ward and Company, Inc. In his motion for judgment, Sateren alleged an agent of Montgomery Ward had falsely represented that Sateren owed the company $921.83, causing him embarrassment, emotional distress, and financial loss, as well as damage to his credit and his standing in the community. In a jury trial, the court struck Sateren\u2019s evidence and entered judgment for Montgomery Ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">The libel action was filed on February 23, 1982. On November 21, 1979, the General District Court of the City of Hampton had dismissed with prejudice a civil warrant brought by Montgomery Ward against Sateren seeking to recover $908.21 on open account.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">In the meantime, Montgomery Ward had continued to press Sateren for payment. It placed the claim with a collection agency \u201cas a charge-off,\u201d meaning that the account was \u201cnoncollectible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">In 1981, Sateren and his wife decided to purchase a new home, and they selected one in the $56,000 to $58,000 price range. The real estate agent handling the transaction \u201cran a credit check\u201d on Sateren. The credit agency\u2019s report showed that Montgomery Ward was still carrying a past due amount of $921 in Sateren\u2019s name, with a rating of \u201cR-9.\u201d A legend accompanying the report defined an R-9 rating as a \u201c[b]ad debt, placed for collection; suit; judgment; bankruptcy; skip.\u201d Testimony showed that an R-9 rating is \u201cthe lowest one\u201d which can be assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The report caused the real estate agent to advise Sateren he could not qualify for financing on his new home unless Montgomery Ward changed the rating. Sateren called on James R. Turner, Montgomery Ward\u2019s credit manager, and asked him to change the rating. Turner refused. The Saterens abandoned the purchase of the home they had selected and bought a less-expensive one with assumable financing.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">In considering Montgomery Ward\u2019s motion to strike Sateren\u2019s evidence, the trial court stated that because Sateren\u2019s action was for libel per quod rather than libel per se, he had the burden of showing \u201cactual malice . . . and . . . actual damages.\u201d The court held that Sateren had shown \u201cno damages\u201d and struck his evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">On appeal, Montgomery Ward correctly makes an important concession in light of our decision in <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>221 Va. 884, 275 S.E.2d 632 (1981), a case involving, as here, a private plaintiff in a libel action against a non-media defendant. Montgomery Ward agrees that \u201cit is not necessary to show actual out of pocket damage in [a] non libel per se action\u201d and that \u201ca showing of loss of reputation and standing in the community, embarrassment, humiliation, and mental suffering will be sufficient for the award of damages.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Thus, it is obvious that the trial court based its finding of \u201cno damages\u201d upon erroneous principles. Montgomery Ward argues, however, that we can yet affirm the judgment by following the rule that \u201cin a proper case, where the correct conclusion has been reached but the wrong reason given, [we will] sustain the result and assign the right ground.\u201d <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Grimes, </em>211 Va. 97, 100, 175 S.E.2d 246, 248 (1970); <em>Eason </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>204 Va. 347, 352, 131 S.E.2d 280, 283 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">We do not think, however, that this is a \u201cproper case\u201d for application of the \u201cright result, wrong reason\u201d rule. While Montgomery Ward states that the trial court assigned several reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>for its decision other than the \u201cno damages\u201d basis, we read the court\u2019s opinion as confining the decision to that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Furthermore, the opinion can as well be read as a rejection of any other basis for the decision, and, in that case, we could not consider another reason in the absence of a cross-assignment of error filed by Montgomery Ward. Finally, we are reluctant to follow the \u201cright conclusion, wrong reason\u201d rule here because not only has the damage question been decided upon erroneous principles but the liability question as well. <em>See </em>n.2. We think Sateren is entitled to another day in court and to have his case tried according to correct principles, win or lose.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-12\"> The difference between the $908.21 figure involved in the district court proceeding and the $921.83 amount involved in the libel action represents finance charges added by Montgomery Ward.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\"> Montgomery Ward also concedes that in light of <em>The Gazette </em>v. <em>Harris, 229 </em>Va. 1, 325 S.E.2d 713, <em>cert. denied, </em>472 U.S. 1032 (1985), decided after the present case was decided below, Sateren, as a private plaintiff suing a non-media defendant, is not required to show actual malice but is entitled to recover upon a showing that Montgomery Ward published false information knowing it was false when published or, believing it to be true, lacked reasonable grounds for such belief. 229 Va. at 15, 325 S.E.2d at 724-25. <em>Gazette </em>lists another ground for recovery, <em>viz., </em>that the defendant \u201cacted negligently in failing to ascertain the facts on which the publication was based.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
