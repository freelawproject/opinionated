Later that day, at Emma\u2019s House, a Children\u2019s Advocacy Center in Hamilton, R.S. participated in a forensic interview with Valerie Widmer (Widmer), a licensed clinical social worker with specialized training in forensic interviews. R.S. stated that she had met Daffin through her friend B.M., whose father worked for Daffin. During the interview, R.S. revealed that Daffin had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>forced or coerced her to have sex multiple times, and induced her to send him a topless photo of herself. R.S.\u2019s allegations resulted in Daffin being charged with two counts of Sexual Intercourse Without Consent, two counts of Sexual Assault, and one count of Sexual Abuse of Children.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b63 Widmer conducted a forensic interview of B.M. the following day at Emma\u2019s House. B.M. reluctantly revealed that she also had been coerced to have sex and was sexually assaulted multiple times by Daffin during the previous summer, while she was 13 years old. B.M.\u2019s allegations resulted in Daffin being charged with three counts of Sexual Intercourse Without Consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u00b64 As the investigation continued, additional victims, former victims, and witnesses were identified. The victims and witnesses provided evidence covering a 20-year period of sexually predatory behavior by Daffin, as well as his use and distribution of dangerous drugs. The victims and witnesses provided details of how Daffin selected and groomed young female victims, eventually leading to him sexually assaulting them. From these reports Daffin was charged with additional counts of Sexual Intercourse Without Consent, Sexual Assault, and Sexual Abuse of Children, along with other crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u00b65 A.K. was one of the additional victims located during the investigation. A.K. was 18 years old at the time of her forensic interview. She revealed that, during the time she was 13-16 years old, she had been sexually assaulted by Daffin on multiple occasions; engaged in sex with Daffin in exchange for drugs; recruited other young girls to have sexual relations with Daffin; and helped to transport young girls and drugs, from Idaho to Montana, for Daffin. A.K.\u2019s allegations resulted in Daffin being charged with two counts of Sexual Intercourse Without Consent, one count of Criminal Distribution of Dangerous Drugs, and one count of Sexual Abuse of Children.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">\u00b66 A.K.\u2019s older sister, K.C., testified that she had known Daffin her entire life because he and her father were friends. K.C. testified to \u201cpartying\u201d with her father and Daffin as a young child. When she was 12 years old, KC.\u2019s father was sent to prison and Daffin began to \u201cflirt\u201d with her. From the time she was 12 years old until she was approximately 18 years old, she was sexually assaulted by Daffin; had sex with Daffin in exchange for drugs and money; recruited other young girls to have sex with Daffin in exchange for drugs and money; and transported drugs and young girls for Daffin. KC.\u2019s allegations resulted in Daffin being charged with one count of Sexual Intercourse Without Consent, one count of Sexual Assault, one count of Criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Distribution of Dangerous Drugs, and one count of Sexual Abuse of Children.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b67 K.D., a former victim, also came forward. K.D. testified that Daffin sexually assaulted her when she was 15 years old, shortly after she had completed a youth drug treatment program. K.D.\u2019s allegation resulted in Daffin being charged with one count of Sexual Intercourse Without Consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b68 At trial, these five girls and women testified in detail concerning Daffin\u2019s process of selecting, grooming, sexually assaulting, and, finally, coercing them to secrecy. Additionally, the State called 29 other witnesses. These witnesses testified to aspects of the investigation and about their knowledge of Daffin\u2019s patterns of victim grooming and abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u00b69 After R.S. made her initial disclosure concerning Daffin, a third-party reported to the school counselor that R.S. had been sexually assaulted in a park by a group of teen boys. When the school counselor questioned R.S. about this, R.S. denied making any such allegation, and said \u201cno one had done anything\u201d to her. Later, R.S. wrote letters of apology to the boys who had been named in the incident. While not explicitly acknowledging she had made false sexual allegations, she offered that the matter was intended as a joke. Around the same time, R.S. recanted her allegations against Daffin. Based on this information, Daffin requested a hearing pursuant to <em>State ex rel. Mazurek v. Dist. Court of the Montana Fourth Judicial </em>Dist., 277 Mont. 349, 922 P.2d 474 (1996), to present evidence of the false allegations made by R.S. and her recantation. After hearing the testimony, the District Court applied \u00a7 45-5-511(2), MCA, by ruling that evidence about the alleged sexual assault in the park by the boys was inadmissible, but that the evidence concerning R.S.\u2019s recantation was admissible because it related directly to R.S.\u2019s allegations against Daffin.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u00b610 Daffin also moved in limine to exclude \u201cother acts\u201d evidence under M. R. Evid. 404(b). The District Court reserved ruling until trial, citing \u201cthe highly inflammatory nature of the evidence of sexual conduct.\u201d Later, it denied the motion in limine, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">The State has adequately explained how it intends to use the evidence to show motive, intent and mental state, knowledge, and identity, which are all permissible purposes for admitting other acts evidence. Daffin\u2019s arguments that such evidence should be precluded because it is remote, is beyond the statute of limitations, and/or does not constitute a criminal offense are without merit\u2014none of these bear on relevance or justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>precluding admissible other acts evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b611 Daffin was convicted of 16 of the 17 charges against him. He appeals, challenging the District Court\u2019s admission of \u201cother acts\u201d evidence and the court\u2019s application of \u00a7 45-5-511(2), MCA, Montana\u2019s Rape Shield Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u00b612 District courts have broad discretion to determine the admissibility of evidence. <em>State v. Madplume, </em>2017 MT 40, \u00b6 19, 386 Mont. 368, 390 P.3d 142 (citing <em>State v. Spottedbear, </em>2016 MT 243, \u00b6 9, 385 Mont. 68, 380 P.3d 810). We review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion, which occurs when a district court acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Madplume, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>Spottedbear, </em>\u00b6 9). To the extent an evidentiary ruling is based on a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Montana Rules of Evidence, our review is <em>de novo. Madplume, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>Spottedbear, </em>\u00b6 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s application of a statute for correctness. <em>State v. Aguado, </em>2017 MT 54, \u00b6 9, 387 Mont. 1, 390 P.3d 628 (citing <em>State v. Colburn, </em>2016 MT 41, \u00b6 6, 382 Mont. 223, 366 P.3d 258).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">\u00b614 <em>1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of prior acts under M. R. Evid. 404(b)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">\u00b615 M. R. Evid. 404(b) states that \u201c[ejvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Rule 404(b) is designed to ensure that jurors \u201cdo not impermissibly infer that a defendant\u2019s prior bad acts make that person a bad person, and therefore, a guilty person.\u201d <em>Madplume, </em>\u00b6 22, (citing <em>State v. Dist. Court of the Eighteenth Judicial Dist., </em>2010 MT 263, \u00b6 47, 358 Mont. 325, 246 P.3d 415 (hereinafter <em>\u201cSalvagni\u201d)). </em>However, evidence of prior bad acts, including uncharged crimes, is admissible for other purposes such \u201cas proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d M. R. Evid. 404(b). \u201cThe distinction between admissible and inadmissible Rule 404(b) evidence turns on the intended purpose of the evidence, not its substance.\u201d <em>Madplume, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing <em>Salvagni, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 47, 62-63). \u201cTo prevent the permissible uses from swallowing the general rule barring propensity evidence, the trial court must ensure that the use of Rule 404(b) evidence is \u201c \u2018clearly justified and carefully limited.\u2019 \u201d <em>Madplume, </em>\u00b6 23 (quoting <em>State v. Aakre, </em>2002 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>MT 101, \u00b6 12, 309 Mont. 403, 46 P.3d 648). Rule 404(b) other acts evidence is admissible if the proponent can \u201cclearly articulate how that evidence fits into a chain of logical inferences, no link of which may be the inference that the defendant has the propensity to commit the crime charged.\u201d <em>State v. Clifford, </em>2005 MT 219, \u00b6 48, 328 Mont. 300, 121 P.3d 489 (quoting and citing <em>United States v. Himelwright, </em>42 F.3d 777, 782 (3rd Cir. 1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b616 Daffin launches a broad-based attack on the State\u2019s overall case, arguing that the District Court abused its discretion by \u201callowing a mountain of prejudicial and confusing evidence regarding [his] alleged past conduct.\u201d Daffin urges us to turn a \u201cjaundiced eye\u201d toward the \u201cmountain of irrelevant, prejudicial propensity evidence\u201d used against him by the State. Daffin\u2019s legal claims are that: (1) the State broadly failed to demonstrate a proper purpose for introducing evidence of Daffin\u2019s prior bad acts; (2) the sheer amount of evidence admitted was overwhelming and prejudiced the jury; and (3) the District Court failed to fulfill its gatekeeping function under M. R. Evid. 403. The State responds that evidence of Daffin\u2019s prior bad acts was admissible because it was \u201cinextricably linked to and explanatory of\u2019 his conduct and was admitted to prove identity, motive, purpose and knowledge, and absence of mistake or accident. The State\u2019s \u201cinextricably linked\u201d argument is improperly drawn from the transaction rule, which the District Court did not address, and which is not at issue here. <em>See </em>\u00a7 26-1-103, MCA; <em>State v. Stout, </em>2010 MT 137, \u00b6 39, 356 Mont. 468, 237 P.3d 37 (\u201cApplication of the transaction rule should not be used to avoid Rule 404 ....\u201d). Rather, we examine the purposes offered by the State under Rule 404(b), some of which overlap, for introduction of the challenged evidence. We then address the District Court\u2019s balancing of the factors in Rule 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">M. R. Evid. 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\n<em>A. Identity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\u00b617  Evidence is admissible to demonstrate that a defendant employs a particular grooming pattern or uses \u201cdistinctive or idiosyncratic methods to lure victims into vulnerable positions that enable sexual assault.\u201d <em>Aakre, </em>\u00b6 20 (citation omitted). \u201cThis identity exception is often used \u2018[t]o prove other like crimes by the accused so nearly identical in method as to earmark them as the handiwork of the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Salvagni, </em>\u00b6 60 (quoting <em>State v. Kordonowy, </em>251 Mont. 44, 49, 823 P.2d 854, 857 (1991)). \u201c[SJimilarity between the prior crime and the alleged crime on trial is sufficient for admissibility, especially in the context of sex crimes.\u201d <em>Aakre, </em>\u00b6 22 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u00b618 Here, the testimony of the former victims and other witnesses was used to establish Daffin\u2019s methods of victim selection and grooming. Some common elements of Daffin\u2019s \u201ccriminal signature\u201d included: supplying his victims with alcohol and drugs; driving his victims around in his vehicle; \u201cpartying\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with his victims; taking them \u201cmudding\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; and, eventually, assaulting them. Testimony about Daffin\u2019s pattern of sexual abuse detailed a process that started with \u201cflirting\u201d; escalated to sexual conversation and touching that bordered on sexual; proceeded to sexual contact; and concluded by telling the victims they were at fault or complicit in the abuse, and swearing them to silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\n<em>B. Motive</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b619  Evidence is admissible to show motive when separate acts can be explained by the same motive. <em>State v. Crider, </em>2014 MT 139, \u00b6 25, 375 Mont. 187, 328 P.3d 612 (\u201c[A] prior bad act may evidence the existence of a motive without supplying the motive. In such cases, the motive is the cause and both the prior acts and the act at issue are effects.\u201d); <em>Salvagni, </em>\u00b6 59 (\u201c[T]he motive is cause, and the charged and uncharged acts are effects; that is, both acts are explainable as a result of the same motive. The prosecutor uses the uncharged act to show the existence of the motive, and the motive in turn strengthens the inference of the defendant\u2019s identity as the perpetrator of the charged act.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\u00b620 The testimony of former victims and witnesses demonstrated Daffin\u2019s longstanding sexual fixation with underage teen girls, particularly living in vulnerable family situations, and provided the motive for his crimes. The record reflected that Daffin pursued a sexual interest in underage females for approximately 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\n<em>C. Purpose and Mental State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">\u00b621 In <em>State v. Stewart, </em>2012 MT 317, \u00b6 64, 367 Mont. 503, 291 P.3d 1187, we stated that a typical prosecution is reducible to three components: \u201c(1) someone committed the <em>actus reus </em>(i.e., forbidden act) alleged in the indictment or information; (2) that person possessed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>requisite <em>mens rea </em>(i.e., criminal intent or state of mind); and (3) that person was the defendant.\u201d (Citation omitted.) At trial, Daffin challenged the first and second components. He claimed that he did not abuse or sexually assault any of the victims of the charged crimes, and that any contact he had with them was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b622 The State\u2019s array of former victims and other witnesses demonstrated that Daffin\u2019s actions with the victims\u2014including those actions, such as recreating in the mountains, that would be innocent and appropriate in circumstances of normative behavior\u2014were perversely intended to abuse the victims, or set up that abuse. As we have previously stated, the use of other-acts evidence to prove either the <em>actus reus </em>or <em>mens rea </em>does not necessarily violate Rule 404(b). <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 65. The testimony of Daffin\u2019s ex-wife, long-time acquaintances, and former victims about Daffin\u2019s behaviors served to prove that he knowingly groomed and sexually assaulted the victims of the charged crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u00b623  While we could analyze the evidence under other factors listed in Rule 404(b), the above-referenced factors are sufficient to establish that the State\u2019s overall evidentiary case, as challenged here, was admitted for proper purposes. Further, given the large number of sexual charges the State had to prove, spanning many years, admission of the volume of sexual evidence was not an abuse of discretion, and the District Court properly fulfilled its gatekeeping function.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">M. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">\u00b624 Daffin argues, \u201cI a Issuming <em>arguendo </em>some of the evidence was admissible for non-propensity reasons, the record reflects [that] the district court took no steps to balance the non-propensity value with [Daffin\u2019s] interest in a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">\u00b625 \u201cAll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by constitution, statute, these rules, or other rules applicable in the courts of this state.\u201d M. R. Evid. 402. Rule 403 provides that relevant evidence may be excluded \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d \u201cDistrict courts have broad discretion to weigh the relative probative value of evidence against the risk of unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>Madplume, </em>\u00b6 32 (citing <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 68). While probative evidence is generally prejudicial to one side or the other, \u201c[e]vidence rises to the level of being unfairly prejudicial only \u2018if it arouses the jury\u2019s hostility or sympathy for one side without regard to its probative value, if it confuses or misleads the trier of fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>or if it unduly distracts from the main issues.\u2019 \u201d <em>Madplume, </em>\u00b6 33 (quoting and citing <em>State v. Hicks, </em>2013 MT 50, \u00b6 24, 369 Mont. 165, 296 P.3d 1149). \u201cEven if evidence is potentially unfairly prejudicial, the Rule 403 balancing test favors admission\u2014the risk of unfair prejudice must substantially outweigh the evidence\u2019s probative value.\u201d <em>Madplume, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b626 The District Court denied Daffin\u2019s Rule 403 objection, reasoning: [T]he Court is not persuaded that the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence. Although the other acts evidence is prejudicial, it is also highly probative in view of Daffin\u2019s defense theory that the victims of the offenses of which he is charged are lying and conspired to make their accusations against him. The jury should be able to hear and weigh this other acts evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b627  Under the standards stated above, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the other acts evidence after balancing its prejudicial effect against its probative value. The challenged evidence was particularly probative of the lengthy and detailed process used by Daffin to systematically, over many years, obtain control over certain kinds of potential victims, groom them for abuse, physically abuse them, and coerce their secrecy about the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b628 <em>2. Did the District Court err in applying \u00a7 45-5-511(2), MCA, Montana\u2019s Rape Shield </em>Law?</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\u00b629 Montana\u2019s Rape Shield Law is designed to prevent victims \u201cfrom being exposed at trial to harassing or irrelevant questions concerning their past sexual behavior.\u201d <em>Colburn, </em>\u00b6 22 (citation omitted). Section 45-5-511(2), MCA, reflects Montana\u2019s interest in preventing the trial of the charge against the defendant \u201cfrom becoming a trial of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct.\u201d <em>Colburn, </em>\u00b6 22 <em>(citing State v. Higley, </em>190 Mont. 412, 422, 621 P.2d 1043, 1050-51 (1980)).

The Rape Shield Law is balanced against the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to confront his accusers and present evidence in his defense, because \u201c[njeither the Rape Shield Law nor the defendant\u2019s right to confront and present evidence are absolute.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>Colburn, </em>\u00b6 25 (citation omitted). We have explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">The Rape Shield Law therefore cannot be applied to exclude evidence arbitrarily or mechanistically and it is the trial court\u2019s responsibility to strike a balance in each case between the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense and a victim\u2019s rights under the statute. A court balancing the interest of the defendant with those protected by the Rape Shield Law should require that the proffered evidence is not merely speculative or unsupported.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A84\"><em>Colburn, </em>\u00b6 25 (internal citations omitted).

Under this inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">the defendant must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that (1) the accusation or accusations were in fact made; (2) that the accusation or accusations were in fact false; and (3) that the evidence is more probative than prejudicial. If the defendant satisfies these three conditions, the trial court will authorize cross-examination of the complaining witness concerning the alleged false accusations. The defendant may thereafter present extrinsic evidence of the false accusations only if the complaining witness denies or fails to recall having made such accusations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXF\"><em>State ex rel.

At the hearing, Shannon McMillan (McMillan), the mother of one of the boys who had been named in the story about R.S. being sexually assaulted in the park, testified that: (1) R.S. had sent texts to McMillan\u2019s son claiming that she loved him; (2) R.S. had \u201ctried breaking up my son\u201d from his girlfriend, who was R.S.\u2019s friend; (3) R.S. \u201cwas really angry because [McMillan\u2019s son] still wouldn\u2019t date her, so she got several of her friends to threaten to beat him up for a couple weeks\u201d; (4) R.S. \u201creported ... to the school that a group of several boys had assaulted her sexually in a park after school\u201d; (5) McMillan\u2019s son had received an apology note written by R.S.; and (6) as a result of the events concerning her son McMillan questioned R.S.\u2019s veracity, concluding that \u201cI believe that [R.S.] will lie to get herself not only out of trouble but to get attention, and I believe that she\u2019s\u2014she really needs a lot of mental help, because she\u2019s making accusation against lots of people and it\u2019s very damaging.\u201d Upon cross-examination, McMillan admitted that she did not know R.S. personally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>and that her testimony was largely based upon things her son and others had told her.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b631 School Resource Officer Randy Eppinger (Eppinger) testified, stating that: (1) the initial allegation against McMillan\u2019s son was reported to the school counselor by a student who had overheard two other students talking about it; (2) the school counselor had told him R.S. denied making the allegation; (3) he had spoken to R.S. and told her not to contact McMillan\u2019s son; and (4) McMillan\u2019s son told him R.S. had not contacted him after their conversation. Patricia Thomas (Thomas), one of Daffin\u2019s friends and the mother of one of R.S.\u2019s friends, testified about R.S.\u2019s recantation of her allegations against Daffin.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u00b632 The District Court held that the threshold showing had been established for Thomas\u2019 testimony about R.S.\u2019s recantation of her allegations against Daffin, and the evidence would be admitted. The District Court denied Daffin\u2019s request to introduce evidence about R.S.\u2019s false allegation against the boys, reasoning that McMillan\u2019s testimony was based solely upon hearsay. The District Court stated, \u201c[i]n the absence of any competent evidence to show that [R.S.] made a false allegation of sexual assault against... McMillan\u2019s son and other students, Daffin cannot establish even the first prong of the <em>Mazurek </em>test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b633 On appeal, Daffin urges that the failure to admit McMillian\u2019s testimony prohibited him from exploring and attacking R.S.\u2019s credibility, and thus prejudiced his defense. He argues that R.S. suffers from mental illness, she made a false accusation to seek attention, and that McMillan\u2019s testimony would have both supported Thomas\u2019s testimony about R.S.\u2019s recantation as well as called into question R.S.\u2019s credibility. Further, Daffin asserts that most of the evidence presented at the <em>Mazurek </em>hearing did not relate to R.S.\u2019s sexual conduct, but instead to her mental health, which formed the basis of R.S.\u2019s need to lie to seek attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">\u00b634 To the extent the District Court applied \u00a7 45-5-511(2), MCA, to conduct other than R.S.\u2019s <em>sexual </em>conduct, Daffin\u2019s argument is correct: the Rape Shield Law was inapplicable. Most of the evidence presented at the hearing did not relate to R.S.\u2019s sexual conduct. However, that does not mean the evidence was admissible. McMillan\u2019s and Eppinger\u2019s testimony about R.S.\u2019s alleged false accusation was based on hearsay and hearsay within hearsay, and much of McMillan\u2019s testimony was inadmissible at trial on that basis. Further, while Daffin now argues that he wanted to offer the theory that R.S.\u2019s mental health problems led her to make the accusation against him, this theory is based on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>brief observation made by Eppinger, at trial, that R.S. \u201cjust wanted her mother\u2019s attention,\u201d which is hardly a basis to frame such a defense. \u201cWe will affirm the district court when it reaches the right result, even if it reaches the right result for the wrong reason.\u201d <em>State v. Ellison, </em>2012 MT 50, \u00b6 8, 364 Mont. 276, 272 P.3d 646 (citing <em>City of Billings v. Staebler, </em>2011 MT 254, \u00b6 9, 362 Mont. 231, 262 P.3d 1101). For these reasons, to the extent the District Court erred in applying the Rape Shield Law, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b635 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b189-6\">JUSTICES SHEA, WHEAT, SANDEFUR and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-16\"> Daffin was sentenced to thirteen life sentences and three one-hundred-year sentences.
