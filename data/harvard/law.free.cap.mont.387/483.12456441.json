We address the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">\n<em>Whether the District Court erred by granting summary judgment to Asurion and denying summary judgment to MIGA based on the exclusivity provision of the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b500-15\">\u00b62 Christy Harris is a former employee of National Electronics Warranty, LLC\u2014now known as Asurion Services, LLC (Asurion)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2014at its customer service facility in Great Falls. While employed by Asurion, Harris filed industrial injury claims for two different incidents, occurring on May 5,2002, and September 4,2002. Asurion was insured by Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company (Lumbermens) as a Plan 2 employer under Montana\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (WCA), \u00a7 39-71-101 et seq., MCA. Lumbermens accepted and adjusted Harris\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claims until it was declared insolvent in May 2013. When Lumbermens went into liquidation, the MIGA assumed handling of Harris\u2019s claims pursuant to the Montana Insurance Guaranty Association Act (Guaranty Act), \u00a7 33-10-101, et seq., MCA. MIGA retained Western Guaranty Fund Services to adjust Harris\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>claims, which it continued to do through February 2015. In February 2015, MIGA notified Asurion that it was seeking recovery of benefits paid on Harris\u2019s claims pursuant to \u00a7 33-10-114(2), MCA, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\">(2) The association has the right to recover from the following persons the amount of any \u201ccovered claim\u201d paid on behalf of the person pursuant to this part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">(a) any insured whose net worth, on December 31 of the year preceding the date the insurer becomes an insolvent insurer, exceeds $50 million and whose liability obligations to other persons are satisfied in whole or in part by payments made under this part[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b63 Asurion filed a declaratory judgment action, naming MIGA, Harris, and the Montana Department of Labor and Industry (DLI) as defendants. Harris and DLI were dismissed as parties, although DLI remained involved as amicus curiae. MIGA answered and filed a counterclaim, also seeking declaratory relief. Asurion and MIGA filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u00b64 The District Court granted Asurion\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied MIGA\u2019s motion. The District Court concluded that \u00a7 33-10-114(2), MCA, did not afford MIGA relief because the WCA protects the employer by providing an exclusive remedy that frees the employer from potential liability claims by an employee. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-71-411, MCA. The District Court held that because Asurion met its obligation to obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance, it has no payment obligations to Harris; therefore, MIGA cannot base a claim for recovery on \u00a7 33-10-114(2), MCA. The District Court concluded: \u201c[I]t would be illogical to conclude that an employer, protected from liability and removed from the benefits distribution process by law, is suddenly liable for all the payments made by MIGA because the insurer became insolvent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">\u00b65 We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56, as a district court. <em>Pilgeram v. GreenPoint Mortg. Funding, Inc., </em>2013 MT 354, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 1, 313 P.3d 839 (citation omitted). Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>Bird v. Cascade Cnty., </em>2016 MT 345, \u00b6 9, 386 Mont. 69, 386 P.3d 602. When there are cross-motions for summary judgment, a district court must evaluate each party\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>on its own merits. <em>Halenga v. Schwein, </em>2007 MT 80, \u00b6 18, 336 Mont. 507, 155 P.3d 1242. On cross-motions for summary judgment, where the district court is not called to resolve factual disputes and only draw conclusions of law, we review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Bud-Kal v. City of Kalispell, </em>2009 MT 93, \u00b6 15, 350 Mont. 25, 204 P.3d 738 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b66 <em>Whether the District Court erred by granting summary judgment to Asurion and denying summary judgment to MIGA based on the exclusivity provision of the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b67 With limited exceptions not applicable to this case, the WCA applies to all employers and employees. \u201cAn employer who has any employee in service under any appointment or contract of hire, expressed or implied, oral or written, shall elect to be bound by the provisions of compensation plan No. 1, 2, or 3.\u201d Section 39-71-401(1), MCA. Asurion elected to be bound by the provisions of Plan 2, which provides for coverage through a licensed private insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"aei-dedup-0\">\u00b68  Section 39-71-411, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">For all employments covered under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act or for which an election has been made for coverage under this chapter, the provisions of this chapter are exclusive .... <em>[A]n employer is not subject to any liability whatever </em>for the death of or personal injury to an employee covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act or <em>for any claims for contribution or indemnity asserted by a third person from whom damages are sought on account of the injuries or death.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">(Emphasis added.) As noted by the District Court, the Montana Constitution likewise provides for the nonliability of an insured employer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">Courts of justice shall be open to every person, and speedy remedy afforded for every injury of person, property, or character. No person shall be deprived of this full legal redress for injury incurred in employment for which another person may be liable <em>except as to fellow employees and his immediate employer who hired him if such immediate employer provides coverage under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws of this state.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 16 (emphasis added). Other than a basic duty to cooperate and assist its insurer, an employer insured under either Plan 2 or 3 has no role in the adjusting of its employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim. <em>Am. Zurich Ins. Co. v. Mont. Thirteenth Judicial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>Dist. Court, </em>2012 MT 61, \u00b6 13, 364 Mont. 299, 280 P.3d 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b69 Montana\u2019s Guaranty Act provides that when an insurer becomes insolvent and enters into liquidation, MIGA assumes most, if not all, of the insolvent insurers\u2019 financial obligations on first-party and third-party claims. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 33-10-101, et seq., MCA. This statutory obligation includes workers\u2019 compensation claims: \u201c[MIGA] shall pay the full amount of any covered claim arising out of a workers\u2019 compensation or excess workers\u2019 compensation policy....\u201d Section 33-10-105(1)(a)(ii)(B), MCA. Section 33-10-114(2)(a), MCA, generally authorizes MIGA to recover the amount of a \u201ccovered claim\u201d paid from \u201cany insured whose net worth, on December 31 of the year preceding the date the insurer becomes an insolvent insurer, exceeds $50 million and whose liability obligations to other persons are satisfied in whole or in part by payments made under this part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b610 Although the parties advance some ancillary arguments, the fundamental conflict in this case is between the exclusivity provision of the WCA, as set forth in \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, and Article II, Section 16 of the Montana Constitution which insulate an insured employer from liability for an injured employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim, and \u00a7 33-10-114(2)(a), MCA, which would ordinarily allow MIGA to seek reimbursement from an insolvent insurer\u2019s insured whose net worth exceeds $50 million. Resolution of this conflict is dispositive of MIGA\u2019s right to seek reimbursement from Asurion.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b611 MIGA argues that \u00a7 33-10-114(2), MCA, should be applied to workers\u2019 compensation insurance with the same force and effect as the statute applies to other property and casualty insurance. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 33-10-101(3), MCA (\u201c[The Guaranty Act] shall apply to all kinds of direct insurance, except life, title, surety, disability, credit, mortgage guaranty, and ocean marine insurance\u201d). MIGA also contends that when Lumbermens was declared insolvent, Asurion\u2019s insurance policy was \u201cjudicially cancelled\u201d and, therefore, Asurion was no longer covered as a Plan 2 employer. At that time, MIGA argues, Asurion effectively became an uninsured employer, and was no longer shielded from liability by the exclusivity provisions of the WCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u00b612 Asurion argues the exclusive remedy doctrine set forth in \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, and Article II, Section 16 of the Montana Constitution insulates employers like Asurion from what are essentially third-party indemnity claims by MIGA. Asurion contends the insurer\u2019s duty to pay claims under a Plan 2 arrangement is non-delegable. Asurion contends \u00a7 33-10-114(2), MCA, as relied on by MIGA, is the more general provision of law, contrary to the more specific provisions of the WCA, specifically \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, concerning liability and indemnity. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b613 The WCA provides an exclusive remedy that protects the employer from liability claims by employees and third parties if the employer has met its obligation to obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance. The exclusive remedy provisions of the WCA found at \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, and Article II, Section 16 of the Montana Constitution are more specific to a workers\u2019 compensation claim made by the employee of an insured employer than the general provisions of \u00a7 33-10-114, MCA, which apply to insurers generally. \u201cIn the construction of a statute, the intention of the legislature is to be pursued if possible. When a general and particular provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the former, so a particular intent will control a general one that is inconsistent with it.\u201d Section 1-2-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b614  Pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, insured employers are \u201cnot subject to any liability whatever ... for any claims for contribution or indemnity asserted by a third person ....\u201d Asurion met its WCA obligation as a Plan 2 employer by securing coverage from Lumbermens. As such, it enjoys the protection of the exclusivity provisions of the WCA, and is not subject to any claims for contribution or indemnity asserted by MIGA.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b615  We are also unpersuaded by MIGA\u2019s arguments that, upon Lumbermens\u2019 insolvency, Asurion effectively became an \u201cuninsured employer,\u201d and was no longer compliant with the WCA. Harris\u2019s claims were made and accepted by Lumbermens in 2002, before Lumbermens\u2019 insolvency. Lumbermens\u2019 subsequent insolvency did not render Asurion an \u201cuninsured employer\u201d as MIGA contends. Section 39-71-501, MCA, specifically defines an \u201cuninsured employer\u201d as \u201can employer who has not properly complied with the provisions of 39-71-401.\u201d Asurion properly complied with \u00a7 39-71-401, MCA, by \u201celectfing] to be bound by the provisions of compensation plan No. ... 2.\u201d Lumbermens\u2019 subsequent insolvency did not render Asurion noncompliant with the WCA for purposes of the claims at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\u00b616 \u201cThe exclusive remedy rule is perhaps the most firmly entrenched doctrine in workers\u2019 compensation law.\u201d <em>Stratemeyer v. Lincoln County, </em>276 Mont. 67, 74, 915 P.2d 175, 179 (1996) (citing <em>Shea v. North Butte Mining Co., </em>55 Mont. 522, 179 P. 499 (1919)). It is the benefit employers receive from the quid pro quo compromise when they provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage. <em>Walters v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>Flathead, Concrete Prods., </em>2011 MT 45, \u00b6 12, 359 Mont. 346, 249 P.3d 913. Asurion provided workers\u2019 compensation coverage in this case, exactly as the WCA required. To deprive Asurion of the benefit of the exclusive remedy by requiring it to reimburse MIGA for the benefits paid to Harris, despite Asurion\u2019s full compliance with the WCA, would strike at one of the very foundations of the workers\u2019 compensation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b617 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b505-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-16\">All further references to the employer in this Opinion will be to \u201cAsurion.\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b505-6\">JUSTICE SANDEFUR,</author>\n<p id=\"AWx\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b618 I dissent. The essential lynchpin of the Majority opinion is the conclusion that MIGA\u2019s statutory claim for reimbursement of liability insurance proceeds paid to a work-comp claimant on behalf of an insolvent Plan 2 insurer is \u201cessentially [a] third-party indemnity claim[]\u201d against the employer in contravention of the exclusivity provision of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA. Without consideration of the meaning of \u201cindemnity\u201d or the qualifying statutory reference to third-parties \u201cfrom whom damages are sought on account of\u2019 injury to an employee, the Majority\u2019s conclusion erroneously stretches the language and intent of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, too far in disregard of the perfectly harmonious, clear, and unambiguous provisions of the Montana Insurance Guaranty Association Act (MIGA Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">\u00b619 In pertinent part, the exclusive remedy provision of the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (WCA) provides that \u201can employer is not subject to <em>any liability whatever </em>for the death of or personal injury to\u201d a covered employee \u201cor for any claims for contribution or indemnity asserted by a third person from whom <em>damages </em>are sought <em>on account of the injuries or death.\u201d </em>Section 39-71-411, MCA (emphasis added). Though the WCA does not define the terms \u201ccontribution\u201d or \u201cindemnity,\u201d statutory terms having technical legal meaning are defined by their \u201cpeculiar and appropriate meaning in law.\u201d Section 1-2-106, MCA (construction of undefined statutory terms). \u201cContribution\u201d is a limited statutory claim of right, by a joint tortfeasor against one or more others, for equitable apportionment of the damages caused by the combined tortious conduct of the multiple tortfeasors. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-1-703(1), MCA (1997); <em>Consolidated Freightways Corp. of Delaware v. Osier, </em>185 Mont. 439, 446, 605 P.2d 1076, 1080 (1979) (noting 1977 Montana statutory provision of limited right of contribution in derogation of common law principle of joint and several liability), <em>superseded on other grounds </em>by \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA (1981). No claim for contribution is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"Asr-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>\u00b620 Indemnity may refer to contract indemnity or equitable indemnity. Contract indemnity arises under \u201ca contract by which one engages to save another from a legal consequence of the conduct of one of the parties or of some other person.\u201d Section 28-11-301, MCA. Indemnity is a contract \u201cobligation by one party to make another whole for a loss that the other party has incurred.\u201d <em>Crone v. Crone, </em>2003 MT 238, \u00b6 30, 317 Mont. 256, 77 P.3d 167. Insurance is a form of contract indemnity where, by contract, \u201cone undertakes to indemnify another or pay or provide a specified or determinable amount or benefit upon determinable contingencies.\u201d Section 33-1-201(5)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b621 Equitable indemnity \u201cshifts the entire loss from one party compelled [by law] to bear it\u201d to another who in equity should be responsible to \u201cbear it instead.\u201d <em>Consolidated Freightways, </em>185 Mont. at 447, 605 P.2d at 1081. A claim for equitable indemnity is a claim: (1) by a person without fault; (2) who is vicariously or otherwise imputed liable to a third-party for injury and damages caused by another\u2019s tortious conduct; and (3) for the amount the person had to pay to compensate the third-party for the injury and damages caused by the tortfeasor. <em>Poulsen v. Treasure State Indus., Inc., </em>192 Mont. 69, 82, 626 P.2d 822, 829 (1981); <em>Consolidated Freightways, </em>185 Mont. at 447-48, 605 P.2d at 1081; <em>Crosby v. Billings Deaconess Hosp., </em>149 Mont. 314, 320, 426 P.2d 217, 220 (1967); <em>see also State ex rel. Deere &amp; Co. v. Montana 5th Jud. Dist. Court, </em>224 Mont. 384, 398-99, 730 P.2d 396, 405-06 (1986) (rejecting distinction between \u201cactive\u201d negligence and merely \u201cpassive\u201d or \u201csecondary\u201d negligence in re equitable indemnity) <em>superseded on other grounds by </em>\u00a7 27-1-703, MCA (1987). Indemnity \u201cis an all-or-nothing proposition\u201d that \u201cproceeds from a different legal basis than contribution.\u201d <em>Cordier v. Stetson-Ross, Inc., </em>184 Mont. 502, 509, 604 P.2d 86, 90 (1979). Equitable indemnity is not applicable \u201cwhere both parties are joint tortfeasors or in pari dilecto.\u201d <em>Poulsen, </em>192 Mont. at 82, 626 P.2d at 829; <em>accord Consolidated Freightways, </em>185 Mont. at 448, 605 P.2d at 1081. Accordingly, for purposes of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, a \u201cclaim for indemnity\u201d is a claim: (1) against an employer; (2) by a third-party who is liable without fault for an employee\u2019s injury or death;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (3) for the amount the third-party has to pay to compensate the employee or survivors; and (4) for an injury or death caused by the conduct of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\u00b622 In contrast to the concepts of contribution and indemnity as referenced in \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, the Montana Insurance Guaranty Association (MIGA) is a \u201cnonprofit association of insurance companies\u201d with the primary statutory duty to pay covered claims payable under an insurance policy issued by an insolvent insurer and left unpaid prior to the insolvency. <em>Howell v. State, </em>263 Mont. 275, 281, 868 P.2d 568, 571 (1994); <em>accord </em>\u00a7 33-10-105(1)(a),MCA. MIGA essentially steps into the shoes of an insolvent insurer and is considered by law to be the insurer to the extent of the insolvent insurer\u2019s obligation under the policy. Section 30-10-105(1)(b), MCA. At issue here, the MIGA Act authorizes MIGA to recover from the insured the amount paid on behalf of an insolvent insurer if the insured has assets in excess of $50 million. Section 33-10-114(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b623 In lieu of common law liability for unintentional torts, every employer has a duty to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage to employees under one of three statutorily options. Sections 39-71-401(1), -411, MCA. Here, Asurion elected to provide work-comp insurance to its employees through Lumbermens, a private insurance provider. After a court of competent jurisdiction declared Lumbermens insolvent, MIGA stepped in and ultimately settled the underlying work-comp claim asserted by Asurion\u2019s employee. MIGA then sought reimbursement from Asurion pursuant to \u00a7 33-10-114(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"ad2-dedup-0\">\u00b624 As a matter of law, MIGA\u2019s claim against Asurion is not a claim for contract indemnity. No contractual relationship existed between MIGA and Asurion. Though MIGA statutorily filled the shoes of Asurion\u2019s insolvent insurer, it did so only \u201cto the extent of\u2019 the insolvent insurer\u2019s obligation under the policy to compensate Asurion\u2019s employee for her work-related injury. Section 33-10-105(l)(b), MCA. Though related, MIGA\u2019s duty to satisfy the insolvent insurer\u2019s obligation to compensate the injured worker arose as a matter of statute independent of any contractual relationship between MIGA and the insolvent insurer, or between MIGA and Asurion. Thus, MIGA\u2019s claim against Asurion is not a claim for contract indemnity. \u00b625 As a matter of law, MIGA\u2019s claim against Asurion is also not a claim for equitable indemnity. MIGA is not a third-party who, by virtue of its relationship to Asurion, was vicariously or otherwise imputed liable for a breach of duty owed to an employee by Asurion. MIGA\u2019s duty to compensate Asurion\u2019s employee did not arise from any vicarious or imputed duty of care. MIGA\u2019s duty to compensate Asurion\u2019s employee arose independently under the MIGA Act. Thus, MIGA\u2019s claim against Asurion was not a claim for equitable indemnity within the meaning of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>\u00b626 This Court has previously recognized the difference between claims against employers that arise from a vicarious or imputed duty of care to an employee as distinct from those based on independent legal obligations. In <em>Cordier, </em>a paper mill worker employed by Champion International who was seriously injured on the job while operating an industrial gang saw asserted a negligence-based products liability claim against the manufacturer of the saw. <em>Cordier, </em>184 Mont. at 504-05, 604 P.2d at 88. In turn, the manufacturer asserted third-party claims for contribution and indemnity against Champion on the asserted ground that the employer negligently failed to adequately instruct, supervise, and warn its employees regarding the operation of the saw. <em>Cordier, </em>184 Mont. at 505, 604 P.2d at 88. At the time, \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, did not expressly exempt employers from third-party contribution and indemnity claims as it does now. <em>See </em>\u00a7 92-2004, R.C.M. (1947). In holding that \u00a7 39-71-411\u2019s general exemption of employers from \u201cany liability whatever\u201d precluded the third-party contribution and indemnity claims against the employer, this Court clearly distinguished an exclusivity-barred equitable indemnification claim arising from the employer\u2019s duty to provide work-comp coverage, from a permissible contract indemnification claim against an employer based on an independent legal obligation arising \u201cseparate and apart from any obligation owed through the injury to the employee.\u201d <em>Cordier, </em>184 Mont. at 511-12, 604 P.2d at 90-91 <em>(citing DeShaw v. Johnson, </em>155 Mont. 355, 472 P.2d 298 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b627 In <em>DeShaw, </em>a construction worker who was seriously injured by electrocution and falling from a utility pole while performing contract construction work asserted a negligence claim against the rural and electrical cooperatives that contracted with the worker\u2019s employer for the work. <em>DeShaw, </em>155 Mont. at 356-57, 472 P.2d at 299-300. The cooperatives in turn asserted a third-party contract indemnity claim against the construction worker\u2019s employer. <em>DeShaw, </em>155 Mont. at 356-57, 472 P.2d at 299-300. In holding that \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA (formerly \u00a7 92-203, R.C.M. (1947)), did not bar the indemnity claim based on a special contract provision wherein the employer agreed to indemnify the cooperatives for such liability, this Court rejected the assertion that the employer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">cannot be liable for more than workman\u2019s compensation benefits to its employees, that such compensation is the measure of [the employer\u2019s] full liability, and that it cannot be subjected to any additional liability to the third-party plaintiff or anyone else because of the injuries sustained by the [worker].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>DeShaw, </em>155 Mont. at 359-61, 472 P.2d at 301-02. We noted that the immunity conferred by \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\"><em>is only against actions for </em>damages <em>on account of the employee\u2019s injury, </em>a third-party\u2019s action for indemnity is not exactly for \u2018damages\u2019 but for reimbursement, and it is not \u2018on account of the employee\u2019s injury, but on account of breach of an independent duty owed by the employer to the third party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><em>DeShaw, </em>155 Mont. at 361, 472 P.2d at 302 (internal quotation omitted and emphasis added). We thus concluded \u201cthat the legislature had in mind [only] those who might attempt to recover <em>through some relationship with the injured [worker], </em>and <em>not </em>anyone ... who seeks to recover on <em>an obligation separate and apart from that owing to the injured employee.\u201d DeShaw, </em>155 Mont. at 361, 472 P.2d at 302 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u00b628 While <em>Cordier </em>was still pending before this Court, the 1979 Montana Legislature prospectively amended \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, to expressly preclude the type of third-party contribution and equitable indemnity claims at issue in <em>Cordier. See </em>\u00a7 39-71-411, MCA (1979) (as amended by Ch. 329, L. 1979 (SB 322)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Neither the language nor legislative history of Ch. 329, L. 1979 (SB 322) evinces any indication of legislative intent to eliminate or limit the independent duty-based employer liability distinction recognized in <em>DeShaw </em>and <em>Cordier. </em>To the contrary, <em>Cordier </em>and the related language and legislative history of Ch. 329, L. 1979 (SB 322) clearly manifest that \u00a7 39-71-411\u2019s express exemption of employers from \u201cany liability whatever\u201d and its supplemental express bar on third-party indemnity claims certainly bar third-party <em>equitable </em>indemnity claims as in <em>Cordier, </em>but not related third-party claims based on an obligation to a third-party independently imposed by law on the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u00b629 Here, as in <em>DeShaw, </em>MIGA\u2019s independent statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>reimbursement claim against Asurion is not an equitable indemnity claim as in <em>Cordier </em>or within the meaning of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA. Based on a reimbursement obligation independently imposed by statute, MIGA\u2019s claim is also not a contract indemnification claim. Even if arguably akin to a contract indemnification obligation, the claim would still be permissible under the distinction recognized in <em>DeShaw </em>and <em>Cordier </em>and which has now stood undisturbed by the Legislature for 47 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b630 Moreover, as in <em>DeShaw </em>where the employer created the additional liability potential by entering into a construction contract with a special indemnification provision, Asurion\u2019s additional liability exposure under \u00a7 33-10-114(2)(a), MCA, was the result of its discretionary election to provide required work-comp insurance to its employees through a private insurer rather than through the State Fund or self-insurance. With express exceptions not applicable here, the MIGA Act applies to all \u201cinsurers\u201d authorized by law to engage in the business of \u201cinsurance\u201d in Montana. Sections 33-10-101(3), -102(4), -103, MCA; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 33-1-201(2), (5)(a), (6), MCA (definitions of authorized insurer, insurance, and insurer). Under the WCA, each employer has the option of choosing one of three statutorily authorized plans for providing required work-comp insurance. Section 39-71-401(1), MCA. Plan 1 allows a qualified employer to self-insure. Sections 39-71-2101 through -2109, MCA. Plan 2 allows employers to provide required insurance through any private insurance company authorized to transact business in Montana. Sections 39-71-2201 through -2215, MCA. Plan 3 allows employers to provide required insurance through the publicly administered State Fund. Sections 39-71-2311 through -2316, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\u00b631 A Plan 1 self-insurer is not an \u201cinsurer\u201d subject to the Montana Insurance Code or the MIGA Act. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 39-71-2101(1), 33-1-102(5), 33-2-201(5)(a), (6), 33-10-102(2), (3), MCA (definition of Plan 1 self-insurer, exemption from Insurance Code, definitions of insurance and insurer, MIGA Act applicability).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similarly, prior to 2015, the Plan 3 State Fund was also not an \u201cinsurer\u201d subject to the Montana Insurance Code or MIGA coverage. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 39-71-2311, -2312(3), 33-1-102(5), MCA (2013) (definition of Plan 3, express exemption from Insurance Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>and MIGA Act applicability).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, an election to provide required work-comp coverage under Plans 1 or 3 would not have subjected Asurion to potential MIGA reimbursement liability under \u00a7 33-10-114(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\u00b632 In contrast, the MIGA Act applied to Plan 2 work-comp insurance carriers at all times pertinent, thus requiring them, inter alia, to contribute to the pooled costs of adjusting MIGA-covered claims. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 39-71-2201(1), 33-10-101(3), -102(4), -103, -106(2), and -116, MCA (definition of Plan 2 insurer, MIGA Act applicable \u201cto all kinds of direct insurance, except life, title, surety, disability, credit, mortgage guaranty, and ocean marine insurance,\u201d definition of MIGA member, imposition of MIGA membership as condition of authority to transact business in Montana, member duty to comply with MIGA plan of operation, and MIGA assessment authority). By electing to provide required work-comp insurance through a Plan 2 insurer, Asurion <em>exposed itself </em>to additional potential liability under \u00a7 33-10-114(2), MCA, in the event that its selected private insurer became insolvent. As in <em>DeShaw, </em>Asurion\u2019s additional liability is not for damages on account of work-related injury to an employee but, rather, for an obligation independently imposed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u00b633 The WCA and MIGA Act are both creations of the Legislature. The Legislature presumably \u201cdoes not intend to interfere with\u201d its prior enactments unless expressly stated or a subsequent enactment is irreconcilable with a prior one. <em>Alkire v. Mun. Court </em>, 2008 MT 223, \u00b6 11, 344 Mont. 260, 186 P.3d 1288 (internal quotation omitted). The Legislature is presumed to act deliberately with full knowledge of existing law on a subject. <em>State v. Brendal, </em>2009 MT 236, \u00b6 18, 351 Mont. 395, 213 P.3d 448. This Court must harmonize statutes where possible to give effect to both in accordance with the Legislature\u2019s plain language and manifest intent. <em>See Brendal, </em>\u00b6 18. No need or justification exists for resort to statutory construction of a specific provision over a more general provision where both provisions are clear, unambiguous, and not in conflict. <em>Van Orden v. United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>2014 MT 45, \u00b6 18, 374 Mont. 62, 318 P.3d 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u00b634 No conflict exists between the exclusivity provision of \u00a7 39-71-411, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>MCA, and the MIGA Act reimbursement provision of\u00a7 33-10-114(2)(a), MCA. Neither is more specific than the other. The Legislature was well aware of the WCA exclusivity provision as it existed in 1971 at the time of enactment of the MIGA Act. The 1979 amendment of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, to expressly bar claims against employers \u201cfor contribution or indemnity asserted by a third person from whom damages are sought on account of the injuries or death\u201d of a covered employee had nothing to do with the MIGA Act in general or \u00a7 33-10-114(2)(a), MCA, in particular. The 1979 amendment was a specific legislative response to a specific problem, <em>i.e., </em>the type of contribution and equitable indemnity claims at issue in <em>Cordier. </em>Nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">\u00b635 In 2007, the Legislature enacted \u00a7 39-71-2215, MCA, to require Plan 2 insurers to post a security deposit to further secure their insurance obligation to injured workers. Ch. 117, \u00a7 15, L. 2007 (SB 108). <em>Inter </em>alia, the 2007 enactment authorized the Department of Labor and Industry to release all or part of a security deposit to MIGA in the event of a Plan 2 insurer\u2019s insolvency and MIGA assumption of the insurer\u2019s obligations. Section 39-71-2215(5), MCA. The 2007 Legislature also exempted Plan 2 captive reciprocal insurers from the MIGA Act. Section 39-71-2201(3), MCA (Ch. 117, \u00a7 10, L. 2007). Though prospective in effect, these 2007 WCA amendments clearly evidence the Legislature\u2019s prior provision, intent, and understanding that the 1971 MIGA Act has always applied to Plan 2 insurers except as the Legislature has otherwise expressly provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u00b636 Thus, it has always been and remains the express provision and intent of the Legislature that the MIGA Act reimbursement provision of \u00a7 33-10-114(2), MCA, apply to non-captive Plan 2 insurers with assets in excess of $50 million. This construction of the WCA and MIGA Act is not a judicial erosion of the essential public policy compromise embodied in the WCA. This construction effects the manifest intent of the Legislature in both enactments. It is purely the result of a legislative prerogative that the Legislature is free to further address as it sees fit. The District Court erroneously concluded that the exclusivity provision of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, precludes application of the MIGA reimbursement provision of \u00a7 33-10-114(2), MCA, in this case.
