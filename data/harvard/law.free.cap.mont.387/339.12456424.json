We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">\u00b62 Thompson was convicted by a Lewis and Clark County jury of felony driving under the influence, negligent endangerment, and six other driving offenses. At the sentencing hearing, the County Attorney \u201crecommended some leniency and suspension of fines\u201d because the fines would be a burden to Thompson\u2019s family. In its oral pronouncement of sentence, the District Court reduced Thompson\u2019s total fines related to the eight counts from $3,520 to $390.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\u00b63 After addressing each count, the District Court incorporated the sentencing conditions of Thompson\u2019s presentence investigation report (PSI) into its oral pronouncement of sentence. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-10\">Mr. Thompson, in the Presentence Investigation, they\u2019ve got a lot of conditions that you are to meet when you are out. Your sentence, you can remain out on a five-year suspended sentence as long as you obey all of those conditions. I am hopeful you will, and this will allow you to get treatment and get this behind you and get ahead of things.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">After ruling that Thompson\u2019s DUI sentence would run consecutive to his misdemeanor sentences, the court asked if there was \u201c[ajnything else from anybody.\u201d Neither party responded, and the court concluded the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">\u00b64 The PSI conditions that the court incorporated into its oral pronouncement included additional fees, costs, and surcharges. Of relevance here, the PSI provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-13\">f. Costs of assigned counsel, paid to clerk of court: (\u00a7 46-8-113, MCA)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-14\">i.

(\u00a7 46-18-232, MCA).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The PSI included also a financial profile of Thompson and his family that detailed their income, assets, and debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\u00b65 The District Court entered a written judgment that ordered Thompson to pay the additional fees, costs, and surcharges included in the PSI conditions. The written judgment specified $2,028.36 for costs of assigned counsel and $1,846.15 for costs of jury service and other expenses related to the case. Thompson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s imposition of sentence for legality. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2000 MT 290, \u00b6 13, 302 Mont. 265, 14 P.3d 480. Whether a sentence is legal is a question of law that we review de novo to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">\u00b67 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in imposing fees, costs, and surcharges in the written judgment that it did not articulate during the oral pronouncement of sentence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">\u00b68 A district court\u2019s \u201coral pronouncement of a criminal sentence ... is the \u2018legally effective sentence and valid, final judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting State <em>v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, \u00b6 40, 288 Mont. 286, 957 P.2d 9). A \u201cwritten judgment is merely evidence of the oral sentence.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 15. Thus, \u201cin the event of a conflict between the oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment and commitment, the oral pronouncement controls.\u201d <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 48. In determining whether portions of a written judgment conflict with the oral pronouncement of sentence, we \u201cdetermine first, whether the defendant was afforded the opportunity to respond to its inclusion upon sufficient notice at sentencing, and second, whether that portion of the written judgment substantively increases one of two things: (1) the defendant\u2019s loss of liberty; and (2) the defendant\u2019s sacrifice of property.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 24. What is \u201ctruly at issue\u201d under this inquiry is \u201cwhether a written judgment had, without notice, substantively increased a defendant\u2019s criminal sentence which had been previously imposed in open court.\u201d <em>State v. Kroll, </em>2004 MT 203, \u00b6 20, 322 Mont. 294, 95 P.3d 717 (citing <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">\u00b69 Thompson argues that we \u201cmust strike all the fees, costs, and surcharges because they were not included in the controlling, oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>pronouncement and were included in the written judgment without notice\u201d to him. Thompson claims that he was not aware that the District Court would be imposing PSI conditions that included additional costs, fees, and surcharges, and that the court did not expressly address these issues during its oral pronouncement of the sentence. Thompson therefore contends that he did not have an opportunity to object to their inclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b610 Thompson acknowledges that during sentencing the District Court \u201cincorporated the conditions of [the PSI] into the oral pronouncement,\u201d and that a number of the \u201cconditions were additional fines, costs, and surcharges.\u201d Although the written judgment contained specific amounts not discussed during the oral pronouncement, the PSI conditions made clear that Thompson would be responsible for costs of his defense \u201cTBD\u201d and for additional fees, costs, and surcharges. For that reason, we decline to hold that the written judgment conflicted with the court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence. <em>See Kroll, </em>\u00b6 23 (affirming certain sentencing conditions even though \u201cthe District Court did not recite these conditions verbatim at sentencing, or specifically incorporate them into [the defendant\u2019s] sentence by reference to the PSI,\u201d in part because we were not \u201cinclined to elevate form over substance or otherwise impose hyper-technical rules at sentencing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\u00b611 In addition, given the court\u2019s discussion of the conditions listed in the PSI, Thompson ought to have been \u201caware of his sentence\u201d when he left the sentencing hearing. <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 38 (citation and internal quotes omitted). The PSI conditions specifically recommended that Thompson would be responsible for paying costs associated with assigned counsel at an amount to be determined, costs as defined in \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, and expenses related to the case pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-232, MCA. During the sentencing hearing, Thompson\u2019s counsel questioned the probation officer who prepared the PSI; counsel did not question the officer about any of the conditions relating to the fees, costs, and expenses for which amounts had not yet been determined. The District Court expressly incorporated the PSPs conditions on the record. The court then asked if there was \u201c[a]nything else from anybody,\u201d and neither party responded. Thompson had notice that the PSI conditions relating to costs would be included in his sentence and the opportunity to object to the court\u2019s statement incorporating the PSI conditions. <em>See State v. McLeod, </em>2002 MT 348, \u00b6 21, 313 Mont. 358, 61 P.3d 126 (concluding that the defendant\u2019s due process rights were not violated when the district court relied on incorrect information in the PSI because the defendant \u201cand his counsel were given ample time to review and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>discuss the PSI prior to the sentencing hearing,... and were given more than one opportunity at the hearing to object to any information contained in the PSI\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b612 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred by imposing additional costs and fees without considering Thompson\u2019s ability to pay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b613 Thompson asserts that the District Court erred when it failed to consider his financial resources and his ability to pay when it adopted the PSI conditions. Relying on the language of applicable statutes, and our holdings in <em>State v. Starr, </em>2007 MT 238, 339 Mont. 208, 169 P.3d 697, and <em>State v. Moore, </em>2012 MT 95, 365 Mont. 13, 277 P.3d 1212, Thompson contends that a court may not sentence a defendant to pay costs without analyzing whether the defendant is able to pay for such costs. Because the court did not conduct such an analysis with regard to the PSI conditions, Thompson contends that the written sentence is unlawful. The State argues that Thompson did not preserve the issue for appeal because he did not object to the court\u2019s failure to inquire into his ability to pay. Thompson responds that the State itself brought the matter to the court\u2019s attention by objecting to the imposition of fines related to the eight counts during sentencing. According to Thompson, the State\u2019s objection allows this Court to review the issue because \u201c[i]t does not matter which party objected to the imposition of fines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\u00b614  Thompson asserts correctly that Montana statutes require a sentencing court to inquire into a defendant\u2019s ability to pay when sentencing a defendant to pay costs. <em>E.g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46-8-113(3), -18-232(2), MCA; <em>Starr, </em>\u00b6 8; <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 11. We have established, however, that \u201ca sentencing court\u2019s failure to abide by a statutory requirement rises to an objectionable sentence, not necessarily an illegal one.\u201d <em>State v. Kotwicki, </em>2007 MT 17, \u00b6 13, 335 Mont. 344, 151 P.3d 892 <em>(citing State v. Nelson, </em>274 Mont. 11, 20, 906 P.2d 663, 668 (1995); <em>State v. Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. 479, 482, 918 P.2d 296, 298 (1996)); <em>State v. MacDonald, </em>2013 MT 105, \u00b6 16, 370 Mont. 1, 299 P.3d 839; <em>accord State v. Phillips, </em>2013 MT 317, \u00b6 26, 372 Mont. 317, 312 P.3d 445 (concluding that a \u201cDistrict Court\u2019s alleged neglect of the statutory requirement to inquire into [a defendant\u2019s] ability to pay the costs of court-appointed counsel does not speak to the legality of the sentence and is only objectionable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u00b615 Thompson did not object when the District Court failed to inquire into his ability to pay the costs included in the PSI. His failure to object \u201cconstituted a waiver that prevents us from reviewing the issue on appeal.\u201d <em>Kotwicki, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>accord MacDonald, </em>\u00b6 18 (\u201c[The defendant\u2019s] failure to object to any oversight by the court regarding her financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>condition constituted a waiver other claim on appeal.\u201d); <em>Phillips, </em>\u00b6 26 (\u201cGiven [the defendant\u2019s] failure to object, we will not review whether the District Court correctly followed the procedure prescribed by \u00a7 46-8-113(3), MCA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b616 Thompson\u2019s reliance on <em>Starr </em>and <em>Moore </em>is misplaced. Although we remanded to the district court in <em>Moore </em>to determine whether the defendant could afford jury costs, the defendant had objected to the imposition of those costs during sentencing. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7, 21. In <em>Starr, </em>the district court inquired into the defendant\u2019s ability to pay and made an explicit finding that the defendant had a \u201climited ability to pay.\u201d <em>Starr, </em>\u00b6 5. The district court nevertheless ordered the defendant to pay over $2,000 for his court-appointed counsel. <em>Starr, </em>\u00b6 6. We reversed the district court because we concluded that the court\u2019s sentence requiring the defendant to pay costs went \u201cagainst the weight of its evidentiary findings.\u201d <em>Starr, </em>\u00b6 11. As we made clear in <em>MacDonald, </em>\u201cThere is no mention in <em>Starr </em>of any failure by the defendant to object to the imposition of defense costs; thus, whether the claim was waived was not an issue on appeal.\u201d <em>MacDonald, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b617 Finally, we are unpersuaded by Thompson\u2019s argument that the prosecutor\u2019s comments about the fines preserved Thompson\u2019s right to appeal the District Court\u2019s imposition of costs and fees without considering Thompson\u2019s ability to pay. First, the State did not \u201cobject\u201d to the court imposing fines related to the eight counts; rather, the State \u201crecommended some leniency and suspension of fines\u201d due to Thompson\u2019s financial situation. Further, we generally require an appellant to \u201cshow that an objection was made at trial on the same basis as the error asserted on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Nolan, </em>2003 MT 13, \u00b6 16, 314 Mont. 47, 62 P.3d 1118. This is because \u201c[Requiring a defendant to raise the issue in the district court through a specific objection gives the prosecution and the trial court the ability to avoid or correct the purported error.\u201d <em>Nolan, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u00b618  Thompson had notice and an opportunity to respond\u2014but did not\u2014to the PSI conditions relating to fees, costs, and surcharges being included in his sentence. He also did not object when the District Court failed to inquire into his ability to pay those costs. We accordingly hold that the District Court\u2019s written judgment imposing fees, costs, and surcharges is not unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">\u00b619 We affirm the District Court\u2019s written judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b368-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, McKINNON, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>SANDEFUR, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b369-5\">JUSTICE SHEA,</author>\n<p id=\"anp-dedup-1\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u00b620 Although I have some misgivings about the District Court\u2019s imposition of costs without considering Thompson\u2019s ability to pay, I must agree that our precedent compels the conclusion that Thompson has not preserved this issue for appeal. Therefore, I concur in the result. I write separately to emphasize what I see as the cautionary tale of this case, as well as the remedy that remains available to Thompson despite our ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u00b621 The record clearly indicates Thompson\u2019s inability to pay the costs imposed\u2014thus, the County Attorney\u2019s recommendation for leniency and suspension of fines because of Thompson\u2019s financial situation and the burden to Thompson\u2019s family. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 16. We decline to consider this issue because Thompson failed to object \u201cwhen the District Court failed to inquire into his ability to pay the costs included in the PSI.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 15. I agree that our existing precedent, particularly <em>McDonald, </em>compels this result. But this nevertheless begs the question: What was Thompson supposed to object to? Although the PSI specified the <em>items </em>of costs that remained to be determined, the <em>amounts </em>of these specific costs were unresolved. Opinion, \u00b6 4. Had the District Court ultimately imposed minimal costs in the written judgment because of Thompson\u2019s inability to pay\u2014as acknowledged by the State at the sentencing hearing\u2014there would have been no basis for an objection. In light of the discussion at the sentencing hearing about Thompson\u2019s inability to pay the fines, and the County Attorney\u2019s recommendation for leniency in that regard, is it so far-fetched to conclude that Thompson reasonably expected the District Court\u2019s assessment of the costs that were left \u201cto be determined\u201d would also factor in his inability to pay, as required by statute? It seems that what we are really faulting Thompson for here is less a failure to object and more a lack of prescience.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">\u00b622 By the same token, although Thompson\u2019s inability to pay was discussed at the sentencing hearing, I concur in our result because I cannot fault the District Court for failing to consider it when entering the written judgment nearly seven weeks later. Since the District Court remitted nearly ninety percent of Thompson\u2019s fines at sentencing, it seems evident that the District Court\u2019s failure to consider Thompson\u2019s inability to pay the costs imposed in the written judgment was not reflective of the Court\u2019s disregard for Thompson\u2019s financial situation; it just was not on the District Court\u2019s radar by that time. As this Court correctly notes, \u201cIrequiring a defendant to raise the issue in the district court through a specific objection gives the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>prosecution and the trial court the ability to avoid or correct the purported error.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 17 (quoting <em>Nolan, </em>\u00b6 16). This case thus illustrates the necessity of objecting at sentencing to undetermined costs\u2014even when the defendant\u2019s inability to pay is evident from the record\u2014both to flag the issue for the District Court\u2019s consideration when it enters the written judgment, as well as to preserve the issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b623 Finally, notwithstanding our decision here, it bears noting that Thompson is not without a remedy. Section 46-18-232(3), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">A defendant who has been sentenced to pay costs and who is not in default in the payment may <em>at any time </em>petition the court that sentenced the defendant for remission of the payment of costs or of any unpaid portion of the costs. If it appears to the satisfaction of the court that payment of the amount due will impose manifest hardship on the defendant or the defendant\u2019s immediate family, the court may remit all or part of the amount due in costs or modify the method of payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">(Emphasis added.) Thompson could have petitioned the District Court for remission when the written judgment was issued. Assuming Thompson\u2019s financial situation remains unchanged from when he was sentenced, and he is not in default in his payments, he may yet petition the District Court for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">\u00b624 For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the result reached by the Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b370-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT and SANDEFUR join the concurrence.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
