We affirm and address the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"A0FF\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by determining that Olson\u2019s Texas DUI convictions were sufficiently similar to constitute prior convictions under \u00a7 61-8-734(1)(a), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\u00b63 On June 12, 2014, Olson was arrested for DUI by the Lincoln County Sheriff s Department after he was observed weaving in traffic and subsequently failed a field sobriety test. A draw of Olson\u2019s blood produced a blood alcohol concentration reading (BAC) of 0.257. Olson was charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol, Fourth or Subsequent Offense, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-401, 61-8-731, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u00b64 Olson pled guilty to the DUI but challenged the use of his prior DUI convictions. Olson had four prior DUIs in three states during his lifetime: Georgia (1999), Montana (2000), Texas (2005), and Texas (2007). Olson objected to the use of his Georgia and Texas convictions, arguing that he was convicted in those states under a lower standard than Montana law. The District Court disagreed, concluding that, at a minimum, the two Texas DUI convictions were obtained under statutes similar to Montana\u2019s statutes, resulting in the present conviction being Olson\u2019s fourth offense for purposes of sentencing. The District Court did not address Olson\u2019s Georgia DUI conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u00b65 Olson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">\u00b66 Whether a prior conviction may be used to enhance a criminal sentence is a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>State v. Krebs, </em>2016 MT 288, \u00b6 7, 385 Mont. 328, 384 P.3d 98 (citing <em>State v. Burns, </em>2011 MT 167, \u00b6 17, 361 Mont. 191, 256 P.3d 944; <em>State v. Maine, </em>2011 MT 90, \u00b6 12, 360 Mont. 182, 255 P.3d 64).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err by determining that Olson\u2019s Texas DUI convictions were sufficiently similar to constitute prior convictions under \u00a7 61-8-734(1)(a), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">\u00b68 Olson argues that his DUI convictions in Texas were obtained under a lower legal standard than used by Montana, and that Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>law contained a rebuttable inference that Texas lacked, thus disqualifying these prior convictions. The State responds that the differences Olson raises are \u201cinsignificant and unsubstantial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b69 Montana criminalizes DUI in two ways, the first based upon the capacity of the driver. \u201cIt is unlawful and punishable ... for a person who is under the influence of: (a) alcohol to drive or be in actual physical control of a vehicle upon the ways of this state open to the public.\u201d Section 61-8-401(1)(a), MCA. \u201cUnder the influence\u201d \u201cmeans that as a result of taking into the body alcohol, drugs, or any combination of alcohol and drugs, a person\u2019s ability to safely operate a vehicle has been <em>diminished.\u201d </em>Section 61-8-401(3)(a), MCA (emphasis added). If a person has an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, there is a rebuttable inference \u201cthat the person was under the influence of alcohol.\u201d Section 61-8-401(4)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u00b610 The second way Montana criminalizes DUI is based upon a driver\u2019s alcohol concentration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">It is unlawful and punishable ... for any person to drive or be in actual physical control of: (a) a noncommercial vehicle upon the ways of this state open to the public while the person\u2019s alcohol concentration, as shown by analysis of the person\u2019s blood, breath, or urine, is 0.08 or more.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Section 61-8-406(1)(a), MCA. Thus, under Montana law, a person may be convicted of DUI either by operating a vehicle while in a \u201cdiminished\u201d capacity due to alcohol or drug consumption or simply because his alcohol concentration is 0.08 or higher. <em>State v. Calvert, </em>2013 MT 374, \u00b6 8, 373 Mont. 152, 316 P.3d 173 (DUI is charged based upon diminished capacity, commonly known as DUI, or based upon alcohol concentration, commonly known as \u201cDUI per se\u201d); <em>Krehs, </em>\u00b6 14 (Montana \u201cestablishes separate offenses for driving under the influence and for driving with excessive blood alcohol concentration.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">\u00b611 A fourth or subsequent conviction under Montana\u2019s DUI statutes is a felony. Section 61-8-731, MCA. For sentencing purposes, a \u201cconviction\u201d includes not only convictions under Montana\u2019s DUI statutes, but also a \u201cconviction for a violation of a <em>similar </em>statute or regulation in another state.\u201d Section 61-8-734(1)(a), MCA (emphasis added). We have held that \u201cif another state\u2019s [DUI] law allows a person to be convicted using a lesser standard than would be required in Montana for a conviction, the statutes are not similar for purposes of \u00a7 61-8-734(1)(a), MCA.\u201d <em>State v. Polaski, </em>2005 MT 13, \u00b6 22, 325 Mont. 351, 106 P.3d 538; <em>accord State v. McNally, </em>2002 MT 160, \u00b6 22, 310 Mont. 396, 50 P.3d 1080. \u201cIn evaluating whether another state\u2019s statutes are similar to Montana\u2019s statutes, we compare the statutes in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>effect at the time the offense was committed.\u201d <em>Calvert, </em>\u00b6 8; <em>accord Polaski, </em>\u00b6 16. Thus, we here compare the Montana and Texas statutes in effect at the time of Olson\u2019s Texas convictions. The Montana statutes in question\u2014\u00a7\u00a7 61-8-401, -406, -734, MCA\u2014have remained substantively unchanged since 2003. Organizational differences between Montana\u2019s statutes and another state\u2019s statutes do not matter, \u201cso long as they contain analogous provisions.\u201d <em>Calvert, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b612 In <em>McNally, </em>the defendant argued that his \u201cDriving While Ability Impaired\u201d (DWAI) convictions in Colorado could not be prior convictions for purposes of \u00a7 61-8-734(1)(a), MCA. <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6 6. Unlike Montana, Colorado had three forms of DUI: (1) an offense defined as being \u201csubstantially incapable\u201d of safely operating a vehicle; (2) a \u201cper se\u201d offense similar to Montana\u2019s; and (3) the DWAI offense, defined as operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs that \u201caffects the person to the slightest degree.\u201d <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-10. We reasoned that Montana did not have an offense similar to Colorado\u2019s DWAI, because \u201c[i]n Montana, a person simply may not be convicted for DUI if his or her ability is impaired \u2018to the slightest degree.\u2019 \u201d <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6 22. Thus, we concluded that McNally\u2019s Colorado DWAI convictions could not be counted as prior convictions for Montana\u2019s sentencing provisions. <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\u00b613 In <em>Polaski, </em>we found that the California DUI per se provision was similar to Montana\u2019s DUI per se statute because they criminalized the same BAC. <em>Polaski, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>see also State v. Barrett, </em>2015 MT 303, \u00b6 9, 381 Mont. 299, 358 P.3d 921. We also concluded that the DUI statutes of the two states were similar, reasoning that Montana\u2019s \u201cdiminished\u201d capability standard, which meant \u201creduced or to a lesser degree,\u201d was similar to California\u2019s standard of \u201cimpaired to an appreciable degree.\u201d <em>Polaski, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u00b614 Turning to the issue here, in the subject years 2005 and 2007, the Texas Penal Code criminalized being \u201cintoxicated while operating a motor vehicle in a public place.\u201d Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 49.04(a) (2005 &amp; 2007). In turn, \u201cintoxicated\u201d was defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">(A) not having the normal use of mental or physical faculties by reason of the introduction of alcohol, a controlled substance, a drug, a dangerous drug, a combination of two or more of those substances, or any other substance into the body; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH2\">(B) having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 49.01(2) (2005 &amp; 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">\u00b615  Comparing these to Montana\u2019s provisions, both States set the same level of culpability for DUI per se: an alcohol concentration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>0.08. <em>Polaski, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Barrett, </em>\u00b6 9. Olson argues that the rebuttable inference of diminished driving when having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 under \u00a7 61-8-401(4)(c), MCA\u2014Montana\u2019s standard DUI statute, not DUI per se\u2014results in a \u201clower standard of proof\u2019 for DUI per se under Montana law. However, this argument is incorrect because a conviction under Montana\u2019s DUI per se provision, \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA, requires no proof of diminishment. The rebuttable inference of diminishment is set forth in the standard DUI statute, \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, because it is relevant to proving that offense, not DUI per se. Thus, the DUI per se statutes in Montana and Texas are similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b616 Regarding standard DUI, violations under Texas and Montana law are based on similar measures of culpability. Montana requires a person\u2019s ability to safely operate a vehicle to be \u201cdiminished,\u201d while Texas requires a person not have \u201cthe normal use of mental or physical faculties.\u201d As we held in <em>Polaski, </em>\u201cdiminished\u201d ability means that a person\u2019s ability to safely operate a vehicle is \u201creduced or to a lesser degree.\u201d <em>Polaski, </em>\u00b6 22. Both Montana and Texas require an appreciable loss of driving ability in order to establish the similar measures of \u201cdiminished\u201d or \u201cnot having the normal use.\u201d This is distinct from the Colorado statutes at issue in <em>McNally, </em>which criminalized a third DUI category based upon a hair-trigger impairment standard of merely \u201cto the slightest degree.\u201d <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u00b617  We conclude that the Texas DUI statutes in 2005 and 2007 were similar to Montana\u2019s laws in effect at that time, rendering Olson\u2019s Texas convictions as prior convictions for the purposes of \u00a7 61-8-734(1)(a), MCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Olson\u2019s Texas convictions are sufficient, along with his Montana convictions, to support his felony DUI conviction, we do not address Olson\u2019s DUI conviction in Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b346-8\">JUSTICES WHEAT, SHEA, BAKER and SANDEFUR concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-9\"> The record provided on appeal does not clearly explain whether Olson\u2019s Texas DUI convictions were for DUI per se, or standard DUI. However, because we conclude that both offenses are similar for purposes of sentencing in Montana, Olson\u2019s Texas convictions properly constituted prior offenses, regardless of which statute he was convicted under.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
