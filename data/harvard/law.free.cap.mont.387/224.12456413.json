We affirm and address the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><em>Did the District Court err by imposing an illegal </em>sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u00b62 On July 12,2015, Highway Patrolman Barry Kilpela stopped Le\u2019s vehicle for speeding on Interstate 94 in Dawson County, Montana. During the stop, Officer Kilpela formed a suspicion that Le was involved in illegal narcotics activity and, after issuing a warning for speeding, asked Le if he would open the back hatch of the vehicle. Le consented and opened the hatch, revealing a \u201clarge blocky shaped bag.\u201d When Kilpela asked what was in the bag, Le stated, \u201cUm, some sort of stuff.\u201d Le opened the bag and Kilpela observed several vacuum-sealed bags of what he believed to be marijuana. Officer Kilpela placed Le under arrest and seized Le\u2019s vehicle. Law enforcement executed a search warrant on the vehicle, discovering 30 vacuum-sealed bags of marijuana weighing a total of 23 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\u00b63 Le was charged with Criminal Distribution of Dangerous Drugs with Intent to Distribute, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-103, MCA. Le conducted plea negotiations with the State, resulting in a plea agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, the State moved to amend the charge to Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA. The Amended Information advised that Le could face five years of imprisonment in the state prison, be fined up to $50,000, or both, but did not mention the imposition of a fine under \u00a7 45-9-130, MCA, based upon the market value of the marijuana he possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">\u00b64 At the change of plea hearing, Le filed an Acknowledgment of Waiver of Rights, acknowledging the charged offense and possible penalty. Prior to Le entering a plea, the District Court informed Le that \u201c[t]he maximum penalty for that charge is up to five years in prison and a $50,000 fine plus a penalty of 35 percent of the market value of the drugs.\u201d Le stated that he understood the possible maximum penalties and entered a plea of guilty to the charged offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">\u00b65 Prior to the sentencing hearing, Le filed an obj ection to imposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>of a fine under \u00a7 45-9-130, MCA, on the grounds, relevant to the appeal, that the fine violated the \u201cApprendi doctrine,\u201d based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000), and \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA, Montana\u2019s statutory counterpart to the <em>Apprendi </em>decision, and that it constituted an excessive penalty prohibited by the Montana and U.S. Constitutions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b66 At the sentencing hearing, the District Court denied Le\u2019s sentencing objections and heard testimony regarding the value of the marijuana Le was convicted of possessing. The court imposed a six-year deferred sentence, with a $1,500 fine to be paid to the Eastern Montana Drug Task Force, and a $15,000 fine pursuant to \u00a7 45-9-130, MCA. Le appeals the imposition of the $15,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u00b67 Criminal sentences are reviewed for legality. <em>State v. Patterson, </em>2016 MT 289, \u00b6 9, 385 Mont. 334, 384 P.3d 92 <em>(citing State v. Simpson, </em>2014 MT 175, \u00b6 8, 375 Mont. 393, 328 P.3d 1144). Our review for legality is generally confined to determining whether the sentencing court had statutory authority to impose the sentence, whether the sentence falls within the parameters set by the applicable sentencing statutes, and whether the court adhered to the affirmative mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes. <em>State v. Himes, </em>2015 MT 91, \u00b6 22, 378 Mont. 419, 345 P.3d 297 (citing <em>State v. Breeding, </em>2008 MT 162, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 323, 184 P.3d 313). A claim that a sentence violates the constitution is a matter of law that we review <em>de novo. State v. Garrymore, </em>2006 MT 245, \u00b6 9, 334 Mont. 1, 145 P.3d 946. We review a court\u2019s conclusions of law and interpretation of statutes <em>de novo </em>for correctness. <em>State v. Henderson, </em>2015 MT 56, \u00b6 9, 378 Mont. 301, 343 P.3d 566 (citing <em>State v. Petersen, </em>2011 MT 22, \u00b6 8, 359 Mont. 200, 247 P.3d 731).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court err by imposing an illegal </em>sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">\u00b69 Le first argues that the $15,000 fine imposed pursuant to \u00a7 45-9-130, MCA, is a sentence enhancement that violated the requirements of <em>Apprendi </em>and \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA, because the State did not allege the enhancement as part of the charge, and Le did not admit to the market value of the marijuana that he pled guilty to possessing.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\u00b610 In <em>Apprendi, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cit is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S. Ct. at 2363 (internal quotations and citations omitted). The Court instructed that, \u201c[olther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum\u201d must be \u201cproved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d in order to satisfy the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to jury trial. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S. Ct. at 2362-63; <em>see also State v. Ghostbear, </em>2014 MT 192A, \u00b6 7, 376 Mont. 500, 338 P.3d 25. Thus, a \u201csentence enhancement\u201d is a fact that increases the penalty for a crime \u201cbeyond the prescribed statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S. Ct. at 2363-64. \u201cIt is a fact <em>not included in the statutory definition of the elements of the charged offense </em>that allows the judge to increase the penalty provided by statute. Section 46-1-401(3), MCA.\u201d <em>Ghostbear, </em>\u00b6 8 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b611 After the <em>Apprendi </em>decision, the Montana Legislature enacted legislation that codified the principles <em>o\u00ed Apprendi </em>in statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">(1) A court may not impose a penalty enhancement specified in Title 45, Title 46, or any other provision of law unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">(a) the enhancing act, omission, or fact was charged in the information, complaint, or indictment, with a reference to the statute or statutes containing the enhancing act, omission, or fact and the penalty for the enhancing act, omission, or fact;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">(b) if the case was tried before a jury, the jury unanimously found in a separate finding that the enhancing act, omission, or fact occurred beyond a reasonable doubt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">(c) if the case was tried to the court without a jury, the court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the enhancing act, omission, or fact occurred; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">(d) a defendant who knowingly and voluntarily pleaded guilty to an offense also admitted to the enhancing act, omission, or fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAQ9\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"33\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAANYAAAAhAQAAAACND2giAAAAU0lEQVR4nGP8z4AL/GXCKcXAMCo3KodVbgKU87cByvgEof7///+f/T8E/LCHMh78/////x+CZnZAOSwOUIYgwsz7UKP+Qen/v///////D+MwSNcAJs070heZVXMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"215\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\"><em>(3)An enhancing act, omission, or fact is an act, omission, or fact, </em>whether stated in the statute defining the charged offense or stated in another statute, <em>that is not included in the statutory definition of the elements of the charged offense and that allows or requires a sentencing court to add to, as provided by statute, a penalty provided by statute for the charged offense </em>or to impose the death penalty instead of a statutory incarceration period provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>by statute for the charged offense. Except as provided in subsection (4), the aggravating circumstances contained in 46-18-303 are enhancing acts, omissions, or facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Sections 46-1-401(1), (3), MCA (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Apprendi </em>and this statute require that any fact \u201cnot included in the statutory definition of the elements of the charged offense,\u201d \u00a7 46-1-401(3), MCA, which increases the penalty \u201cbeyond the prescribed statutory maximum,\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S. Ct. at 2363-64, must either be found beyond a reasonable doubt by the factfinder at trial or admitted by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u00b612  The sentencing penalty provision at issue in this case, \u00a7 45-9-130, MCA, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">(1) In addition to the punishments and fines set forth in this part, the court shall fine each person found to have possessed or stored dangerous drugs 35% of the market value of the drugs as determined by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">This is a mandatory penalty, providing that sentencing courts \u201cshall fine\u201d each defendant \u201cfound to have possessed or stored dangerous drugs\u201d an amount equal to 35% of the market value of the drugs he possessed. Section 45-9-130(1), MCA. As such, the penalty is not subject to the discretionary authority provided to courts under the general sentencing statutes. Sections 46-18-201, et seq., MCA; <em>State v. Mingus, </em>2004 MT 24, \u00b6 15, 319 Mont. 349, 84 P.3d 658 (holding discretionary sentencing statutes do not apply to mandatory fines).</p>\n<p id=\"AHt\">\u00b613 Le committed the offense of criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a violation of \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA, because he was a person who \u201cpossessed] any dangerous drug, as defined in 50-32-101,\u201d here, marijuana. He was convicted by guilty plea, in which he admitted to possessing the marijuana.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By so doing, he admitted \u201cto have possessed or stored dangerous drugs\u201d as required by \u00a7 45-9-130, MCA, the mandatory penalty provision. The mandatory penalty did not here require proof of any other fact \u201cnot included in the statutory definition of the elements of the charged offense,\u201d \u00a7 46-1-401(3), MCA, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>therefore, is not a sentencing enhancement for Le\u2019s crime. <em>See Ghostbear, </em>\u00b6 14 (holding \u201cthe jury could not have returned the conviction without determining as a matter of fact\u201d the asserted enhancement fact). By virtue of his plea, including his admission to possessing the marijuana, Le mandatorily became subject to the 35% market value fine, part of the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d penalty for his crime, as he was correctly advised by the District Court. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S. Ct. at 2363. No other fact needed to be proven by the State or admitted by Le, and the State was not required under \u00a7 46-1-401(1)(a), MCA, to charge the enhancingfact in the Information.</p>\n<p id=\"ANu\">\u00b614 Le argues that his plea did not include an admission of the \u201cmarket value of the drugs,\u201d which the District Court determined in order to calculate the 35% penalty, and thus, the market value was an enhancing fact that was not properly proven. However, the 35% penalty was mandatorily triggered solely by Le\u2019s admission that he criminally possessed dangerous drugs\u2014not by the determination of the market value of those drugs. As noted above, <em>Apprendi </em>prohibits the removal from the jury or factfinder of \u201cthe assessment of facts that <em>increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.\u201d Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S. Ct. at 2363 (emphasis added). The District Court\u2019s calculation of the 35% penalty did not increase the prescribed range of penalties to which Le was exposed. That range was determined by the entry of Le\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b615  Le also challenges the $15,000 fine as violating of Montana\u2019s constitutional prohibition of \u201cexcessive fines.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 22. We have said that a fine or punitive assessment can violate the Excessive Fine Provision of the Montana Constitution if it is \u201cgrossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant\u2019s offense.\u201d <em>State v. Good, </em>2004 MT 296, \u00b6 23, 323 Mont. 378, 100 P.3d 644 (citing <em>United States v. Bajakajian, </em>524 U.S. 321, 334, 118 S. Ct. 2028, 2036 (1998)). Here, the Legislature incorporated the concept of proportionality into \u00a7 45-9-130, MCA, by requiring that the amount of the fine be based upon the market value of the dangerous drugs that a defendant illegally possessed. Thus, the greater the value of the illegally possessed drugs, or \u201cgravity\u201d of the offense, the greater the fine. Le\u2019s fine of $15,000 resulted from carrying 23 pounds of illegal drugs, and the calculation of the value of those drugs. Further, $15,000 is significantly less than the maximum discretionary fine of $50,000 that the sentencing court was authorized to impose for Le\u2019s conviction. Lee has not demonstrated that the fine is \u201cgrossly disproportional\u201d to the gravity of his offense and violates the Excessive Fines Provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>\u00b616 Finally, Le admits that he did not raise a double jeopardy argument below, but nonetheless, requests this Court to review under the plain error doctrine or <em>the Lenihan </em>Rule. Generally, \u201c[plarties may not raise claims for the first time or change legal theories on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Weatherell, </em>2010 MT 37, \u00b6 16, 355 Mont. 230, 225 P.3d 1256 <em>(citing State v. Weaselboy, </em>1999 MT 274, \u00b6 16, 296 Mont. 503, 989 P.2d 836). The \u201cplain error\u201d exception to this general rule allows this Court to \u201creview a claim notwithstanding it being raised for the first time on appeal if failing to review the claimed error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State v. Bateman, </em>2004 MT 281, \u00b6 20, 323 Mont. 280, 99 P.3d 656 (citing <em>State v. Godfrey, </em>2004 MT 197, \u00b6 22, 322 Mont. 254, 95 P.3d 166) (internal quotations omitted). Similarly, the <em>Lenihan </em>Rule \u201cprovides an exception to the general rule and allows appellate review of a criminal sentence that is alleged to be illegal or in excess of statutory mandates, even if the defendant raised no objection in the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Kotwicki, </em>2007 MT 17, \u00b6 8, 335 Mont. 344, 151 P.3d 892 (citing <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 343, 602 P.2d 997, 1000 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u00b617 We conclude that this matter does not warrant plain error review. Neither is Le entitled to relief pursuant to the <em>Lenihan </em>Rule. We have limited review of \u201cthe merits of a defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim, despite the failure to raise the issue in the district court, where the court could have determined from the record that the government lacked the power to charge a defendant,\u201d and here the government did not lack such authority. <em>State v. Toth, </em>2008 MT 404, \u00b6 8, 347 Mont. 184, 197 P.3d 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b254-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, McKINNON and SANDEFUR concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-11\"> Because Le did not speak English fluently, a certified Vietnamese Interpreter was sworn and provided translation for Le.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b250-11\"> Le\u2019s argument on appeal regarding excessive sanctions focuses only on the Montana Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\"> We have held that Montana\u2019s statutory enactment of <em>Apprendi </em>has \u201cno substantive distinction between the principles enunciated in <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny.\u201d <em>Garrymore, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b252-11\"> During the change of plea hearing, Le pled guilty to possessing more than 60 grams of marijuana, \u00a7 45-9-102(2), MCA, described by his attorney as being \u201ca substantial amount.\u201d The amount was more specifically referred to variously by the prosecutor as \u201cwell over 60 grams\u201d and in poundage as \u201cin the low 20s.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
