(Richland Aviation), by holding that Richland Aviation is not a \u201cscheduled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>airline\u201d subject to central assessment by DOR. We affirm and state the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\"><em>Did the District Court err by concluding Richland Aviation was not a \u201cscheduled airline\u201d and therefore not subject to central </em>assessment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u00b62 Since 1971, Richland Aviation, a company based in Sidney, Richland County, Montana, has provided on-demand flight services, operating from the Sidney-Richland Airport. Richland Aviation owns six light, twin piston engine aircraft, the largest of which is a Cessna 404 with a maximum capacity of2,684 pounds. Richland Aviation hires out its aircraft and related services for the transport of people and goods on a contract basis. Richland Aviation does not provide scheduled or pre-set flights beyond the individual arrangements it enters with those hiring its services. As Richland Aviation explains, \u201c[o]ne cannot walk up to the gate, view a list of set and published dates and times for flight, and purchase a ticket. Rather, use of the airplane is negotiated on a case-by-case basis and via a negotiated contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AC5\">\u00b63 Richland Aviation has entered an agreement with the United Parcel Service (UPS) to pick up and deliver freight at certain locations on a routine basis. Under the negotiated agreement, the date, time, and pickup locations are determined exclusively by UPS, and all flights provided by Richland Aviation pursuant to the agreement are reserved exclusively for the transport of UPS freight.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00b64 Since its inception, Richland Aviation has registered its aircraft with the Department of Transportation pursuant to the aeronautical regulation and licensing provisions in \u00a7 67-3-201, et seq., MCA. As DOR explains, these provisions impose an aircraft registration fee in lieu of property taxes which is mutually exclusive to the system of central assessment of scheduled airlines, and which is a prerequisite to operation of the aircraft.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7 67-3-201(1), MCA (\u201c[A] person may not operate or cause or authorize to be operated a civil aircraft within this state unless the aircraft has an appropriate effective registration, license, certificate, or permit issued or approved by the United States government that has been registered with the department and the registration with the department is in force.\u201d). Richland Aviation\u2019s aircraft have never been centrally assessed for taxation by DOR.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\u00b65 In 2013, DOR sent a questionnaire to Richland Aviation and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>air carriers to determine if these companies \u201cwere operating in a manner that would subject them to central assessment.\u201d Richland Aviation returned the questionnaire, indicating that it provided air transport services under a contract with UPS. DOR ultimately determined that Richland Aviation \u201cperforms regularly scheduled flights for UPS\u201d and was therefore subject to centrally assessed taxes. Richland Aviation objected and filed the instant proceeding to determine whether it was subject to the aircraft registration statutes, rather than central tax assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b66 Because there was no statutory definition for the statutory term, \u201cregularly scheduled flight,\u201d the District Court reasoned that the term \u201cscheduled airline\u201d had been rendered \u201cstatutorily undefined and ambiguous,\u201d and looked to authority from federal and sister jurisdictions to define these terms. It concluded that Richland Aviation was not a scheduled airline because it \u201cdoes not hold out to the public that it operates between certain places at certain times,\u201d and granted summary judgment to Richland Aviation. DOR appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b67 We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment, applying the criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). <em>Citizens for a Better Flathead v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>2016 MT 256, \u00b6 10, 385 Mont. 156, 381 P.3d 555 <em>(citing Pilgeram v. GreenPoint Mortg. Funding, Inc., </em>2013 MT 354, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 1, 313 P.3d 839). We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>W. Energy Co. v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of </em>Revenue, 1999 MT 289, \u00b6 6, 297 Mont. 55, 990 P.2d 767 <em>(citing Nimmick v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>270 Mont. 315, 319, 891 P.2d 1154, 1156 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court err by determining that Richland Aviation was not a \u201cscheduled airline\u201d and therefore not subject to central </em>assessment?</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">\u00b69 After the District Court entered its decision in this case, and before appellate briefing was completed, we decided <em>Montana Department of Revenue v. Alpine Aviation, Inc., </em>2016 MT 283, 385 Mont. 282, 384 P.3d 1035. <em>Alpine </em>was a unique interlocutory appeal of an adjudication of a \u201csubstantive question of law\u201d pending before the State Tax Appeal Board, pursuant to \u00a7 15-2-305, MCA, with no factual record. <em>Alpine, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7, 10. The purpose of that litigation was to obtain a definition of the key, but undefined, statutory term, \u201cregularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>scheduled flights,\u201d \u00a7 15-23-401(1), MCA, for purposes of its application within other provisions that require central assessment of \u201cscheduled airlines\u201d or \u201cscheduled airline compan[ies].\u201d Sections 15-23-101(3), 15-23-401(8), MCA; <em>Alpine, </em>\u00b6 8. We defined \u201cregularly scheduled flights\u201d as \u201cthose which follow an interval according to timetables and locations predefined by the carrier and which fly regardless of whether there are passengers or freight to be carried <em>.\u2019\u2019Alpine, </em>\u00b6 15. We noted that \u201c[o]ne key concept ... is <em>who </em>sets the flight schedule. An airline arranges a regularly scheduled flight; the customer does not.\u201d <em>Alpine, </em>\u00b6 14 (emphasis in original). Given the posture of that appeal, we did not reach the ultimate question of whether Alpine Aviation was a scheduled airline subject to central assessment. <em>Alpine, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b610 DOR argues that the District Court\u2019s order conflicts with <em>Alpine </em>because the District Court reasoned that the statutory terms were ambiguous and looked to foreign authority to arrive at a definition, when there is no ambiguity in the statutes. It also argues that Richland Aviation should be deemed a \u201cscheduled airline\u201d because it offers its services for hire by the general public and provides those services in accordance with an agreed-upon schedule, citing its contract with UPS. In answer, Richland Aviation argues that the District Court should be affirmed because its services do not constitute \u201cregularly scheduled flights\u201d as defined in <em>Alpine. </em>Richland Aviation argues that, even if it flies regularly under its contract with UPS, the schedule and locations are not \u201cpredefined by the carrier,\u201d but, rather, predefined by the customer. Alternatively, Richland Aviation \u201cinvites this Court to reconsider the definition of\u2018regularly scheduled flights\u2019 it provided in <em>Alpine Aviation, </em>taking into account the historical, industry, technical, and peculiar meaning of the term \u2018scheduled.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b611 \u201cIt is a basic premise of the law of taxation that the foundation for levying and assessing a tax depends upon the existence of a valid legislative act specifically designating the imposition of the tax. Nothing is taxable unless clearly authorized by statute.\u201d <em>Powder River Cnty. v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>2002 MT 259, \u00b6 40, 312 Mont. 198, 60 P.3d 357 (citing <em>Connick v. Judge, </em>167 Mont. 357, 361, 538 P.2d 1024, 1027 <em>(1975)); accord N. Pac. Ry. v. Carland, </em>5 Mont. 146, 200, 3 P. 134, 162 (1884); <em>State ex rel. Tillman v. District Ct., </em>101 Mont. 176, 181, 53 P.2d 107, 109-10 (1936); <em>Swartz v. Berg, </em>147 Mont. 178, 182-83, 411 P.2d 736, 738 (1966) (noting tax statutes are to be interpreted <em>\u201cstricti juris,\u201d </em>that is, \u201cstrictly construed against the taxing authorities, and in favor of the taxpayer,\u201d citing 51 Am. Jur. Taxation \u00a7 650); <em>Omimex Can., Ltd. v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>2008 MT 403, \u00b6 21, 347 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>176, 201 P.3d 3 (holding \u201ctax statutes are to be strictly construed against the taxing authority and in favor of the taxpayer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\u00b612 In the briefing in this case, as in <em>Alpine, </em>the parties discuss a substantial body of general aviation law and legislative history that they would like the Court to incorporate into the analysis of the subject statutory definitions. <em>See Alpine, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-10. Richland Aviation here draws our attention to this \u201centire universe of legal authority\u201d in the hope that we will revisit the definition recently adopted in <em>Alpine, </em>particularly by importing the technical industry meaning of the term \u201cscheduled.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Aircraft Owners &amp; Pilots Ass\u2019n v. Port Auth. of N.Y., </em>305 F. Supp. 93, 97-98 (E.D.N.Y. 1969) (distinguishing scheduled airlines, or \u201ccarriers,\u201d from \u201cGeneral Aviation,\u201d which \u201cuses smaller aircraft\u201d and \u201cpossibly reflects a shorter average haul\u201d). However, we conclude it is unnecessary to do so in order to properly apply the Montana statutes. \u201c[T]here is no reason for us to engage in a discussion of the legislative history to construe [a] statute when we have determined that the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous on its face.\u201d <em>State v. Goebel, </em>2001 MT 73, \u00b6 21, 305 Mont. 53, 31 P.3d 335 (citation omitted). Our reasoning in <em>Alpine </em>demonstrated that the meaning of the words chosen by the Legislature was clear on its face, as we noted that dictionary definitions of the statutory terms produced \u201ccommon sense renderings.\u201d <em>Alpine, </em>\u00b6 13. We realize that <em>Alpine </em>was devoid of a factual record. Nonetheless, the Legislature did not choose to employ industry terms such as \u201cgeneral aviation,\u201d and we need not consider them where the issue is resolved under the plain wording of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b613 DOR is required to centrally assess the property of \u201cscheduled airlines.\u201d Section 15-23-101(3), MCA. A \u201cscheduled airline company\u201d is \u201cany person who undertakes directly or indirectly to engage in the business of scheduled air commerce.\u201d Section 15-23-401(8), MCA. In turn, \u201cair commerce\u201d is \u201cthe transportation by aircraft of persons or property for hire in interstate, intrastate, or international transportation on regularly scheduled flights.\u201d Section 15-23-401(1), MCA. In <em>Alpine, </em>we defined \u201cregularly scheduled flights\u201d as \u201cthose which follow an interval according to timetables and locations predefined by the carrier and which fly regardless of whether there are passengers or freight to be carried <em>.\u2019\u2019Alpine, </em>\u00b6 15. Such flights \u201coccur[] on a uniform or unvarying, and reoccurring, basis as preset by an airline and offered for hire to the public.\u201d <em>Alpine, </em>\u00b6 14. A key element of these definitions is <em>\u201cwho </em>sets the flight schedule. An airline arranges a regularly scheduled flight; the customer does not.\u201d <em>Alpine, </em>\u00b6 14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\u00b614 DOR argues that the discussion in <em>Alpine </em>of \u201cwho sets the flight\u201d is <em>dictum </em>because \u201c[t]his Court provided no further elaboration, nor any authority upon which to rely,\u201d but DOR overlooks the unique nature of the <em>Alpine </em>appeal. <em>Alpine </em>was decided without a factual record from which to elaborate, and the opinion could be considered, under DOR\u2019s view, <em>obiter dictum </em>in its entirety, because we did not resolve the ultimate issue. More to the point, the concept of the airline arranging the flight, and not the customer, simply restates the clear meaning of the phrases \u201ctimetables and locations predefined by the carrier\u201d and flying \u201cregardless of whether there are passengers or freight to be carried,\u201d which are included in the definition of \u201cregularly scheduled flights.\u201d <em>Alpine, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b615 Applying these definitions here, Richland Aviation does not engage in \u201cregularly scheduled flights\u201d required for central assessment. Richland Aviation does not publish or otherwise predefine a schedule of flights that it offers to the public. It does not fly \u201caccording to timetables and locations predefined by the carrier.\u201d <em>Alpine, </em>\u00b6 15. It flies on a schedule that is arranged by the customer. Here, the customer whose contract gives rise to this litigation, UPS, sets the dates, times, and pickup locations\u2014not Richland Aviation.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u00b616  This conclusion corresponds with Montana\u2019s aircraft registration statutes. \u201c[AJircraft required to be registered in Montana are subject to a fee. The registration fee is <em>in lieu of property tax.\u201d </em>Section 67-3-204(1), MCA (emphasis added). However, \u201caircraft operated <em>by an airline company and regularly scheduled </em>for the primary purpose of carrying persons or property for hire in interstate or international transportation\u201d are exempt from registration. Section 67-3-201(3)(c), MCA (emphasis added). As such, aircraft that are subject to the registration and fee requirements in Title 67, chapter 2, part 2, MCA, imposed in lieu of property taxes, are generally not subject to taxation by central assessment under \u00a7 15-23-101(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"avu-dedup-0\">\u00b617 The District Court did not have the benefit of our ruling in <em>Alpine </em>when it issued its opinion. Even though it employed a different analysis, concluding the statutes were ambiguous and looking to foreign authority, the District Court nonetheless reached the correct result.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b430-8\">JUSTICES WHEAT, SANDEFUR, SHEA, McKINNON and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-9\"> Br. of Appellant 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
