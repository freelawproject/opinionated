Lackman raises three issues on appeal, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in instructing the jury on Lackman\u2019s justifiable use of force defense.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-11\">\n<em>2. Whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding Lackman\u2019s failure to tell police his self-defense story constitute plain error.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-12\">\n<em>3. Whether the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement of the legal elements for justified use of lethal force constitutes plain error.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b476-15\">\u00b63 Partelow and Lackman got in a fight when Lackman went to Partelow\u2019s home to pick up some personal belongings. Partelow punched Lackman two or three times before Lackman pulled out his gun and shot him. Lackman fled the scene with his girlfriend and another friend, Juan Jose Romero. Lackman wiped the gun down and Romero hid the gun north of Butte. Everyone involved had been using methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-16\">\u00b64 A highway patrol trooper arrested Lackman near Roundup the next night after stopping a car in which Lackman was a passenger. Two officers transported Lackman back to Butte. The officers did not interrogate Lackman during the transport, but Lackman asked them how difficult it would be to prove self-defense. The record does not reflect whether Lackman had received <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-17\">\u00b65 Lackman gave notice prior to trial of his intent to raise the affirmative defense of justifiable use of force. He testified at trial that he shot Partelow in self-defense. Lackman stated that he had heard stories about Partelow \u201cpulling knives on people\u201d and beating them \u201creally severely, even to the point of death.\u201d He testified further that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>he was scared during the fight because he thought Partelow was going to \u201ckill me or at least severely beat me.\u201d During cross-examination, the State questioned Lackman about his self-defense story and asked if he had told anyone that \u201cstory until today.\u201d There was no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u00b66 Lackman requested that the jury be instructed that lethal force could be used \u201cto prevent the commission of a forcible felony.\u201d Section 45-3-102, MCA. The District Court refused this instruction. The court reasoned that there was no evidence presented of a forcible felony \u201cother than the attack on Mr. Lackman personally,\u201d and that the instruction proposed by the State adequately addressed that offense. The court reasoned further that Lackman\u2019s instruction could potentially confuse the jury. The court instructed the jury that a person is justified in the use of deadly force \u201conly if he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u00b67 In her closing argument, the prosecutor repeated the law of justifiable use of force as given in the jury instruction. The prosecutor then stated that a person has \u201cto have a reasonable belief that your life is in jeopardy to be able to take someone else\u2019s and be justified in doing so.\u201d Defense counsel did not object. Instead, she used her closing argument to correct the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement of the law. She emphasized, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to let ourselves get beat up and get serious bodily injury\u201d in order to be justified in the use of force. The jury convicted Lackman. The District Court sentenced him to ninety years in prison. Lackman appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">\u00b68 This court reviews for correctness the legal determinations a lower court makes when giving jury instructions, including whether the instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the applicable law. <em>State v. Carnes, </em>2015 MT 101, \u00b6 6, 378 Mont. 482, 346 P.3d 1120. District courts are given broad discretion when instructing a jury; reversible error occurs only if the instructions prejudicially affect a defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Carnes, </em>\u00b6 6. A district court\u2019s decision on jury instructions is presumed correct, and the appellant has the burden of showing error. <em>Carnes, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">\u00b69 This Court may discretionarily review claimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, even if no contemporaneous objection is made, under plain error review. <em>State v. Godfrey, </em>2004 MT 197, \u00b6 22, 322 Mont. 254, 95 P.3d 166. We exercise plain error review where failingto review the claimed error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 22. We use our inherent power of common law plain error review sparingly, on a case-by-case basis, and only in this narrow class of cases. <em>Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u00b610 <em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in instructing the jury on Lackman\u2019s justifiable use of force defense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\u00b611 The District Court submitted three instructions to the jury on justifiable use of force. Instruction No. 22 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">A person is justified in the use of force or threat to use force when and to the extent that he reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself against the imminent use of unlawful force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">However, a person is justified in the use of force which is intended or likely to cause death or serious bodily harm only if he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Instruction No. 23 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">If the Defendant has offered evidence of justifiable use of force, the State has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant\u2019s actions were not justified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-12\">If you find that he/she has offered evidence of justifiable use of force, but that the State has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant\u2019s actions were not justified, you must find the Defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">And Instruction No. 24 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-14\">The Defendant has offered evidence of justifiable use of force in this case. You are to consider the following requirements of the law in determining whether the use of force claimed by Defendant was justified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-15\">[1] The danger of harm to the Defendant must be a present one and not made by a person without the present ability to carry out the threat;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-16\">[2] The force threatened against the Defendant must be unlawful;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-17\">[3] The Defendant must actually believe that the danger exists, that is, use of force is necessary to avert the danger and that the kind and amount of force which defendant uses is necessary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-18\">[4] The Defendant\u2019s belief, in each of the aspects described, must be reasonable even if it is mistaken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>[5] A person who is lawfully in a place or location and who is threatened with bodily injury or loss of life has no duty to retreat from a threat, or summon law enforcement assistance prior to using force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">Even if you determine the use of force by Defendant was not justified, the state still has the duty to prove each of the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u00b612 Lackman takes issue with Instruction No. 22. He points out that \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA\u2014upon which the instruction is based\u2014justifies the use of lethal force \u201cwhere a defendant reasonably believes that the force is necessary <em>either </em>to prevent death or serious bodily harm <em>or </em>to prevent a forcible felony.\u201d Lackman also observes that \u00a7 45-3-101(2), MCA, in turn, defines a \u201cforcible felony\u201d as \u201cany felony which involves the use or threat of physical force or violence against any individual.\u201d Lackman asserts that both aggravated assault (\u00a7 45-5-202(1), MCA) and assault with a weapon (\u00a7 45-5-213(1), MCA) are forcible felonies that can be accomplished by creating a \u201creasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\u00b613 Lackman thus argues that under the forcible felony provision of \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, \u201ca person can be legally justified in the use of lethal force to prevent an attacker from creating reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury ... even if actual serious bodily injury is not imminent.\u201d Because Lackman\u2019s use of force was the main question at trial, and under his reading the forcible felony standard \u201cis a more expansive standard for justified use of lethal force than requiring imminent serious bodily injury,\u201d Lackman argues that the District Court \u201cmisstated the law and lessened the State\u2019s burden to prove that [his] force was not justified.\u201d Lackman asserts that the District Court therefore abused its discretion by not including \u201cforcible felony\u201d in Instruction No. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">\u00b614 In exercising its \u201cbroad discretion in formulating jury instructions,\u201d a district court \u201cmust instruct the jury on each theory which is supported by the record.\u201d <em>State v. Archambault, </em>2007 MT 26, \u00b6 25, 336 Mont. 6, 152 P.3d 698. This does not mean, however, that a defendant is \u201centitled to have the jury instructed on every nuance of his or her theory of the <em>case.\u201d Archambault, </em>\u00b6 25. We will thus uphold jury instructions so long as the instructions \u201cfully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the applicable law.\u201d <em>Archambault, </em>\u00b6 25. The applicable law here begins with \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">A person is justified in the use of force or threat to use force against another when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes that the conduct is necessary for self-defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>or the defense of another against the other person\u2019s imminent use of unlawful force. However, the person is justified in the use of force likely to cause death or serious bodily harm only if the person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to the person or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Section 45-3-102, MCA. Because it is an affirmative defense, Lackman had the \u201cinitial burden\u201d of producing evidence that his use of lethal force was justified. <em>State v. Erickson, </em>2014 MT 304, \u00b6 25, 377 Mont. 84, 338 P.3d 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u00b615 We construe \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, \u201caccording to the plain meaning\u201d of its language. <em>State v. Price, </em>2002 MT 229, \u00b6 47, 311 Mont. 439, 57 P.3d 42. Lackman\u2019s argument that \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, authorizes the use of lethal force \u201cto prevent the commission of a forcible felony\u201d is correct as far as it goes. Predicate, however, is the first sentence of \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, which authorizes \u201cthe use of force\u201d only \u201cwhen and to the extent that the person reasonably believes that the conduct is necessary for self-defense ... against the other person\u2019s <em>imminent use of unlawful </em>force.\u201d Section 45-3-102, MCA (emphasis added); <em>see State v. Dahms, </em>252 Mont. 1, 13-14, 825 P.2d 1214, 1222 (1992) (noting that \u201cthe term \u2018imminent\u2019 does not refer to any element of felony assault, but applies to the justifiable use of force\u201d). We have held that \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, \u201callows a person to use force to defend himself or herself in a degree commensurate with the threat of harm the person faces.\u201d <em>Archambault, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>State v. Stone, </em>266 Mont. 345, 347, 880 P.2d 1296, 1298 (1994)) (internal quotations omitted); <em>accord State v. Miller, </em>1998 MT 177, \u00b6 28, 290 Mont. 97, 966 P.2d 721 (concluding that \u201cthe degree of force a person uses to defend himself must be commensurate with the threat of harm the person faces\u201d). Under the statute\u2019s plain language, Lackman was justified in using force against Partelow\u2014including lethal force\u2014only if Lackman reasonably believed that Partelow\u2019s use of unlawful force against him was imminent, and if the force he used in response was commensurate to Partelow\u2019s threat of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">\u00b616 As the District Court concluded, the evidence did not support the theory behind Lackman\u2019s requested instruction. At the time Lackman shot Partelow, only he and Partelow were engaged in a fight. Lackman did not testify\u2014and the evidence does not show\u2014that Lackman shot Partelow to protect anyone other than himself. Multiple witnesses testified that the fight between Lackman and Partelow had gone on for only a short time when Lackman shot Partelow. Lackman testified that Partelow hit him \u201c[t]wo or three times\u201d and that he did not hit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Partelow. Lackman testified that he had heard stories about Partelow \u201cpulling knives on people\u201d and beating them \u201creally severely, even to the point of death.\u201d He did not testify to seeing any weapon. Lackman said that the reason he shot Partelow was because he thought Partelow was going to \u201ckill me or at least severely beat me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u00b617  Lackman\u2019s own testimony demonstrates that he shot Partelow because he believed it was \u201cnecessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm\u201d to himself. Section 45-3-102, MCA. The District Court concluded correctly that \u201cthe only forcible felony we\u2019re talking about is seriously [sic] bodily injury that would be inflicted against Mr. Lackman.\u201d The three justifiable use of force instructions therefore fully and fairly instructed the jury regarding the law applicable to Lackman\u2019s defense. We will not fault the District Court for refusing to instruct the jury \u201con every nuance of [Lackman\u2019s] theory of the case.\u201d <em>Archambault, </em>\u00b6 25. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury on Lackman\u2019s justifiable use of force defense without including the \u201cforcible felony\u201d component.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u00b618 <em>2. Whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding Lackman\u2019s failure to tell police his self-defense story constitute plain error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\u00b619 During its case-in-chief, the State questioned one of the officers who transported Lackman back to Butte following his arrest. The prosecutor asked the officer if Lackman had asked any questions during the ride. The officer testified, \u201cOne time Mr. Lackman asked me how hard it would be to prove a self-defense case.\u201d During his direct examination, Lackman admitted to making the statement and testified that he asked the question \u201c[b]ecause I knew what happened, but I didn\u2019t trust\u2014I don\u2019t know. I was scared that I wouldn\u2019t be able to prove my case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">\u00b620 He testified further on direct that he did not call the police after shooting Partelow because, \u201cI was doing drugs at the time, and I was afraid they wouldn\u2019t believe me.\u201d He agreed that it was his \u201cnatural instinct to run from trouble.\u201d During Lackman\u2019s cross-examination, the prosecutor followed up on this line of questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">Q. And I believe [defense counsel] asked you if your natural instinct is to run?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">Q. Away from trouble?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-13\">Q. If you\u2019re justified, why are you in trouble?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-14\">A. Because I don\u2019t really have\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014didn\u2019t think that the police would believe me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-15\">Q. Would believe what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>A. My story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">Q. Your story. Your story was that this man was going to kill you and you had to kill him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">A. Yes. That he was attacking me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">Q. And I think [defense counsel] put it in her opening that you had no other choice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">Q. And you thought the police wouldn\u2019t believe you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">A. I didn\u2019t know if they would believe me or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-11\">Q. Did you ever tell them\u2014or the police your story?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-12\">A. No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-13\">Q. Nobody\u2019s heard your story until today; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-14\">A. Until today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-15\">Defense counsel did not object to this line of questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-16\">\u00b621 In her closing argument, defense counsel emphasized Lackman\u2019s belief that the police would not believe his self-defense story. She opened her argument by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-17\">\u201cHow do you prove a self-defense case? How hard is it to prove a self-defense case?\u201d Those were the thoughts that were going through Jeff Lackman\u2019s mind when he was arrested. How does he go before someone and convey what it was like to have to make the ultimate decision, the decision to defend yourself from serious bodily injury or death, and that by defending yourself you shot someone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-18\">During rebuttal, the prosecutor addressed defense counsel\u2019s argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYk\">And then [defense counsel] asked you, put yourself\u2014or don\u2019t put yourself\u2014why Mr. Lackman would be asking how hard it is to prove self-defense. Ask yourself what the answer is. I suggest when you\u2019re in the back of the cop car, you\u2019re going to find something else up. Because you weren\u2019t successful in the first time of events, which is to run and get away. So how hard is it to prove self-defense? And if it\u2019s self-defense, why don\u2019t you tell anybody? I can understand maybe that there\u2019s some apprehension with law enforcement. But when his girlfriend [who witnessed the shooting] asked him, \u201cHow could you do that, why did you do that,\u201d he didn\u2019t say it was self-defense, did he? He didn\u2019t answer her. He didn\u2019t tell Romero. He didn\u2019t call anybody. He didn\u2019t do this until the gig was up and until he was in the back of a police car and he comes up with how hard is it to prove self-defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-19\">Defense counsel once again did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-20\">\u00b622 Lackman argues that the State improperly introduced and commented upon his failure to tell police his self-defense story. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>asserts that his claims warrant plain error review because they implicate his \u201cfundamental constitutional rights and failure to review the claims would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice and leave unsettled the fundamental fairness of [his] trial.\u201d Evidence of his silence, Lackman contends, violated M. R. Evid. 403 because the risk of unfair prejudice outweighed the evidence\u2019s probative value. Moreover, Lackman asserts, use of his silence to create an inference of guilt also violated his rights under the Montana Constitution. Lackman acknowledges that this Court has concluded that the State does not violate a defendant\u2019s rights by commenting on the defendant\u2019s silence prior to being given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 915 P.2d 208 (1996), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds by State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817. Nevertheless, Lackman urges us to follow other courts in holding that the State violates a defendant\u2019s rights by commenting on the defendant\u2019s silence regardless whether he has received <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u00b623 \u201cIt is well established that impeachment use of a defendant\u2019s silence after arrest and after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings is a violation of due process.\u201d <em>State v. Morsette, </em>2013 MT 270, \u00b6 35, 372 Mont. 38, 309 P.3d 978 (citing <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 618-19, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 2245 (1976)). Equally well established, it does not violate \u201c \u2018due process of law for a State to permit cross-examination as to postarrest [pre-<em>Miranda] </em>silence when a defendant chooses to take the stand.\u2019 \u201d <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 139, 915 P.2d at 216 (quoting <em>Fletcher v. Weir, </em>455 U.S. 603, 607, 102 S. Ct. 1309, 1312 (1982)); <em>accord State v. Schaff, </em>2011 MT 19, \u00b6 15, 359 Mont. 185, 247 P.3d 727 (concluding that <em>\u201cDoyle </em>does not preclude impeaching a testifying defendant using inconsistent pre-<em>Miranda </em>statements or omissions\u201d); <em>State v. Clausell, </em>2001 MT 62, \u00b6 61, 305 Mont. 1, 22 P.3d 1111 (concluding that the <em>\u201cDoyle </em>rul\u00e9is limited to only those instances where the prosecution seeks to impeach a defendant\u2019s testimony based on silence after <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u00b624 We are unpersuaded that Lackman\u2019s claims warrant plain error review. After shooting Partelow, Lackman fled the scene with his girlfriend and Romero. While they were driving, his girlfriend asked, \u201cHow could you do\u2014how could you do that? What\u2014why would you do that?\u201d Lackman did not respond. He spent hours in the car with Romero after fleeing the crime scene. During all that time, he never made mention of having acted in self-defense. Lackman took the stand and testified that he did not call the police after shooting Partelow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>because he \u201cwas afraid they wouldn\u2019t believe [him].\u201d During its cross-examination, the State followed up on this line of questioning, with Lackman confirming that he did not tell police his story because he thought the police would not believe him. In the context of the questioning, the prosecutor\u2019s next question\u2014\u201cNobody\u2019s heard your story until today; is that correct?\u201d\u2014relates to Lackman\u2019s prearrest silence. Similarly, considered in context, the prosecutor\u2019s comment in rebuttal closing argument that Lackman failed to tell anybody his self-defense story \u201cuntil the gig was up and until he was in the back of a police car\u201d relates to his prearrest silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b625  To the extent that the prosecutor\u2019s comments can be characterized as relating to Lackman\u2019s post-arrest silence, it is undisputed that the record does not reflect whether Lackman was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. We have held consistently that use of a defendant\u2019s post-arrest, pr <em>e-Miranda </em>silence to impeach a defendant\u2019s testimony does not violate due process. <em>Schaff, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Clausell, </em>\u00b6 61; <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 139-40, 915 P.2d at 216-17. In light of our case law, we conclude that Lackman\u2019s claims do not warrant plain error review because he has not demonstrated that the State violated his fundamental rights by commenting upon his failure to tell police his self-defense story. We therefore decline to address his argument that the Court should extend <em>Doyle </em>to a defendant\u2019s pr <em>e-Miranda </em>silence.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao1t\">\u00b626 <em>3. Whether the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement of the legal elements for justified use of lethal force constitutes plain error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b627 During her closing argument, the prosecutor emphasized that the jury should not focus on Lackman\u2019s \u201cversion of self-defense, but what the law is.\u201d The prosecutor continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">And Judge Newman just read you the law that you should be focusing on here. A person is justified in the use of force or threat to use force, and to the extent that he reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself against the imminent use of unlawful force. However, a person is justified in the use of force which is intended or likely to cause death or serious bodily harm only if he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Later in her argument, the prosecutor made the following statement regarding justifiable use of force:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">You have to apply what you have heard in this case to the law. And you need to determine and\u2014look at that jury instruction on self-defense, and you need to determine what is reasonable, what belief is reasonable. You have to have a <em>reasonable belief that your life is in jeopardy to be able to take someone else\u2019s and be justified </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number><em>in doing so.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u00b628 Defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement of the law. Defense counsel used her closing argument, however, to correct the misstatement. She clarified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">[T]he law does not say that you can only use deadly force if there\u2019s the threat of death. It\u2019s also serious bodily injury. You\u2019ll have those instructions. Look at them. He did exactly to the extent what he needed to do to save himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">Self-defense has been a concept accepted by the law forever, as far as I know. That has been granted to all of us, that we can defend ourselves. We don\u2019t have to let ourselves get beat up and get serious bodily injury. We don\u2019t have to allow ourselves to die. We get to defend ourselves. That is the right of each of you, and it was his right. And he exercised that right. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Defense counsel used the phrase \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d six times during her closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">\u00b629 Lackman contends that the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement of the law of justifiable use of force violated his right to due process and therefore warrants plain error review. He asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement prejudiced his right to a fair trial because it \u201cwas the lynchpin of the State\u2019s persuasive closing argument.\u201d The State concedes that the prosecutor misstated the law but argues that the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement \u201cdid not render [Lackman\u2019s] trial fundamentally unfair or his conviction a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">\u00b630 We exercise plain error review \u201csparingly on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>State v. McDonald, </em>2013 MT 97, \u00b6 8, 369 Mont. 483, 299 P.3d 799. \u201cWe will not presume prejudice from\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement during closing argument; Lackman bears the burden of showing that the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement \u201cviolated his substantial rights.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 10 (citation and internal quotations omitted). We view the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement \u201cduring closing argument in the context of the entire argument\u201d in determining whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments violated Lackman\u2019s substantial rights. <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 10 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">\u00b631  Although the prosecutor misstated the law, she correctly stated the law early in her closing argument. Immediately prior to her misstatement, she encouraged the jury to \u201clook at that jury instruction on self-defense.\u201d Thus, \u201cin the context of the entire argument,\u201d we cannot conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement violated Lackman\u2019s substantial rights. <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 10. Moreover, defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>counsel made a seemingly strategic decision not to object to the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement. Defense counsel emphasized during her closing argument that the threat of serious bodily injury justifies the use of deadly force. She pointed out the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement of the law and used it to Lackman\u2019s advantage. Lackman has not met his burden of showing that failure to review the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice or call into question the fundamental fairness of his trial. Accordingly, we conclude that there was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">\u00b632 We affirm Lackman\u2019s deliberate homicide conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b486-7\">JUSTICES SHEA, WHEAT, SANDEFUR and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
