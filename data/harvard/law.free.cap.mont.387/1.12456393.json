We affirm and address these issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-11\"><em>1. Did the District Court err by not substituting Aguado\u2019s counsel </em>?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-12\">\n<em>2.

A.M., Patricia\u2019s granddaughter, moved into Aguado and Patricia\u2019s home when she was young due to her mother\u2019s inability to care for her. As such, A.M. was raised by Patricia and Aguado and considered Aguado to be a grandfather figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-20\">\u00b63 In June or early July, 2012, during a family vacation to Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>from Kentucky, Patricia\u2019s children, Ashley Sexton (Ashley) and Ricky Mills (Ricky) (A.M.\u2019s aunt and uncle), observed interactions between Aguado and A.M. that raised suspicions regarding the relationship between them. As was usual each summer, A.M. returned with Ashley to Kentucky to spend time with her family there, including A.M.\u2019s brother, T.M., who was being raised by Ashley. During a drive to Wal-Mart, Ashley asked A.M. \u201cif there was anybody that was trying to touch her or make her do things she didn\u2019t want to do.\u201d A.M. told Ashley that Aguado \u201chad tried to force himself on her thrusting his hand down her pants and threatened to kill Patricia and A.M. if she told anyone.\u201d A.M. told Ashley about a \u201csex contract\u201d she had signed with Aguado as a means to get Aguado to stop his sexual actions. She said the document was hidden under her mattress at Aguado and Patricia\u2019s home in Columbus. Ashley informed Ricky about A.M.\u2019s disclosure and the two of them proposed that A.M. record a phone call between her and Aguado after A.M. informed them that Aguado would talk about sex with her on the phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b64 Ricky set up recording equipment on the phone and A.M. made a call with Ashley present for support. The conversation became sexually explicit, with Aguado asking A.M. if they were \u201cstill on\u201d for doing the \u201cfull fuck\u201d and the \u201cBig Lick\u201d when she returned to Montana, and later asking A.M. if she was \u201cready for a full fuck?\u201d, saying that she was \u201cgonna love it, baby.\u201d Aguado told A.M. that she \u201cneed[ed] to [have sexual intercourse] as much as you can the first two weeks\u201d to alleviate any pain and said that he would \u201ctake care o\u2019 ya\u201d because he knew \u201chow to do it where it ain\u2019t gonna bother you that much.\u201d A.M. was thirteen years old at the time of the phone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\u00b65 After the phone call, Ashley, Ricky, and another family member drove to Montana to inform Patricia and attempt to find the \u201csex contract\u201d A.M. had described. Upon arriving, Ricky found the document where A.M. said it would be. The next day, Ricky advised Patricia of A.M.\u2019s allegations and played the recording of Aguado and A.M.\u2019s telephone conversation. Later that day, Ricky, Ashley, and Patricia made an initial report to the Stillwater County Sheriffs Department and, the following day, fully reported the incident and turned over the recording and \u201csex contract\u201d to authorities. Aguado was arrested that day and later charged with Sexual Abuse of Children and Sexual Assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">\u00b66 At the two trials, A.M. testified that Aguado had showed her pornographic videos when she was six years old and began touching her inappropriately about the same time. A.M. testified that Aguado touched her private parts \u201cI p Iretty much almost every day,\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>often occurred in the car or A.M.\u2019s bedroom. A.M. also testified to multiple instances of sexual assault, some involving Aguado\u2019s use of force and A.M.\u2019s active resistance. A.M. testified the \u201csex contract\u201d stated she \u201chad to go all the way and [do a] big lick\u201d with Aguado on a given day and that Aguado had her sign it \u201c|b lecau.se he would always ask for something and I would say T promise,\u2019 when I really didn\u2019t want to do it. And I would always lie when I\u2019d say T promise\u2019, to him, so he made me write it down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b67 The jury found Aguado guilty of Sexual Abuse of Children, but hung on the charge of Sexual Assault. The State pursued a second trial on the Sexual Assault charge, after which the jury found Aguado guilty. Aguado appeals. Additional facts are discussed as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\u00b68 A request to substitute counsel is within the sound discretion of the district court, reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>State v.

Goulet, </em>283 Mont. 38, 41, 938 P.2d 1330, 1332 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b28-12\">\u00b612 <em>1. Did the District Court err by not substituting Aguado\u2019s counsel </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>\u00b613 Aguado argues the District Court improperly denied his two requests for substitution of counsel. He argues the multiple complaints he made about his public defender, Gregory Paskell (Paskell), and the evidence adduced at two hearings demonstrate that tension and conflicts of interest existed between Aguado and Paskell such that Paskell should have been replaced. The State counters that Aguado did not demonstrate to the District Court that \u201cPaskell was operating under an actual conflict,\u201d nor that counsel\u2019s performance was affected by the claimed conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b614 After the first trial, Aguado filed a motion to substitute counsel, asserting that Paskell had communicated with the prosecution without authorization, was excessively argumentative, refused to file certain motions, refused to provide adequate investigative and professional services, and aided in violating Aguado\u2019s rights due to excessive bail. Aguado stated he had filed a complaint with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) against Paskell and, as such, must be given a private attorney because all public defenders were likewise conflicted. The District Court scheduled a hearing to inquire into Aguado\u2019s claims and ordered Paskell to respond to the allegations, issuing a Gillham<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> order that stated \u201c[t]o the extent that defense counsel... necessarily reveals confidential information,\u201d he would not be subject to disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b615 During the hearing, the District Court addressed Aguado\u2019s allegations individually, allowing Aguado to fully state his concerns on each one. However, Aguado was unable to provide specifics and admitted he actually had not filed an ODC complaint against Paskell. Aguado then claimed he had not received all of the discovery documents and that Paskell would not provide him additional copies of documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b616 Pursuant to the District Court\u2019s request, Paskell responded and stated that he had spent over 400 hours in this case and was not Aguado\u2019s first attorney. Aguado had initially hired a private attorney who withdrew before Paskell was appointed as his public defender. Paskell stated that the prior attorney had done little preparation and that Paskell needed the first continuance he had requested to be adequately prepared for trial. Paskell noted the motion to suppress he had filed as a result of the continuance was successful in suppressing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>much of the evidence against Aguado.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Paskell stated that Aguado has \u201calleged various kinds of conspiracies and issues concerning the production of the phone conversation, the sex contract and other matters\u201d but that those allegations had been fully investigated. Regarding Aguado\u2019s discovery concerns, Paskell stated that discovery documents are provided \u201cas a matter of rule and policy\u201d by the Office of Public Defender (OPD) and \u201ceverything that comes into the office goes right to the client.\u201d Regarding the copies Aguado had alleged Paskell would not make for him, Paskell stated that the documents in question regarded Aguado\u2019s insurance issues, and that OPD did not have resources to make copies for other matters. Paskell explained that he had filed some motions on Aguado\u2019s behalf, but that he believed others to be potentially irrelevant, and that certain witnesses Aguado wanted called would provide only duplicative testimony. Finally, Paskell noted that Aguado\u2019s concern that he was delaying the trial was incorrect because \u201cI e | very thing that we did for Mr. Aguado proved somewhat if not successful.\u201d Paskell stated that he could represent Aguado effectively, and Aguado stated that he could continue with Paskell \u201c[i]f need be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b617 The District Court denied Aguado\u2019s request for substitution, concluding that he had failed to raise \u201cseemingly substantial\u201d complaints and had \u201cnot demonstrated that there has been a total breakdown in communication between he and attorney Paskell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u00b618 Shortly before the second trial, Paskell sent a letter to the District Court \u201cto advise the court on certain matters of importance\u201d and that Paskell had permission from Aguado to speak with the District Court about these matters. Paskell stated that Aguado wanted new counsel and that Aguado planned, on the first day of trial, to fire Paskell. Paskell stated Aguado wanted a continuance to further analyze the evidence, and that Aguado claimed Paskell had conspired with the State to conceal documents from Aguado.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u00b619 The District Court conducted a hearing and heard Aguado\u2019s complaints against Paskell. The hearing considered both the request for new counsel and Aguado\u2019s motion to continue the trial. Aguado stated that Paskell had provided him a copy of his entire case file, which he claimed had 5,000 documents. In the file, Aguado had found a copy of Ricky\u2019s phone bill, which he claimed was never provided to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>him despite repeated requests. Noting research contained in the file regarding federal communications statutes, Aguado claimed the phone call between he and A.M. was illegally recorded and should have been suppressed. Aguado claimed that \u201cMr. Paskell deliberately withheld those documents from me. For what reason, I have no idea. It\u2019s been prejudice against me and the same with the State prosecutors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b620 In response, Paskell stated that he had made a complete copy of his file to give to Aguado, but it contained 300 or 400 pages of discovery, not 5,000. He explained that he and Aguado disagreed on whether federal statute precluded introduction of the evidence. He also reiterated that the OPD has procedures to provide copies to clients and was \u201cvery confident\u201d this had been done for Aguado.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b621 The District Court explained to Aguado that if it were to deny his request for substitution of counsel, he would have either the choice of continuing with Paskell or representing himself, and explained the risks of self-representation. The court asked Aguado if he could continue to work with Paskell, and Aguado responded that he had lost trust in Paskell. Paskell stated he was \u201cwilling to continue to represent [Aguado].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">\u00b622 The District Court issued an order concluding that Aguado \u201chas once again failed to raise a seemingly substantial complaint in regards to his attorney\u201d and denied the motion. The District Court stated Paskell has \u201cbeen a consummate professional and has zealously and effectively represented the Defendant since day one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AX\">\u00b623  Criminal defendants have a fundamental right to effective assistance of counsel. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 24; <em>State v. Happel, </em>2010 MT 200, \u00b6 14, 357 Mont. 390, 240 P.3d 1016. \u201cHowever, \u2018the right to assistance of counsel does not grant defendants the right to counsel of their choice.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Dethman, </em>2010 MT 268, \u00b6 15, 358 Mont. 384, 245 P.3d 30 (quoting <em>State v. Craig, </em>274 Mont. 140, 149, 906 P.2d 683, 688 (1995)); <em>accord Cheetham, </em>\u00b6 18. \u201cWhen a defendant complains about ineffective assistance of appointed counsel and requests new counsel, a district court must make \u2018adequate initial inquiry\u2019 as to whether defendant\u2019s allegations are \u2018seemingly substantial.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Dethman, </em>\u00b6 16 (quoting Happel, \u00b6 <em>14; State v. Gallagher, </em>1998 MT 70, \u00b6 15, 288 Mont. 180, 955 P.2d 1371). \u201cA district court conducts \u2018adequate initial inquiry\u2019 when it considers the defendant\u2019s factual complaints together with counsel\u2019s specific explanations and makes some sort of critical analysis of the complaint.\u201d <em>Dethman, </em>\u00b6 16 (quoting Happel, \u00b6 14). A district court conducts an inadequate inquiry where it \u201cfails to conduct \u2018even a cursory inquiry\u2019 \u201d into the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>allegations. <em>Cheetham, </em>\u00b6 20 (quoting <em>State v. Schowengerdt, </em>2015 MT 133, \u00b6 17, 379 Mont. 182, 348 P.3d 664).</p>\n<p id=\"Aa\">\u00b624  We have explained that, to obtain substitution of counsel, the defendant bears the burden of proving: (1) \u201ccomplete collapse of the attorney-client relationship\u201d; (2) \u201ctotal lack of communication\u201d; or (3) \u201cineffective assistance of counsel [IAC].\u201d <em>Cheetham, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>Edwards, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>State v. Kaske, </em>2002 MT 106, \u00b6 30, 309 Mont. 445, 47 P.3d 824). A complaint is \u201cseemingly substantial\u201d if it provides a legitimate concern about any of these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b625 However, an inquiry into a complaint of ineffective assistance for purposes of substitution of counsel should not become <em>Strickland </em>litigation to resolve the merits of such claims. As we stated in Cheetham:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">A claim of ineffective assistance based on differences between the defendant and his counsel about trial strategy and production of evidence is available in, and better suited for, a postconviction proceeding where counsel may divulge more freely\u2014with appropriate safeguards <em>(In re Gillham, </em>216 Mont. 279, 282, 704 P.2d 1019, 1021 (1985))\u2014his or her communications with the defendant and strategic decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-8\"><em>Cheetham, </em>\u00b6 29; <em>see also Cheetham, </em>\u00b6 39 (McKinnon, J., concurring) (\u201cWhile precedent regarding ineffectiveness claims informs our understanding of the right to substitution, a judge should not be required to conduct a collateral proceeding during the pendency of a trial, which is more appropriately handled through a postconviction proceeding.\u201d). While the court may need to inquire sufficiently of the defendant and counsel to determine whether a complete collapse of communication or of the relationship has occurred, this should not necessitate the issuance of a <em>Gillham </em>order. <em>Cheetham, </em>\u00b6 29 (\u201cBy its terms, the procedure we directed in <em>Gillham </em>applies to petitions for postconviction relief when a response from defense counsel is necessary.\u201d). The appropriate time for an evaluation of the merits of an ineffectiveness claim is either on direct appeal, if the IAC claims are record-based, or in a postconviction proceeding if the grounds are not record-based. <em>State v. Howard, </em>2011 MT 246, \u00b6 21, 362 Mont. 196, 265 P.3d 606 (\u201cWhen claims of ineffective assistance are capable of resolution by examining the record alone, they are appropriate for consideration on direct appeal.\u201d); <em>State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 24, 316 Mont. 198, 70 P.3d 738 (\u201c[I]f the Court cannot make that determination from the record before it, then it must decline to proceed further and allow the defendant to raise his ineffective assistance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>counsel claim in a petition for postconviction relief.\u201d). \u201cIn reviewing a district court\u2019s inquiry [regarding a substitution of counsel request], we do not examine whether counsel was ineffective, but instead, whether the district court\u2019s inquiry into the claim was adequate.\u201d <em>Cheetham, </em>\u00b6 <em>20 (citing State v. MacGregor, </em>2013 MT 297, \u00b6 25, 372 Mont. 142, 311 P.3d 428). \u201cIt is within the sound discretion of the district court to rule on requests for appointment of new counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Hendershot, </em>2007 MT 49, \u00b6 23, 336 Mont. 164, 153 P.3d 619; <em>accord Gallagher, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>Craig, </em>274 Mont. at 149, 906 P.2d at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"A0\">\u00b626  Here, the District Court conducted considerable inquiries into Aguado\u2019s complaints, working methodically through all of them. The complaints from Aguado and the responses from Paskell both indicate there was conflict and disagreement regarding how to conduct the case. However, there is ample evidence that Paskell and Aguado were able to communicate, no evidence that Paskell had a true conflict that would prevent him from representing Aguado, and no legitimate concerns that Paskell was providing ineffective assistance. Indeed, Paskell effectively obtained an order suppressing evidence against Aguado, and the first trial ended in a hung jury on one of the counts. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Aguado\u2019s complaints were not seemingly substantial and in denying his substitution motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u00b627 <em>2. Did the District Court violate Aguado\u2019s confrontation rights by excluding evidence pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-511(2), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u00b628 The State filed a motion in limine to exclude any evidence regarding A.M.\u2019s sexuality, including any specific acts with others. Aguado opposed the motion, arguing that A.M.\u2019s sexual orientation provided context to the phone call between them. Particularly, as stated in his offer of proof, Aguado sought to introduce evidence that A.M. was being bullied at school for her bisexual orientation and that she planned to go on an overnight camping trip to have sex with a boy to alleviate bullying on the issue. Aguado alleged that, when A.M. asked to go on the camping trip, he and Patricia had denied permission, after which A.M. had allegedly told Aguado \u201cmaybe I should fuck you.\u201d Aguado argued that A.M. made statements to Aguado that led him to believe that she was planning to have sex with her half-brother and another unnamed male while in Kentucky. For what it was worth, Aguado wanted to argue to the jury that, in light of this evidence, the phone call between he and A.M. must be understood as him encouraging A.M. to return to Montana so they \u201ccould further discuss the bullying, her response to it and her possible involvement with others sexually in order to prevent inappropriate sexual choices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>\u00b629 The District Court granted the State\u2019s motion, reasoning that Aguado\u2019s offer of proof did not \u201crebut, contextualize, or explain\u201d the statements made during the phone call and that \u201cthe evidence appears primarily to be directed at sullying the victim\u2019s character by painting her an overly sexualized, lesbian or bisexual teenage girl and placing her on trial, the very thing prohibited by \u00a7 45-5-511.\u201d The District Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">The defense may not offer nor suffer to be offered any evidence concerning the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct, except with the defendant, or prior instances of sexual abuse of the victim, if any. Such prohibition shall include any reference to the victim\u2019s sexual orientation, sexualized or flirtatious behavior, and/or purported desire or plan to have sex with anyone, aside from the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ac-dedup-0\">\u00b630 Despite this ruling, the District Court permitted significant context evidence to be introduced by Aguado. In the first trial, Aguado elicited testimony from A.M. that she was being bullied for \u201cweird choices\u201d she had made, and that Aguado had denied her request to go to the park because of his assertion that she was going to \u201chave sex with boys there.\u201d Aguado testified about A.M.\u2019s bullying and that she had a solution which, Aguado believed, was for A.M. to have sex with a male. He also testified that he believed A.M. was going to have sex with someone in Kentucky and that his intent during the recorded phone call \u201cwas to get her to come back here to Montana. And to\u2014I just played along with her, pretty much\u201d in order to get her away from the drinking, drugs, and \u201cheavy sexual activities\u201d down in Kentucky. Aguado testified similarly in the second trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">What you heard on the tape, to be blunt, is what she wanted. Okay?

Thus, to resolve the tension between the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense and the victim\u2019s rights under the statute, the district court must \u201cstrike a balance in each case.\u201d <em>Colburn, </em>\u00b6 25 (citing <em>State v.

First, the theory was speculative. If A.M. was indeed bisexual, having sex with a male may have done nothing to alleviate bullying over a bisexual orientation. Indeed, it may have provided reason for further negative attention, especially if committed with her grandfather. And, Aguado told A.M. in the phone call that no one would know they had sexual intercourse, which would also defeat Aguado\u2019s theory. Second, Aguado\u2019s context theory conflicts with the actual conversation during the phone call. Aguado did not play along with a plan proposed by A.M. Rather, Aguado raises the subject of sex by asking A.M. if \u201cwe\u2019re still on\u201d and if she\u2019s ready for \u201cfull\u201d sexual activity. The District Court was correct\u2014Aguado\u2019s purpose was to prejudice A.M. in the eyes of the jury. Finally, the District Court allowed much of what Aguado wished to introduce, only excluding A.M.\u2019s sexuality. Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion and there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b635 <em>3. Did the District Court err by dismissing Juror No. 5 in the second </em>trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b636 During jury selection in the second trial, the District Court asked each prospective juror whether \u201canyone had a close family member or they themselves been sexually abused or accused of such.\u201d A number of potential jurors indicated they met the criteria and each was individually questioned in chambers. However, Juror No. 5 did not respond in the affirmative and was eventually seated on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">\u00b637 After the prosecution had given its opening statement, but before presenting evidence, a Columbus police officer advised the prosecution that Juror No. 5\u2019s son had previously been convicted of a sexual offense. The State informed Judge Spaulding, who questioned the juror. Juror No. 5 acknowledged that his son had been convicted of statutory sexual intercourse without consent. He explained that he did not disclose the conviction during voir dire because he \u201cdidn\u2019t picture it as a sexual assault. It was boyfriend-girlfriend. He was a year or so older than the girlfriend.\u201d He assured the court that he could judge the case impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">\u00b638 The State was concerned that the juror had not disclosed the incident during voir dire in response to the question asking for such disclosure. The State advised the court that it would likely have used a preemptory challenge to strike the juror had it known this information during voir dire, and asked the District Court to excuse him and seat the alternate juror. Aguado argued that Juror No. 5\u2019s assurances that he could be fair and unbiased were sufficient. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>District Court dismissed Juror No. 5 because he had failed to disclose his son\u2019s conviction and seated the alternate to \u201cavoid absolutely any argument that anything improper has occurred here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b639 On appeal, Aguado argues that the District Court abused its discretion in seating the alternate juror because the State only learned about the lack of disclosure due to the \u201cknowledge of law enforcement\u201d and none of the information came to light during voir dire. Aguado adds that Juror No. 5 did not \u201cwillfully or intentionally withhold material information\u201d and assured the District Court that he could be unbiased.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u00b640 Montana Code provides that, \u201cI a llternate jurors, in the order in which they are called, shall replace jurors who, prior to the time the jury arrives at its verdict, become unable or disqualified to perform their duties.\u201d Section 46-16-118(3), MCA. \u201cThe trial court has discretion to remove a juror and seat an alternate juror whenever the facts show the juror\u2019s ability to perform his duties is impaired.\u201d <em>Grindheim, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Pease, </em>222 Mont. at 470, 724 P.2d at 162-63).</p>\n<p id=\"A2i\">\u00b641 In <em>Pease, </em>the district court replaced a juror during the trial after learning he was soon to be arrested for a felony he had confessed to. <em>Pease, </em>222 Mont. at 469-70, 724 P.2d at 162. The State moved to disqualify the juror, arguing he may be \u201coverly sympathetic to the defendant or he may vote for a conviction to gain leniency from the State.\u201d <em>Pease, </em>222 Mont. at 470, 724 P.2d at 162. We held that the defendant had to demonstrate \u201cbias or prejudice,\u201d such as \u201cdischarge of a juror for want of any factual support, or for a legally irrelevant reason,\u201d in seating the alternate juror. <em>Pease, </em>222 Mont. at 470-71, 724 P.2d at 163. Ultimately, we concluded that there was not an abuse of discretion and that the district court had provided a \u201clegal reason\u201d for the discharge. <em>Pease, </em>222 Mont. at 471, 724 P.2d at 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b642 Here, the District Court\u2019s questions revealed that Juror No. 5 may have not been truthful during voir dire, and that the State would likely have used a preemptory challenge had the truth been told. The District Court determined that the lack of candor during voir dire was a sufficient basis to justify seating the alternate juror. Jurors may be removed for cause for a variety of reasons, including \u201cfor any other reason that the court determines.\u201d Section 46-16-115, MCA. \u201cAlthough a defendant is entitled to an impartial jury, he has no right to a particular juror.\u2019\u2019 State <em>v.

Aguado passed the alternate for cause and the District Court had a good legal reason and factual support to seat the alternate. Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u00b643 <em>4. Did the District Court err by not giving a more specific unanimity </em>instruction?</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b644 Aguado argues that the District Court improperly instructed the jury when it utilized the pattern unanimity instruction from the Montana Pattern Jury Instructions. Aguado alleges the problem with the instruction, given the \u201csheer volume of allegations put forth by A.M. that could be see[n] to constitute the offense of sexual assault,\u201d is that it did not \u201csufficiently instruct the jury ... that it must unanimously decide on the exact when and where of the single count that constitutes the offense.\u201d The State argues that the allegations here likely satisfy our holding in <em>State v. Harris, </em>2001 MT 231, \u00b6 15, 306 Mont. 525, 36 P.3d 372, <em>abrogated in part on other grounds by Robinson v. State, </em>2010 MT 108, \u00b6 12 n.1, 356 Mont. 282, 232 P.3d 403, that where \u201cpersistent illegal acts were so frequently perpetuated and so closely connected as to be properly viewed as a single, continuous, running offense\u201d no unanimity instruction is needed, but that, even so, the instruction given was adequate and \u201cin no way compromised Aguado\u2019s guilty verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u00b645 In <em>State v. Weaver, </em>1998 MT 167, 290 Mont. 58, 964 P.2d 713, we held that, when a defendant is charged \u201cwith a series of unrelated allegations of sexual misconduct taking place over a period of years,\u201d the district court, \u201cwhere appropriate,\u201d must issue a unanimity instruction. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-39. We later clarified that holding in <em>Harris.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AE\">\u00b646  Aguado was charged with one count of Sexual Assault that covered a period of three years in the second trial. On the stand, A.M. testified to both repeated instances of sexual assault and to sexual events occurring frequently and in close connection. Perhaps given out of caution, the District Court\u2019s decision to give the pattern unanimity instruction, and not a different unanimity instruction, was not an abuse of discretion. We cannot conclude that the court failed to \u201cfully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case.\u201d <em>Dunfee, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\u00b647 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b38-8\">JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT and SANDEFUR concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b29-8\"><em> In re Gillham, </em>216 Mont. 279, 704 P.2d 1019 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b30-8\"> Paskell\u2019s motion resulted in an order suppressing the evidence from Aguado\u2019s laptop and a box found in an outbuilding, called a \u201crape kit\u201d by the parties, that contained items associated with sexual activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b38-9\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"A8\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">\u00b648 I agree with the Court\u2019s resolution of all issues in these proceedings, with the exception of the first issue regarding substitution of counsel. I continue to believe that the Court fails to properly enunciate a standard by which the trial court may assess the merits of such a motion. <em>See generally Cheetham, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-46 (McKinnon, J., specially concurring). Here, while the Court states that \u201cwe do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>examine whether counsel was ineffective,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 25, we nonetheless continue to allow for substitution of counsel if the defendant can demonstrate \u201cineffective assistance of counsell.I\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 24. Our inconsistency and unwillingness to properly differentiate between an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, appropriately raised in a collateral postconviction proceeding, and a request for substitution of counsel, raised during the pendency of trial, leaves the trial court and litigants without the appropriate guidance they should receive from this Court. Failure to adequately distinguish the two types of inquiries will continue to require collateral proceedings during the pendency of a trial and issuance of <em>Gillham </em>orders, both of which were done here. In my opinion, it is time to clearly state for the trial courts and litigants what standard to employ when conducting an \u201cadequate initial inquiry.\u201d <em>Dethman, </em>\u00b6 16; Opinion, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\u00b649 Our precedent informing a trial judge of the inquiry necessary when presented with a motion for substitution of counsel during trial is confusing, if not impossible to follow. We compound that problem today by continuing to blend an ineffectiveness claim with a substitution claim. While our precedent consistently emphasizes the need to conduct an adequate initial inquiry when a motion for substitution of counsel has been made, we have been careless in articulating the standard to be applied by a trial judge in resolving such a motion. We continue in that tradition today. In some cases, our enunciated standard requires a \u201ctotal lack of communication,\u201d <em>State v. Molder, </em>2007 MT 41, \u00b6 33, 336 Mont. 91, 152 P.3d 722; others a \u201ctotal lack of communication <em>or </em>ineffective assistance of counsel,\u201d <em>Dethman, </em>\u00b6 16, (emphasis added); and still others only an \u201cineffective assistance of counsel\u201d inquiry, <em>Gallagher, </em>\u00b6 24, <em>MacGregor, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b650 We were urged by the State in <em>Cheetham </em>to enunciate a clear standard for substitution requests. The State referred this Court to the well-reasoned authority of federal courts and the United States Supreme Court and urged us to enunciate a clear standard. Instead, we chose to dodge the bullet by concluding it was \u201cunnecessary to adopt a new standard in this case\u201d because \u201cthe court\u2019s initial inquiry did not reveal serious questions as to whether [defense counsel] performed the role of counsel envisioned by the Sixth Amendment!.]\u201d <em>Cheetham, </em>\u00b6 28, n.2. As I contended in <em>Cheetham, </em>I do not know how we assess whether counsel performed \u201cthe role of counsel envisioned by the Sixth Amendment\u201d when we fail to articulate a clear standard to assess the substitution request and continue to blend the request with an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\u00b651 In federal jurisprudence, prejudice is presumed and a per se violation of the Sixth Amendment based upon a \u201cconstructive\u201d denial of counsel arises whenever there is (1) an irreconcilable conflict between counsel and defendant; (2) an actual conflict of interest on the part of counsel; or (3) a complete breakdown in communication between counsel and the defendant. \u201cTo warrant substitute counsel, a defendant must show... \u2018a conflict of interest, an irreconcilable conflict, or a complete breakdown in communication between the attorney and the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Swinney, </em>970 F.2d 494, 499 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 1011, 113 S. Ct. 632 (1992) (citations omitted). <em>See also United States v. Allen, </em>789 F.2d 90, 92 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 846, 107 S. Ct. 164 (1986); <em>United States v.

The test, which is rooted in the breakdown of the attorney-client communication sufficient enough to frustrate the original purpose of the appointment, is essentially whether the trial judge should have granted a substitution motion because of an irreconcilable conflict. <em>Daniels v. Woodford, </em>428 F.3d 1181, 1197 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>550 U.S. 968, 127 S. Ct. 2876 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\u00b652 In my opinion, we do a disservice to the trial courts and the litigants who appear before them, when, after observing the inappropriate practice of granting a <em>Gillham </em>order and conducting an ineffective assistance of counsel hearing during the pendency of a trial, we nonetheless persist in failing to establish a standard by which to assess the request. I would, as the federal courts have, set forth a standard warranting substitution of counsel when there is an irreconcilable conflict between counsel and defendant, a conflict of interest on the part of counsel, or a complete breakdown in communication between counsel and the defendant. In evaluating whether a court has abused its discretion in denying a substitution motion, the following circumstances are relevant: the timeliness of the motion, the adequacy of the court\u2019s inquiry, and the degree to which the irreconcilable conflict has prevented the mounting of an adequate defense. <em>Allen, </em>789 F.2d at 92; <em>Whaley, </em>788 F.2d at 583; <em>Daniels, </em>428 F.3d at 1197-98. I believe such a standard is premised upon sound constitutional principles underlying the Sixth Amendment and Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u00b653 For the aforesaid reasons, I specially concur in the decision reached by the Court regarding issue one. As to the remaining issues, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
