We reverse and address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">\n<em>Did the involuntary commitment order violate the requirements of \u00a7 53-21-127(8), MCA?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\u00b62 On May 26, 2016, the Missoula County Attorney\u2019s Office petitioned the District Court for a determination that K.P. suffered from a mental disorder requiring involuntary commitment, based on a mental health evaluation that concluded K.P. was suffering from Schizoaffective Disorder. Earlier that day, K.P. had been involuntarily admitted to Saint Patrick Hospital after committing, as described in the report, \u201cacts of vandalism at his local mental health center and threatening to kill people.\u201d At the hospital, K.P. struck one of the nurses. The report advised that K.P. was \u201cwell known\u201d to the hospital and, compared to earlier evaluations by the same doctor, was \u201cwell below his baseline\u201d and \u201cpresently in the midst of a psychotic episode.\u201d \u00b63 Based on the report, the District Court determined that there was probable cause that K.P. suffered from a mental disorder, and that \u201cthere is an imminent threat of injury to himself or to others, or he is substantially unable to care for himself.\u201d The District Court ordered evaluation, treatment, and detention for K.P., as well as initiation of commitment proceedings and the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">\u00b64 On June 2, 2016, the District Court conducted a commitment hearing. The only witness was Thomas Hodgetts, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, who testified that K.P. was suffering from schizophrenia and was an imminent threat to others, and recommended he be committed to MSH for three months. At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court remanded K.P. to the custody of the Missoula County Sheriff. Then, outside the presence of K.P., the District Court stated from the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">THE COURT: So based on the testimony presented, the court finds K.P. to be suffering from schizophrenia, that he is in need of commitment, and the least restrictive placement is the Montana State Hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">The court further finds that treatment can be successful at the state hospital, and it\u2019s likely that his stay there will be fairly limited, and that when he comes back to the community certainly his ongoing treatment and medication regime needs to be monitored as for all people on schizophrenia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-11\">The court directs the transport to the state hospital and the state to prepare the appropriate order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAkX\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"45\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAOAAAAAtAQAAAACfIFomAAAAUElEQVR4nGP8z4AbMOGRG5UclRyVJEVSAcr5CRN9gpD8/wEq9qMByrhHhLEM/////y//HwJ+QOn/jyEUw//////vh4r9hUl+h1CMo9megCQAwRQ/EBHT/WwAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"224\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-4\">THE COURT [Responding to a question from counsel regarding under which statutory prong K.P. was being committed]: Well, he\u2019s a danger to others and his\u2014there was sufficient testimony presented that the danger was primarily the behavior that he exhibits to others ... and that\u2019s the danger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">That\u2019s why I had him removed from the courtroom before I announced my decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAsbn\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"36\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAP0AAAAkAQAAAABqfwG2AAAAU0lEQVR4nGP8z4AX/GTCL8/AMKpgVMGoApwKTkC5/x2gjJ9oCvZAuf8eQBk/Goi1guH///////8/DqH+/7OHMn7AaKgJGlDljDA3sMIMYBwK2R8AGywqjurdJQEAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"253\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">THE COURT [Responding to a question from counsel regarding involuntary medication]: Yes, it needs to be\u2014I\u2019m sorry. I forgot that. Yes, it needs to be an option, and he needs to go through the protocols at the state hospital if he refuses, but medication is essential, and that\u2019s another reason why, you know, I\u2019m committing him. That he\u2019s shown reluctance to take medication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADA\">\u00b65 On June 20, 2016, the State was informed from MSH that K.P. was to be unconditionally discharged from the MSH on June 24, 2016, to the Western Montana Mental Health Center in Missoula. On July 1,2016, the District Court issued a written commitment order, finding that K.P. should be committed for not more than three months in the MSH. K.P. was conditionally released by the MSH on July 6, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\u00b66 Whether a district court\u2019s findings of fact meet statutory requirements is a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>In re D.L.B., </em>2017 MT 1, \u00b6 10, 386 Mont. 180, 389 P.3d 227 (citing <em>In re S.G.R., </em>2016 MT 70, \u00b6 13, 383 Mont. 74, 368 P.3d 1180).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">\u00b67 K.P. argues that the District Court\u2019s oral order of involuntary commitment violated the governing statute and due process because it failed to include the required factual findings, citing <em>In re Mental Health of E.P.B., </em>2007 MT 224, \u00b6 13, 339 Mont. 107, 168 P.3d 662 and <em>In re L.L.A., </em>2011 MT 285, \u00b6 7, 362 Mont. 464, 267 P.3d 1. The State counters that the statute does not require detailed oral findings, and when considering the written order as well, the District Court sufficiently complied with the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">\u00b68 Because involuntary commitment has a \u201ccalamitous effect\u201d on the person being committed, we have long held the commitment statutes must be \u201cstrictly followed.\u201d <em>In re Mental Health of E.P.B., </em>\u00b6 7; <em>accord In re C.R.C., </em>2004 MT 389, \u00b6 13, 325 Mont. 133, 104 P.3d 1065; <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number><em>the Mental Health of R.M., </em>270 Mont. 40, 44, 889 P.2d 1201, 1204 (1995); <em>In re Mental Health of S.J., </em>231 Mont. 353, 355, 753 P.2d 319, 320 (1988). \u201cConclusory statements of statutory criteria do not constitute strict compliance with the statutory mandate of \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA.\u201d <em>In re L.L.A., </em>\u00b6 11 (internal quotations omitted); <em>accord In re Mental Health of E.P.B., </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b69 Section 53-21-127(8), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall make the following findings of fact:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">(a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">(b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">(c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-10\">(d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the respondent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\">(e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and supervision of the respondent\u2019s treatment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-12\">(f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was chosen from among other alternatives;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-13\">(g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-14\">(h) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen from among other alternatives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-15\">\u00b610 In <em>In re Mental Health </em>of E.P.B., we held the district court\u2019s findings were a \u201cfar cry\u201d from the statutory requirements where the district court recited a witness\u2019s testimony, noted it was consistent with other professional opinions, and entered four conclusory statements on the statutory criteria. <em>In re Mental Health of E.P.B., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10, 13. Similarly, in <em>In re L.L.A., </em>we held the district court\u2019s order failed to satisfy statutory requirements where it \u201ccontain[ed] no indication of the facts upon which it found that, because of her mental disorder, L.L.A. is substantially unable to protect her life and safety or that imminent threat of injury to herself or others will result if she is left untreated.\u201d <em>In re L.L.A., </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\u00b611  Here, the District Court\u2019s oral order only generally reflected the requirements of \u00a7 53-21-127(8), MCA, finding that K.P. suffered from schizophrenia, he needed commitment, MSH was the least restrictive option, his stay at MSH would likely be limited and successful, he was being committed for the danger he was to others, and involuntary medication could be administered. As K.P. argues, any informed review of the record leads to \u201can inescapable truth\u2014the ID |i strict IClourt, did not make the factual findings required by Montana Code Annotated \u00a7 53-21-127(8).\u201d The order did not satisfy the statute because there were no findings of facts to support the general conclusions, thus failing to provide \u201ca detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment.\u201d Section 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u00b612 The State\u2019s argument that this Court should utilize the findings of the written order in conjunction with the oral findings fails to address the fact that the written order was entered after K.P. had been committed for 30 days, just five days before he was conditionally released from MSH. Thus, the oral order was essentially the order that involuntarily committed K.P., not the belated written order, and it implicated the liberty rights the statutory scheme serves to protect. <em>See In re </em>B.D., 2015 MT 339, \u00b6 7, 381 Mont. 505, 362 P.3d 636 (noting \u201cstrict adherence\u201d exists due to the \u201cutmost importance of the rights at stake in [commitment] proceedings\u201d); <em>In re Mental Health of L.K.-S., </em>2011 MT 21, \u00b6 15, 359 Mont. 191, 247 P.3d 1100 (holding the \u201cprocedural safeguards\u201d to protect these rights are of \u201ccritical importance\u201d). Oral findings can be helpful and we have cited them, in supplement to a written order, to affirm involuntary commitments. <em>See, e.g., In re D.L.B., </em>\u00b6 17; <em>In re S.M., </em>2014 MT 309, \u00b6 27, 377 Mont. 133, 339 P.3d 23. However, while \u00a7 53-21-127(8), MCA, does not expressly mandate that an order of commitment be in writing, an oral order alone is unlikely to satisfy the detailed requirements and the purposes of the statute. As we have explained, \u201cthe <em>written order of commitment </em>must at the least be adequate to \u2018apprise) ] the receiving staff at [the commitment facility], treatment professionals, and even law enforcement who may be involved in transporting the patient, of the particular condition and behaviors that prompted hospitalization or gave rise to the need for commitment.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re S.M., </em>\u00b6 29 (quoting <em>In re L.L.A., </em>\u00b6 21) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 3-5-501(1)(d), (2), MCA (providing that \u201call orders, judgments and decrees\u201d are to be \u201centered\u201d by the clerk of the district court, and kept either electronically or in paper form).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>\u00b613  The State also argues that we should apply the doctrine of implied findings to enhance the oral order. Under this doctrine, \u201cwhere findings are general in terms, any findings not specifically made, but necessary to the determination, are deemed to have been implied, if supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>In re S.M., </em>\u00b6 28 (internal quotations omitted); <em>In re M.P.-L., </em>2015 MT 338, \u00b6 20, 381 Mont. 496, 362 P.3d 627 (citing use of written and oral findings, as well as the use of the doctrine of implied findings). However, \u201c[w]e decline to expand the doctrine of implied facts to the degree necessary to affirm a commitment order that is beyond \u2018hare-bones\u2019 and \u2018spartan.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re C.C., </em>2016 MT 174, \u00b6 23, 384 Mont. 135, 376 P.3d 105. Here, the oral order of commitment is insufficient to be affirmed by the use of implied findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u00b614 K.P. also argues that his constitutional right to due process was violated by his removal from the courtroom before the District Court orally pronounced its order, but having invalidated the order on statutory grounds, we need not address further issues. \u201cCourts should avoid constitutional questions whenever possible.\u201d <em>Wolfe v. Dep\u2019t of Labor and </em>Indus., 255 Mont. 336, 339, 843 P.2d 338, 341 (1992); <em>accord Sanchez v. State, </em>2012 MT 191, \u00b6 19, 366 Mont. 132, 285 P.3d 540; <em>State v. Peters, </em>2011 MT 274, \u00b6 33, 362 Mont. 389, 264 P.3d 1124.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u00b615 Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s commitment order is reversed and vacated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
