Lance Christopher Pavlik, </em>ordering the District Court to terminate contempt proceedings against her in that matter. Counsel for Lance Christopher Pavlik has filed a response objecting to the petition and asking this Court to allow the contempt proceedings against VanSkyock to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\u00b62 The rather convoluted procedural history of this matter began with Pavlik\u2019s 2013 entry of guilty pleas to two counts of vehicular homicide while under the influence and two counts of criminal endangerment. On March 12,2013, the District Court sentenced Pavlik on these convictions to a 30-year commitment to the Montana Department of Corrections (DOC) with all but 10 years suspended, and an additional 10-year suspended sentence for each of his criminal endangerment convictions. The court ordered that the sentences for criminal endangerment would run concurrent to the sentences for vehicular homicide, so that, in total, Pavlik would serve a 30-year commitment to DOC with 20 years suspended. The court did not restrict Pavlik\u2019s parole eligibility and recommended that DOC place him in the WATCh program, \u201cproviding it meets with the approval of the Department of Corrections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\u00b63 VanSkyock was the DOC probation officer who prepared the presentence investigation report in the case. After the court sentenced Pavlik to a DOC commitment, VanSkyock requested by standard form that DOC override its usual preliminary placement screening process and place Pavlik directly at the Montana State Prison (MSP). The originally asserted grounds for the override were that: (1) Pavlik\u2019s unsuspended 10-year sentence rendered him ineligible by statute for placement at the Missoula Assessment Center (MASC); (2) \u201cthe intent of [his] sentence\u201d was that he serve the first 5 years of his unsuspended sentence before \u201cbeing screened for the WATCh Knights Program\u201d; and (3) \u201c[t]here is much public sentiment about this case and it would be best for all if this offender was transferred to MSP.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">\u00b64 DOC MASC/Passages Administrator Dan Maloughney approved the override request and DOC placed Pavlik at MSP. Upon review of the override, acting DOC ACCD Administrator Cathy Gordon: (1) concluded that VanSkyock\u2019s initial request erroneously stated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>court imposed a 5-year parole restriction; (2) issued a revised <em>Override &amp; Referral Form </em>stating that the sole reason for the override was that Pavlik\u2019s unsuspended 10-year sentence rendered him ineligible by statute for placement at MASC; and (3) directing that VanSkyock\u2019s original override request form be destroyed and superseded by the revised form.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b65 Three years after sentencing, Pavlik moved the District Court to hold VanSkyock in contempt and sanction her in her individual capacity on the asserted ground that she contemptuously circumvented or interfered with the authority and sentencing order of the court by requesting the DOC preliminary placement screening override based on falsified information, thereby effectively precluding or delaying his placement in the WATCh program and impeding his parole eligibility. VanSkyock moved to dismiss the contempt proceedings based on lack of jurisdiction, the statute of limitations, and because she cannot be held in contempt for DOC\u2019s valid placement decision. The District Court denied her motion to dismiss, and VanSkyock now asks this Court to intervene via supervisory control or other appropriate writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\u00b66 Supervisory control is an extraordinary remedy justified when urgency or emergency factors make the normal appeal process inadequate, the case involves purely legal questions, and the other court is proceeding under a mistake of law causing a gross injustice. M. R. App. P. 14(3). We conclude those prerequisites are present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">\u00b67 Pavlik\u2019s motion for contempt asserted that VanSkyock \u201cdeserves to be held in contempt until such time as this wrong is fully righted\u201d and thus \u201crespectfully request! ed I... holding [VanSkyock] in contempt and imposing an appropriate sanction for said contempt\u201d pursuant to \u201c\u00a7 3-1-501, et seq., [MCA] \u201d. Pavlik accordingly requested a contempt hearing pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-518, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">\u00b68 By its express terms, \u00a7 3-1-518(1), MCA, applies to alleged contempts \u201cnot committed in the immediate view and presence of the court or judge.\u201d Thus, the alleged contempt is an \u201cindirect contempt\u201d ratherthan a\u201cdirect <em>contempt.\" See Kaufman v. Montana Twenty-First Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>1998 MT 239, \u00b6\u00b6 19 and 25, 291 Mont. 122, 966 P.2d 715. The distinction between direct and indirect contempts \u201cis critical\u201d to the determination of the proper contempt procedure. <em>Kaufman, </em>\u00b6 19. \u00b69 Also critical to the determination of the proper contempt procedure is the distinction between criminal and civil contempts. A contempt proceeding is criminal if the purpose of the proceeding is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>impose a penalty \u201cto punish the contemnor for a specific act\u201d thereby \u201cvindicad ingI the authority of the court.\u201d Section 3-1-501(3), MCA; <em>Kaufman, </em>\u00b6 17. On a criminal contempt, \u201cthe contemnor cannot end the incarceration or avoid the fine by complying with [the subject] court order.\u201d Section 3-1-501(3), MCA; <em>see also Kaufman, </em>\u00b6 17. In contrast, a contempt proceeding is civil if the purpose of the proceeding is to impose a contingent jail or monetary sanction \u201cto force the contemnor\u2019s compliance with a court order.\u201d Section 3-1-501(3), MCA; <em>Kaufman, </em>\u00b6 17. In contrast to a criminal contempt, a civil \u201ccontemnor can end the incarceration or avoid the fine by complying with [the subject] court order.\u201d Section 3-1-501(3), <em>MCA; Kaufman, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b610 The distinction between a criminal and civil contempt has critical procedural due process implications. Except for direct contempts committed under circumstances requiring \u201cimmediate corrective steps ... to restore order, maintain [the] dignity and authority of the court, and to prevent delay,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> criminal contempt proceedings require the full procedural due process protections of \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d a \u201chearing before a neutral judge,\u201d advance notice \u201cof the charges\u201d against the alleged contemnor, \u201cthe right to be represented by counsel,\u201d and \u201ca reasonable opportunity\u201d to oppose the charges \u201cby defense or explanation\u201d and the opportunity to \u201ctestify and call other witnesses.\u201d <em>Kaufman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31, 33. In response to <em>Kaufman, </em>the Montana Legislature repealed the prior Title 3, MCA, criminal sanction for indirect contempt and effectively provided that Title 3 indirect contempts are now punishable only by formal prosecution by the State of Montana under the general rules of criminal procedure specified by Title 46, MCA. Section 3-1-501(4), MCA; 2001 Mont. Laws 2458, 2460 (inter alia repealing former \u00a7 3-1-519, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u00b611  Here, it is unclear from Pavlik\u2019s Motion For Order Of Contempt whether he asks the District Court to hold VanSkyock in indirect civil contempt or indirect criminal contempt. Without need to pass on the correctness of the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the motion as a motion for civil contempt, Pavlik\u2019s contempt motion is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>fatally defective as a matter of law in either event.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If viewed as a motion for criminal contempt, indirect criminal contempts defined by Title 3, Chapter 1, MCA, are prosecutable only by the State by separate criminal proceeding commenced and prosecuted pursuant to Title 46, MCA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-1-501(4), MCA (the \u201cprocedures provided by Title 46 apply to criminal contempt prosecutions, except those under 3-1-511\u201d). Thus, Pavlik\u2019s motion fails to state a cognizable claim for criminal contempt as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b612 Pavlik\u2019s motion is similarly defective as a motion for indirect civil contempt. When a district court commits a criminal defendant to DOC for placement pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-201(3)(a)(iv)(A), MCA, the sentencing court has no authority to direct or control where or in what program DOC ultimately places the defendant for the term of sentence. <em>State v. Bekemans, </em>2013 MT 11, \u00b6 49, 368 Mont. 235, 293 P.3d 843. The sentencing court may recommend a particular placement for DOC consideration but the recommendation is not binding on DOC. <em>Bekemans, </em>\u00b6 49. Thus, as a threshold matter of law, the DOC placement \u201coverride\u201d at issue was not an override, disregard, or circumvention of the District Court\u2019s sentencing order or authority, it was an internal exercise of DOC placement authority and discretion, however well-grounded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Assuming <em>arguendo </em>the truth of the factual allegations against VanSkyock, her conduct was not a contempt, as defined by \u00a7 3-1-501(1)(c), (d), or (i), MCA, of the District Court\u2019s sentencing order or authority as a threshold matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u00b613 In any event, a cognizable claim for civil contempt must seek to compel performance of \u201can act that is in the power of the contemnor to perform.\u201d Section 3-1-520, MCA. Pavlik\u2019s motion does not seek a contempt citation and sanction against DOC as an entity or <em>against </em>VanSkyock as a DOC officer, administrator, or authorized agent in ultimate placement authority. Rather, it merely seeks a contempt citation and sanction against VanSkyock in her individual capacity as the line-level probation and parole officer who initially requested that the authorized DOC official(s) \u201coverride\u201d the usual preliminary DOC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>commitment screening process and place Pavlik directly at the Montana State Prison. Pavlik\u2019s motion and briefing, the District Court\u2019s order, and Pavlik\u2019s response on supervisory control are all devoid of any legal showing or indication that a line-level probation officer, as distinct from DOC as an agency or its authorized placement officer(s), has the authority to initially determine, or subsequently alter, a placement within the context of a court-ordered DOC commitment for placement in an appropriate correctional facility or program under \u00a7 46-18-201(3)(a)(iv)(A), MCA. Beyond asserting that VanSkyock should \u201cbe held in contempt until such time as this wrong is fully righted,\u201d Pavlik\u2019s motion and brief fail to state or seek performance of any specific act that would remedy the alleged wrong and be in VanSkyock\u2019s power to perform. Thus, as a matter of law, Pavlik\u2019s motion fails to state a cognizable claim for civil contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"A2Ks\">\u00b614  We conclude that the District Court erred as a matter of law in failing to grant VanSkyock\u2019s motion to dismiss the contempt proceeding on the foregoing grounds asserted in her motion to dismiss. The normal appeal process is inadequate, and the District Court is proceeding under a mistake of law causing a gross injustice. Therefore, in the exercise of our power of supervisory control, we hereby reverse the District Court\u2019s order denying VanSkyock\u2019s motion to dismiss, and remand for denial of Pavlik\u2019s contempt motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b615 The Clerk is directed to provide a copy of this Order to all counsel of record; to the Hon. James A. Manley, Twentieth Judicial District Court, Lake County; and to Lyn Fricker, Clerk of District Court, Lake County.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Dated this 2nd day of May, 2017.</p>\n<judges id=\"b336-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-6\"> The summary contempt procedure specified by \u00a7 3-1-511, MCA (criminal punishment of direct contempts necessary \u201cto restore order, maintain the dignity or authority of the court, or prevent delay\u201d), complies with minimum due process standards. <em>See Kaufman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\"> While we choose to resolve this matter on substantive grounds, Pavlik\u2019s contempt motion was also procedurally defective in violation of the affidavit requirement of \u00a7 3-1-512, MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b335-8\"> Whether and what remedy independent of the underlying criminal case may be available for redress or review of internal DOC placement decisions within the scope of its statutory discretion under \u00a7 46-18-201(3)(a)(iv)(A), MCA, is beyond the limited scope of our review on supervisory control here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
