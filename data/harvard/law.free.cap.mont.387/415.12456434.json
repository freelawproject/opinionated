Southern Montana Telephone Company and Lincoln Telephone Company\u2014both regulated by the Commission\u2014filed motions for protective orders to keep the salary information confidential. The Commission denied the motions, relying in part on a new \u201crubric\u201d that it developed by which it declared it would judge such motions. Southern and Lincoln each appealed to the First Judicial District Court. In two separate rulings, the District Court affirmed. \u00b62 Southern and Lincoln appeal, raising several issues. We reverse on the sole ground that the Commission\u2019s \u201crubric\u201d constitutes a de facto rule subject to Montana Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA) rulemaking requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">\u00b63 Southern and Lincoln are privately-owned Montana telecommunications companies. They also qualify as \u201cpublic utilities\u201d and are therefore subject to regulation by the Commission. Sections 69-1-102, -3-101(1)(f), MCA. The Commission possesses the authority to regulate privately-owned companies that provide a \u201cregulated telecommunications service\u201d\u2014like Southern and Lincoln\u2014but it does not regulate \u201c[rjural telephone cooperatives.\u201d Sections 69-3-101(1)(f), -901(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">\u00b64 The Commission certifies certain telecommunications public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>utilities as \u201celigible telecommunications carrierlsl\u201d (ETCs) for purposes of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996. <em>See </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.201(b) (2016); \u00a7 69-3-840(2), MCA. That Act\u2019s purpose is, in part, to provide \u201cuniversal\u201d telecommunications services to \u201clow-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high cost areas.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(3) (2015). The Act establishes the \u201cuniversal service\u201d fund (USF)\u2014a series of federal subsidies made available to ETCs for the purpose of providing such services. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(e). Federal law provides the requirements for ETC certification. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 214(e). Only a company that receives certification as an ETC may be eligible to receive USF subsidies. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(e). The Federal Communications Commission delegates to the Commission the authority to certify annually ETCs in Montana. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.314; \u00a7 69-3-840(1), MCA. The Commission must base its ETC certification on companies\u2019 compliance with federal statute. Section 69-3-840(2), MCA. The Commission has certified Southern and Lincoln as ETCs, and each receives federal USF subsidies.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\u00b65 Pursuant to federal law, the Commission requires all ETCs to apply for recertification annually. Section 69-3-203, MCA. Although all ETCs must submit certain documentation to the Commission for recertification, most are unregulated telephone cooperatives and not public utilities. Only ETCs that are subject to Commission regulation as public utilities\u2014including Southern and Lincoln\u2014must submit \u201cannual reports.\u201d Mont. Admin. R. 38.5.2602 (2000). The Commission prescribes the information that ETCs must include in their annual reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\u00b66 Recently the Commission began requiring that privately-owned ETCs disclose in their annual reports the names and compensation information for all executives and managers earning more than $100,000 per year in total compensation. The Commission\u2019s purpose in imposing this requirement was to increase transparency by disclosing to the public how ETCs spend the federal USF subsidies that they receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u00b67 Southern and Lincoln each filed motions for protective orders with the Commission. The motions requested that the Commission permit them to not disclose their employees\u2019 compensation information publicly. They agreed to provide the compensation information to the Commission but argued that employee salaries constituted trade secret information and that disclosure would violate the employees\u2019 constitutional rights to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\u00b68 The Commission denied Southern\u2019s and Lincoln\u2019s motions for protective orders. It concluded that the compensation information did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>not constitute a trade secret and that the employees\u2019 individual rights to privacy in their compensation did not clearly outweigh the public\u2019s right to know how the companies spent federal subsidies. In reaching the latter conclusion, the Commission developed and employed a three-part \u201crubric by which to judge companies\u2019 motions for protective orders\u201d of employee compensation information. Under the rubric, the public\u2019s right to know will outweigh the employees\u2019 individual privacy in their compensation information when: (1) \u201cthe employee is a manager or executive of the telecommunications company\u201d; (2) \u201cthe manager or executive has annual compensation that exceeds $100,000\u201d; and (3) \u201cone-fifth or more of [the company\u2019s] total Montana revenues originate from sources tied to the company\u2019s designation as an ETC\u201d\u2014i.e., from the USF subsidies. The Commission held no hearings or rulemaking proceedings before adopting this rubric, and applied it for the first time in the orders denying Southern\u2019s and Lincoln\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b69 Both Southern and Lincoln derive at least one-fifth of their total revenue from federal funds. The Commission thus determined that the compensation information of the companies\u2019 executive or managerial employees earning more than $100,000 per year in total compensation would notbe \u201csubject to confidentiality.\u201d The Commission subsequently denied Southern\u2019s and Lincoln\u2019s motions for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b610 Southern and Lincoln each filed petitions for judicial review in the First Judicial District Court. They raised several challenges, including an argument that the Commission\u2019s rubric constituted a \u201crule\u201d under MAPA and that the Commission had unlawfully adopted that rule without adhering to MAPA\u2019s rulemaking requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u00b611 In separate orders, two different judges affirmed the Commission\u2019s orders. Both concluded in relevant part that the Commission\u2019s \u201crubric\u201d did not constitute a \u201crule\u201d within the meaning of MAPA. In its order in Southern\u2019s case, the court explained that the Commission was \u201cnot required to initiate rulemaking to determine which factors to apply when balancing an individual\u2019s right of privacy versus the public\u2019s right to know. An agency\u2019s factual determination when conducting a legal analysis prescribed by the Montana Constitution is not a rule.\u201d The court stated further in that order that when the Commission \u201cidentifies and applies factors with which to balance competing constitutional mandates involving public records, it is not establishing a de facto rule.\u201d Southern and Lincoln appealed the court\u2019s orders, and their appeals were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">\u00b612 In an administrative appeal, we apply the same standards of review that the district court applies. <em>Nw. Corp. v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Serv. Regulation, </em>2016 MT 239, \u00b6 25, 385 Mont. 33, 380 P.3d 787. A court reviews an administrative decision in a contested case to determine whether the agency\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Nw. Corp., </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u00b613 Southern and Lincoln argue that the Commission\u2019s rubric establishes a \u201cstandard\u201d that \u201cimplements\u201d the Commission\u2019s \u201cpolicy\u201d of making ETC federal funding more transparent to the public. They therefore contend that it constitutes a de facto rule within the meaning of MAPA and that the Commission was obligated to comply with MAPA\u2019s rulemaking procedures before implementing the rubric.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\u00b614 The Commission counters that the District Court correctly concluded that the rubric was not a rule under MAPA. It emphasizes that the Commission is obligated to balance the public\u2019s constitutional right to know against the employees\u2019 constitutional right to privacy when considering companies\u2019 motions for protective orders. The Commission argues that its formulation of the rubric was simply a tool for applying this balancing test on a case-by-case basis and was therefore not subject to rulemaking requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">\u00b615 MAPA defines a \u201crule\u201d as \u201ceach agency regulation, standard, or statement of general applicability that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy.\u201d Section 2-4-102(11)(a), MCA. Before an administrative agency adopts a rule, MAPA mandates that the agency \u201ccomply with the public notice and comment procedures detailed in \u00a7\u00a7 2-4-302 and -305, MCA.\u201d <em>State v. Vainio, </em>2001 MT 220, \u00b6 27, 306 Mont. 439, 35 P.3d 948. These procedures include, among other requirements, that the agency give written notice of its proposed rule, hold a hearing, afford interested parties the opportunity to submit data, views, or arguments, consider comments in those submissions, and issue a statement explaining its reasons for adopting the rule. Sections 2-4-302, -305, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">\u00b616 \u201cUnless a rule is adopted in substantial compliance with these procedures, the rule is not valid.\u201d <em>Vainio, </em>\u00b6 27. In <em>Vainio, </em>we reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction for Medicaid fraud because the conviction was based on his violation of Medicaid policies that the Department of Public Health and Human Services had not adopted in compliance with MAPA rulemaking procedures. <em>Vainio, </em>\u00b6 71. We reached a similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>conclusion in two earlier cases. In <em>Northwest Airlines v. State Tax Appeal Board, </em>221 Mont. 441, 720 P.2d 676 (1986), we held invalid a Department of Revenue auditor\u2019s unilateral decision to include airline carriers\u2019 nonstop \u201cflyover\u201d miles in the agency\u2019s tax apportionment formula for determining a carrier\u2019s corporate license tax. We concluded that the standard inclusion of \u201cflyover\u201d miles constituted a rule under MAPA. <em>Nw. Airlines, </em>221 Mont. at 445, 720 P.2d at 678. In <em>Rosebud County v. Department of Revenue, </em>257 Mont. 306, 849 P.2d 177 (1993), we held invalid a Department of Revenue decision to alter the default method for assessing the market value of heavy equipment. The Department sent a letter to all county assessors directing them to use the new method. <em>Rosebud Cnty., </em>257 Mont. at 308, 849 P.2d at 178. Although the Department later conducted rulemaking to adopt this new method as a rule, we held that the rulemaking process was a \u201csham\u201d because the Department had denied \u201cthe public, the Legislature, and certain affected agencies\u201d their \u201cright to participate effectively in the governmental <em>process.\u201dRosebud Cnty., </em>257 Mont. at 311, 849 P.2d at 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b617 The Commission\u2019s rubric establishes a list of three formulaic criteria that it uses \u201cto judge companies\u2019 motions for protective orders\u201d of executive compensation information and to determine \u201cwhether the right to know of the public outweighs the demand of individual privacy involving ETC telecommunication company employee compensation.\u201d This rubric does not call for balancing in dividual interests on a case-by-case basis; it sets a standard by which the Commission judges all motions for protective orders for salary information of regulated ETCs. If the company\u2019s circumstances fit the formula, there is no further inquiry; all companies that receive at least twenty percent of their revenues from federal subsidies must disclose the compensation information of executives earning over $100,000 per year in total compensation, while all companies that do not meet the twenty percent threshold may keep that information confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b618 The term \u201crubric\u201d is defined as \u201c[a]n established <em>rule, </em>custom, or law\u201d or as \u201c[a]n authoritative <em>rule, </em>esp. for conducting a public worship service.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1529 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 10th ed. 2014) (emphasis added). The Commission\u2019s description of its formula as a \u201crubric\u201d is apt: it sets a \u201cstandard ... of general applicability\u201d that \u201cimplements\u201d the Commission\u2019s \u201cpolicy\u201d of providing for greater public disclosure of how ETCs spend the federal subsidies they receive. Section 2-4-102(11)(a), MCA. It therefore constitutes a rule within the meaning of MAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\u00b619 MAPA categorizes \u201csubstantive rules\u201d as either \u201clegislative rules\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>or \u201cadjective or interpretive rules.\u201d Section 2-4-102(14), MCA. \u201cLegislative rules\u201d have the force of law and are invalid unless adopted via rulemaking. Section 2-4-102(14)(a), MCA. \u201cAdjective or interpretive rules,\u201d in contrast, lack the force of law, \u00a7 2-4-102(14)(b), MCA, and may be adopted with publication of a statement of the advisory nature of the rule in the Administrative Rules of Montana. Section 2-4-308, MCA. The Commission failed to follow either process. It did not conduct rulemaking, so the rubric did not meet the requirements for a \u201clegislative rule.\u201d Section 2-4-102(14)(a), MCA. The Commission also failed to adopt the rubric as advisory only \u201cin accordance with\u201d MAPA\u2019s requirements for adopting an \u201cadjective or interpretive rule.\u201d Sections 2-4-102(14)(b), -308, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b620  The Commission developed and announced its rubric in the orders denying Southern\u2019s and Lincoln\u2019s motions for protective orders. It did not give advance notice to potentially interested parties of its intent to adopt this rubric or provide such parties an opportunity to comment on the rubric. The rubric is therefore invalid for failure to comply with MAPA rulemaking requirements. <em>Vainio, \u00b6 </em>27; \u00a7\u00a7 2-4-302, -305, MCA. The District Court incorrectly concluded otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u00b621 We reverse the judgments of the District Court in Southern\u2019s and Lincoln\u2019s cases and instruct the court to vacate the Commission\u2019s orders and to remand for further proceedings on the companies\u2019 motions for protective orders.</p>\n<judges id=\"b437-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, SANDEFUR and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
