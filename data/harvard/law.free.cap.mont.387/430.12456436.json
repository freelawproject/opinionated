The presiding judge\u2014Judge George Huss\u2014determined that the stipulated settlement was reasonable and entered judgment against Junkermier\u2019s insurer, N ew York Marine and General Insurance Company. New York Marine appealed and questioned Judge Huss\u2019s impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">\u00b62 We concluded in that appeal that Judge Huss should have disclosed a potential conflict of interest. We referred the case to the District Court to determine whether Judge Huss should have been disqualified for cause. The District Court concluded that Judge Huss was required to recuse himself and should have been disqualified. The District Court also vacated all orders that Judge Huss issued after he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>should have been disqualified. Peters contend that the District Court erred in ruling that Judge Huss should have been disqualified and in vacating Judge Huss\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b63 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b64 This is the third time this matter has been before this Court. <em>Draggin\u2019 Y Cattle Co. v. Addink, </em>2016 MT 98, 383 Mont. 243, 371 P.3d 970 (hereafter <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II); Draggin\u2019 Y Cattle Co. v. Addink, </em>2013 MT 319, 372 Mont. 334, 312 P.3d 451 (hereafter <em>Draggin\u2019 Y I). </em>We restate the relevant facts briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\u00b65 Peters sued Junkermier in January 2011 for damages related to tax services Junkermier performed for Peters. Junkermier requested that New York Marine defend and indemnify them against Peters\u2019s claims. New York Marine defended Junkermier subject to a reservation of rights throughout the suit. In the first appeal, we reversed a grant of summary judgment in Junkermier\u2019s favor and remanded. <em>Draggin\u2019 Y I, </em>\u00b6 51. Judge Huss assumed jurisdiction of this underlying action following remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">\u00b66 Peters and Junkermier entered into a settlement agreement and stipulation for entry of judgment without New York Marine\u2019s participation or authorization in November 2014. On December 5, 2014, New York Marine filed a motion to intervene and requested additional discovery and a stay of the scheduled reasonableness hearing. Ten days later, Judge Huss granted New York Marine\u2019s motion to intervene, denied its motions for additional discovery and to stay, and held the reasonableness hearing. NewYorkMarine contested the stipulated settlement\u2019s reasonableness and denied liability for the settlement. Judge Huss concluded that the stipulated settlement was reasonable and entered judgment in the amount of $10,000,000 in Peters\u2019s favor. New York Marine appealed, and Peters cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"A3E\">\u00b67 For the first time on appeal, New York Marine asserted that Judge Huss had an apparent conflict of interest stemming from a sexual harassment complaint that his former court reporter filed against him. New York Marine alleged that Judge Huss had individually entered into a stipulated settlement without the participation or authorization of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), which acted as Judge Huss\u2019s insurer by paying for his defense under a reservation of rights. New York Marine alleged further that the OCA had filed a declaratory judgment action in which it contested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the stipulated settlement amount\u2019s reasonableness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Judge Huss\u2019s potential conflict of interest, New York Marine contended, violated the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct and should have resulted in Judge Huss\u2019s disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b68 We concluded that Rule 2.12, M. C. Jud. Cond., required that Judge Huss disclose his participation in his personal stipulated settlement to the parties because the circumstances \u201ccould potentially cause the judge\u2019s impartiality reasonably to be questioned.\u201d <em>Draggin\u2019 YII, </em>\u00b6 31. But we declined to determine whether Rule 2.12 required Judge Huss to disqualify himself because such a determination \u201crequires findings of fact and conclusions of law following the presentation of evidence.\u201d <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 31. We therefore \u201cdetermine^] that the appropriate course of action [was] to refer the disqualification issue to a district judge to hear the matter pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA.\u201d <em>Draggin\u2019 YII, </em>\u00b6 31. In a subsequent order, this Court assigned the Honorable Russell C. Fagg to preside over the disqualification proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b69 Upon referral, Judge Fagg set a disqualification hearing, at which Judge Huss testified. The court\u2019s ensuing order concluded that Judge Huss was required to recuse himself and should have been disqualified from presiding over the stipulated settlement. The District Court concluded further that the new judge assigned to the case would need to decide the issues raised by the parties after New York Marine intervened in the case. The court\u2019s order therefore had the effect of vacating all of Judge Huss\u2019s orders after New York Marine intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u00b610 We review judicial disqualification questions de novo. <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 10. Our inquiry requires an objective examination of the circumstances surrounding potential judicial disqualification and an accurate interpretation of the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct. <em>Draggin\u2019 YII, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">\u00b611 <em>1. Whether the District Court correctly concluded that Judge Huss </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number><em>was required, to recuse himself and should have been disqualified.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b612 The District Court issued findings of fact regarding both the Peters\u2019s case and the suit against Judge Huss. The court\u2019s findings related to the Peters\u2019s case focused on the time period following the Peters/Junkermier stipulated settlement. The court also made findings related to the suit against Judge Huss regarding the circumstances and procedural posture of that case and what Judge Huss agreed to under his stipulated settlement. Finally, the court\u2019s findings addressed the overlap in the two stipulated settlements\u2019 timelines. The court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">Judge Huss did not disclose to the litigants in this case the existence of his confessed judgment in favor of [the court reporter], the fact that he had contractually agreed to cooperate in her execution of that judgment against the OCA, or the fact the OCA had challenged the reasonableness of Judge Huss\u2019 stipulated judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b613 The court then reviewed the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct, particularly Rule 2.12(A). Based on its interpretation of the Code and \u201cthe above facts,\u201d the court determined that Judge Huss\u2019s \u201cimpartiality might reasonably have been questioned at the time he presided over and evaluated the stipulated settlement in this litigation, including the December 15, 2014, reasonableness hearing and [New York Marine\u2019s] request for discovery regarding the settlement\u2019s reasonableness.\u201d In making this determination, the court highlighted our observation in <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II </em>that \u201cJudge Huss presided over a hearing in which an insurer questioned the reasonableness of a stipulated settlement while the reasonableness of his own personal stipulated settlement was being questioned by his insurer.\u201d <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 30. The District Court concluded that under \u201cRule 2.12(A) and Montana law, Judge Huss was required to recuse himself and should have been disqualified from presiding over the settlement executed in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">\u00b614 Peters argue on appeal that the District Court erred by concluding that Rule 2.12(A) provided grounds for Judge Huss\u2019s disqualification. Peters contend that the evidence does not reasonably call Judge Huss\u2019s impartiality into question. In support of this position, Peters assert that the OCA\u2019s declaratory judgment action did not affect Judge Huss because he never had any personal or financial interest in the OCA lawsuit, the OCA did not pursue its allegation that the stipulated settlement was unreasonable, and Judge Huss\u2019s interests in the case against him had been resolved by the time New York Marine had moved to intervene in the present case. Relying on <em>Reichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d 455, Peters argue that Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Huss\u2019s interest was \u201ctoo remote, too speculative and too contingent\u201d to warrant disqualification under Rule 2.12. Finally, Peters assert that the District Court relied too heavily on our decision in <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II </em>to conclude that Judge Huss should have disqualified himself, instead of independently reviewing the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\u00b615 Peters rightly point out that we \u201cdeclineldl to address whether Rule 2.12 required Judge Huss to disqualify himself.\u201d <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 23. Instead, we \u201caddres.sledl whether Judge Huss initially should have disclosed the circumstances to the parties.\u201d <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 23. Our comment that \u201cJudge Huss presided over a hearing in which an insurer questioned the reasonableness of a stipulated settlement while the reasonableness of his own personal stipulated settlement was being questioned by his insurer\u201d supported our conclusion that \u201cJudge Huss was required to disclose\u201d to the parties his own recent stipulated settlement. <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 30. The District Court considered this statement, but based its findings of fact and conclusions of law on the evidence introduced following our referral in <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II. </em>The court made specific findings regarding the Peters\u2019s case, the case against Judge Huss, and the overlap between the two cases. The court entered its conclusions of law on the basis of these findings of fact and its interpretation of Rule 2.12. It entered its order on the basis of our instruction to determine whether disqualification was warranted. The District Court did not rely improperly on our decision in <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II </em>in determining that Judge Huss should have disqualified himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b616 Both parties rely on <em>Reichert </em>in arguing their respective positions. In <em>Reichert, </em>we addressed whether Rule 2.12 required four justices to recuse themselves from deciding an issue involving the election of Supreme Court justices. <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 42. Given the nature of the claims, our analysis focused on Rule 2.12(A)(2)(c). <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 41-51. That subsection is one of a number of specific circumstances Rule 2.12 enumerates that might lead to reasonable questions about a judge\u2019s impartiality. M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A). It provides that a judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned when \u201c[t]he judge knows that the judge ... has more than a de minimis interest that could be substantially affected by the proceeding.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A)(2)(c). <em>Reichert </em>thus focused on whether the justices knew they had \u201cmore than a de minimis interest that could be <em>substantially </em>affected by the proceeding.\u201d <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 45 (emphasis in original). In making this determination, we relied on cases from other jurisdictions that \u201creached similar conclusions about the necessary degree of interest\u201d a judge must have in a proceeding to support disqualification. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 46. Disqualification under Rule 2.12(A), however, is \u201cnot limited\u201d to only those circumstances articulated in Rule 2.12(A)(1)-(5). M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A). Rather, the \u201cultimate question\u201d under a Rule 2.12 analysis is whether the judge\u2019s \u201cimpartiality \u2018might reasonably be questioned.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 50 (quoting M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b617 <em>InReichert, </em>we considered the United States Supreme Court\u2019s due process analysis in <em>Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., </em>556 U.S. 868, 129 S. Ct. 2252 (2009), and observed that, \u201c[blecause the codes of judicial conduct provide more protection than due process requires, most disputes over disqualification will be resolved without resort\u201d to constitutional due process considerations. <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 31 (citation and internal quotations omitted). The applicable standards of judicial conduct resolve the question presented in this case. Here, our focus is not whether Judge Huss had a personal \u201cinterest that could be substantially affected by the proceeding,\u201d but instead whether his participation in his personal stipulated settlement could reasonably raise concerns about his impartiality in the instant proceedings. <em>Reichert </em>turned on the application of Rule 2.12(A)(2)(c), under which we concluded that \u201cany biasing influence is too remote, too speculative, and too contingent to mandate recusal.\u201d <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 45. This case involves the overarching principle of impartiality contained in Rule 2.12(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b618 Rule 2.12 governs judicial disqualification under the Code. <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>State v. Dunsmore, </em>2015 MT 108, \u00b6 13, 378 Mont. 514, 347 P.3d 1220; <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 41-42. It provides that \u201c[a] judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A). The comments to Rule 2.12 reiterate that \u201ca judge is disqualified whenever the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12 cmt. [1]. The Code defines \u201cimpartiality\u201d as an \u201cabsence of bias or prejudice in favor of, or against, particular parties or classes of parties, as well as maintenance of an open mind in considering issues that may come before a judge.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Terminology, \u201cImpartiality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b619 Determining whether a party might reasonably question a judge\u2019s impartiality requires an examination of the nature of the judge\u2019s interest in the issues before the judge. M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12; M. C. Jud. Cond., Terminology, \u201cImpartiality.\u201d By definition, an inquiry into whether a judge can remain impartial given the judge\u2019s interest in a particular issue requires an examination of how that interest may affect the judge\u2019s objectivity. M. C. Jud. Cond., Terminology, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\u201cImpartiality\u201d; <em>see Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-30 (concluding that although a judge\u2019s average personal experiences shape the judge\u2019s perspective, such experiences do not \u201cnecessarily preclude a judge from maintaining an \u2018open mind in considering issues that may come before a judge[;]\u2019 \u201d therefore, such experiences \u201cdo not generally lead to reasonable questions about the judge\u2019s impartiality and subsequent disqualification under Rule 2.12\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b620 We are mindful that \u201c[a]n independent, fair, and impartial judiciary is indispensable to our system of justice.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Preamble [1]. We are mindful also that the Code cautions against \u201cI u |nwarranted disqualification\u201d because \u201c[ajlthough there are times when disqualification is necessary to protect the rights of litigants and preserve public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary, judges must be available to decide matters that come before the courts.\u201d <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 29 (quoting M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.1 cmt. [1]); <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 49 (quoting M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.1 cmt. [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b621 As the District Court observed, the procedural posture and circumstances surrounding the stipulated settlement in the Peters\u2019s case are strikingly similar to those surrounding Judge Huss\u2019s personal stipulated settlement. Peters and Junkermier entered into their stipulated settlement without New York Marine\u2019s participation or authorization on November 13,2014. Under the stipulated settlement, Junkermier confessed to a judgment of $10,000,000; it assigned any rights it may have had against New York Marine to Peters; and it agreed to cooperate with Peters in executing the stipulated settlement against New York Marine. Peters agreed under the stipulated settlement not to execute the judgment against Junkermier. New York Marine thereafter intervened, denied liability for the settlement, and contested the stipulated settlement\u2019s reasonableness. Judge Huss held the reasonableness hearing on December 15, 2014, and he issued the order concluding that Peter\u2019s stipulated settlement was reasonable on March 5, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\u00b622 The case against Judge Huss began in February 2014 when his court reporter filed a sexual harassment complaint against him. Similar to Junkermier, Judge Huss requested that his \u201cinsurer\u201d\u2014the OCA\u2014defend and indemnify him against those claims. The OCA paid for Judge Huss\u2019s defense, subject to a reservation of rights, until it concluded that it was not obligated to do so given the nature of the allegations against him. One month before Peters and Junkermier entered into their stipulated settlement, Judge Huss and the court reporter entered into a \u201cStipulation and Confession of Judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Resulting From the State of Montana\u2019s Refusal to Defend and Indemnify.\u201d Judge Huss entered into the stipulated settlement without the OCA\u2019s participation or authorization. Under the stipulated settlement, Judge Huss confessed to a judgment of $744,371; he agreed to cooperate in executing the judgment against the OCA; he assigned his rights against the OCA to the court reporter; and the court reporter agreed not to execute the judgment against Judge Huss in his personal capacity. One month before the reasonableness hearing in the present case, the OCA filed an action seeking a judicial declaration that it was not responsible for Judge Huss\u2019s stipulated settlement. In its complaint, the OCA contested the stipulated settlement\u2019s reasonableness and denied any liability for the settlement. Two weeks after presiding over the reasonableness hearing in the present case, Judge Huss filed an answer to the OCA\u2019s complaint in which he asserted that his own stipulated settlement was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u00b623 At the disqualification hearing before Judge Fagg, Judge Huss acknowledged that the OCA challenged his stipulated settlement, in part, on the ground that the settlement was unreasonable. He testified that he had denied that the settlement was unreasonable and that the OCA continued to question the settlement\u2019s reasonableness until at least February 2015. He agreed that he had bound himself under the stipulated settlement to cooperate in obtaining a judgment against the OCA. He agreed also that the settlement allowed the court reporter to continue her sexual harassment claims against him if he breached his duty to cooperate and that he could be exposed to personal liability. Finally, Judge Huss testified that he remained a party in the OCA\u2019s suit through at least February 2015. Judge Huss did not disclose any information related to the claims against him or his personal stipulated settlement to the parties here.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b624 Peters\u2019s claims that Judge Huss\u2019s interests in the case against him were resolved by the time New York Marine intervened in the present case are belied by the fact that Judge Huss filed his answer to the OCA\u2019s complaint after New York Marine moved to intervene. Judge Huss\u2019s testimony at the disqualification hearing contradicts further Peters\u2019s assertion that Judge Huss did not have any personal or financial interest in the OCA lawsuit. Judge Huss testified that he had a duty to cooperate in obtaining a judgment against the OCA; that if he breached that duty, the sexual harassment claims against him could resume; that resuming the claims would expose him to personal liability; and that he remained involved in the OCA\u2019s action through at least February 2015. The fact that the OCA ultimately did not pursue its allegation that the stipulated settlement was unreasonable does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>change the fact that the OCA continued to question the settlement\u2019s reasonableness while Judge Huss considered the reasonableness of Peters\u2019s and Junkermier\u2019s stipulated settlement. Judge Huss\u2019s ruling came on the heels of filing his answer denying that his settlement was unreasonable, following the reasonableness hearing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b625 Our \u201cobjective examination of the circumstances surrounding [Judge Huss\u2019s] potential judicial disqualification\u201d confirms the District Court\u2019s ruling that Judge Huss\u2019s impartiality reasonably could be questioned. <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 10. Judge Huss continued to have a present and immediate interest in his own personal stipulated settlement after New York Marine intervened in the present case. The nature of Judge Huss\u2019s interest in his personal stipulated settlement raises reasonable questions regarding his \u201cabsence of bias or prejudice in favor of, or against, particular ... classes of parties\u201d\u2014e.g., parties arguing for, or against, the reasonableness of stipulated settlements reached while their insurer\u2019s liability for defense and indemnity remains unsettled. M. C. Jud. Cond., Terminology, \u201cImpartiality.\u201d The circumstances surrounding Judge Huss\u2019s personal stipulated settlement, and the related litigation then pending, also raise reasonable questions about his ability to maintain \u201can open mind in considering\u201d the reasonableness of the stipulated settlement at issue here. M. C. Jud. Cond., Terminology, \u201cImpartiality.\u201d Accordingly, we do not agree with Peters that Judge Huss\u2019s interest was \u201ctoo remote, too speculative, and too contingent\u201d to warrant disqualification under Rule 2.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b626  Based on the District Court\u2019s finding of fact, we agree with its conclusion that Judge Huss\u2019s impartiality in deciding the stipulated settlement\u2019s reasonableness \u201cmight reasonably be questioned.\u201d The District Court correctly held that Judge Huss was required to disqualify himself pursuant to Rule 2.12(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b627 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in vacating Judge Huss\u2019s orders issued after he should have disqualified himself</em></p>\n<p id=\"A1g\">\u00b628 The District Court determined that the \u201cnew judge assigned to this case will need to decide pending discovery issues, the stipulated judgment\u2019s reasonableness, [New York Marine\u2019s] motion to dismiss Peters\u2019 cross-claims, and any other issues which arise.\u201d The District Court\u2019s order thus had the effect of vacating Judge Huss\u2019s orders denying New York Marine\u2019s motions for discovery and for a stay, his order determining that the settlement was reasonable, and the entry of judgment against New York Marine.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u00b629 Peters argue that the District Court erred in vacating Judge Huss\u2019s orders given that the court did not find personal bias or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>prejudice. Peters first point out that we referred the disqualification issue to the District Court to hear the matter pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA. That statute, Peters assert, provides that judicial disqualification may occur \u201conly upon proof of \u2018personal bias or prejudice.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting \u00a7 3-1-805(1), MCA). Peters thus claim that the \u201cpurpose for remanding this case for a hearing under M.C.A. \u00a7 3-1-805(1) was to determine if Judge Huss had demonstrated actual bias or prejudice against [New York Marine].\u201d In further support of their contention, Peters allege that this Court\u2019s caselaw and M. R. Civ. P. 61 prohibited the District Court from vacating Judge Huss\u2019s decisions absent a showing of personal bias or of prejudice to New York Marine\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b630 Peters argue also that Rule 2.12(A) does not provide grounds for vacating a judge\u2019s decisions. Peters contend that New York Marine did not assert that Judge Huss should be disqualified pursuant to Rule 2.12(A)(1), which requires personal bias or prejudice. Rather, Peters assert, New York Marine claimed that Judge Huss should be disqualified under Rule 2.12(A) because there were reasonable questions regarding his impartiality. Peters claim, \u201cA finding that Judge Huss\u2019s impartiality might reasonably have been questioned under Rule 2.12(A) would be legally insufficient to vacate his decisions.\u201d In fact, Peters assert, the Code expressly prohibits using it as a \u201cbasis for litigants to seek to change a judge\u2019s decision.\u201d (Quoting M. C. Jud. Cond., Scope [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b631 Peters misinterpret our rationale in <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II </em>for referring the matter pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA. The statute \u201csets forth a procedure which must be followed when a party believes the presiding judge cannot be fair and impartial in the proceeding.\u201d <em>In re Guardianship &amp; Conservatorship of A.M.M., </em>2016 MT 213, \u00b6 21, 384 Mont. 413, 380 P.3d 736; <em>see Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 22 (\u201cA party also may seek disqualification by invoking the procedures of \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA.\u201d). The ordinary procedure requires a party to \u201cfile an affidavit alleging facts showing personal bias or prejudice of the presiding judge.\u201d Section 3-1-805(1), MCA. If the allegation of bias is made against a district court judge, \u201cthe matter shall be referred to the Montana Supreme Court.\u201d Section 3-1-805(1), MCA. If the affidavit complies with a number of requirements articulated in the statute, \u201cthe Chief Justice shall assign a district judge to hear the matter.\u201d Section 3-1-805(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u00b632 Here, New York Marine alleged on appeal in <em>Draggin\u2019 YII </em>that Judge Huss should have disqualified himself under Rule 2.12 because there were reasonable questions regarding his impartiality. <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 12. We declined \u201cto address whether Rule 2.12 required Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Huss to disqualify himself.\u201d <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 23. We concluded that determining whether Judge Huss should have been disqualified \u201crequireldl findings of fact and conclusions of law following the presentation of evidence.\u201d <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 31. We therefore determined that \u201cthe appropriate course of action [was] to refer the disqualification issue to a district judge to hear the matter pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA.\u201d <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b633 The circumstances are unique and dictated what we determined to be \u201cthe appropriate course of action\u201d in light of the assertions New York Marine made on appeal. <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 31. New York Marine alleged facts raising serious questions about Judge Huss\u2019s impartiality, invoking the possibility of \u201cpersonal bias or prejudice of the presiding [district court] judge.\u201d Section 3-1-805(1), MCA. Because the matter already was before this Court on appeal, we invoked the statute to afford a fact-finding process. <em>Draggin\u2019 YII, </em>\u00b6 31. In accordance with our Opinion, the Chief Justice referred the disqualification issue to the District Court \u201cto hear the matter pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA.\u201d <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b634 We observed <em>in Draggin\u2019 Y II </em>that \u201cRule 2.12 of the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct and \u00a7\u00a7 3-1-803, and -805, MCA, governs [sic] judicial disqualification.\u201d <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 41-51). New York Marine\u2019s allegations\u2014and the majority of our analysis in <em>Draggin\u2019 </em>YII\u2014focused on Rule 2.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b635  The Code establishes rules and standards meant to ensure that parties have their cases decided by an impartial judge. E.g., M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 1.2 (\u201cA judge shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary, and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety.\u201d); M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.2 (\u201cA judge shall uphold and apply the law, and shall perform all duties of judicial office fairly and impartially.\u201d). As such, Rule 2.12 requires that a judge disqualify himself or herself whenever a party might reasonably question the judge\u2019s impartiality\u2014i.e. the judge\u2019s \u201cabsence of bias or prejudice.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A); M. C. Jud. Cond., Terminology, \u201cImpartiality.\u201d The Rule requires no separate showing of actual bias or prejudice. Reasonable questions regarding a judge\u2019s ability to remain impartial inherently raise questions about the party\u2019s right to a fair tribunal. Once it is determined that a judge\u2019s impartiality reasonably has been placed in question, it would be impossible to assess whether the judge\u2019s decision might have been the same had the judge not possessed the disqualifying interest. Prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>is determined by the existence <em>vel non </em>of the interest. We are unpersuaded by Peters\u2019s arguments to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b636 Because disqualification proceedings are premised upon a litigant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair and impartial tribunal, we are unpersuaded by Peters\u2019s contention that a violation of the Code cannot be the basis for vacating a judge\u2019s decision. The Code cautions that it is not \u201cintended to be the basis for litigants to seek to change a judge\u2019s decision.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Scope [1]. The Code does not, however, expressly prohibit a party from invoking its protections to vacate a judge\u2019s orders when the Code requires disqualification. In fact, we have reversed judges\u2019 orders based on our conclusion that a judge should have been disqualified under Rule <em>2.12. Bullman v. State, </em>2014 MT 78, \u00b6 17, 374 Mont. 323, 321 P.3d 121 (reversing a district court\u2019s denial of a postconviction relief petition because a judge \u201cwas required to disqualify himself\u2019 under Rule 2.12); <em>In re B.W.S., </em>2014 MT 198, \u00b6\u00b6 16-19, 376 Mont. 43, 330 P.3d 467 (reversing a termination of parental rights order because the judge \u201cwas required to disqualify himself\u2019 under Rule 2.12).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b637 As we held in <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>Rule 2.12 \u201cundoubtedly requires judges to disqualify themselves if a party might reasonably question their impartiality.\u201d <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 25. The \u201cjudge\u2019s obligation not to hear or decide matters in which disqualification is required applies regardless of whether a motion to disqualify is filed.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12 cmt. [2]. In other words, Rule 2.12 mandates that a judge cannot proceed in a case when disqualification is required under the Rule. Upholding the orders of a judge who should not have heard or decided the matter in the first place is directly contrary to the black-letter standards Rule 2.12 articulates.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b638 Upholding such an order also would run counter to the Code\u2019s Canons, which \u201cprovide important guidance in interpreting the Rules.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Scope [2]. Canon 1 provides that \u201c[a] judge shall uphold and promote the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary, and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Canon 1. Allowing a judge\u2019s order to stand when the judge should have been disqualified because his impartiality might reasonably have been questioned does not \u201cuphold and promote the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Canon 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\u00b639 We based our holding in <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II </em>that \u201ca judge should disclose information that is relevant to a possible motion for disqualification\u201d under Rule 2.12, in part, on our determination that disclosure \u201cadvances one of the Code\u2019s fundamental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>purposes\u2014promoting confidence in the judiciary.\u201d <em>Draggin\u2019 Y II, </em>\u00b6 25. Vacating the orders of a judge whose impartiality reasonably has been questioned similarly promotes confidence in the judiciary. Analogously, we have accepted supervisory control to decide a substitution of judge question under \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, in part because allowing the matter to proceed \u201cmay cause uncertainty as to the validity of the District Court judge\u2019s involvement and decisions in this matter.\u201d <em>Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. v. Mont. Second Judicial District Ct., </em>2002 MT 83, \u00b6 8, 309 Mont. 289, 46 P.3d 606; <em>see also </em>M. R. App. P. 6(3)(k) (allowing immediate appeal in a civil case of an order granting or denying a motion for substitution of judge); M. R. App. P. 14(3)(c) (allowing supervisory control over a court that has granted or denied a motion for substitution of a judge in a criminal case).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\u00b640  We conclude that the District Court did not err in relying on Rule 2.12 to vacate Judge Huss\u2019s orders after he should have disqualified himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b641 We affirm the District Court\u2019s order concluding that Judge Huss should have disqualified himself and vacating the orders issued after he should have done so.

In <em>Berdahl, </em>we held that the stipulated settlement was not enforceable against the State because Judge Huss entered into the settlement without the State\u2019s consent in violation of Montana statute. <em>Berdahl, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
