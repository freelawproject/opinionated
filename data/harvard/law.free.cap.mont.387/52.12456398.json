Harrison sought to dismiss the resulting tampering with evidence charge. The District Court denied her motion and a jury convicted Harrison of tampering with evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">\u00b62 A Missoula police officer pulled Harrison over in September 2013 after observing her driving at night with no headlights. After making contact with Harrison and observing various signs of intoxication, the officer administered preliminary field sobriety tests. Harrison failed the tests, and the officer asked her to take a preliminary breath test, which she refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">\u00b63 The officer placed Harrison under arrest and transported her to the police station, where the officer applied for a telephonic search warrant to obtain a blood sample from Harrison. After obtaining the warrant, the officer transported Harrison to the hospital for a blood draw. There, the officer removed Harrison\u2019s handcuffs to facilitate the blood draw. While the officer was filling out paperwork, Harrison fled. She was not located until the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">\u00b64 The State charged Harrison with tampering with or fabricating physical evidence in violation of \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA. The charge was based on Harrison\u2019s leaving the hospital and thereby preventing a blood sample from being drawn. Harrison sought dismissal of the tampering charge on the ground that blood is not evidence until it is removed from the body. She relied on our decision in <em>State v. Peplow, </em>2001 MT 253, 307 Mont. 172, 36 P.3d 922, to support her position.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">\u00b65 The District Court denied Harrison\u2019s motion. Harrison renewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>her motion following the State\u2019s presentation of evidence, and the District Court again denied it. The jury found Harrison guilty. The court sentenced Harrison to a period of four years with all four years suspended for the tampering count. Harrison appeals her conviction and sentence for tampering.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s decision on a motion to dismiss in a criminal case de novo. <em>State v. Nelson, </em>2014 MT 135, \u00b6 16, 375 Mont. 164, 334 P.3d 345. When the dismissal is based upon the interpretation or construction of a statute, we determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation or construction is correct as a matter of law. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">\u00b67 <em>Whether the District Court erred in concluding that Harrison\u2019s blood, while still within her body, constituted physical evidence subject to tampering.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\u00b68 The District Court found Harrison\u2019s arguments for dismissing the tampering count \u201cpretty compelling,\u201d but it \u201cvacillated back the other way\u201d after considering the State\u2019s brief. After noting that there had recently \u201cbeen a change in the law,\u201d the court opined that this was \u201can issue that ought to be resolved\u201d by this Court. The court concluded that it was \u201cgoing to let this evidence go forward,\u201d and that it would \u201cgo forward on all three counts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">\u00b69 On appeal, Harrison asserts that our holding in <em>Peplow </em>controls. She contends that legislative changes to the implied consent statutes do not alter our ruling in that case. Harrison accordingly argues that the District Court erred in not dismissing the tampering charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">\u00b610 The State counters by contending that <em>Peplow </em>is factually distinguishable from the instant case and was limited to the specific issue we considered in that case. Thus, the State asserts that <em>Peplow </em>is inapplicable. The State argues that even if <em>Peplow </em>is applicable, it is no longer controlling given amendments to the relevant statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">\u00b611 In <em>Peplow, </em>the defendant was charged with tampering with evidence under \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA. <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 11. The tampering charge was based on the fact that the defendant consumed alcohol following an accident and prior to his blood alcohol level being tested. <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 11. We framed the issue as whether \u201cconsuming alcohol after a vehicle accident constitute^] tampering with physical evidence under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u00a7 45-7-207, <em>MCA.\" Peplow, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b612 Section 45-7-207, MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">A person commits the offense of tampering with or fabricating physical evidence if, believing that an official proceeding or investigation is pending or about to be instituted, the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">(a) alters, destroys, conceals, or removes any record, document, or thing with purpose to impair its verity or availability in the proceeding or investigationf.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Section 45-7-207(1)(a), MCA. We noted in <em>Peplow </em>that while \u201cphysical evidence\u201d is not defined in the tampering statute, \u201cevidence\u201d is defined in \u00a7 26-1-101(2), MCA. <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 21. That section defines \u201cevidence\u201d as \u201cthe means of ascertaining in a judicial proceeding the truth respecting a question of fact, including but not limited to witness testimony, writings, physical objects, or other things presented to the senses.\u201d Section 26-1-101(2), MCA. Reading the tampering statute together with the statutory definition of evidence, we clarified that the specific issue to be decided in <em>Peplow </em>was \u201cwhether a person\u2019s blood alcohol content, as it exists inside their body and within their control, constitutes \u2018physical evidence,\u2019 or a \u2018thing presented to the senses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 22 (quoting \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA, and \u00a7 26-1-101(2), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">\u00b613 In concluding that blood within an individual\u2019s body does not constitute physical evidence or a thing presented to the senses, we emphasized that \u201cevidence of alcohol or drugs in a person must be \u2018shown by an analysis of the person\u2019s blood or breath\u2019 for it to be admissible.\u201d <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 25 (quoting \u00a7 61-8-404, MCA). \u201cStated otherwise,\u201d we clarified, one\u2019s blood alcohol level \u201cis not evidence until it exists in a state capable of analysis.\u201d <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 25. We pronounced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abu\">Section 61-8-404, MCA, clearly does not contemplate that potentially measurable amounts of alcohol, still within the human body, constitute evidence. Until one\u2019s breath or blood has been obtained or collected for analysis, it simply cannot be considered \u201cphysical evidence,\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA, or a \u201cthing presented to the senses,\u201d as explained in \u00a7 26-1-101(2), MCA. Because a person\u2019s blood alcohol level cannot be determined until he or she expels either a sample of blood, air, or urine, such fluids simply cannot be considered physical evidence prior to being removed from the body. We therefore conclude that physical evidence of one\u2019s alcohol content is limited to that which is collected for analysis of the person\u2019s blood or breath, under \u00a7 61-8-404, MCA. One\u2019s blood, and blood alcohol level, while still within his body, simply is not physical evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-10\"><em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 26. Such a conclusion, we stressed, \u201cavoids absurd results.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 27. We thus held that \u201cthe District Court erred when it held that Peplow\u2019s [blood alcohol level], while still within his body, constituted physical evidence subject to illegal tampering.\u201d <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u00b614 The State\u2019s contentions that the facts and issue presented in <em>Peplow </em>limit its application are misplaced. The fact that Peplow drank following an accident and prior to having his blood alcohol level tested did not prove central to our ultimate conclusion that \u201c[o]ne\u2019s blood, and blood alcohol level, while still within his body, simply is not physical evidence.\u201d Peplow, \u00b6 26. Similarly, the fact that we initially framed the issue as whether \u201cconsuming alcohol after a vehicle accident constitute^] tampering with physical evidence under \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA,\u201d did not confine our final holding that \u201cthe District Court erred when it held that Peplow\u2019s [blood alcohol level], while still within his body, constituted physical evidence subject to illegal tampering.\u201d <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 28. We are further unpersuaded by the State\u2019s assertion that these explicit conclusions following detailed analysis are dicta.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u00b615 Contrary to the State\u2019s argument, the Legislature\u2019s amendments to the implied consent statute, \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, and the statute defining what may be seized with a search warrant, \u00a7 46-5-224(1), MCA, do not impact <em>Peplow\u2019s </em>authority here. The issue <em>Peplow </em>addressed\u2014and the issue on appeal here\u2014is whether an individual\u2019s blood, while still in her body, constitutes \u201cphysical evidence\u201d under \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA. <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22, 28. While we cited other statutes in addressing this question\u2014including \u00a7 61-8-402(1), MCA\u2014our holding that blood inside an individual\u2019s body does not constitute evidence subject to tampering rested on our interpretation of \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA, the definition of \u201cevidence\u201d under \u00a7 26-1-101(2), MCA, and what constitutes admissible evidence under \u00a7 61-8-404(1)(a), MCA. <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-26. The relevant portions of those statutes have not been amended since our decision in <em>Peplow.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u00b616 The Legislature has enacted provisions allowing officers to obtain a search warrant for a driver\u2019s blood in certain circumstances. Section 46-5-224(1), MCA\u2014which the State emphasizes heavily\u2014now provides that a \u201cwarrant may be issued under this section to search for and seize any... evidence, including blood samples that may yield evidence of any measured amount or detected presence of alcohol or drugs in a person\u2019s body when subjected to testing.\u201d This statute makes plain that blood samples may be seized pursuant to a search warrant. That does not, however, change what constitutes \u201cevidence\u201d in the first place. For starters, blood is not a \u201csample\u201d until it is withdrawn. Plus, the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>language references blood samples \u201cthat <em>may yield </em>evidence.\u201d Section 46-5-224(1), MCA (emphasis added). Finally, lack of a search warrant to draw Peplow\u2019s blood was not pertinent to our conclusion that \u201c[ofee\u2019s blood, and blood alcohol level, <em>while still within his body, </em>simply is not physical evidence.\u201d <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 26 (emphasis added). The State\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\u00b617  The State does not ask us to overrule <em>Peplow. </em>We hold that <em>Peplow </em>is dispositive in the present case. Its language affords but one interpretation. Until Harrison\u2019s blood was \u201cobtained or collected for analysis, it simply [could not] be considered \u2018physical evidence\u2019 as set forth in \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA, or a \u2018thing presented to the senses,\u2019 as explained in \u00a7 26-1-101(2), MCA.\u201d <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 26. Because Harrison\u2019s \u201cblood alcohol level cannot be determined until... she expels either a sample of blood, air, or urine, such fluids simply cannot be considered physical evidence prior to being removed from the body.\u201d <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 26. Consistent with this precedent, we conclude that \u201cphysical evidence of [Harrison\u2019s] alcohol content is limited to that which is collected for analysis of [her] blood or breath.\u201d <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u00b618  Finally, we reject the State\u2019s argument that a ruling in Harrison\u2019s favor will tie the hands of law enforcement in conducting investigations. As noted, the law authorizes a search warrant to obtain blood samples to detect the presence of alcohol or drugs. Section 46-5-224(1), MCA. Harrison\u2019s actions at the hospital to evade the ordered blood draw resulted in her conviction for escape, and conceivably could have garnered an additional charge for obstructing a peace officer under \u00a7 45-7-302, MCA. In other words, there are specific statutory tools to ensure accountability for offenders who impede lawful investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">\u00b619  We conclude that the District Court erred in denying Harrison\u2019s motion to dismiss when it determined that Harrison\u2019s blood, \u201cwhile still within [her] body, constituted physical evidence subject to illegal tampering.\u201d <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 28. We reverse Harrison\u2019s conviction for tampering with evidence and remand for entry of judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b81-9\">JUSTICES SHEA, SANDEFUR and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-15\"> The jury also convicted Harrison of driving under the influence and escape. Harrison does not challenge those convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b81-10\">JUSTICE WHEAT,</author>\n<p id=\"AWn\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">\u00b620 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision reversing the District Court\u2019s denial of Harrison\u2019s motion to dismiss the tampering with evidence charge brought against her after she fled the hospital to avoid having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>her blood drawn pursuant to a lawful warrant. I conclude the factual distinctions in <em>Peplow </em>are significant and render <em>Peplow </em>inapposite authority for the case before us. Additionally, the 2011 legislative changes to the statutes applied in <em>Peplow </em>and applicable to the case at bar require a new analysis and application to the facts currently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b621 As noted by the majority, Peplow, after crashing his vehicle, left the scene of the accident before officers arrived. As Peplow walked along the road and away from the accident scene, a passing couple asked if he needed assistance but he declined. The couple called 9-1-1 and reported the accident and their suspicion that Peplow was intoxicated. Peplow went home, consumed alcohol, left home, went to a tavern, and consumed more alcohol. It was at the tavern that Montana Highway Patrol Officer Tom Hamilton, the officer dispatched to investigate the accident, located Peplow approximately 1 to 1.5 hours after the accident. Hamilton conducted a Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test which indicated Peplow was highly impaired. Subsequent detention center tests indicated that Peplow was intoxicated with a .202 blood alcohol level.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u00b622 Unlike the facts in <em>Peplow, </em>Harrison was pulled over for driving at night with no headlights. The officer, after observing signs of intoxication, conducted field sobriety tests that indicated that Harrison was intoxicated. Of the eighteen indicators measured in field sobriety tests, Harrison displayed fifteen indicators of impairment. After she refused to provide a preliminary breath test, she was arrested. She subsequently withdrew her implied consent to provide a blood sample. Based upon Harrison\u2019s extensive DUI history, the arresting officer obtained a telephonic warrant to collect a blood sample from Harrison pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, and transported her to the hospital for the blood draw procedure. While the officer was completing the necessary paperwork, Harrison fled the hospital and hid until the following day at which time blood test results were no longer relevant to her charge of DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\u00b623 A significant and critical factual distinction between <em>Peplow </em>and the case before us is that when Peplow went home after the accident and drank three double shots of whiskey, went to the tavern and began drinking a beer, he was not under lawful arrest, in custody, or subject to a warrant obtained in accordance with statutory requirements. No officer had observed Peplow or performed field sobriety tests to determine whether he was impaired or intoxicated at the time of the accident. Moreover, there was no judicial determination\u2014through application for and acquisition of a warrant\u2014that evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>impairment existed prior to Peplow altering his blood alcohol content by consuming alcohol after the accident. Consequently, our ruling that consuming alcohol after a vehicle accident did not constitute tampering with physical evidence was the correct ruling in <em>Peplow. </em>That narrow ruling, however, does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b624 The <em>Peplow </em>Court was constrained in its interpretation and application of certain relevant statutes by both the facts in <em>Peplow </em>as well as the language of the statutes as they existed at that time. I acknowledge that the tampering with evidence statute applied in <em>Peplow, </em>\u00a7 45-7-207, MCA, with the exception of two minor word changes in 2009, is identical to the statute applied in this case. When the <em>Peplow </em>Court analyzed the tampering statute, it noted that the words \u201cphysical evidence\u201d were not defined in the criminal code. Consequently, it turned to the general definition of \u201cevidence\u201d set forth in the Montana Rules of Evidence, and while the definition of \u201cevidence\u201d contained \u201cthings presented to the senses,\u201d the <em>Peplow </em>Court concluded that blood alcohol content (BAC) within the body did not constitute such a \u201cthing.\u201d <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u00b625 Subsequent to <em>Peplow, </em>the Montana Legislature revised parts of the criminal code and the motor vehicle statutes, including \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, and \u00a7 46-5-224, MCA. At the time <em>Peplow </em>was decided, \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, the \u201cimplied consent\u201d statute in the Motor Vehicles title of the Montana statutes, did not include a section authorizing law enforcement officers to apply for a search warrant to collect a blood sample if the arrested person refused to agree to a blood draw. In 2011, the Legislature added subsection (5) which provides in relevant part, \u201cIf the arrested person has refused to provide a ... blood ... sample under 61-8-409 ... the officer may apply for a search warrant to be issued pursuant to 46-5-224 to collect a sample of the person\u2019s blood for testing.\u201d Section 61-8-402(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\u00b626 A search warrant requires a neutral third party\u2014a judge or magistrate\u2014to assess the evidence presented by law enforcement to determine the existence of probable cause. In this case, the arresting officer obtained a telephonic warrant after a judge determined probable cause existed and that a blood test was relevant evidence and warranted based upon the results of Harrison\u2019s field sobriety tests and the officer\u2019s observations. At the time the warrant was issued, Harrison became obligated to allow a blood draw. As noted by the Arizona Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Clary, </em>2 P.3d 1255, \u00b6 16 (Ariz. 2000), \u201cA search warrant is a court order that authorizes police to intrude into an individual\u2019s privacy.\u201d In <em>Clary, </em>the court described BAC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>evidence as \u201ccritical and often dispositive in DUI cases,\u201d and concluded that a warrant for a blood draw in a DUI case could be executed through the use of reasonable force if necessary. <em>Clary, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19 and 28 n. 5. Decisions such as <em>Clary </em>illustrate the significance of the power of the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b627 Also in 2011, the Legislature amended \u00a7 46-5-224, MCA. Prior to that amendment \u00a7 46-5-224, MCA, provided that \u201cA warrant may be issued under this section to search for and seize any: (1) evidence; (2) contraband, or (3) person for whose arrest there is probable cause, for whom there has been a warrant of arrest issued, or who is unlawfully restrained.\u201d After 2011, \u00a7 46-5-224(1), MCA, provides: \u201cevidence, including blood samples that may yield evidence of any measured amount or detected presence of alcohol or drugs in a person\u2019s body when subjected to testing.\u201d With this revision, the Legislature declared that \u201cevidence\u201d seizable by search warrant included a blood sample drawn to ascertain a person\u2019s BAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u00b628 I conclude that these legislative revisions state that a blood sample is \u201cevidence\u201d that may be specified in a search warrant; consequently, such blood evidence is \u201cphysical evidence\u201d and a \u201cthing\u201d that may not be tampered with. This interpretation comports with our rule of statutory construction that \u201cspecific provisions prevail over general provisions.\u201d <em>State v. Plouffe, </em>2014 MT 183, \u00b6 27, 375 Mont. 429, 329 P.3d 1255. In other words, relying on the revised specific provisions in the criminal procedure and DUI statutes is more appropriate than relying on the general evidence statutes as was required in <em>Peplow.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u00b629 I therefore conclude that under the facts in this case, Harrison\u2019s blood alcohol content within her body became evidence upon her arrest and the issuance of the search warrant. It also became a \u201cthing\u201d with which she was not allowed to tamper. This is not a novel conclusion. <em>See, e.g., Botka v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139062, 2012 WL 4466489 (Fla.), in which the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division, applying a statute almost identical to our tampering statute, found that a \u201cperson\u2019s blood alcohol level does constitute a \u2018thing\u2019 for purposes of the Tampering with Evidence statues [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">\u00b630 I agree with the majority that in cases involving an escapee or other offender who impedes lawful investigations, law enforcement may charge him or her with escape and/or obstructing a peace officer, in addition to the original underlying charge or charges. However, for the reasons set forth in this Dissent, I believe under circumstances such as those presented in this case, our statutes support being able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>charge the offender with tampering with physical evidence as well.</p>\n<p id=\"AjT\">\u00b631 For these reasons, I would affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Harrison\u2019s motion to dismiss the evidence tampering charge. I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b85-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH and JUSTICE McKINNON join the Dissent of JUSTICE WHEAT.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
