We conclude the order\u2019s factual findings are deficient and remand for entry of an amended order in compliance with the express requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-127 and -128(1)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\"><em>Did the District Court\u2019s findings of fact meet the statutory requirements regarding alternative placement </em>options?</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">\u00b62 D.L.B. has suffered from paranoid schizophrenia since his diagnosis at age 22 following a psychotic break. Now 76 years old, D.L.B.\u2019s long history of mental illness includes numerous involuntarily psychiatric hospitalizations in Washington and Montana. When his disorder was not well managed by medication, D.L.B. became unable to meet and maintain his most basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, and safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">\u00b63 On March 24, 2015, D.L.B. was transferred to the Nursing Care Center from the Montana State Hospital (MSH). Within 90 days of the transfer, certified mental health professional Susan Stevens, M.S., L.M.F.T., petitioned to extend D.L.B.\u2019s commitment. Following an evidentiary hearing, the District Court recommitted D.L.B. to the Nursing Care Center for up to six months. D.L.B. appealed and this Court affirmed. <em>In re D.L.B. (D.L.B. I), </em>2017 MT 1, \u00b6 20, 386 Mont. 180, 389 P.3d 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">\u00b64 On December 18, 2015, Stevens petitioned for a second extended commitment on the ground that D.L.B. continued to suffer from a mental disorder requiring evaluation and treatment. The District Court appointed counsel and designated D.L.B.\u2019s sister as his court-appointed \u201cfriend.\u201d At a contested hearing on January 22, 2016, Stacie Klemo, registered nurse supervisor at the Nursing Care Center, testified at length regarding D.L.B.\u2019s mental disorder, daily assistance needs, and general treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">\u00b65 Susan Stevens evaluated D.L.B.\u2019s condition at the time of the hearing as declining, depressed, and delusional. Stevens testified that D.L.B.\u2019s history of medication noncompliance reflected his near total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>lack of insight regarding his mental illness. Stevens described a recurring pattern where D.L.B.\u2019s psychiatric condition would stabilize during an involuntary hospitalization but then destabilize upon discharge due to medication noncompliance. Without daily medication, D.L.B.\u2019s disorder would spiral out of control, causing rapid decompensation and renewed need for involuntary inpatient treatment. Stevens analyzed the alternative placements available and testified that, while D.L.B. experienced a serious and chronic mental illness, he did not require the acute level of care provided at MSH. However, according to Stevens, D.L.B.\u2019s history demonstrated an inability to successfully manage in a community placement, even with extensive support services. Stevens further ruled out nursing home care due to D.L.B.\u2019s active psychosis and because nursing homes cannot administer involuntary medication when needed. Stevens thus concluded that the Nursing Care Center was the least restrictive placement for effective treatment of D.L.B. At the hearing, D.L.B. contrarily stated he would rather live in a nursing home than remain at the Nursing Care Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b66 At the close of the hearing, the District Court entered oral findings of fact from the bench that D.L.B. required recommitment, the Nursing Care Center was the least restrictive placement for effective treatment, and involuntary administration of necessary medication was in his best interest. On February 9, 2016, the Court entered written findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order recommitting D.L.B. for involuntary mental health treatment at the Nursing Care Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u00b67 We review involuntary civil commitment orders to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law are correct. <em>In re S.M., </em>2014 MT 309, \u00b6 13, 377 Mont. 133, 339 P.3d 23. Upon review of involuntary commitment proceedings, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>In re </em>G.M., 2007 MT 100, \u00b6 12, 337 Mont. 116, 157 P.3d 687 (citation omitted). Whether a district court\u2019s findings of fact satisfy statutory requirements is a question of law reviewed for correctness. <em>S.M., </em>\u00b6 13; <em>In re Mental Health </em>of E.P.B., 2007 MT 224, \u00b6 5, 339 Mont. 107, 168 P.3d 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\"><em>Did the District Court\u2019s findings of fact meet the statutory requirements regarding alternative placement </em>options?</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">\u00b68 Title 53, chapter 21, MCA, sets forth specific procedural and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>substantive requirements for involuntary civil commitment proceedings. No later than two weeks before an involuntary commitment expires, the responsible professional may petition the court to extend commitment upon a specified showing of need for the extension. Section 53-21-128(1)(a), MCA. Except for the right to a jury trial, the extension procedure \u201cmust be the same in all respects as the procedure\u201d required for an initial mental health commitment. Section 53-21-128(1)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b69 If the court finds on hearing that the respondent \u201ccontinues to suffer from a mental disorder and to require commitment\u201d under any of the substantive criteria of \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, then \u201cthe court shall order commitment\u201d in accordance with \u00a7 53-21-127, MCA. Section 53-21-128(1)(d), MCA. At a separate dispositional hearing, the court must determine the least restrictive placement for effective treatment from the alternatives specified in \u00a7 53-21-127(3), MCA. Sections 53-21-127(5) and -128(1)(d), MCA. The selected placement alternative must be based on a \u201ccomprehensive individualized plan of treatment.\u201d Section 53-21-128(1)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b610  Whether \u201cstated on the record\u201d or by written \u201copinion or memorandum of decision,\u201d district courts must generally make findings of fact and conclusions of law stating the factual and legal bases for decisions in civil matters. M. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(1). In extending a prior involuntary mental health commitment, district courts must make specific findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">(1) stating in detail \u201cthe facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment\u201d under the commitment criteria of \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-126, - 127(8)(a), and -128(1)(d), MCA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">(2) describing \u201cwhat alternatives for treatment of the [respondent] are available,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-127(8)(c) and -128(1)(d), MCA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">(3) describing \u201cwhat [treatment] alternatives were investigated,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-127(8)00 and -128(1)(d), MCA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">(4) describing \u201cwhy the investigated alternatives were not found suitable,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-127(8)(d) and -128(1)(d), MCA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-11\">(5) stating \u201cthe name of the [selected] facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and supervision of the respondent\u2019s treatment,\u201d \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(e), MCA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-12\">(6) stating the specific term of the extended commitment, \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-127(3) and -128(1)(d), MCA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-13\">(7) determining which of the placement alternatives considered is \u201cthe least restrictive alternative to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective treatment,\u201d \u00a7 53-21-127(5), MCA; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>(8) stating, as applicable, \u201cthe reason inpatient treatment was chosen from among other alternatives,\u201d \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(f), MCA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">(9) finding, as applicable, \u201cthat the respondent meets the [Montana Mental Health Nursing Care Center] admission criteria\u201d and, if so, that the Nursing Care Center superintendent \u201chas issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission,\u201d \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(g), MCA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">(10) finding \u201cthat a comprehensive individualized plan of treatment\u201d exists for the respondent in the selected placement, \u00a7 53-21-128(1)(d), MCA; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">(11) stating, as applicable, \u201cthe reason involuntary medication was chosen from among other alternatives,\u201d \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(h), MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Due to the profound impact of involuntary commitment on the fundamental liberty interests of persons suffering from mental disorders, district courts must strictly comply with all procedural and substantive requirements for involuntary mental health commitments, including required findings of fact, regardless of \u201cthe commonly urgent nature\u201d of these proceedings. <em>D.L.B. I, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>In re B.D., </em>2015 MT 339, \u00b6 7, 381 Mont. 505, 362 P.3d 636. At a minimum, omission of required findings of fact warrants remand for statutory compliance. <em>In re Mental Health of D.S., </em>2005 MT 152, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21, 327 Mont. 391, 114 P.3d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">\u00b611 D.L.B. does not dispute on appeal the District Court\u2019s general findings under \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-126, -127, and -128(1)(d), MCA, that he continued to suffer from a mental disorder requiring continued treatment for up to one year. Though he questions why the professionals who testified at the hearing did not consider a potential family placement with his sister, D.L.B. also does not challenge the court\u2019s finding that the Nursing Care Center was the least restrictive placement option. Rather, he merely challenges the sufficiency of the District Court\u2019s written findings of fact and seeks remand for entry of an amended recommitment order with required statutory findings. \u00b612 In response, the State first asserts that D.L.B.\u2019s appeal is moot because his recommitment to the Nursing Care Center began on January 22, 2016, and expired before the completion of appellate briefing in this matter. D.L.B. contrarily asserts that his challenge of the statutory sufficiency of the order falls \u201cunder the \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review\u2019 exception to the mootness doctrine.\u201d <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>In re J.S.W., </em>2013 MT 34, \u00b6 11, 369 Mont. 12, 303 P.3d 741. We agree with D.L.B. Apparently due to the urgent nature of these proceedings, facially deficient involuntary commitment orders continue to come before this Court and are indeed likely to reoccur. Thus, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>conclude that the issue raised by D.L.B. falls within the exception to the mootness doctrine as a matter capable of repetition otherwise likely to evade review.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b613 Pursuant to our doctrine of implied findings, the State next asserts that the District Court\u2019s written order is minimally sufficient in light of its bench findings and the record evidence. Under that doctrine, otherwise facially insufficient findings of fact may be minimally sufficient if, within the scope of the express findings made, more specific findings of fact \u201cnecessary to the determination\u201d can be clearly inferred from other express findings or the evidentiary record. <em>In re S.G.R., </em>2016 MT 70, \u00b6\u00b6 20-24, 383 Mont. 74, 368 P.3d 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\u00b614 However, the implied findings doctrine is not unlimited. This Court will not imply otherwise essential findings if the implied findings would be \u201cinconsistent with express findings made.\u201d <em>Interstate Brands Corp. v. Cannon, </em>218 Mont. 380, 385, 708 P.2d 573, 576 (1985). Further, the implied findings doctrine may apply to satisfy express statutory requirements for involuntary commitments only if specific evidence referenced in other express findings clearly supports the implied statutory finding. <em>Compare S.G.R., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-24 (required \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(a) finding on \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-126(1) and -128(1)(d) requirements for necessity of continued treatment supported by other findings referencing specific evidence clearly showing need for commitment), <em>and In re Mental Health of S.C., </em>2000 MT 370, \u00b6\u00b6 12-15, 303 Mont. 444, 15 P.3d 861 (required \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(h) finding on need for involuntary medication \u201cabundantly clear from\u201d other \u201cdetailed findings\u201d), <em>with In re L.L.A., </em>2011 MT 285, \u00b6\u00b6 13-22, 362 Mont. 464, 267 P.3d 1 (findings couched in terms of statutory language without specific reference to the respondent\u2019s circumstances and relevant behaviors insufficient to support \u00a7 53-21-126(1) finding), <em>G.M., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-23 (conclusory restatement of statutory criteria and vague reference to witness testimony insufficient), <em>and </em>D.S., \u00b6 21 (insufficient description of placement and treatment alternatives considered under \u00a7 53-21-127(3) and (5), MCA). We will not stretch the doctrine of implied findings to remedy commitment orders that are \u201cbeyond hare-bones\u2019 [or] \u2018spartan.\u2019 <em>\u201dIn re C.C., </em>2016 MT 174, \u00b6 23, 384 Mont. 135, 376 P.3d 105 (insufficient findings containing \u201cno detailed facts and recountfing] no testimony ... specific to [the respondent\u2019s] condition, symptoms, or actions\u201d). District courts must strictly comply with the detailed findings requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-127(8) and -128(1)(d), MCA. <em>D.L.B. </em>I, \u00b6 17; C.C., \u00b6 23; B.D., \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\u00b615 In this case, the District Court\u2019s recommitment order set forth a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>prefatory summary of relevant testimony from mental health professional Susan Stevens and Nursing Care Center registered nursing supervisor Stacie Klemo regarding D.L.B.\u2019s diagnosed mental disorder (schizophrenia), symptoms (delusional/irrational thinking), related threatening and aggressive behavior, history of refusing medication, and related inability to meet or provide for his own basic needs. The summary further referenced Stevens\u2019 unrebutted opinion that the Nursing Care Center \u201cis the least restrictive placement until a new placement can be arranged.\u201d The Court\u2019s summary closely corresponds to the witnesses\u2019 unrebutted testimony on the hearing record.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b616 As to placement alternatives considered and the most appropriate and least restrictive placement selected, Ms. Stevens testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">I ... determined that [D.L.B.] did not need a more restrictive environment such as the State Hospital. That is for more acute illness. He has a chronic illness and the [Nursing Care Center] is handling his care in a safe manner ... I ruled out nursing home care due to his psychosis as well as their... inability to administer medications involuntarily. At this time there is no family member available to care for him due to his inability to meet his own basic needs. Therefore, I determined that the least restrictive environment was the [Nursing Care Center].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">At the close of hearing, the District Court accordingly made the following bench findings and order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">Then based on the testimony of Ms. Stevens and the record in this matter the Court will find for the reasons previously stated that commitment is necessary. The Court will also find for the reasons previously stated that the [Nursing Care Center] is the least restrictive placement for [D.L.B.] to receive the help that he needs. The Court will then grant the petition for recommitment and recommit [D.L.B.] to the [Nursing Care Center] for a period of up to one year unless sooner released. And we will grant to the facility the ability to administer medications involuntarily if needed for [D.L.B.\u2019s] best interests and health reasons, for his protection and the protection of other residents and staff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Apart from its prefatory summary of the evidence, the District Court\u2019s subsequent written recommitment order set forth nine findings of fact. The only express findings addressing D.L.B.\u2019s need for continued commitment and the selected placement alternative were conclusory Finding Nos. 6 and 7, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">6. Testimony from the Petitioner, Sue Stevens, verified that commitment is necessary for D.L.B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>7. The most appropriate and least restrictive placement for D.L.B. is the Montana Mental Health Nursing [Care] Center (MMHNCC).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u00b617 We cannot apply our implied findings doctrine in derogation of express statutory requirements for specific findings of fact. D.S., \u00b6\u00b6 19-21. The statutorily required findings of fact for extension of a prior involuntary mental health commitment include, <em>inter alia, </em>specific findings describing or stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">(1) \u201cwhat [treatment] alternatives were investigated,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-127(8)(b) and -128(1)(d), MCA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">(2) \u201cwhat alternatives for treatment of the [respondent] are available,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-127(8)(c) and -128(1)(d), MCA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">(3) \u201cwhy the investigated alternatives were not found suitable,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-127(8)(d) and -128(1)(d), MCA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">(4) as applicable, \u201cthe reason inpatient treatment was chosen from among other alternatives,\u201d \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(f), MCA; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">(5) as applicable, \u201cthat the respondent meets the admission criteria\u201d of the [Montana Mental Health Nursing Care Center] and, if so, that the superintendent \u201chas issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission,\u201d \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(g), MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">\u00b618 In <em>D.L.B. I, S.G.R., </em>and <em>S.C. </em>we applied our implied findings doctrine to affirm involuntary commitment and recommitment orders that lacked specific, statutorily required findings of fact where, unlike here, <em>other written and oral findings </em>clearly implicated the required statutory findings. <em>See D.L.B. I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-20, <em>S.G.R., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-24; and <em>S.C., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-15. In contrast, in <em>D.S., </em>we reversed an otherwise proper involuntary commitment where the district court\u2019s findings of fact were devoid of any express finding, or basis for an implied finding, stating in detail the required factual bases for the court\u2019s finding that commitment was necessary under \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, or the placement alternatives considered under \u00a7 53-21-127(3) and (5), MCA. <em>D.S., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">\u00b619  Here, as in D.S., the District Court\u2019s express written findings, including the prefatory summary of the evidence and bench findings on the hearing record, are simply devoid of express detailed findings, or bases for implied findings, as required by \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-127(8)(b), (c), (d), (f), and -128(1)(d), MCA, as to the treatment alternatives investigated, available, and found not suitable. Also missing are \u201cthe reason inpatient treatment was chosen from among other alternatives,\u201d whether D.L.B. met the Nursing Care Center admission criteria, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>verification that the Center\u2019s superintendent had authorized a specific admission date and time in writing as required by \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(g), MCA. While nearly all of this detailed information is present and unrebutted in the hearing record,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> application of our implied findings doctrine to remedy these technical deficiencies in the District Court\u2019s written and oral findings of fact would effectively override and disregard the express statutory mandates of \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-127(8)(b), (c), (d), (f), (g), and -128(1)(d), MCA. We cannot stretch our implied findings doctrine that far.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b620  We hold that the District Court\u2019s recommitment order does not minimally comply the specific findings requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-127(8)(b), (c), (d), (f), (g), and -128(1)(d), MCA. Therefore, we hereby remand for entry of an amended recommitment order including those required findings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b355-7\">JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b355-8\">JUSTICE McKINNON, specially concurring.</judges>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">\u00b621 I agree that the District Court\u2019s factual findings are insufficient to satisfy the express requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-127 and -128(1)(d), MCA. However, I do not subscribe to the Court\u2019s approval of those cases in which we incorrectly utilize the doctrine of implied findings, specifically <em>S.G.R. </em>and <em>D.L.B. I. </em>Accordingly, I write separately because the Court continues to acknowledge the reasoning of those cases as valid in its discussion of the doctrine and, further, to clarify the doctrine and explain the limitations of its use, especially within the context of an involuntary commitment proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">\u00b622 We have actually only utilized the implied findings doctrine in two involuntary commitment proceedings. In the first case, <em>S.G.R., </em>we affirmed the commitment entered by the District Court by assembling an order premised upon the court\u2019s statement during trial that S.G.R.\u2019s mental condition \u201cput him at risk.\u201d From this utterance, we \u201cgrew\u201d the commitment order, articulating in the first instance the statutory basis upon which the commitment was warranted. We chose \u00a7 53-21-126(1)(a), MCA, and, as if our stating so made it true, concluded that being \u201cat risk\u201d \u201cclearly impl[ied]\u201d S.G.R. was recommitted because he was \u201csubstantially unable to provide for his own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety.\u201d We incorrectly utilized the doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>of implied findings to conclude that express statutory requirements had been met when those requirements instead were required to be made in the first instance by the trial court. We did not \u201cimply\u201d a factual finding which was necessary for an express finding of the court, as the implied findings doctrine allows, we simply made the entire finding(s) ourselves. We did not stop there, but, under the umbrage of the doctrine, went on to formulate the statutory basis upon which S.G.R. should be committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u00b623 Less than a year later, from the same district court, we considered another recommitment order, which again failed to indicate under which statutory subsection the court determined commitment of the respondent was necessary\u2014\u00a7 53-21-126(1)(a), (b), (c), or (d). <em>D.L.B. I, </em>\u00b6 8. We combed the transcript to \u201cimply\u201d factual findings <em>and </em>conclusions of law and selected from among the four statutory options the subsection which we believed was most rooted in the evidence, making all necessary \u201cimplied findings\u201d along the way. In doing so, we made conclusions of law that were absent from the district court\u2019s order, but nonetheless required by the statute, and implied all facts expedient to our determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>D.L.B. I, </em>\u00b6 20. Such a standard of review is novel, in my opinion, and one which I have not had the opportunity to apply myself or, for that matter, observe in other courts. Its utility is completely evident and will undeniably prove useful in this Court\u2019s toolbox should we choose, again, to implement a particular result we deem worthwhile.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\u00b624 In both <em>S.G.R. </em>and <em>D.L.B. I, </em>we seized upon dicta in <em>S.C. </em>when we applied the doctrine of implied findings to create and assemble our trial court order. In <em>S.C., </em>S.C. argued that the district court had not made a <em>separate </em>factual finding setting forth why it had determined involuntary medication was necessary. However, in <em>S. C. </em>the district court made express findings of fact that supported its express conclusion under \u00a7 53-21-127, MCA, that involuntary medication was necessary. The district court set forth the following in its findings of fact: (1) S.C. had on two occasions been observed throwing her medication in the garbage can; (2) S.C. had a history of medication noncompliance; (3) S.C. continued to state she did not need medication, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>even though the prescribed treatment of her mental illness required medication; and (4) S.C.\u2019s mental illness, if left untreated by medication, would result in S.C. or others being placed at risk of harm. Although we found that the district court\u2019s \u201cspecific findings provide a clear rationale for ordering involuntary medicationl , |\u201d we nonetheless noted the doctrine of implied findings adopted by the Court in <em>Interstate Brands, </em>which involved a contract dispute and issues of bailment between an armored car service and its customer, added further support for the district court\u2019s \u201cabundantly clear\u201d findings of fact regarding involuntary medication. <em>S.C., </em>\u00b6 14. In doing so, we opened the door to what can only be characterized as a new and expanding chapter to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b625 I submit that it was unnecessary to mention the implied findings doctrine in <em>S.C. </em>and that we did so without careful examination and explanation of the doctrine\u2019s applicability in the context of an involuntary commitment proceeding. It is my opinion, or perhaps optimism, that had we carefully considered the doctrine in conjunction with the well-recognized principle that there is to be strict compliance with the involuntary commitment statutes, <em>In re Mental Health of S.J., </em>231 Mont. 353, 355, 753 P.2d 319, 320 (1988), our decision in <em>S.G.R. </em>and <em>D.L.B. I </em>would have been different. An examination of the doctrine itself establishes why this is so.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b626 The doctrine has its origins in the rules of civil procedure, currently M. R. Civ. P. 52(6)(c), concerning judgment on partial findings. Rule 52(6)(c) provides that \u201c[i]f a party has been fully heard on an issue during a nonjury trial and the court finds against the party on that issue, the court may enter judgment against the party on a claim or defense that, under the controlling law, can be maintained or defeated only with a favorable <em>finding </em>on that issue.\u201d (Emphasis added). As early as 1899, we explained that \u201cthe present Codes recognize the system of implied findings, and that, under that system, where there are defective findings the judgment appealed from will not be reversed unless requests and exceptions were made and saved.\u201d <em>Haggin v. Saile, </em>23 Mont. 375, 380, 59 P. 154, 155 (1899) (citations omitted). We observed in <em>Haggin </em>that the doctrine requires \u201cthe losing party to take proper steps to except to the defects in the findings of fact, pointing out the particular omissions of which he complains ...,\u201d or otherwise \u201che cannot secure a reversal in the defects in the findings filed[.]\u201d <em>Haggin, </em>23 Mont. at 380, 59 P. at 155. Accordingly, the \u201cpresumption\u201d is that the \u201comitted issues necessary to supply the defects in the <em>findings\u201d </em>are found in favor of the prevailing party. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number><em>Haggin, </em>23 Mont. at 380, 59 P. at 155. (citations omitted; emphasis added). <em>See also Gallagher v. Cornelius, </em>23 Mont. 27, 28, 57 P. 447, 448 (1899) (\u201cThe defendants complain of the failure of the referee to make express findings on every issue ... [b]ut it does not appear the defendants requested findings in writing, as is required by Section 1114 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b627 This Court applied the doctrine of implied findings in <em>Yellowstone Nat\u2019l Bk. v. Gagnon, </em>25 Mont. 268, 271, 64 P. 664, 665 (1901), to conclude that, in the absence of the plaintiff either requesting findings or filing exceptions to defective findings, the \u201cpresumption obtains that the court impliedly found for the prevailing party upon the issues of fact not covered by the express findings.\u201d Unless the party has requested findings or filed objections to defective findings, the \u201cexpress findings are supplemented by implied findings.\u201d <em>Yellowstone Nat\u2019l Bk., </em>25 Mont. at 271, 64 P. at 665. We also explained in <em>Crosby v. Robbins, </em>56 Mont. 179, 182 P. 122 (1919), that the doctrine of implied findings was not unlimited. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">[T]he doctrine is limited to cover these cases: (a) if no findings are made, and none requested, it will be presumed that the court found in favor of the prevailing party upon every issue necessary to support the judgment, (b) If the court makes findings which are deficient, but the defects are not pointed out, the presumption will be indulged that the court also found upon other facts in issue sufficient, by supplementing the facts found, to sustain the judgment. It will not be presumed that the court impliedly found facts inconsistent with the express findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\"><em>Crosby, </em>56 Mont. at 193, 182 P. at 125 (citations omitted). Where the court \u201cexpressly [finds] every fact necessary to support the judgment ..., there is no room for the application of the doctrine of implied findings.\u201d <em>Crosby, </em>56 Mont. at 193, 182 P. at 125.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>Eskestrand v. Wunder, </em>94 Mont. 57, 64, 20 P.2d 622, 624 (1933), this Court determined that a specific finding made by the trial court was \u201cone of fact\u201d and that \u201cany further finding on the subject, necessary, will be implied ...,\u201d thus acknowledging the doctrine was limited to implied findings of fact, as compared to implied conclusions of law or, as relevant here, implying that specific statutory determinations were made by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u00b628 Citing M. R. Civ. P. 52, we reaffirmed these principles in <em>Poulsen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>v. Treasure State Indus., </em>192 Mont. 69, 77, 626 P.2d 822, 827 (1981), explaining that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s judgment is presumed correct, and this Court will draw every legitimate inference to support that presumption.\u201d We held that this Court adheres to the \u201cdoctrine of implied findings which states that where a court\u2019s findings are general in terms, any findings not specifically made, but necessary to the judgment, are deemed to have been implied, if supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Poulsen, </em>192 Mont. at 77, 626 P.2d at 827. Accordingly, \u201c[i]n support of the trial court, this Court will engage in the doctrine of implied findings so long as those findings are not inconsistent with express findings made.\u201d <em>Poulsen, </em>192 Mont. at 77-78, 626 P.2d at 827.</p>\n<p id=\"AQBf\">\u00b629 In <em>Poulsen, </em>we drew on the reasoning of <em>Boas v. Bank of America Nat. Trust &amp; Savings Ass\u2019n., </em>125 P.2d 620 (Cal. 1942), to explain the doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">On appeal a reviewing court is entitled to draw necessary inferences from the trial court\u2019s express findings in order to support a judgment [citations omitted]; that is to say, where from the facts found and the judgment ordered it is evident in the light of the entire record that if more complete findings had been made they would have been adverse to the contention of the appellant, it will be deemed that such inferences were drawn by the trial court, and in those circumstances the failure so to find is not a ground for the reversal of the judgment. [Citations omitted.] Here fraud was charged; one of the legal grounds upon which the trial court founded its judgment that the agreement was void was that it was obtained by false pretenses; and the evidence shows and the trial court expressly found that the false representations were at all times known to the plaintiff to be false. It follows necessarily that if the trial court had made a finding covering the element of intent to deceive the finding would have been adverse to appellants. Therefore, the absence of a specific finding to that effect does not serve as grounds for reversal. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">The issue of fraud constituted one of the principal issues the trial court was called upon to decide, and a great deal of evidence was introduced on that issue. It must be assumed, therefore, that if the trial court did not believe that appellants made the false representations with intent to deceive it would have so found. As said in <em>Phillips v. Hooper, </em>43 Cal. App. 2d 467, [111 P.2d 22], the findings of fact must be taken as embodying the conclusions of the trial court on all questions of fact submitted to it for decision; and no antecedent expressions of the trial judge can in any way restrict his power to declare his final conclusion in the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>manner authorized by law, that is, by filing his decision containing his findings of fact and conclusions of law as provided in sections 632 and 633 of the Code of Civil Procedure (citing several cases).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-5\"><em>Boas, </em>125 P.2d at 623-24. <em>See also Interstate Brands Corp. v. Cannon, </em>218 Mont. 380, 384, 708 P.2d <em>573, 576 (1985); Ballenger v. Tillman, </em>133 Mont. 369, 378, 324 P.2d 1045, 1050 (1958); <em>Crisse v. State Highway Commission, </em>147 Mont. 374, 381, 413 P.2d 308, 310, (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b630 As the foregoing abundantly makes clear, the doctrine of implied findings is a rule of civil procedure that allows judgment to be entered, even though the trial court has made only partial findings, because the judgment made by the trial court can only be maintained with a favorable finding on the particular issue. Although a party may \u201clater question the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the findings, whether or not the party requested findings, objected to them, moved to amend them, or moved for partial findings[,]\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(5), where the findings are general in terms, any findings not specifically made, but necessary to the determination, are deemed to have been implied, if supported by the evidence. Thus, the underlying justification for the doctrine is first, a requirement that error be preserved so that the trial court has an opportunity to correct its omissions; and, second, that a presumption in favor of the trial court implies all of the factual findings necessary to uphold its judgment, provided they do not contradict other express findings and are likewise supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b631 On appeal, we review a commitment order to determine whether a district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous. <em>D.L.B. I, </em>\u00b6 10. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence or if, after review of the entire record, we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>S.G.R., </em>\u00b6 13. Significantly, the doctrine of implied findings is consistent with this standard of review; a finding could not be implied if it were not supported by the evidence. Moreover, an implied finding could not be made to support an express finding if the express finding demonstrated the trial court had misapprehended the effect of the evidence or left this Court with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake had been made. Hence, the doctrine of implied findings acts to presume omitted findings which are consistent and necessary to the express findings already made by the trial court, thereby avoiding reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">\u00b632 However, use of the doctrine of implied findings, as its name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>suggests, is limited to supplementing the findings already made by the trial court. Using the doctrine to make conclusions of law which have been omitted by the trial court or other omitted findings and conclusions specifically required by statute is, therefore, inconsistent with the rationale underlying the doctrine. We review commitment orders to determine whether a district court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. <em>S.G.R., </em>\u00b6 13. Whether a district court\u2019s findings of fact meet statutory requirements is a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>S.G.R., </em>\u00b6 13. Accordingly, we must know what the district court concluded in order to review it and apply the correct standard of review. The doctrine of implied <em>findings </em>is of no use when conclusions of law or statutory requirements have been omitted; that is the job of the trial court in rendering its judgment. Where a trial court\u2019s conclusion regarding the statutory basis for commitment is completely lacking, we cannot imply the <em>judgment, </em>as we did in <em>D.L.B. I </em>and <em>S.G.R. </em>In other words, as an appellate court we are not permitted to imply from our independent review of the record that the trial court would have made the specific statutory findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b633 With regard to the State\u2019s power to treat the mentally ill, the Legislature has specifically established the law in Chapter 21 of Title 53, MCA. I agree with the Court as to the specific findings of fact which must be made by the district court under the statute, Opinion, \u00b6 10. When the statute requires the district courts to make specific findings, this Court may not imply them from our independent review of the evidence. The district court \u201cshall\u201d state the facts upon which it is requiring commitment. Section 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA. In determining whether a commitment is required, the district court \u201cshall consider\u201d subsections (a) through (d) of \u00a7 53-21-126. Section 53-21-126(1), MCA. Indeed, the posttrial disposition ordered by the district court is expressly contingent upon the conclusion made by the court pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-126(a) through (d), MCA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 53-21-127(7), MCA (\u201cIf the court relies solely upon the criterion provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), the court may require commitment only to a community facility or program[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u00b634 I cannot agree with the Court, to the extent our decision continues to acknowledge incorrectly decided precedent allowing for the assembly and creation of an order which, in the first instance, is committed to the jurisdiction of the District court. I do not agree that use of the doctrine of implied findings to conclude the District Court met express statutory requirements is consistent with the doctrine\u2019s rationale. The doctrine has a place in our jurisprudence, but its use is limited\u2014especially within the context of a statutory scheme that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>requires strict compliance and involuntarily detains a person who is not charged with having committed a crime. It is the job of the trial court to state its facts specially and its conclusions of law separately. M. R. Civ. P. 52. If it fails to do so, it is our job, pursuant to the standard of review, to reverse the judgment of the district court. It is not our job to substitute our own findings and conclusions for the omissions of the trial court, despite how earnestly we may feel the person needs commitment or our compulsion to act as a trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"ajj-dedup-0\">\u00b635 To the extent we perpetuate the validity of our precedent wherein we incorrectly applied the doctrine of implied findings and give lip service to the standards of review, I feel compelled to write separately. In all other respects, I agree with the Court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-11\"> Except for the Nursing Care Center information required by \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(g), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\"> Although we referred to the doctrine of implied findings in <em>S.M., </em>we actually concluded that the oral findings made by the court during the hearing were consistent with the written order.
