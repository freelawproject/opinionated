She requests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>that we vacate the order amending the parenting plan and remand for a new hearing to establish an appropriate parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b62 We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u00b63 Andrew Orvis and Cristy are the parents of a seven-year-old child, G.M.O. The District Court adopted a parenting plan in August 2012 when G.M.O. was two years old. Under the plan, G.M.O. resided primarily with Cristy, and Andrew had parenting time every week from Tuesday morning to Thursday evening. Both parents lived in Missoula at the time. G.M.O. has been in Cristy\u2019s primary care ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">\u00b64 Cristy worked as the general manager of a Taco Bell in Missoula. In early 2016, Cristy was offered the general manager position for Taco Bell in Kalispell. The position included a pay raise, a better schedule, and an opportunity for growth in the company. Cristy accepted the position and managed the Kalispell location while still living in Missoula. Cristy commuted to and from Kalispell a few times a week for several months.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">\u00b65 In April 2016, Cristy provided notice of her intent to move to Columbia Falls. Andrew filed a motion opposing Cristy\u2019s intent to move. The District Court denied Cristy\u2019s motion and set an August hearing date to review the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">\u00b66 Both Cristy and Andrew testified at the hearing. Cristy offered evidence and testified extensively that allowing her to maintain primary care of G.M.O. in Columbia Falls would be in the child\u2019s best interest. Andrew provided little testimony regarding G.M.O.\u2019s best interests. The court did not make any oral findings during the hearing. The court did state, however, that \u201cthere are worse things than having to go to two different schools in a year, and I know there\u2019s a lot of kids go to two different schools in a year without, you know, too much harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">\u00b67 The District Court issued a brief order amending the parenting plan on August 23, 2016. The order did not contain any substantive findings of fact or conclusions of law. It provided that G.M.O. would attend school in Columbia Falls from the beginning of the school year until Thanksgiving. At that point, G.M.O. would move back to Missoula and attend school there until Easter. At Easter, G.M.O. would again move back to Columbia Falls to finish the school year. Following the school year, G.M.O. would move back to Missoula to spend the first third of the summer there. She would spend the second third of the summer in Columbia Falls, and the last third of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>summer back in Missoula. At the end of the summer, G.M.O. would move back to Columbia Falls to begin the school year. The District Court found this schedule to be \u201cin the best interest of the child.\u201d Cristy appeals. Andrew did not submit a response brief on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact related to a parenting plan to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Parenting of C.J., </em>2016 MT 93, \u00b6 12, 383 Mont. 197, 369 P.3d 1028. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake. <em>C.J., </em>\u00b6 12. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>C.J., </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u00b69 A district court has broad discretion when considering the parenting of a child. <em>C.J., </em>\u00b6 12. Accordingly, absent clearly erroneous findings, we will not disturb a district court\u2019s decision regarding parenting plans unless there is a clear abuse of discretion. <em>C.J., </em>\u00b6 12. A district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>C.J., </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">\u00b610 A district court must \u201cdetermine the parenting plan in accordance with the best interest of the child.\u201d Section 40-4-212(1), MCA. The best interest standard applies to amending parenting plans as well. Section 40-4-219(1), MCA. The court must \u201cconsider all relevant parenting factors\u201d in determining the best interest of the child. Section 40-4-212(1), MCA. The statute sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors for the court to consider, including: \u201cthe child\u2019s adjustment to home, school, and community;\u201d \u201ccontinuity and stability of care;\u201d and \u201cdevelopmental needs of the child.\u201d Section 40-4-212(1)(d), (h), (i), MCA. A court may \u201camend a prior parenting plan if it finds, upon the basis of facts ... that the amendment is necessary to serve the best interest of the child.\u201d Section 40-4-219(1), MCA. \u201cAlthough [w]e have encouraged district courts to make specific findings on each relevant statutory factor, we require only that the district court make findings sufficient for this court to determine whether the court considered the statutory fact[ors] and made its ruling on the basis of the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>C.J., </em>\u00b6 14 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">\u00b611 The District Court\u2019s order simply \u201creaffirmed its earlier findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>about the child\u2019s most significant contacts being in Missoula, including school, friends, and medical care.\u201d The court then stated conclusively that it is \u201cin the best interest of the child to spend Fall and Spring in school in Columbia Falls and Summer in Missoula.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b612 The District Court\u2019s \u201cfindings\u201d are insufficient. The court\u2019s order provides no basis for this Court \u201cto determine whether the court considered the statutory fact! ors I and made its ruling on the basis of the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>C.J., </em>\u00b6 14. Moreover, there is no justification\u2014on this record or any that we can imagine\u2014for a determination that requiring a child to switch schools between Missoula and Columbia Falls twice during the school year could be in the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b613 The District Court\u2019s amended parenting plan requires G.M.O. to move six times during the course of the year\u2014including twice during the school year. The court\u2019s order lacks any consideration of the school calendars or of how the disruption may affect G.M.O.\u2019s \u201cdevelopmental needs\u201d and her \u201cadjustment to ... schoolf] and community.\u201d Section 40-4-212(1)(d), (i), MCA. The court seems to base its decision on the fact that G.M.O. \u201cwill be traveling for visitation no matter which school district is selected\u201d and that \u201cwinter travel is the most challenging.\u201d The court\u2019s finding that this plan is in G.M.O.\u2019s best interest exceeds the bounds of reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u00b614  We conclude that the District Court\u2019s order contains insufficient findings of fact related to G.M.O.\u2019s best interest and that the findings it does contain are clearly erroneous. We conclude further that the District Court abused its discretion in amending the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">\u00b615 We reverse the District Court\u2019s order amending the parenting plan and remand for a new hearing to determine the best interest of the child.</p>\n<judges id=\"b409-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, SHEA and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
