We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue in this matter is whether the District Court erred in dismissing Nolan\u2019s complaint for failure to comply with applicable Rules of Civil Procedure for service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">\u00b63 From 2011 through September 30, 2016, RiverStone contracted with Yellowstone County to provide medical services for inmates at the Yellowstone County Detention Facility. Nolan was incarcerated at the facility for a period during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">\u00b64 On February 11, 2013, Nolan filed a pro se complaint against RiverStone asserting a crudely pled civil claim alleging that it violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution (prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment) by denying him access to a prescribed pain medication (Hydrocodone) while incarcerated. Nolan subsequently filed additional pro se documents and mailed some to RiverStone\u2019s general business address. On April 8, 2014, after obtaining issuance of a summons, Nolan mailed the summons to RiverStone along with purported amendments to his original complaint. The attempted mail service did not include his original complaint or an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">\u00b65 On November 3, 2015, the clerk of court notified Nolan that more than a year had passed without any action in his case and that local court rules required dismissal for failure to prosecute absent a showing of good cause for the delay within 20 days. Nolan quickly responded by filing a motion, which indicated he expected the clerk of court to arrange for the sheriff to serve RiverStone on his behalf. In early December, Nolan filed two motions seeking to compel RiverStone to answer his complaint, and mailed a copy of the second motion to RiverStone. At Nolan\u2019s request, the clerk of court issued another summons on December 21, 2015.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u00b66 On August 31,2016, RiverStone moved, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(5), for dismissal of Nolan\u2019s complaint for failure to effect proper service of process within three years as required by M. R. Civ. P. 4(t). On September 2, 2016, Nolan filed, and served by mail, two pro se responses opposing dismissal on the asserted grounds that RiverStone had actual notice of the complaint and that pro se litigants are entitled to wide latitude with the technical pleading and practice requirements of the Rules of Civil Procedure. While the motion to dismiss was pending, Nolan belatedly effected personal service of process on RiverStone on September 14, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b67 On September 20, 2016, the District Court dismissed Nolan\u2019s complaint with prejudice pursuant to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">(1) M. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(3)(B)(iii), 4(i)(3)(A), and 4(t) (requirement for non-mail personal service on authorized corporate agent within 3 years of filing date of complaint);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">(2) <em>In re Marriage of Zacher, </em>2004 MT 249, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 323 Mont. 54, 98 P.3d 309 (proper service of process is jurisdictional\u2014strict compliance with rules for service of process is mandatory) <em>overruled on other grounds by Essex Ins.

Kniss, </em>2005 MT 268, \u00b6 9, 329 Mont. 115, 122 P.3d 1203 (citing <em>Gulf Ins. Co. v. Clark, </em>2003 MT 87, \u00b6 11, 315 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Mont. 121, 68 P.3d 673).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b610 A plaintiff commences a civil action by filing a complaint. M. R. Civ. P. 3. A judgment is binding on a party only if the court first acquires personal jurisdiction over the party. The court acquires personal jurisdiction only by personal service of process on the adverse party or if the party submits to the jurisdiction of the court by voluntary appearance. M. R. Civ. P. 4(b)(2). Personal service requires delivery of a summons and copy of the complaint to the defendant by an authorized process server. M. R. Civ. P. 4(c)(1) and (d)(1). Alternatively, a plaintiff may serve process on a defendant by mail upon strict compliance with specified mail service requirements including, <em>inter alia, </em>provision and timely return of a written acknowledgment of service. M. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(3). However, mail service is not available for service of process on a \u201ccorporation, partnership, or other unincorporated association.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(3)(B)(iii). Because proper service of process is jurisdictional, <em>see </em>M. R. Civ. P. 4(b)(2), strict compliance with the rules for service of process is mandatory. <em>Zacher, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17; <em>In re Marriage of Blaskovich, </em>249 Mont. 248, 250, 815 P.2d 581, 582 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u00b611 The plaintiff \u201cbears the burden\u201d of timely effecting proper service of process. M. R. Civ. P. 4(c)(1). A plaintiff must effect proper service within three years of the date of filing of the complaint. M. R. Civ. P. 4(t)(1). \u201c[U]pon motion or on its own initiative,\u201d the court <em>\u201cmust dismiss </em>an action without prejudice\u201d if the plaintiff fails to bring about proper service within the three year deadline. M. R. Civ. P. 4(t)(1) (emphasis added). On motion, the court may dismiss an action with prejudice if \u201cthe plaintiff fails to prosecute\u201d the action, fails to comply with the Rules of Civil Procedure, or disobeys an order of the court. M. R. Civ. P. 41(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">\u00b612  Acknowledging his defective service on appeal, Nolan asserts that RiverStone had actual notice of his complaint and purported amendments based on his informal mail service. However, mere \u201cknowledge of the action is not a substitute for valid service.\u201d <em>Fonk, </em>260 Mont. at 383-84, 860 P.2d at 147 (summons and petition left with family member insufficient to confer jurisdiction); <em>Semenza, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-15 (defective service on non-agent); <em>Blaskovich, </em>249 Mont. at 252, 815 P.2d at 583 (proof of mail service insufficient without written acknowledgment). Strict compliance with the rules for service of process is mandatory. <em>Zacher, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17; <em>Fonk, </em>260 Mont. at 383, 860 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>P.2d at 147. Therefore, regardless of RiverStone\u2019s actual knowledge of the pendency of his complaint, Nolan\u2019s informal mail service was insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b613 Citing <em>Estate of Mills, </em>2015 MT 245, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25, 380 Mont. 426, 354 P.3d 1271 (Rice, J., concurring) <em>(discussing Hall v. Hall, </em>2015 MT 226, 380 Mont. 224, 354 P.3d 1224), Nolan asserts that pro se litigants are entitled to relief from mandatory procedural rules. He claims he lacked the knowledge and ability to follow the exacting rules for service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b614 In contrast to the mandatory threshold jurisdictional issue here, the question in <em>Mills </em>was whether good cause existed to equitably set aside a default judgment against a pro se defendant under the three-factor test under M. R. Civ. P. 55(c). <em>Mills, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-21. To the extent referenced in Justice Rice\u2019s concurrence, <em>Hall, </em>like <em>Mills, </em>similarly did not involve a mandatory threshold jurisdictional matter. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-25 (liberally construing pro se correspondence as timely M. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion to set aside default judgment and timely notice of appeal based on \u201crather unique circumstances of this case\u201d). Therefore, <em>Mills </em>and <em>Hall </em>are distinguishable and provide no support for Nolan\u2019s assertion that pro se litigants are entitled to relief from mandatory service of process rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u00b615  Though this Court often affords pro se litigants wide latitude regarding substantive pleading requirements, they must still strictly comply with procedural rules. <em>Xu, </em>\u00b6 23. Strict compliance is particularly important where, as here, the procedural rules at issue are jurisdictional in nature. Consequently, the District Court correctly concluded that Nolan was not entitled to relief from the mandatory Rules for service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u00b616 Nolan has made no showing that any of the District Court\u2019s pertinent findings of fact were clearly erroneous. On de novo review, we conclude the District Court\u2019s applications and conclusions of law are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">\u00b617 We hold the District Court correctly dismissed Nolan\u2019s complaint due to his failure to comply with the mandatory rules for proper service of process on RiverStone. We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b125-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-12\"> The District Court order describes guidance the office of the clerk of court provided Nolan regarding service of process and the three-year deadline for completing service by February 11, 2016.
