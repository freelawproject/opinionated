R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment. We affirm and address the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\"><em>Did the District Court err by denying Swanson\u2019s motions on the ground that the claims were foreclosed under \u00a7 53-6-145, </em>MCA?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\u00b62 Swanson is the Personal Representative of the Estate of Maria Atkins-Swanson (Atkins-Swanson), who tragically died in 2013. Atkins-Swanson was a participant in a government-sponsored program that forms the legal context for the claims brought by Swanson against Consumer Direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Program Overview</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">\u00b63 The Social Security Act authorizes States to create, design, and administer home and community-based Personal Assistance Services Programs (PASPs), aimed at assisting the elderly and people with disabilities, collectively referred to as \u201cConsumers,\u201d with residential living. <em>See, generally, </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396 et seq. (2012). PASPs help Medicaid-eligible Consumers maintain their independence, preserve their connection to the community, and avoid institutionalization by receiving support in their homes. Section 53-6-145(2)(d), MCA. Under a PASP, Consumers can obtain personal assistant services, or PAS, including assistance with activities of daily living,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> household tasks, and escort services. Admin. R. M. 37.40.1101(2) (1995); \u00a7 53-6-145(2)(d), MCA. The Social Security Act grants States broad discretion in designing and implementing PASPs. The Montana Legislature has determined that Montana should participate in the program and has directed the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) to establish PASPs for eligible Montanans. Section 53-6-145(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">\u00b64 Pursuant to this directive, DPHHS has developed two different PASPs. The first program is designated as the Agency-Based PASP, which provides for the delivery of services by qualified personal care provider agencies. The provider agency works with the Consumer to establish the schedule for service provision and provides the trained staff necessary for the delivery of care. Under this program, Consumers have no authority and must rely on the provider agency to coordinate and provide the appropriate services.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>\u00b65 The second program developed by DPHHS is designated the Self-Directed PASP. This is the program in which Atkins-Swanson was participating at the time of her death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the Self-Directed PASP, the Consumer \u201chas the primary responsibility ... [for] scheduling, training, and supervislingI ... the personal assistant.\u201d Admin. R. M. 37.40.1305(2)(a) (1995). Further, \u201c[t]he consumer has the right to require that a particular assistant discontinue providing services to the consumer.\u201d Admin. R. M. 37.40.1305(2)(a) (1995). The Self-Directed PASP enables qualified Consumers to exert autonomy over their care needs and is \u201cintended to provide control of service delivery to the consumer and to allow the consumer to direct health related tasks.\u201d Admin. R. M. 37.40.1301(1) (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b66 To qualify for the Self-Directed PASP under the regulations governing the program in 2013, a Consumer was required to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">(a) have a medical condition which results in the need for personal assistance services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">(b) <em>be capable of assuming the management responsibilities of assistants </em>or have an immediately involved representative willing to assume this responsibility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">(c) have authorization from a physician or health care professional to participate in the program; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">(d) <em>be capable of making choices about activities of daily living, understand the impact of these choices and assume the responsibility of the choices.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Admin. R. M. 37.40.1305(1) (1995) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">Consumer Direct</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">\u00b67 Consumer Direct is licensed as an agency service provider by DPHHS. Under the Self-Directed PASP, Consumer Direct provides administrative support to Consumers receiving personal services for a fee, helping Consumers apply their Medicaid benefits to compensate their personal assistants. Consumer Direct\u2019s \u201cConsumer Training Manual\u201d informed Consumers that Consumer Direct would \u201cprocess payroll, file taxes, bill for services, process criminal background checks and provide you with the training materials for your caregiver(s).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AhI\">Maria Atkins-Swanson</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">\u00b68 In 2009, Atkins-Swanson applied and qualified for participation in the Self-Directed PASP under the eligibility criteria. She selected Consumer Direct as her provider agency. Atkins-Swanson located, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>selected, and hired Taylor Lang (Lang) to be her personal assistant. She trained Lang and supervised Lang\u2019s provision of services. After initially being medically qualified to participate in 2009, Atkins-Swanson was medically re-qualified for the Self-Directed PASP annually until her death in 2013, as required by Admin. R. M. 37.40.1305(1)(c) (1995). Consumer Direct, as the provider agency, provided the above-described administrative services to Atkins-Swanson during the course of her participation in the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b69 On June 27, 2013, while Lang was serving as her personal assistant, Atkins-Swanson succumbed to a fatal overdose of buspirone. Thereafter, Swanson filed this action on his own behalf and on behalf of Atkins-Swanson\u2019s Estate against Consumer Direct, stating claims of wrongful death, survivorship, and breach of contract. Swanson alleged that Consumer Direct was Lang\u2019s employer and liable in <em>respondeat superior </em>for Lang\u2019s involvement in Atkins-Swanson\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b610 Consumer Direct moved for summary judgment on the basis of \u00a7 53-6-145(5), MCA, which provides that \u201c[mjedical and related liability for personal-care services ... rests with the person directing the services,\u201d arguing that Atkins-Swanson was the person directing the personal services at issue. The District Court agreed, reasoning that Atkins-Swanson had qualified to participate in the Self-Directed PASP, that \u00a7 53-6-145(5), MCA, assigned liability for Lang\u2019s services to Atkins-Swanson and was dispositive, rendering Consumer Direct \u201cstatutorily immune from medical and related liability so long as it is not directing the personal-care services.\u201d Swanson filed a M. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment, which the District Court denied on the grounds that \u201cSwanson has not presented any new evidence, manifest errors of law or fact, or shown any evidence of counsel\u2019s misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\u00b611 Swanson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">\u00b612 We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as a district court. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct and its findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Pilgeram v. GreenPoint Mortg. Funding, Inc., </em>2013 MT 354, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 1, 313 P.3d 839 (internal citations omitted). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a M. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Anderson, </em>2013 MT 238, \u00b6 13, 371 Mont. 321, 307 P.3d 313 (citing <em>In re Marriage of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>2011 MT 255, \u00b6 12, 362 Mont. 236, 262 P.3d 1105).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b613 <em>Did the District Court err by denying Swanson\u2019s motions on the ground that the claims were foreclosed under \u00a7 53-6-145, </em>MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u00b614 Swanson first urges reversal of the District Court upon the theory that Consumer Direct was Lang\u2019s \u201ccommon law employer\u201d and, therefore, bore responsibility for her actions under <em>respondeat superior. </em>Swanson\u2019s theory is largely premised upon a statement made within the State\u2019s 2011 Application for a Section 1915(c)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Home and Community Based Service Waiver submitted to obtain authorization for Medicaid funding of Montana\u2019s Personal Assistance Programs. On a pre-printed form, an option box is checked under the subject category \u201cParticipant-Employer Authority\u201d that includes the language \u201c[a]n agency is the common law employer of participant-selected/recruited staff and performs necessary payroll and human resources functions.\u201d The Medicaid waiver application process is governed by Section 1915 of the Social Security Act and \u00a7 53-6-402, MCA, which Swanson cites, and which generally authorizes DPHHS to seek and obtain \u201cwaivers of federal [MJedicaid law\u201d used to fund personal and community-based services. Section 53-6-402(1), (2), MCA. The form relied upon by Swanson, whatever the meaning or intent of the quoted language may be, was submitted by the State as part of the Medicaid waiver application process. However, the PASPs, particularly the Self-Directed PASP at issue, are authorized by Section 1905 of the Social Security Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and governed by \u00a7 53-6-145, MCA, the implementation of which resolves the issues raised here. Implicit within Swanson\u2019s additional arguments about the interpretation of \u00a7 53-6-145, MCA, is the recognition that the Legislature has acted in this area, and common law principles do not control. \u201cIn this state there is no common law in any case where the law is declared by statute.\u201d Section 1-1-108, MCA; <em>see Woods v. State, </em>2015 MT 8, \u00b6 19, 378 Mont. 38, 340 P.3d 1254 (\u201cAlthough the Woodses urge this Court to apply general common law principles of foreseeability,... the Legislature rejected this approach when it adopted \u00a7 27-1-1102, MCA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">\u00b615 Addressingthe District Court\u2019s dismissal of his claims under \u00a7 53-6-145(5), MCA, Swanson argues that \u201c[a]ny waiver [of liability] that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>may be derived from \u00a7 53-6-145, MCA[,] is ambiguous,\u201d and that an \u201calternative plausible interpretation\u201d is that the provision simply means \u201cthe disabled person\u2019s assistants are not to be held to a standard of care equivalent to a medical provider.\u201d Swanson also argues the statutory language that medical and related liability \u201crests with\u201d the person directing services does not mean liability could not be shared by others, which would be more consistent with the idea that personal assistants are treated as employees of the licensed provider agencies for some purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b616 Our purpose is to \u201cimplement the objectives the Legislature sought to achieve.\u201d <em>Clark Fork Coal. v. Tubbs, </em>2016 MT 229, \u00b6 20, 384 Mont. 503, 380 P.3d 771 (citing <em>Mont. Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. Sager, </em>190 Mont. 247, 264, 620 P.2d 1189, 1199 (1980)). \u201cIf the intent of the Legislature can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used in the statute, the plain meaning controls and the Court need go no further nor apply any other means of interpretation.\u201d <em>Clark Fork Coal., </em>\u00b6 20 <em>(citing Phelps v. Hillhaven Corp., </em>231 Mont. 245, 251, 752 P.2d 737, 741 (1988)). \u201cWhen the legislative intent cannot be readily derived from the plain language, we review the legislative history and abide by the intentions reflected therein.\u201d <em>State v. Allport, </em>2015 MT 349, \u00b6 13, 382 Mont. 29, 363 P.3d 441 (quoting <em>Montanans For Justice: Vote No On CI-98 v. State, </em>2006 MT 277, \u00b6 60, 334 Mont. 237, 146 P.3d 759).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u00b617 Section 53-6-145(1), MCA, states the Legislature\u2019s objectives for the PASPs and authorizes DPHHS and the Department of Labor and Industry to develop rules furthering those objectives, including defining the legal duties of the persons involved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">Recognizing the importance of <em>consumer control </em>over personal assistance services in a <em>self -directed service model, </em>the legislature directs the department of public health and human services and the department of labor and industry to adopt administrative rules authorizing a person with a disability <em>to act as though the person is the employer, for the purposes of selection, management, and supervision, of a personal assistant, although the personal assistant is the employee of another person or entity. </em>The rules must reflect both the rights and protection guaranteed to workers under existing labor law and <em>ensure that consumers of personal assistant services have day-to-day control, supervision, and direction over those services.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">(Emphasis added.) This section divides legal responsibilities, normally vested completely in an employer, between the person with a disability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>or \u201cConsumer,\u201d and \u201canother person or entity,\u201d regarding the employment of the personal assistant.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u00b618 Pursuant to this statutory section, regulations have been adopted that further define this division of responsibilities. Regarding the Self-Directed PASP, Admin. R. M. 37.40.1305 (1995), provides the requirements that must be assumed by the Consumer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">(1) To qualify for self-directed personal assistance, the consumer must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">(a) have a medical condition which results in the need for personal assistance services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">(b) <em>be capable of assuming the management responsibilities </em>of assistants ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">(c) have authorization from a physician or health care professional to participate in the program; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">(d) <em>be capable of making choices about activities of daily living, understand the impact of these choices and assume the responsibility of the choices.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">(2) The consumer must be <em>capable of acting as though the personal assistant is their employee for the purposes of selection, management and supervision of the personal assistant, although the personal assistant is the employee of a self-directed personal assistance provider.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">(a) The <em>consumer has the primary responsibility in the scheduling, training and supervision of the personal assistant. The consumer has the right to require that a particular assistant discontinue providing services to the consumer.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, the Consumer, to participate in a Self-Directed PASP, must be capable of making choices regarding her daily activities, understanding these choices, and assuming responsibility for them. <em>See also </em>Admin. R. M. 37.40.1102(5) (1995) (\u201cThe recipient, in order to receive personal care services, must be capable of making choices about activities of daily living, understand the impact of these choices and assume responsibility for the choices ....\u201d). Further, the Consumer is to act as the employer for purposes of the \u201cselection,\u201d \u201cscheduling,\u201d \u201ctraining,\u201d \u201cmanagement,\u201d and \u201csupervision\u201d of the personal assistant, and even has \u201cthe right to require that a particular assistant discontinue providing services.\u201d Admin. R. M. 37.40.1305(2) (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-14\">\u00b619 Admin. R. M. 37.40.1307 (1995) sets forth the requirements of the Self-Directed PASP provider agencies, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-15\">(1) Self-directed personal assistance providers have the following responsibilities:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>(a) assist consumers to identify resources for personal assistants;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">(b) advise the consumer regarding program participation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">(c) determine the amount of services available to the consumer by completing the consumer profile;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">(d) re-certify consumer needs every 180 days;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">(e) review the plan of care; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">(f) <em>act as the employer of record for personal assistants for purposes of payroll and federal hiring practices.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">\u00b620 Swanson does not argue that these regulations are inconsistent with \u00a7 53-6-145, MCA. They provide further definition about the parties\u2019 individual legal responsibilities with regard to personal assistants. The Consumer has full authority over the personal assistant\u2019s provision of services, while the provider agency is the personal assistant\u2019s employer for the narrow purpose of providing administrative support. This designation of responsibilities lays the foundation for application of \u00a7 53-6-145(5), MCA: \u201cMedical and related liability for personal-care services... rests with the person directing the services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">\u00b621 Swanson\u2019s arguments notwithstanding, the record and the governing authority allow us but one conclusion\u2014that \u201cthe person directing the services\u201d in the Self-Directed PASP at issue here was Atkins-Swanson. In contrast to the Agency-Based PASP model, the licensed provider agency in a Self-Directed PASP exercises no authority over the day-to-day provision of services by the personal assistant. To the contrary, the Consumer must be capable of exercising complete management responsibilities for the assistant, and is granted the authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">\u00b622 To the extent any ambiguity would remain, the legislative history confirms this purpose of the statute. A report submitted to the Senate Committee on Public Health, Welfare &amp; Safety during a hearing on March 13, 1995, by Representative John Cobb, sponsor of HB 504, which created the authority for PASPs,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provided the following question and answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-14\">Q: Who will assume the liability if the PA [personal assistant] performs a task wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>A: This bill (through amendment) recognizes that the <em>person directing his\\her PAS [personal assistance services] has the liability and responsibility to ensure that their needs are met. </em>Once trained, consumers of PAS are responsible for ensuring that their personal assistants work as directed and performed [sic] to their satisfaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-5\"><em>Committee Hearing on HB 504 Before the S. Comm. on Pub. Health, Welfare &amp; Safety, </em>54th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Mont. 1995) (emphasis added). HB 504 bill was enacted as Chapter 525, Laws of Montana, and provided, in pertinent part, the following Statement of Intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">The rules must allow the person with a disability to act as though the person is the employer, for the purposes of selection, management, and supervision of the personal assistant in making the decisions of who to employ, terms of employment, length of employment, and other matters, although the personal assistant is the employee of another person or entity. Before a person with a disability would be allowed to act as though that person is the employer, the person must also have a plan of care approved by a physician or health care professional, stating what aspects of the disabled person\u2019s care the personal assistant may be assigned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbH\">Thus, the legislative history reflects that the Legislature contemplated the issue of liability, placing it on the Consumer if she elected to exercise the authority of an employer over the management of the personal assistant, was capable of doing so, and was so approved. This history confirms our reading of \u00a7 53-6-145(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u00b623 Swanson argues that the statute should not also foreclose his claim against Consumer Direct for negligent failure to adequately train and supervise Lang. However, first, there is no support in the record for Swanson\u2019s assertions that \u201cConsumer Direct assumed certain affirmative duties to train and supervise\u201d Lang, and that Atkins-Swanson had \u201cno ability\u201d to control or participate in Lang\u2019s provision of services. Atkins-Swanson was required to demonstrate the ability to manage Lang in order to participate in a Self-Directed PASP, and no one disputes that she so qualified. The program laid the responsibility to train and supervise Lang directly on Atkins-Swanson, not Consumer Direct. Then, as the District Court reasoned, the plain language of \u00a7 53-6-145(5), MCA, \u201ccovers both medical <em>and </em>related liability. As Swanson rightly acknowledges, the administration of medication was a medically-related aspect of [Atkins-Swanson\u2019s] care.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">\u00b624 Lastly, Swanson argues \u201cpublic policies support the right to sue Consumer Direct for its role in I Atkins- IS wanson\u2019s death.\u201d We do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>disagree. A program designed to help disabled persons should also ensure that appropriate liability protections are in place to protect them in the event they receive negligent care. However, we have noted in other contexts, \u201clegislative decisions ... are subject to honest debate.\u201d <em>Satterlee v. Lumberman\u2019s Mut. Cas. </em>Co., 2009 MT 368, \u00b6 37, 353 Mont. 265, 222 P.3d 566. \u201cSuch a debate involves issues and decisions about public policy that are clearly of the sort much better suited to the halls of the legislature.\u201d <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b625  The District Court correctly granted Consumer Direct\u2019s motion for summary judgment and correctly denied Swanson\u2019s M.
