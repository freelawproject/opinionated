Talksabout sought to have each charge transferred to Youth Court. After analyzing the relevant statutory factors, the District Court denied both transfer motions. Talksabout eventually pleaded guilty to one count, and the court sentenced him to fifty years in prison, with ten years suspended. We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying Talksabout\u2019s requests to transfer the charges to Youth Court;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-13\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court erred in sentencing Talksabout.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-14\">\u00b62 Applying appropriate deference, we affirm the District Court\u2019s refusal to transfer the charges to Youth Court. We remand for entry of an amended judgment and review of the sentence as provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-15\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b191-16\">\u00b63 In August 2013, the State filed an information in the District Court charging Talksabout with one count of sexual intercourse without consent. The State filed the information directly in the District Court pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-206(2), MCA, because of the nature of the charge and because Talksabout was seventeen when the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>occurred. The charge arose out of Talksabout\u2019s non-consensual sexual contact with fourteen-year-old A.C. during an underage drinking party. An intoxicated A.C. told Talksabout that she did not want to have sex, but Talksabout undressed her and digitally penetrated her after trying to have sex with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b64 The District Court held a hearing in January 2014 pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA, to determine whether the case should be transferred to Youth Court. Juvenile Probation Officer Tim Callahan and Great Falls Police Detective Mike Stimac testified for the State. Licensed psychologist Dr. Bowman Smelko and Talksabout\u2019s grandmother Betty Trombley\u2014with whom Talksabout lived\u2014testified on Talksabout\u2019s behalf. Dr. Smelko had evaluated Talksabout and opined that Talksabout\u2019s interests and the interests of the community would best be served by handling the case in Youth Court. The District Court agreed that transferring the case to Youth Court would be in Talksabout\u2019s best interests. It concluded, however, that the nature of the offense and the interests of community protection weighed against transferring the case to Youth Court. The District Court therefore denied the transfer motion. The court noted further that Talksabout was under investigation for an unrelated sex offense involving a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"AP5\">\u00b65 In January 2014, the State filed another information in the District Court charging Talksabout with a separate count of sexual intercourse without consent. Even though Talksabout was only sixteen at the time of that offense, the State again filed the information directly in the District Court because sexual intercourse without consent is an enumerated offense under \u00a7 41-5-206(1), MCA. The incident involved D.P., who was twelve at the time. The second incident was similar to the first\u2014D.P. and Talksabout were at an underage drinking party and Talksabout got D.P. alone in a room, undressed her, and had sex with her after being told no.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b66 The two cases were consolidated on the State\u2019s motion. In July 2014, the District Court held another hearing pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA, to determine whether to transfer the second incident to Youth Court. Adult Probation Officer Susan Carroll and Detective Stimac testified on behalf of the State, and Dr. Smelko again testified on behalf of Talksabout. The court once more found the statutory criteria for transfer to Youth Court were not met and denied Talksabout\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b67 Ultimately, Talksabout agreed to a non-binding plea agreement under which he pleaded guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent. The agreement required that Talksabout admit to the facts of both incidents involving A.C. and D.P. The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>sentenced Talksabout to Montana State Prison for fifty years, with ten years suspended. The court\u2019s sentence did not reflect that Talksabout was a criminally convicted youth. Talksabout appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b68 We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to transfer to youth court a juvenile case charged in district court. <em>State v. Dietsch, </em>2013 MT 245, \u00b6 10, 371 Mont. 460, 308 P.3d 111. A court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811. We review for clear error the specific findings of fact on which the district court relied in making its transfer decision. <em>State v. Whiteman, </em>2005 MT 15, \u00b6 10, 325 Mont. 358, 106 P.3d 543. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake. <em>Whiteman, </em>\u00b6 10. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party when determining whether a district court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Welu v. Twin Hearts Smiling Horses, Inc., </em>2016 MT 347, \u00b6 12, 386 Mont. 98, 386 P.3d 937. We review criminal sentences for legality, to determine whether they are within the parameters set by statute as a matter of law. <em>Dietsch, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u00b69 <em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying Talksabout\u2019s requests to transfer the charges to Youth Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">\u00b610 Section 41-5-206, MCA, authorizes the State to charge a youth directly in district court under certain circumstances. A county attorney may seek leave to file an information in district court if the youth was twelve years old or older at the time of the conduct and is alleged to have committed one of several enumerated offenses. Section 41-5-206(1), MCA. If, however, the youth was seventeen years old at the time of the alleged enumerated offense, the county attorney must petition for leave to file the information in district court. Section 41-5-206(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">\u00b611 In either instance, once leave to file the information is granted, \u201cthe district court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the matter must be transferred back to the youth court,\u201d unless the youth or the youth\u2019s counsel waives the hearing. Section 41-5-206(3), MCA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>The district court may transfer the case to youth court only if it finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">(a) a youth court proceeding and disposition will serve the interests of community protection;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">(b) the nature of the offense does not warrant prosecution in district court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">(c) it would be in the best interests of the youth if the matter was prosecuted in youth court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Section 41-5-206(3), MCA. Each of these factors must be met in order to transfer the case to youth court. Section 41-5-206(3), MCA. In analyzing these factors, a district court, \u201cas factfinder[,] sits in the best position to weigh all of [the] evidence\u201d and \u201cresolve!] conflicting evidence before it.\u201d <em>Dietsch, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15, 16. Generally, we will not overturn a district court\u2019s determinations regarding conflicting evidence. <em>Dietsch, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>accord Whiteman, </em>\u00b6 15 (\u201c[I]t is within the domain of the trial court to resolve conflicts in the evidence based on its assessment of the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses before it, and this Court will not resolve conflicts on appeal.\u201d) (citation and internal quotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">I. Talksabout\u2019s first transfer request.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">\u00b612 In consideringTalksabout\u2019s motion on the first charge, the District Court reviewed the evidence in light of each factor prescribed by \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA. First, as to whether transferring the charge to Youth Court would serve the interests of community protection, the District Court noted that Probation Officer Callahan \u201cexplained that protecting the community is more challenging with older youths, and given his age, Talksabout cannot complete sex offender treatment before he turns 18 years-old.\u201d The court emphasized Probation Officer Callahan\u2019s testimony that unlike in district court, sex offender registration is not required in a Youth Court disposition. The court noted its concern that prior to the transfer hearing, \u201cTalksabout absconded while released on his own recognizance, failed to appear for Court, and committed a new offense by shoplifting from a local department store.\u201d The court expressed further concern that Talksabout was under investigation for a separate sex offense involving a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">\u00b613 The court acknowledged that Talksabout\u2019s grandmother cared for and was committed to her grandson. But it opined that \u201cTalksabout is not provided with much structure or discipline [at his grandmother\u2019s home], as evidenced by dropping out of school and allegedly committing the present offense while out of the house in the middle of the night without his grandmother\u2019s knowledge.\u201d Finally, the court noted its concern over Talksabout\u2019s \u201cvictim impact statements\u201d from Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Smelko\u2019s report. The statements conveyed that Talksabout believed that he was the real victim in the situation, exhibiting a lack of empathy and accountability. After considering all of the evidence, the District Court concluded that transferring the case to Youth Court was not in the interests of community protection given \u201cTalksabout\u2019s age, home environment, conduct while on release, minimization of his alleged conduct, and need for more structured supervision if convicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZq\">\u00b614 The District Court next considered whether the nature of the offense warranted prosecution in district court. The court noted that in analyzing this factor, it was required to examine the nature of the allegations and not just the offense itself. (Citing <em>Whiteman, </em>\u00b6 13.) The court declared that \u201cthere are few offenses more serious than sexual intercourse without consent\u00ed,] and using intoxicants to perpetrate such an offense is inexcusable.\u201d The court then summarized Detective Stimac\u2019s testimony, stating that \u201cTalksabout knew the victim\u2019s age and that she was menstruating, yet proceeded to undress her, digitally penetrate her, remove her clothes, and vaginally penetrate her on multiple occasions.\u201d The court noted that during the transfer hearing, \u201cTalksabout\u2019s counsel faulted the victim for becoming intoxicated, flirting with multiple boys at the party, and grabbing Talksabout\u2019s genitals.\u201d The court stated not only that it was unpersuaded by Talksabout\u2019s \u201cimplicit assertion\u201d that \u201c \u2018date rape\u2019 is a crime of lesser gravity,\u201d but that such a belief \u201cis as repugnant as it is unsupported.\u201d The District Court concluded that the nature of the allegations warranted prosecution in District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u00b615 Addressing whether transferring the case to Youth Court would be in Talksabout\u2019s best interest, the court recognized Dr. Smelko\u2019s testimony that \u201cprosecution in District Court will harm Talksabout\u2019s cognitive and behavioral development, increase his risk to reoffend, and he matches the profile of an offender that can be treated in Youth Court.\u201d The court noted that the State presented very little evidence to contradict Talksabout\u2019s position. The court therefore determined that Talksabout\u2019s best interests weighed in favor of transferring the case to Youth Court. Because Talksabout failed to establish two out of the three elements for transfer under \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA, the court denied the transfer to Youth Court and retained jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b616 On appeal, Talksabout contends that the District Court abused its discretion by finding that the interests of community protection and the nature of the offense warranted prosecution in district court. Talksabout argues that the court\u2019s findings on these two elements were not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\u00b617 Regarding the interests of the community, Talksabout contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>that the evidence established that he had no prior violent criminal or drug history, that his grandmother could provide adequate supervision and make him comply with probation, and that Youth Court could provide adequate supervision. Talksabout contends further that the District Court improperly disregarded Dr. Smelko\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b618 Addressing the nature of the offense, Talksabout claims that the District Court was unwilling to consider any so-called \u201cmitigating facts.\u201d These facts include: that Talksabout is \u201ca developmentally immature 17-year-old\u201d; that he \u201cvaginally penetrated without consent a peer-age intoxicated 14-year-old\u201d; that the other individuals at the party were teenagers and there was alcohol at the party; that the victim \u201ckissed several boys at the party, and one youth stated A.C. actually put her hands down [Talksabout\u2019s] pants\u201d; that another boy \u201cfirst assaulted A.C. in a room alone\u201d; that Talksabout \u201cwalked A.C. home and kissed her good night\u201d after sexually assaulting her; and that Talksabout apparently thought A.C. was old enough to consent. Talksabout again asserts that the District Court failed to adequately consider Dr. Smelko\u2019s testimony in analyzing this factor. Talksabout relies heavily on the fact that the other boy charged in connection with the same incident had his transfer request approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b619 Talksabout does not argue that the District Court committed any error of law. The Dissent contends, however, that the court erred in its interpretation of the transfer statute by failing to consider the \u201cnature of the offense\u201d in light of certain objectives of the Youth Court Act. In the absence of \u201cspecific criteria\u201d by which to evaluate the nature of the offense, the Dissent proposes a new standard under which a district court must specifically consider certain legislative purposes articulated in \u00a7 41-5-102, MCA. Dissent, \u00b6 66. But the legislative purpose governing transfer is that expressly articulated in \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA, and requires a preponderance of evidence on all three factors in order for the District Court to transfer the matter to Youth Court for adjudication. The Youth Court Act\u2019s purposes are subsumed in \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(a) and (c), MCA, under which the District Court must analyze both the interests of community protection and the best interests of the youth. A youth\u2019s best interests include the remedial purposes the Dissent reiterates from the Youth Court Act\u2019s general purposes provision, \u00a7 41-5-102(2)-(3), MCA. Dissent, \u00b6 68. And the District Court found that the preponderance of the evidence did support a finding that transfer to Youth Court was in Talksabout\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u00b620 The Dissent cites no case applying \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA, since its 1997 amendment. Case law construing the current statute confirms that the District Court must look to the nature of the allegations\u2014and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>not just the <em>seriousness </em>of the offense\u2014in analyzing whether the nature of the offense warrants prosecution in district court. <em>Whiteman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-15. The statute commits the question of transfer to Youth Court to the District Court\u2019s discretion. Section 41-5-206(3), MCA; <em>Dietsch, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>Whiteman, </em>\u00b6 19. We are not persuaded from our review of the record that the District Court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. The record substantiates the court\u2019s findings that Talksabout failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that transferring the case to Youth Court would serve the interests of community protection and that the nature of the offense did not warrant prosecution in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"Af8\">\u00b621  The record establishes that the District Court did not act arbitrarily or fail to employ conscientious judgment when it concluded that \u201cTalksabout\u2019s age, home environment, conduct while on release, minimization of his alleged conduct, and need for more structured supervision if convicted, make[] the District Court a more appropriate forum to supervise Talksabout.\u201d Nor did the court exceed the bounds of reason in concluding that the nature of the offense warranted prosecution in the District Court. Talksabout was accused of undressing and forcibly having sexual intercourse with an intoxicated fourteen-year-old after repeatedly being told no. Though both Dr. Smelko and Talksabout\u2019s grandmother provided testimony to support Talksabout\u2019s contentions, the District Court was in the best position to resolve the conflicting evidence before it. <em>Dietsch, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15, 16. The District Court did not have to accept Talksabout\u2019s \u201cmitigating facts,\u201d which it found to suggest the victim\u2019s responsibility for the incident. The evidence strongly indicated that, if convicted, Talksabout would need sex offender treatment. Talksabout expressed unwillingness to enter treatment, however, and denied that his conduct \u201csexually offended against\u201d A.C. Even though he had not yet admitted to the offense, Talksabout put this evidence before the court through Dr. Smelko, and the District Court did not clearly err in considering it for the purpose of evaluating the nature of the offense and the interests of community protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b622 It is not the appellate court\u2019s function to undertake, as the Dissent does, a <em>de novo </em>review of the record or to raise objections that might have been, but were not, made by the parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead, this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>reviews a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>Whiteman, </em>\u00b6 10. It is the \u201ctrier of fact [that] resolves conflicts in the evidence before it, and this Court will not reevaluate this same evidence on appeal.\u201d <em>Whiteman, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>accord Dietsch, </em>\u00b6 15 (\u201cThe District Court as factfinder sits in the best position to weigh all of this evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b623 The Dissent overlooks our decisions in <em>Whiteman </em>and <em>Dietsch </em>deferring to the district courts\u2019 refusal to transfer cases to Youth Court. In <em>Whiteman, </em>we found substantial credible evidence based on testimony from a corrections administrator and probation officer that the youth court had more limited resources for handling young violent offenders and that \u201cyouth court proceedings would limit the dispositional options to juvenile correctional or treatment facilities and only for the limited time frame of the youth court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Whiteman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-18. In <em>Dietsch, </em>a case involving a sexual offense with circumstances nearly identical to those in the case at bar, we likewise emphasized the district court\u2019s reliance on the youth court\u2019s limited dispositional options, whereas district court prosecution \u201cwould allow dispositional options that would include supervision and rehabilitation Tor a period of up to Dietsch\u2019s remaining natural life.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dietsch, </em>\u00b6 14. We relied on evidence in the record concerning the facts of the alleged offense, Dietsch\u2019s \u201chigh lack of empathy,\u201d and his \u201chighly significant familiarity about sex with underage girls in his community.\u201d <em>Dietsch, </em>\u00b6 16. This evidence, we determined, was sufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding that the nature of the offense did not warrant youth court disposition. <em>Dietsch, </em>\u00b6 16. It is difficult to reconcile <em>Whiteman </em>and <em>Dietsch </em>with the Dissent\u2019s analysis of how the District Court should have analyzed the statutory transfer factors in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"Akm\">\u00b624  Like <em>Whiteman </em>and <em>Dietsch, </em>the evidence presented to the District Court regarding the \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA, factors conflicted. As in those cases, however, the record contains substantial credible evidence to support the District Court\u2019s findings. Bearing in mind that we view the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying Talksabout\u2019s motion to transfer to Youth Court the sexual intercourse without consent charge related to A.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">II. Talksabout\u2019s second transfer request.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u00b625 After hearing Talksabout\u2019s transfer request related to D.P., the District Court again analyzed the \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA, factors and likewise concluded that the factors necessitated retention in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>District Court. Similar to the first order, the District Court was concerned that Talksabout\u2019s age made treatment in Youth Court more difficult. The court noted that Probation Officer Carroll \u201cexpressed concerns over the supervision of Talksabout in Youth Court because he has a negative attitude toward treatment, there are multiple alleged victims, and there is no accountability in Youth Court.\u201d The court emphasized that Dr. Smelko had revised his evaluation to conclude that \u201cTalksabout presents a moderate risk to reoffend.\u201d And the District Court again highlighted Talksabout\u2019s \u201cvictim impact statements\u201d from Dr. Smelko\u2019s report demonstrating that the youth did not take responsibility for his actions. The District Court consequently concluded that the interests of community protection would best be served by continuing the case in district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b626 The court\u2019s findings regarding the nature of the offense were nearly identical to its findings in the first transfer order. The court summarized Detective Stimac\u2019s testimony regardingthe allegations as follows: \u201cTalksabout knew the victim\u2019s age, removed her clothes, the victim protested, Talksabout persisted, and forcibly had sexual intercourse with the 12-year-old victim.\u201d The court also noted that the incident was alleged to have occurred a month before Talksabout\u2019s assault of A.C. The court thus concluded that the nature of the offense warranted prosecution in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b627 Finally, the District Court analyzed whether transfer to Youth Court would be in Talksabout\u2019s best interests. The court again highlighted Dr. Smelko\u2019s testimony. This time, however, the court concluded that \u201cDr. Smelko\u2019s conflicting and incomplete conclusions and diagnoses\u201d supported keeping the case in the District Court. The court explained that Dr. Smelko had conducted new psychological testing on Talksabout\u2019s intellectual functioning that demonstrated he was comparable to an eight- or nine-year-old child. But the court determined that a \u201cclose examination of Dr. Smelko\u2019s report reveals that other than baldly concluding that Talksabout has an eight or nine-year old intellectual ability, Dr. Smelko does not actually conclude that he has an intellectual disability as defined by the American Psychological Association and the United States Supreme Court.\u201d The District Court expressed deep concern regarding Dr. Smelko\u2019s opinion that Talksabout fit the hostile masculinity syndrome personality profile. The court quoted a treatise that the State had referenced in cross-examining Dr. Smelko on this diagnosis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">Hostile masculinity syndrome refers to a personality profile that includes interrelated attitudes and emotions that may be grouped within two primary components: The first consists of hostile, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>distrustful, insecure feelings toward people, particularly women, accompanied by misogynous (woman-hating) attitudes, such as beliefs that rape victims secretly desire to be victimized. The second component consists of a desire to control and dominate women that results in deriving sexual arousal and gratification from such domination over women. Men who have such a syndrome typically also have an insecure sense of masculinity and are hypersensitive to rejection from women. They are frequently highly narcissistic as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The court acknowledged that from a punitive perspective, adult penalties were not in Talksabout\u2019s best interest. The court concluded, however, that from a rehabilitative perspective, Talksabout required treatment\u2014treatment that likely could not be completed if the case were handled in Youth Court. Because effective treatment was in Talksabout\u2019s best interest, the court concluded that this factor weighed against transferring the case to Youth Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b628 On appeal, Talksabout contends that the District Court abused its discretion in denying transfer of the second sexual intercourse without consent charge to Youth Court for reasons similar to its denial on the first charge. Talksabout again asserts that the court\u2019s findings were not supported by substantial evidence. Talksabout argues that the District Court acted arbitrarily in affording Dr. Smelko\u2019s report limited weight. He again relies heavily on Dr. Smelko\u2019s testimony and asserts that Dr. Smelko demonstrated that Talksabout was developmentally immature and required treatment as a youth. Thus, Talksabout contends that the evidence regarding his best interests was not conflicting. Talksabout argues that the District Court erred in relying on the probation officer\u2019s testimony in analyzing the interests of community protection because, in Talksabout\u2019s view, the probation officer was focused on adult supervision and failed to account for the specifics of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b629 Talksabout emphasizes Dr. Smelko\u2019s testimony and the weight the District Court accorded that evidence; but he overlooks that it is the District Court\u2019s role to weigh and resolve conflicts in the evidence before it. <em>Dietsch, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16. That the State did not call its own expert is of no moment; \u201c[a] factfinder remains free to disregard an expert\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Willis v. Fertterer, </em>2013 MT 282, \u00b6 35, 372 Mont. 108, 310 P.3d 544 (citing <em>Stave v. Estate of Rutledge, </em>2005 MT 332, \u00b6 21, 330 Mont. 28, 127 P.3d 365). The State points out that all of the evidence the District Court found concerning \u201cat the first hearing about the nature of the offense and interests of community protection became even more concerning at the second hearing, since Talksabout\u2019s two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>offenses were remarkably similar.\u201d Dr. Smelko had conducted additional testing since the first transfer hearing and acknowledged on cross-examination that Talksabout was impulsive, could be expected to entertain potentially dangerous risks to himself and others\u2014including sexual behaviors\u2014and has a pattern of sexually abusive behavior. The additional evidence presented at the second transfer hearingheightened the District Court\u2019s concerns and provided further evidence substantiating its findings on those two statutory factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b630  There also was substantial evidence supporting the District Court\u2019s conclusion that retaining the second charge was in Talksabout\u2019s best interests. As the court noted, Dr. Smelko \u201creacheldl important conclusions on Talksabout\u2019s risk,\u201d including that Talksabout was a moderate risk to reoffend, his behavior was \u201clikely to be reckless,\u201d and he was \u201cquite impulsive and prone to behaviors likely to be self-harmful or self-destructive.\u201d These observations support the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the treatment and supervision that could be provided under the auspices of the District Court were in Talksabout\u2019s best interest. Moreover, the District Court did not exceed the bounds of reason when it relied on Dr. Smelko\u2019s own conclusion that Talksabout fits the hostile masculinity syndrome personality profile. These were serious concerns that changed Dr. Smelko\u2019s assessment of Talksabout\u2019s recidivism risk. These concerns provide additional support for the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Talksabout would require more intensive supervision and treatment than the Youth Court could provide. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Talksabout\u2019s second transfer motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b631 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in sentencing Talksabout.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\u00b632 A youth who has been charged and convicted in district court must be sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-2503, MCA. Section 41-5-206(6), MCA. In sentencing the youth, the district court must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">(b) retain jurisdiction over the case until the criminally convicted youth reaches the age of 21;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">(c) order the department to submit a status report to the court, county attorney, defense attorney, and juvenile probation officer every 6 months until the youth attains the age of 21. The report must include a recommendation from the department regarding the disposition of the criminally convicted youth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">Section 41-5-2503(l)(b)-(c), MCA. Talksabout contends, and the State concedes, that the case should be remanded to the District Court with instructions to modify the judgment in accordance with these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>requirements. The State does not agree with Talksabout, however, that \u00a7 41-5-2503(2), MCA, also requires the District Court to review Talksabout\u2019s sentence before he turns twenty-one. The State argues that \u00a7 41-5-2510(1), MCA, \u201cspecifically excludes\u201d Talksabout from the sentence review process provided for in \u00a7 41-5-2503(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b633 Section 41-5-2503(2), MCA, provides that the \u201cdistrict court <em>shall </em>review the criminally convicted youth\u2019s sentence pursuant to 41-5-2510 before the youth reaches the age of 21 <em>if </em>a hearing has not been requested under 41-5-2510.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

As the State points out, the District Court could have sentenced Talksabout to one hundred years for his sexual intercourse without consent conviction. Section 45-5-503(2), MCA (prescribing sentencing requirements for sexual intercourse without consent). Thus, under the plain language of \u00a7 41-5-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>2510(1), MCA, Talksabout could not, \u201cat any time\u201d prior to reaching the age of twenty-one, \u201crequest a hearing to review the sentence imposed on [him].\u201d The fact that the statute prohibited Talksabout from requesting an earlier hearing does not, however, bar his sentence from being reviewed. The plain language of \u00a7 41-5-2503(2), MCA, provides that \u201cif a hearing has not been requested under 41-5-2510,\u201d then the District Court must still \u201creview [Talksabout\u2019s] sentence pursuant to 41-5-2510 before [he] reaches the age of 21.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b636 The statute requires the court to hold a hearing within ninety days after a request for hearing is filed \u201cor\u201d the court determines that a sentence review hearing \u201cis required under 41-5-2503.\u201d Section 41-5-2510(2), MCA. After considering evidence presented at the hearing, as well as records pertaining to the youth and any statements from the victim, the youth\u2019s parents or guardian, or other advocates for the youth, the court is required to determine whether a preponderance of the evidence shows that \u201cthe criminally convicted youth has been substantially rehabilitated.\u201d Section 41-5-2510(4), MCA. If it makes a determination of substantial rehabilitation, the sentencing court \u201cshall determine whether to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">(a) suspend all or part of the remaining portion of the sentence, impose conditions and restrictions pursuant to 46-18-201, and place the youth on probation under the direction of the department, unless otherwise specified;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">(b) impose all or part of the remaining sentence and make any additional recommendations to the department regarding the placement and treatment of the criminally convicted youth; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">(c) impose a combination of options allowed under subsections (5)(a) and (5)(b), not to exceed the total sentence remaining.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Section 41-5-2510(5), MCA. These statutes guarantee that a criminally convicted youth has at least one opportunity for the sentencing court to review his rehabilitative progress and either reaffirm or revise his sentence when he turns twenty-one.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">\u00b637 Our interpretation of the Criminally Convicted Youth Act furthers the statutory scheme. The Criminally Convicted Youth Act\u2019s express purposes include protection of the public, holding youth accountable for their crimes, and providing \u201cfor the custody, assessment, care, supervision, treatment, education, rehabilitation, and work and skill development of youth <em>convicted in district court.\u201d </em>Section 41-5-2502(3), MCA (emphasis added). The Act further ties its \u201cexpress legislative purposes\u201d to those set forth in the Youth Court Act\u2019s \u00a7 41-5-102, MCA. Section 41-5-2502(4), MCA. In other words, the Act does not just shuffle a youth off to the adult offender system and forget about his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>age. The rehabilitative goals of both the Youth Court Act and the Criminally Convicted Youth Act follow the youth until he or she reaches the age of twenty-one and the District Court makes an express determination whether to finally impose the full adult sentence. Prohibiting the District Court from reviewing Talksabout\u2019s sentence would defeat the statutory scheme and render pointless the provisions requiring status reports and a \u201crecommendation from the department regarding the [youth\u2019s] disposition\u201d to facilitate the sentencing court\u2019s review. Section 41-5-2503(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b638  We conclude that the District Court erred by not including the requirements found in 41-5-2503(1), MCA, in Talksabout\u2019s sentence.

In refusing to transfer these matters from the District Court to youth court pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA, the District Court erroneously viewed R.T.\u2019s guilt as a fait accompli with the transfer hearings as a springboard to a lengthy prison sentence under the guise that a district court prosecution was a more appropriate forum <em>for his supervision and rehabilitation. </em>While the statutory transfer criteria require district courts to consider various circumstances in the event that a youth is guilty, we should not stamp our imprimatur on a process gone awry in contravention of the evidence, the express purposes of the Act, and a youth\u2019s fundamental rights to the presumption of innocence and to remain silent. I would: (1) reverse the District Court\u2019s transfer hearing orders, thus defaulting these cases to district court jurisdiction due to the expiration of the primary jurisdiction of the youth court at R.T.\u2019s current age of 21, <em>see State v.

The first charged offense (first case) involved a 14-year-old female victim (A.C.) and occurred when R.T. was 17 years old. The second charged incident (second case) involved a 12-year-old female victim (D.P.) and actually occurred about a month before the first case when R.T. was 16 years old. Both incidents similarly occurred at underage parties where R.T. and each victim eventually went into isolated rooms together. In the first case, alone with the intoxicated 14-year-old victim, R.T. undressed her and, after an unsuccessful attempt at penile-vaginal intercourse, subjected her to digital-vaginal intercourse. In the second case, alone with the 12-year-old victim, R.T. undressed her and, despite her having said no, subjected her to penile-vaginal intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u00b642 Due to the youth\u2019s age at the time of the alleged offenses, the State charged both cases directly in district court rather than youth court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-5-206(1), (2), MCA. In each case, the Youth Court Act then required an immediate transfer hearing to determine whether prosecution would be more appropriate in youth court rather than in district court. Section 41-5-206(3), MCA. Upon a hearing, a district court may transfer the prosecution of a youth back to youth court only if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">[1] a youth court proceeding and disposition will serve the interests of community protection;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">[2] the nature of the offense does not warrant prosecution in district court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-11\">[3] [a youth court prosecution would be in the youth\u2019s] best interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-13\">Section 41-5-206(3), MCA. The Act requires courts to interpret and construe the statutory transfer criteria <em>\u201cto effectuate\u201d </em>its \u201cexpress legislative purposes.\u201d Section 41-5-102, MCA (emphasis added); <em>see also State ex rel.

The court must also apply and assess the transfer criteria in accordance with a youth\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>fundamental constitutional rights to the presumption of innocence and to remain silent. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-5-102(4), MCA (court must construe and interpret Act in accordance with youth\u2019s \u201cconstitutional and statutory rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b643 In separate written orders for each transfer hearing, the District Court separately addressed each of the three statutory transfer criteria.

In the second case, the District Court similarly found that the district court was \u201ca more appropriate forum <em>to ... rehabilitate\u201d </em>R.T. based on his \u201cage, home environment, conduct while on release, minimization of his alleged conduct, risk to reoffend and need for more structured supervision.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The stated bases for the District Court\u2019s ultimate \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(a) findings were substantially the same except for R.T.\u2019s upgraded risk to re-offend as an additional consideration in the second case.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">\n<em>R.T.\u2019s Age In Re Supervision and Sex Offender Treatment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AUh\">\u00b645 In both cases, the District Court found that a district court prosecution was \u201ca more appropriate forum\u201d due to R.T.\u2019s \u201cadvanced age.\u201d At the time of the first transfer hearing, R.T. was \u201cless than two months\u201d short of his 18th birthday. He was 18 at the time of the second transfer hearing. The primary youth court jurisdiction extends until a youth is 21 years old with the option of extending probation, subject to district court supervision and adult consequences, until age 25. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Sections 41-5-205(1) and -208, MCA. The District Court found R.T.\u2019s age significant because he would not be able to complete sex offender treatment before age 18, \u201cprotecting the community is more challenging with older youths,\u201d and sex offender registration \u201cis not required\u201d for a youth court disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u00b646 In the first case, the District Court based its community protection finding on Chief Juvenile Probation Officer Tim Callahan\u2019s general statement that \u201cthe older the youth is, the more challenging it can become to deal with.\u201d However, in context, the complete substance of Callahan\u2019s testimony was that supervision of older sex offenders can be challenging in youth court <em>if the youth is unable to complete sex offender treatment by age 21 or, at the latest, age 25. </em>The District Court\u2019s findings inexplicably glossed over Callahan\u2019s specific testimony that \u201cwe could get [R.T.\u2019s sex offender treatment] done\u201d and <em>\u201cwe can protect the community even within the juvenile system.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The State presented, and the District Court cited, no evidence to the contrary. The District Court did not find, and the evidentiary record is insufficient for an implied finding, that R.T. could not or would not complete required sex offender treatment by age 21 or, at the latest, age 25 under youth court supervision. The District Court similarly did not find, and the evidentiary record is similarly insufficient for an implied finding, that a youth court supervision would not serve the interests of community protection contrary to the unequivocal and unrebutted testimony of the Chief Probation Officer and Dr. Bowman Smelko, Psy.D, ABPP.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The hearing record was simply devoid of any conflicting evidence to weigh. The District Court clearly mischaracterized or, at least, misapprehended the first hearing evidence regarding the suitability of a youth court supervision to serve the interests of community protection. Review of the record clearly manifests that the District Court made a mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u00b647 The District Court similarly mischaracterized or misapprehended the import of the distinction between district court and youth court sex offender registration. The District Court inaccurately characterized sex offender registration as \u201cnot required\u201d in youth court. As a matter of law, sex offender registration is mandatory in youth court unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>court specifically finds that \u201cregistration is not necessary\u201d to protect the public and exemption of a youth \u201cis in the public\u2019s best interest.\u201d Sections 46-23-504(1), 41-5-1513(1)(d), MCA. If the youth court does not exempt a youth from sex offender registration, the youth, like an adult offender, must then register for the remainder of his or her life unless the court later relieves the registration requirement in the public interest after a period of 10 years for Level 1 (low risk) offenders or after 25 years for Level 2 (moderate risk) offenders. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-23-506, MCA; <em>compare </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46-23-504(1) <em>with </em>41-5-1513(1)(d), MCA. Thus, the District Court\u2019s mischaracterization, or at least, misapprehension of the import of the distinction between district court and youth court sex offender registration clearly did not support its ultimate finding that a youth court proceeding would not serve the interests of community protection. The District Court mistakenly relied on that insignificant distinction as a basis for its required \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(a) finding that a youth court prosecution would not serve the interests of community protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u00b648 Strangely enough, the State did not recall the Chief Probation Officer to testify at the second transfer hearing. It instead presented, and the District Court relied on, the opinion of Montana Department of Corrections Adult Probation and Parole (AP&amp;P) Officer Susan Carroll who essentially testified that a district court prosecution would <em>better </em>serve the interests of community protection due to the challenge of \u201csupervising adult sex offenders,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the more punitive district court probation violation consequences, and because it was then apparent that R.T. had committed two offenses rather than one. However, R.T. was not an \u201cadult sex offender.\u201d As a matter of fact, he was a juvenile sex offender subject to potential district court supervision as an adult.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Regardless of this fine distinction, the District Court\u2019s findings reference only the AP&amp;P officer\u2019s general statements that R.T.\u2019s age \u201cmakes treatment more difficult,\u201d he \u201cmight not complete treatment,\u201d and R.T. \u201chas a negative attitude toward treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\u00b649 Except for the potentially longer supervision period and punitive probation violation consequences in district court, neither the AP&amp;P officer\u2019s testimony, nor the District Court\u2019s findings, state or indicate any reason why, how, or on what basis district court supervision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>R.T.\u2019s compliance with sex offender treatment or other probation conditions would better protect the public than youth court supervision of those same conditions. The risk that that R.T. \u201cmight not\u201d timely complete sex offender treatment was highly speculative and, in any event, the same in district court as in youth court. The State presented, and the District Court found, no particularized non-speculative evidence that the youth court jurisdiction would be insufficient to protect the public by ensuring that R.T. would timely complete required sex offender treatment before age 21 or, at the latest, age 25. To the contrary, despite her stated concerns and preference for a district court prosecution, the AP&amp;P officer grudgingly admitted at the second hearing that the youth court could safely supervise R.T. in the community. The State presented no evidence to the contrary. In light of her grudging admission regarding the capability of a youth court supervision, the AP&amp;P officer\u2019s <em>mere preference </em>for a district court supervision was hardly sufficient to contradict or outweigh the unequivocal testimony of Dr. Smelko, and the similarly unequivocal earlier testimony of the Chief Probation Officer, that the youth court could safely supervise R.T. in the community. Thus, the mere facts of R.T.\u2019s age, the possibility that he might violate his sex offender treatment or other probation conditions, and that district court probation violation consequences were more punitive clearly did not support the District Court\u2019s \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(a) finding that a youth court prosecution would not serve the interests of community protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\n<em>R.T.\u2019s Home Environment and Need for More Structured Supervision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u00b650 In further support of its findings that a district court prosecution was a \u201cmore appropriate forum\u201d to supervise and rehabilitate R.T., the District Court found that R.T. had little family \u201cstructure or discipline\u201d and needed more structured supervision. The District Court based this finding on the facts that R.T.\u2019s elderly grandmother had raised him since birth, he dropped out of school at 16 to assist her, and he snuck out of his grandmother\u2019s home late at night to go to the underage drinking party where the incident with the 14-year-old victim occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"Anc\">\u00b651 However, other than a ticket for failing to wear a helmet at a skate park, R.T. had no prior criminal record. The State presented no evidence indicating that R.T. had any prior delinquent, violent, predatory, deviant, mentally unstable, or anti-social history or tendencies. Regardless of his ultimate guilt or innocence in this case, the fact that, like most Montanans, R.T. was not raised in an idyllic nuclear family setting did not ipso facto make him a risk to community safety. The State presented no evidence that R.T.\u2019s imperfect family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>structure increased any case-related risk that he might commit another sex offense, that youth court supervision could not adequately protect the community from that risk, or that district court supervision could better protect the community from that risk. Whether subject to district court or youth court supervision, a probation officer would closely supervise R.T. on probation. The State presented, and the District Court found, no evidence indicating that district court supervision would provide more structure for community protection than youth court supervision. Thus, R.T.\u2019s imperfect family structure clearly did not support the District Court\u2019s ultimate finding under \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-206(3)(a) and -102, MCA, that a youth court proceeding would not serve the interests of community protection. Upon review of the record, the District Court mistakenly relied on R.T.\u2019s imperfect family structure as a basis for its \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(a) finding that a youth court prosecution would not serve the interests of community protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\n<em>R.T.\u2019s Conduct While on Release</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b652 In further support of its findings that a district court prosecution was a \u201cmore appropriate forum\u201d to supervise and rehabilitate R.T., the District Court found that he had \u201cabsconded\u201d by failing to appear for court and had committed a new shoplifting offense while earlier released on his own recognizance. However, the District Court made no finding as to the <em>reason </em>for R.T.\u2019s failure to appear for the earlier hearing, whether due to his own irresponsible disregard, lack of notice, or miscommunication with appointed counsel or his grandmother. There was certainly no finding that R.T. ran away from home for any significant period or that he attempted to flee to avoid prosecution. The District Court\u2019s finding that R.T. \u201cabsconded\u201d was a dramatic overstatement of the evidence. The District Court\u2019s findings are also conspicuously devoid of any finding, or sufficient record basis for an implied finding, indicating any logical nexus between R.T.\u2019s sex offense recidivism risk and his earlier failure to appear for a hearing or the unrelated misdemeanor shoplifting offense. Thus, R.T.\u2019s failure to appear for a hearing and the unrelated shoplifting offense clearly did not support the required finding under \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(a), MCA, that a youth court proceeding would not serve the interests of community protection. Upon review of the record, the District Court\u2019s reliance on those considerations as bases for its \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(a) finding in favor of a district court prosecution was clearly mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\n<em>R.T.\u2019s Minimization and Rights to Presumption of Innocence and to Remain Silent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">\u00b653 In both transfer orders, the District Court found that R.T.\u2019s \u201cminimization of his alleged conduct\u201d supported its ultimate \u00a7 41-5-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>206(3)(a) finding that the district court was a \u201cmore appropriate forum\u201d to supervise and rehabilitate him. The District Court found that R.T. minimized his \u201calleged conduct\u201d in statements taken from Dr. Smelko\u2019s pre-adjudication psychosexual evaluation report, paraphrased in the report and listed in the District Court\u2019s findings as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">\u2022 I am the real victim in the current situation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">\u2022 I do not agree with the police report describing my offenses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">\u2022 I do not believe my sexual behavior messed up my victim</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">\u2022 I do not have a sexual problem [sic] to work out and treatment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">\u2022 I am not willing to enter treatment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">\u2022 I never sexually offended against this person</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">In essence, the District Court found that the youth court could not safely treat and supervise R.T. because he: (1) continued to deny his guilt; (2) denied that he needed sex offender treatment; and (3) would not willingly submit to sex offender treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">\u00b654 As a threshold matter, no connective record facts bridge the vast evidentiary divide between the mere fact that R.T. continued to deny guilt and its consequences <em>under a pre-conviction not guilty plea </em>and the postconviction likelihood that he would be more able or willing to complete sex offender treatment and probation under youth court or district court supervision. In the manifest absence such a critical evidentiary bridge, the mere fact of R.T.\u2019s continued denial of guilt and its consequences was simply not probative of whether he would or would not have been less likely to successfully complete sex offender treatment and probation under youth court supervision than district court supervision. Further compounding this manifest evidentiary shortfall was the unrebutted testimony of Dr. Smelko and the Chief Juvenile Probation Officer, with the AP&amp;P officer\u2019s grudging admission, that the youth court <em>could </em>safely treat and supervise R.T. in the community. On this basis alone, R.T.\u2019s pre-adjudication \u201cminimization of his alleged conduct\u201d clearly does not support the District Court\u2019s finding that a youth court prosecution would not serve the interests of community protection. Thus, to the extent based on R.T.\u2019s pre-adjudication minimization of his conduct, the District Court\u2019s adverse \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(a) finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">\u00b655 However, the District Court\u2019s focus on R.T.\u2019s pre-adjudication denial of guilt and its consequences is even more problematic.

In the second transfer hearing, with the additional reference to the AP&amp;P officer\u2019s testimony that R.T. \u201chas a negative attitude toward [sex offender] treatment,\u201d the District Court again relied on the \u201cminimization\u201d to offset Dr. Smelko\u2019s testimony that, despite the upgrade of R.T.\u2019s risk-tier designation to a Level 2 (moderate risk to re-offend),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the youth court could still safely treat and supervise him in the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u00b657 The sole purpose of a youth court transfer hearing is to determine whether the prosecution should proceed in district court or youth court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA. While the statutory transfer criteria necessarily require the district court to assess a youth\u2019s circumstances in the event of a conviction, the court may not apply or assess them in a manner that contravenes or imposes adverse consequences on a youth\u2019s exercise of his or her fundamental rights to remain silent and to the presumption of innocence. Despite perfunctory recognition that R.T. \u201cha[d] not pled guilty,\u201d the District Court\u2019s consideration of R.T.\u2019s refusal to admit guilt, and its consequences, as a basis for the District Court\u2019s adverse \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(a) finding violated R.T.\u2019s rights to the presumption of innocence and to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"Adsc\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u00b658 Recognizing this problem, the State asserts on appeal that R.T. waived his rights by presenting Dr. Smelko\u2019s testimony. However, nothing in Dr. Smelko\u2019s testimony, his report, or the District Court\u2019s findings indicates any statement by R.T. directly or indirectly admitting guilt. To the contrary, the problem was that the District Court penalized R.T. for <em>not </em>admitting guilt and accepting the consequences thereof. Thus, the State\u2019s implied waiver theory had no application to the District Court\u2019s infringement of R.T.\u2019s rights to the presumption of innocence and to remain silent based on his refusal to admit guilt or accept the consequences of guilt.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Al1\">\u00b659 The State\u2019s waiver theory applies, if at all, only to the threshold disclosure of R.T.\u2019s statements. By analogy, the youth court may order a pre-dispositional \u201cpsychological evaluation\u201d of a youth \u201cif the youth waives the youth\u2019s constitutional rights in the manner provided for in\u201d \u00a7 41-5-331, MCA. Section 41-5-1503, MCA. At the time of the pre-adjudication psychosexual evaluation, R.T. was a 17-year-oldhigh school dropout. There is no evidence that he affirmatively waived his right to remain silent at or prior to the evaluation. There is no evidence that counsel assisted R.T. at the evaluation. R.T. did not testify at either hearing and did not affirmatively waive his right to remain silent on either hearing record. Dr. Smelko was an independent MSOTA-qualified mental health expert apparently commissioned by defense counsel. He was not R.T.\u2019s agent or treating medical provider. There is no evidence that anyone counseled or advised R.T. that statements made to Dr. Smelko in that clinical setting could potentially be used against him in court. Dr. Smelko\u2019s testimony did not reference or otherwise introduce R.T.\u2019s statements into the hearing record. Neither the State, nor defense counsel, offered Dr. Smelko\u2019s report into evidence. The Court demanded to see the report <em>sua sponte. </em>Under the totality of the circumstances, R.T. did not waive his right to remain silent based on defense counsel\u2019s mere presentation of Dr. Smelko\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b660 The District Court\u2019s improper consideration ofhis refusal to admit guilt and its consequences was highly prejudicial. It was a, if not the, central justification for the District Court\u2019s \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(a) finding that a youth court prosecution would not serve the interests of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>community protection. Thus, to the extent based on R.T.\u2019s pre-adjudication minimization of his conduct, the District Court\u2019s adverse \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(a) finding was independently erroneous as a matter of law in violation of R.T.\u2019s fundamental rights to the presumption of innocence and to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\n<em>Multiple Offenses and More Punitive District Court Consequences</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Abb\">\u00b661 In further support of its second hearing finding that a district court prosecution was a \u201cmore appropriate forum\u201d to rehabilitate R.T., the District Court\u2019s findings gave significant weight to AP&amp;P Officer Susan Carroll\u2019s opinion that a district court prosecution would better serve the interests of community protection because R.T. was now accused of two sex offenses and a district court prosecution had more punitive consequences. Indeed, the fact that R.T. was accused of two sex offenses involving minors in the span of a month was obviously a valid community protection concern. However, the exclusive focus of the parties and the District Court at both transfer hearings was whether a district court or youth court <em>supervision </em>would best serve the interests of community protection.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nowhere in the record is there any suggestion, evidence or court finding that an unsuspended prison sentence of any length might be necessary to serve the interests of community protection.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\u00b662 Even as to probation, it was not enough for the District Court to merely consider whether district court probation violation consequences were \u201cmore appropriate\u201d than youth court consequences. If the focus of a transfer hearing becomes the sufficiency of probation violation consequences, \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(a), MCA, still requires the court to consider whether youth court probation violation consequences, including adult supervision and potential imprisonment until age 25, would \u201cserve the interests of community protection.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-5-102(2), MCA (Act must be interpreted and construed \u201cto effectuate\u201d its express remedial purpose of providing \u201cavoidable consequences\u201d for misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>through \u201csupervision, care, rehabilitation, detention, competency development, and community protection\u201d); <em>see also </em>D.M.B., \u00b6 12. In no other way can courts balance the Youth Court Act\u2019s dual, but not necessarily competing, purposes of youth remediation and public protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b663 Here, the evidence that the youth court could safely treat and supervise R.T. in the community was the <em>only </em>specific community protection <em>evidence </em>at either transfer hearing. At the first hearing, the evidence was the unqualified opinions of the independent, MSOTA-qualified psychosexual expert and the Chief Juvenile Probation Officer. At the second hearing, the evidence was the unqualified opinions of the psychosexual expert and the admission of the AP&amp;P officer. In light of her admission that the youth court could safely supervise R.T. in the community, the AP&amp;P officer\u2019s stated preference for a district court prosecution clearly did not support the required \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(a) finding that a youth court disposition would not serve the interests of community protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b664 In advance of the second transfer hearing, Dr. Smelko upgraded R.T.\u2019s SVOR risk-tier designation from a Level 1 (low risk to reoffend) to a Level 2 (moderate risk to re-offend), but nonetheless maintained his unequivocal opinion that the youth court could safely treat and supervise R.T. in the community. The State presented no contrary expert testimony or other evidence. In contrast to the District Court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>critique of Dr. Smelko\u2019s opinion that a youth court prosecution would be in R.T.\u2019s best interests, the District Court\u2019s findings did not dispute Dr. Smelko\u2019s still unrebutted opinion that the youth court could safely treat and supervise R.T. in the community. Thus, without more, the mere facts that R.T. was now accused of two sex offenses and that the district court had more punitive probation violation consequences clearly did not support the required finding under \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(a), MCA, that a youth court proceeding would not serve the interests of community protection. Upon review of the record, the District Court mistakenly relied on those considerations as bases for its \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(a) finding in favor of a district court prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"Ana\">\u00b665 In summary, the District Court\u2019s ultimate \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(a) finding that a youth court proceeding would not serve the interests of community protection is clearly erroneous as matter of fact. The evidence in the transfer hearing records clearly supported an affirmative finding that a youth court proceeding and disposition would serve the interests of community protection. The District Court\u2019s finding is also independently erroneous as a matter of law in violation of R.T.\u2019s fundamental rights to the presumption of innocence and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\"><em>2.

Section 41-5-206(1), (2), MCA. By legal consequence and factual nature, these offenses are the most serious offenses under Montana law. Consequently, as a mandatory condition precedent for transfer of any of these cases from district court back to the youth court, the district court must find that \u201cthe nature of the offense does not warrant prosecution in district court.\u201d Section 41-5-206(3)(b), MCA. The Act provides no specific criteria or standard to guide the court, or inform youths, on what basis or under what circumstances the \u201cnature\u201d of these most serious offenses would \u201cnot warrant prosecution in district court.\u201d However, as an overarching guide, the district court must still construe and interpret \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(b), MCA, \u201cto effectuate\u201d the \u201cexpress legislative purposes\u201d of the Youth Court Act. Section 41-5-102, MCA.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">\u00b667 In the first case, the District Court based its \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(b) finding on the seriousness of the alleged facts that the 17-year-old R.T.: (1) knew the victim was only 14 years old; (2) encouraged her to use \u201cintoxicants\u201d; and (3) undressed and subjected her to digital and penile intercourse without her consent while she was intoxicated. On the hearing record and in its subsequent written order, the District Court then further found \u201crepugnant\u201d what it perceived as victim-blaming and a false distinction between \u201cdate rape\u201d and \u201cforcible rape.\u201d In the second case, the District Court exclusively focused on the seriousness of alleged facts that the 16-year-old R.T.: (1) \u201cmay have been under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>influence of marijuana\u201d; (2) knew the victim was only 12 years old; and (3) removed the victim\u2019s clothes and subjected her to intercourse over her verbal protests and physical resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b668 However, mere focus on the seriousness or severity of the alleged facts is not enough under \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(b), MCA. As a matter of law, courts must carefully consider whether, despite the serious nature of the alleged facts, a youth court proceeding could accomplish or effect the Act\u2019s express non-punitive, remedial purposes to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">(1) provide \u201cimmediate, consistent, enforceable, and avoidable consequences\u201d for misconduct through \u201csupervision, care, rehabilitation, detention, competency development, and community protection;\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">(2) maintain youth \u201cin a family environment whenever possible, separating the youth ... only when necessary for the welfare of the youth or for the safety and protection of the community.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Section 41-5-102(2) to (3), MCA; <em>see also D.M.B., </em>\u00b6 12 (mandatory nature of \u00a7 41-5-102, MCA); <em>see also In re J.D.W., </em>267 Mont. 87, 91-94, 881 P.2d 1324, 1327-29 (1994) (erroneous transfer to district court based on reference to longer district court jurisdiction without consideration of adequacy of youth court jurisdiction in re Act\u2019s criteria and remedial purposes) (modified in part by statutory amendment). If a youth court prosecution <em>cannot </em>accomplish or effect the express purposes of the Act due to the nature of the facts and circumstances of a particular case, then the nature of the case warrants a district court prosecution under \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(b), MCA. On the other hand, if a youth court prosecution <em>can </em>accomplish or effect the express purposes of the Act despite the serious nature of the facts and circumstances of the case, then the nature of the case warrants a youth court prosecution under \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(b), MCA. Though district courts of course have broad discretion to make these determinations on a case-by-case basis, they cannot simply disregard or gloss over them. Unmoored from its express remedial purposes, mere focus on the seriousness of the facts and circumstances of a case would defeat the Act\u2019s mandatory legislative purposes and effectively mean that no case with serious or severe facts and circumstances would warrant youth court prosecution under any circumstance. <em>See In re Stevenson, </em>167 Mont. 220, 228-29, 538 P.2d 5, 9-10 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">\u00b669 Incredibly, the Majority contends that such consideration and balancing of the express legislative purposes of the Act would effect a \u201cnew standard\u201d for determining whether the serious nature of an offense would not warrant a district court prosecution under \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(b), MCA. The Majority essentially contends that, as a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>the 1997 amendment of \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA, the \u201cnature of the offense\u201d is now a stand-alone transfer criterion focused solely on a standardless assessment of the severity of the alleged facts of offenses which are already the most serious offenses under Montana law. Conspicuously missing from the Majority analysis is any analysis or explanation indicating any legal standard or factual scenario under which the factual basis for offenses that are already the most serious of offenses would <em>not </em>preclude a youth court prosecution under \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b670 Even more problematic, the Majority simply ignores the Legislature\u2019s express command that courts \u201cinterpret and construe\u201d the Youth Court Act <em>\u201cto effect\u201d </em>its \u201cexpress legislative purposes.\u201d Section 41-5-102, MCA (emphasis added). How the Majority construes \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(b), MCA, to be exempt or excluded from the unqualified mandate of \u00a7 41-5-102(2) to (3), MCA, is mystifying. The fact, as asserted by the Majority, that this Court has yet to squarely consider the interplay between \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-102(2) to (3) and -206(3)(b), MCA, is a patently insufficient basis to endorse and uphold unfettered district court discretion over the express legislative command of \u00a7 41-5-102(2) to (3), MCA. The mandatory language of \u00a7 41-5-102, MCA, is not a new standard\u2014it is an old standard that this Court is duty-bound to enforce regardless of the outcome in a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u00b671 Here, in both cases, the District Court\u2019s \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(b) consideration and findings went no further than noting the seriousness of the offenses and alleged facts. Neither the District Court\u2019s findings, nor either of the hearing records, indicate any careful consideration of whether, despite the seriousness of the offenses and factual allegations, a youth court prosecution could accomplish or effect the Act\u2019s dual, and not necessarily mutually exclusive, legislative purposes of youth remediation and community protection. Though the District Court correctly found that the alleged facts were serious and egregious in nature, those findings of fact are incomplete under \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-206(3)(b) and -102, MCA, without reconciliation with the express legislative purposes of the Act. Thus, whether viewed as an erroneous application of law or based on insufficient evidence, the District Court\u2019s ultimate \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(b) finding that the nature of these cases warranted district court prosecution was clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number><em>3.

In the first case, noting Dr. Smelko\u2019s unrebutted testimony and the State\u2019s failure to present any contradictory evidence, the District Court found that a youth court proceeding would be in R.T.\u2019s best interests due to the inevitable harm that an adult court prosecution would cause to R.T.\u2019s \u201ccognitive and behavioral development.\u201d However, in the second case, the District Court contrarily found that \u201cDr. Smelko\u2019s conflicting and incomplete conclusions and diagnoses, the pre-trial nature of his evaluation, [R.T.\u2019s] moderate risk to reoffend, and Dr. Smelko\u2019s serious concerns about [R.T.\u2019s] prognosis for intervention (especially the hostile masculinity syndrome) necessitate retention of this case in [d]istrict [c]ourt.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u00b673 As a threshold matter, the District Court\u2019s reliance on the \u201cpretrial nature\u201d of Dr. Smelko\u2019s evaluation is puzzling. By definition, a youth court transfer hearing is a preliminary, pre-adjudicatory hearing with the sole purpose to determine whether the case should proceed as a district court or youth court prosecution. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA. As such, the highly relevant risk factor and amenability to community treatment and supervision analyses of an MSOTA-qualified mental health professional must necessarily be \u201cpre-trial [in] nature.\u201d The mere fact that a psychosexual evaluation was a pre-adjudication evaluation does not per se diminish its probative value under \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\u00b674 The District Court further assigned \u201climited weight\u201d to Dr. Smelko\u2019s diagnosis of R.T.\u2019s limited \u201cintellectual ability\u201d and risk analysis conclusions because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The standards for a psychosexual evaluation prescribed by the Montana Sex Offender Treatment Association provide, \u201cEvaluations received by the pre-sentence investigator that have been performed prior to an admission of guilt by the offender <em>may not meet the requirements of these Standards.\u201d See </em>Montana Sex Offender Treatment Association, <em>Standards for Evaluation and Ongoing Assessment of Adult Sexual Offenders, </em>June 16, 2014, at p. 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">(Emphasis in original.) However, as manifest in the quotation, the referenced standard disclaimer is applicable only to the <em>postconviction </em>MSOTA-qualified psychosexual evaluations required in presentence and predispositional investigation reports. <em>See also </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46-18-11 1(1)(b), 46-23-509, 41-5-1513(2), MCA. Though often highly relevant to youth court transfer criteria, the Youth Court Act does not similarly require psychosexual evaluations for pre-adjudication youth court transfer hearings. Moreover, even to the extent pertinent, the cited MSOTA disclaimer says no more than that pre-adjudication psychosexual evaluations <em>may </em>not satisfy MSOTA standards. Consequently, at most, a question of fact <em>may </em>exist in a particular case as to the MSOTA standard sufficiency of a pre-adjudication evaluation. The District Court did not find, and the record does not reflect, any <em>evidence </em>indicating that Dr. Smelko\u2019s pre-adjudication psychosexual evaluation did <em>not </em>meet MSOTA standards. Neither party, nor the District Court, questioned Dr. Smelko about the subsequently cited MSOTA disclaimer and it was not otherwise at issue at the hearing. The District Court\u2019s unsupported reference to the MSOTA disclaimer is no more than speculative innuendo, devoid of probative value on the record in this case. The District Court abused its discretion in speculatively discounting Dr. Smelko\u2019s psychosexual evaluation analysis based on the cited MSOTA disclaimer.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b675 Upon close examination of the predicate findings, the District Court\u2019s reference to \u201cincomplete conclusions and diagnoses\u201d referred to Dr. Smelko\u2019s diagnoses that R.T. had the \u201cintellectual ability\u201d of an 8 to 9 year old and was \u201c \u2018borderline\u2019 mentally retarded.\u201d In support of that characterization, the District Court\u2019s findings reflect considerable <em>sua sponte </em>critique of Dr. Smelko\u2019s clinical methodology and reasoning by abstract reference to cited federal authority and internally referenced standards of the American Psychological Association. No record expert testimony supported the critique and the District Court nonetheless relied upon the primary thrust of Dr. Smelko\u2019s testimony in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u00b676 In that regard, the District Court seized upon \u201cDr. Smelko\u2019s serious concerns about [R.T.\u2019s] prognosis for intervention (especially the hostile masculinity syndrome).\u201d Of obvious concern to himself, the State, and the District Court, Dr. Smelko concluded, upon additional evaluation after the first hearing, that R.T. seems to also fit \u201cthe <em>Hostile Masculinity </em>[psychological] subtype\u201d characterized by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">hostile, distrustful, insecure feelings toward people, particularly women, accompanied by misogynous (woman-hating) attitudes, such as beliefs that rape victims secretly desire to be victimized ... [and the] desire to control and dominate women that results in deriving sexual arousal and gratification from such domination over women.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Based on this serious concern, Dr. Smelko upgraded his prior assessment of R.T.\u2019s risk-tier designation from a Level 1 (low risk to re-offend) to a Level 2 (moderate risk to re-offend). Despite its narrow critique of R.T.\u2019s diagnosed mental disability, the District Court accepted these central conclusions without challenge or qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"auh-dedup-0\">\u00b677 Dr. Smelko further testified unequivocally that R.T. needed sex offender treatment regardless of whether supervised by the youth court or district court. Again, the District Court agreed. It expressly found that \u201cfrom a rehabilitative side [R.T.] requires treatment\u201d\u2014\u201c[effective treatment is in [R.T.\u2019s] best interest.\u201d The District Court similarly found that \u201cadult penalties are not in [R.TJ\u2019s best interest... that is true in every case.\u201d Thus, neither the District Court\u2019s express findings nor the hearing record manifest any logical basis for concluding under \u00a7 41-5-206(3)(c), MCA, that a youth court prosecution would not be in R.T.\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u00b678 Even if valid, the District Court\u2019s narrow critique of R.T.\u2019s diagnosed mental disability did not undermine or conflict with Dr. Smelko\u2019s unrebutted testimony, as noted in the District Court\u2019s second hearing findings, that a district court prosecution \u201cwill harm [R.T.\u2019s] cognitive and behavioral development and <em>increase </em>his risk to reoffend.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Any infirmity in Dr. Smelko\u2019s mental disability diagnosis similarly did not undermine or conflict with the District Court\u2019s own express findings that \u201ceffective treatment\u201d was in R.T.\u2019s best interests and that \u201cadult penalties\u201d were not. The District Court made no finding, and the record is devoid of any basis for an implied finding, that a district court prosecution rather than a youth court prosecution was necessary to provide R.T. effective sex offender treatment. The District Court\u2019s reliance on its critique of Dr. Smelko\u2019s mental disability diagnosis as a basis for its finding that a youth court prosecution would not be in R.T.\u2019s best interests was a non sequitur. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Thus, the District Court misapprehended the evidence. Its second hearing! 41-5-206(3)(c) finding that youth court supervision would not be in R.T.\u2019s best interests was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\n<em>4. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b679 Consistent with the express legislative purposes of the Youth Court Act, this Court has previously recognized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">Adults and youths are different, and so are the court systems that recognize those differences. The U.S. Supreme Court discussed key differences between juveniles and adults in its landmark decisions holding that the death penalty cannot be imposed on juvenile offenders. <em>Roper v. Simmons, </em>543 U.S. 551, 569-71, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 1195-96, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2005); <em>Thompson v. Oklahoma, </em>487 U.S. 815, 833-38, 108 S. Ct. 2687, 2698-2700, 101 L. Ed. 2d 702 (1988). The youth court system was specifically designed to appropriately address the youthful indiscretions resulting from immaturity. The U.S. Supreme Court discussed <em>how the distinct needs of youths are promoted by ensuring their ongoing access to rehabilitative, rather than punitive, juvenile justice systems.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-9\"><em>In re G.T.M., </em>2009 MT 443, \u00b6 15, 354 Mont. 197, 222 P.3d 626 (emphasis added and citations omitted). This Court has further noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\">Montana recognizes that youths are to be given special treatment by the courts. The youth court system is designed to promote individual rehabilitation and allow young people to learn positive lessons from their transgressions. In youth court, these young people are not subject to the same criminal sanctions as are adults. An express legislative purpose of the Montana Youth Court Act is \u201cto prevent and reduce youth delinquency through a system that does not seek retribution but that provides: (a) immediate, consistent, enforceable, and avoidable consequences of youths\u2019 actions; (b) a program of supervision, care, rehabilitation, detention, competency development, and community protection for youth before they become adult offenders!.]\u201d Section 41-5-102(2), MCA[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-11\"><em>In re Appeal of Cascade Cnty. Dist. Court, </em>2009 MT 355, \u00b6 14, 353 Mont. 194, 219 P.3d 1255 (citations omitted, first alteration original).</p>\n<p id=\"AYi\">\u00b680 Consistent with the express legislative purpose of Montana\u2019s Youth Court Act, and of particular application here, the United States Supreme Court has recognized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-12\"><em>Three general differences </em>between juveniles under 18 and adults <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot with reliability be classified among the worst offenders. </em>First, as any parent knows and as the scientific and sociological studies respondent and his <em>amici </em>cite tend to confirm, \u201c[a] lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility are found in youth more often than in adults and are more understandable among the young. These qualities often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions and decisions.\u201d It has been noted that \u201cadolescents are overrepresented statistically in virtually every category of reckless behavior.\u201d Arnett, <em>Reckless Behavior in Adolescence: A Developmental Perspective, </em>12 Developmental Review 339 (1992). In recognition of the comparative immaturity and irresponsibility of juveniles, almost every State prohibits those under 18 years of age from voting, serving on juries, or marrying without parental consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">The second area of difference is that juveniles are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure. ... \u201c[YJouth is more than a chronological fact. It is a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage.\u201d... This is explained in part by the prevailing circumstance that juveniles have less control, or less experience with control, over their own environment. See Steinberg &amp; Scott, Less Guilty by Reason of Adolescence: Developmental Immaturity, Diminished Responsibility, and the Juvenile Death Penalty, 58 Am. Psychologist 1009, 1014 (2003) (hereinafter Steinberg &amp; Scott) (\u201c[A]s legal minors, [juveniles] lack the freedom that adults have to extricate themselves from a criminogenic setting\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">The third broad difference is that the character of a juvenile is not as well formed as that of an adult. The personality traits of juveniles are more transitory, less fixed. See generally E. Erikson, Identity: Youth and Crisis (1968).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">These differences render suspect any conclusion that a juvenile falls among the worst offenders. The susceptibility of juveniles to immature and irresponsible behavior means \u201ctheir irresponsible conduct is not as morally reprehensible as that of an adult.\u201d Their own vulnerability and comparative lack of control over their immediate surroundings mean juveniles have a greater claim than adults to be forgiven for failing to escape negative influences in their whole environment. The reality that juveniles still struggle to define their identity means it is less supportable to conclude that even a heinous crime committed by a juvenile is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>evidence of irretrievably depraved character. <em>From a moral standpoint it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult, for a greater possibility exists that a minor's character deficiencies will be reformed. </em>Indeed, \u201c[t]he relevance of youth as a mitigating factor derives from the fact that the signature qualities of youth are transient; as individuals mature, the impetuousness and recklessness that may dominate in younger years can subside.\u201d ... see also Steinberg &amp; Scott 1014 (\u201cFor most teens, [risky or antisocial] behaviors are fleeting; they cease with maturity as individual identity becomes settled. Only a relatively small proportion of adolescents who experiment in risky or illegal activities develop entrenched patterns of problem behavior that persist into adulthood\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">... [A] plurality of the Court recognized the import of these characteristics with respect to juveniles under 16.... We conclude <em>the same reasoning applies to all juvenile offendersl.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\"><em>Roper, </em>543 U.S. at 569-71, 125 S. Ct. at 1195-96 (holding death penalty unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment for juvenile offenders) (internal citations omitted and emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\u00b681 In fairness to the District Court, these cases are extremely difficult and devastating to all parties involved\u2014victims and their families, youth offenders and their families, and the communities in which we live. This type of illegal conduct and resulting harm is inexcusable and intolerable. Despite increased public awareness and stepped-up law enforcement, the problem of sex offenses continues to plague our communities and society, often sparking high public interest and concern. However, despite the pernicious nature of this problem and the understandably high public interest and concern, it remains never more imperative in our country and State that we remain vigilant that these types of cases are fairly prosecuted by the calm and objective application of the rule of law to complete and reliable facts, particularly in the case of juvenile offenders. In no other way can our constitutional system provide fair, equal, and objective justice for all.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">\u00b682 Our Youth Court Act, enacted by the people through the Legislature, has laid out a fair and objective framework to deal with these types of cases. The sole question at issue in this case is whether the District Court correctly determined, <em>on the evidence presented in court, </em>that <em>the governing provisions of the Youth Court Act </em>warranted youth court prosecutions or adult prosecutions in district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\u00b683 Glossing over the manifest deficiencies in the District Court\u2019s findings and application of the law, the Majority chides that \u201c[i]t is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>[this Court\u2019s] function to undertake ... a <em>de novo </em>review of the record or to raise objections that might have been, but were not, made by the parties.\u201d True enough. However, it is nonetheless the function, <em>and duty, </em>of this Court to carefully review district court transfer hearing determinations for legal correctness, abuse of discretion based on arbitrary rationale, and clearly erroneous fact findings based on insufficient evidence, misapprehension of the evidence, or firm conviction of mistake. <em>Dietsch, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Whiteman, </em>\u00b6 10. Aside from repeated cursory assertions of broad discretion, the Majority analysis simply falls short of our applicable standards of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b684 For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that, in refusing to transfer these cases back for youth court prosecution and disposition pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA, the District Court abused its discretion in contravention of the record evidence, express purposes of the Act, and R.T.\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights to the presumption of innocence and to remain silent. I would: (1) reverse the District Court\u2019s transfer hearing orders, thus defaulting these cases to district court jurisdiction due to the expiration of the primary jurisdiction of the youth court at R.T.\u2019s current age of 21, <em>see Beach, </em>217 Mont. at 142-44, 705 P.2d at 100-02 (default district court jurisdiction over felony offenses under Mont.
