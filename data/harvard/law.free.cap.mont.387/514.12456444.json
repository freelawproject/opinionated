We reverse and address the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">\n<em>Did the District Court err by holding that USAA did not breach its duty to defend under the homeowner\u2019s policies or the renter\u2019s policy?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">\u00b62 Barry Van Sickle (Van Sickle) purchased a home in Stevensville, Montana, in 2001. In 2010, Van Sickle placed the home for sale and, in the process, completed a Seller\u2019s Property Disclosure Statement Montana Association of Realtors\u00ae Standard Form (Disclosure). The Disclosure requested the seller to \u201cPlease describe any Adverse Material Facts concerning the items listed or other components, fixtures or matters,\u201d followed by a request for information about the \u201cBASEMENT: (Leakage, Flooding, Moisture or evidence of Water, and Fuel Tanks).\u201d In the blank next to this request, Van Sickle wrote \u201cN\\A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">\u00b63 On January 28, 2014, Huckins conveyed an offer on Van Sickle\u2019s home. Van Sickle accepted the offer on January 29, 2014, and, \u201c[s]oon thereafter,\u201d the Disclosure completed by Van Sickle was provided to Huckins. Prior to closing, Huckins paid for a home inspection and inquired into home insurance costs. The inspection revealed that there was an \u201cunconventional\u201d sump pump in the basement, and the home insurance quotes indicated that a claim for flooding in the home had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>been made in 2011. Huckins closed on the transaction in March 2014, but upon entering the home after the closing, she found the basement flooded.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\u00b64 Huckins filed a complaint against Van Sickle and his real estate agent<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Underlying Complaint). The Underlying Complaint stated that the Disclosure\u2019s question about the basement was \u201cleft blank by Van Sickle\u201d and provided a screenshot of that question with a blank answer. Huckins alleged that Van Sickle should have disclosed the previous basement flooding problems and set forth claims of negligent misrepresentation, negligence, fraud and fraudulent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, violations of the Montana Consumer Protection Act, deceit, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">\u00b65 At times related to the events stated by the Underlying Complaint, Van Sickle held three insurance policies through USAA. From 2001 to January 3, 2014, Van Sickle was covered by an annually renewing homeowner\u2019s policy, with identical terms each year (Pre-2014 Policy). When the policy renewed for the January 4, 2014 to January 4, 2015 term, USAA added additional exclusions, including one that excluded coverage for damages \u201carising out of your failure, intentionally or unintentionally, to disclose information regarding the sale or transfer of real or personal property.\u201d (2014 Policy) (collectively \u201cHomeowner\u2019s Policies\u201d). The Homeowner\u2019s Policies both included personal liability protection that provided both indemnity and a defense \u201c[i]f a claim is made or a suit is brought against an \u2018insured\u2019 for damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 caused by an \u2018occurrence\u2019 to which this coverage applies.\u201d In addition to the Homeowner\u2019s Policies, Van Sickle, who at the time had moved to and rented a home in California, had a renter\u2019s policy that ran from March 15, 2014, to March 15, 2015 (Renter\u2019s Policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\u00b66 Van Sickle tendered the Underlying Complaint to USAA, who conducted a telephone interview with Van Sickle and his wife, Michelle Van Sickle (Michelle). Following the interview, USAA sent a letter to Van Sickle denying coverage for the claims stated in the Underlying Complaint, stating \u201c[t]he allegations are concerning alleged misrepresentation and concealment of material facts concerning the sale of property,\u201d and that the policy required an \u201coccurrence as defined\u201d to provide coverage, noting that \u201cI m ^representation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>concealment is not an accident and does not give rise to an occurrence.\u201d USAA\u2019s letter also cited the exclusion for \u201cproperty damage to property owned by an insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">\u00b67 Van Sickle then settled the underlying litigation with Huckins by way of a consent judgment of $300,000 and Van Sickle\u2019s assignment of all claims under his insurance policies to Huckins in exchange for a covenant not to execute. The District Court entered the consent judgment on June 25, 2015, concluding it was \u201creasonable in light of the facts and circumstances of this case, and the risks and costs of litigation.\u201d Huckins then brought the instant case against USAA, stating claims for breach of duty to defend Van Sickle, breach of contract, violations of the Montana Unfair Trade Practices Act, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and punitive damages. Huckins and USAA moved for summary judgment on the primary issue of whether USAA had breached its duty to defend Van Sickle. The District Court reasoned that the claim did not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined by the policies held by Van Sickle, and that USAA had therefore not breached its duty to defend under either the Homeowner\u2019s Policies or the Renter\u2019s Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u00b68 Huckins appeals. Additional facts will be referenced herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">\u00b69 A district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo, applying the same criteria as the district court. <em>J &amp; C Moodie Props., LLC v.

Huckins also argues that the District Court erred by resolving any doubt about the allegations as stated in the Underlying Complaint in favor of USAA, instead of in favor of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b613 USAA argues that the Underlying Complaint \u201cfailed to assert \u2018bodily injury\u2019 as defined in the policy\u201d and that the District Court correctly concluded that there was no \u201coccurrence,\u201d under either the Homeowner\u2019s Policies or the Renter\u2019s Policy. USAA also argues that, while the District Court reached the right result on these grounds, the \u201cFailure to Disclose\u201d exclusion in the 2014 Policy provided an unequivocal demonstration that the facts alleged in the underlying lawsuit did not fall within the 2014 Policy\u2019s coverage, and the Renter\u2019s Policy is not applicable to the home in Stevensville.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\u00b614 \u201cThe duty to defend arises when a complaint against an insured alleges facts, which if proven, would result in coverage.\u201d <em>J &amp; C Moodie, </em>\u00b6 <em>20 (citing Farmers Union Mut.

Fisher Builders, Inc., </em>2016 MT 91, 383 Mont. 187, 371 P.3d 375 [hereinafter <em>Fisher </em>Builders].</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">\u00b618 Regarding the Pre-2014 Policy, the record indicates that Huckins made the offer on Van Sickle\u2019s home on January 28, 2014, and Van Sickle accepted the offer the next day. Huckins admits that she received the Disclosure \u201c[s]oon thereafter.\u201d As such, the 2014 Policy, which became effective on January 4, 2014, is the only homeowner\u2019s policy under which coverage must be analyzed. \u201c[A] claim or cause of action accrues when all elements of the claim or cause exist or have occurred.\u201d Section 27-2-102(1)(a), MCA; <em>accord O\u2019Connor v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>2004 MT 65, \u00b6 12, 320 Mont. 301, 87 P.3d 454. Huckins\u2019 claims against Van Sickle all accrued after the Pre-2014 Policy had expired, and after the 2014 Policy went into effect, on January 4, 2014. Therefore, USAA did not breach its duty to defend under the Pre-2014 Policy because it was not in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">\u00b619 The 2014 Policy contained a \u201cFailure to Disclose\u201d exclusion that barred coverage for \u201c\u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 arising out of your failure, intentionally or unintentionally, to disclose information regarding the sale or transfer of real or personal property.\u201d The Underlying Complaint made eight claims against Van Sickle. First, under negligent misrepresentation, Huckins alleged that \u201cVan Sickle represented through the Seller\u2019s Property Disclosure Statement that he knew [of] no events of basement leakage, flooding, moisture, or evidence of water.\u201d Second, the negligence claim alleged that \u201c[a]s a seller, Van Sickle had a duty to obtain and communicate information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>on the true condition of the property\u201d and he breached that duty when he failed to disclose the 2011 flood event. Third, the fraud/fraudulent misrepresentation claim alleged that \u201c[w]hen Van Sickle made written representations that there were no flooding or water related deficiencies in the basement he made false representations of a material fact.\u201d Fourth, the constructive fraud claim alleged that \u201c[a]s the seller ... Van Sickle ... had a duty to disclose all adverse material facts concerning the property in order to avoid the misrepresentation or concealment of pertinent facts.\u201d Fifth, Huckins alleged the Montana Consumer Protection Act had been violated when Van Sickle \u201cengaged in deceptive acts or practices prior to Huckins\u2019 purchase of the property.\u201d Sixth, the deceit claim alleged that \u201c[Van Sickle] suggested or asserted facts that were untrue, or, alternatively, [he] suppressed facts that were true\u201d \u201cwith the intent to induce Huckins to purchase the property.\u201d Seventh, under breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, Huckins alleged that \u201c[b]y not disclosing the 2011 flood and its continuing nature, Van Sickle deprived Huckins of certain benefits of the Buy/Sell Agreement and her eventual purchase of the property through dishonesty and commercially unreasonable conduct.\u201d Finally, claiming punitive damages, Huckins alleged that \u201c[Van Sickle] acted with actual malice as [he] had knowledge of material facts [he was] obligated to disclose to Huckins concerning the property, and knew their lack of disclosure would create a high probability of injury to Huckins.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u00b620 Even reading it \u201cnarrowly and strictly,\u201d <em>Newman, </em>\u00b6 35, the Failure to Disclose Exclusion clearly excludes coverage for an insured\u2019s failure to disclose information \u201cregarding the sale or transfer of real... property.\u201d There is no ambiguity as applied to the record here. Each allegation in the Underlying Complaint is premised upon Van Sickle\u2019s alleged failure to provide information regarding the 2011 flood or general flood conditions in the area to Huckins. As such, the exclusion must apply and \u201cthere exists an unequivocal demonstration that the claim against an insured does not fall within the insurance policy\u2019s coverage.\u201d <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 22. Therefore, as to this policy, USAAhad no duty to defend Van Sickle.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Renter\u2019s Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\u00b621 The Renter\u2019s Policy was in effect from March 15, 2014, to March 15, 2015. The closing of the transaction occurred in March of 2014, so the alleged damage potentially occurred while the policy was in effect, and no proof or argument is offered otherwise. Although denominated a renter\u2019s policy, the policy provided both property coverage and personal liability coverage under substantively the same terms as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Homeowner\u2019s Policies. However, unlike the 2014 Policy, the Renter\u2019s Policy did not contain a Failure to Disclose exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\u00b622 The Renter\u2019s Policy states that \u201c[i]f claim is made or suit is brought against an \u2018insured\u2019 for damages because of\u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 caused by an occurrence to which this coverage applies,\u201d a defense and indemnity up to the policy\u2019s limits would be provided. An \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions, which results, during the policy period, in: \u2018bodily injury\u2019; or \u2018property damage\u2019.\u201d In turn, \u201cbodily injury\u201d is defined as \u201cbodily harm, sickness, or disease, including required care, loss of services and death that results,\u201d and \u201cproperty damage\u201d is defined as \u201cphysical injury to, destruction of, or loss of use of tangible property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ab7\">\u00b623 The Underlying Complaint does not state a claim for \u201cbodily injury\u201d as we have interpreted the term used in this policy. In <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Wagner-Ellsworth, </em>2008 MT 240, 344 Mont. 445, 188 P.3d 1042, we held that the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d incorporated not only \u201cphysical harm to the body, sickness, disease, or death,\u201d but also \u201cmental or psychological injury that is accompanied by physical manifestations.\u201d <em>Wagner-Ellsworth, </em>\u00b6 40. However, the Underlying Complaint does not allege such injuries, claiming only that Huckins experienced \u201cconcern\u00ed | for the health and well being of her daughters as well as her own,\u201d and \u201cpain, suffering, anxiety, stress, and emotional distress.\u201d None of these are asserted to be \u201cphysical manifestations\u201d of physical injuries or actual \u201cbodily harm, sickness, or disease.\u201d As such, Huckins did not plead a bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u00b624 However, the Underlying Complaint states a claim for \u201cproperty damage\u201d under the policy. Huckins alleged that, after closing, she \u201cfound the basement flooded.\u201d She stated that she had \u201csustained damages\u201d and that \u201cextensive repairs\u201d and \u201cother remedial work\u201d would be necessary to \u201crestore the property.\u201d These allegations are sufficient to state a claim for \u201cphysical injury to, destruction of, or loss of use of tangible property,\u201d as defined in the Renter\u2019s Policy. Having concluded that the Underlying Complaint stated a claim under the Renter\u2019s Policy, we next consider whether USAA breached the duty to defend Van Sickle against the Underlying Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\u00b625 After the Underlying Complaint was filed, USAA conducted a recorded interview with Van Sickle and his wife, Michelle. In the interview, Michelle indicated that the Van Sickles had not disclosed the earlier flooding of the house because they understood the Disclosure form to be asking about current problems, not prior problems. She stated that \u201che [Van Sickle] left it blank because we at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>that time there was nothing and we knew that there was no ... mold or or [sic] anything because we had everything professionally fixed ... so they left that part blank.\u201d She further explained that they had sold four houses in Texas, where they were required to complete another disclosure document that was not required in Montana and were there asked to provide information on other problems they knew about the house, but that such questions were not asked on the Disclosure form for this transaction, which they found \u201cvery misleading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u00b626 The District Court reasoned that an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy was not alleged because (1) the Underlying Complaint stated that Van Sickle acted with intent in completing the Disclosure, and (2) the alleged property damage \u201ccould reasonably be expected to (objectively) result from such act,\u201d that is, that a buyer could reasonably be expected to sustain such property damage if she was induced to purchase the home by relying on Van Sickle\u2019s intentional statement. This analysis was based upon our decision in <em>Fisher Builders, </em>in which we clarified our jurisprudence regarding the interpretation of the term \u201coccurrence\u201d and, correspondingly, its common policy definition as an \u201caccident,\u201d and when an intentional act could be considered an \u201caccident\u201d for purposes of insurance coverage. We held that \u201cthe policy language defining \u2018accidents\u2019 may include intentional acts if the damages were not objectively intended or expected by the insured.\u201d <em>Fisher Builders, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\u00b627 In a critical distinction from this case, in <em>Fisher Builders </em>the insurer defended the insured under a reservation of rights in the underlying litigation and initiated a declaratory action to determine whether the policy provided coverage for the claim under which it had a duty to indemnify the insured. <em>Fisher Builders, </em>\u00b6 7. Thus, in <em>Fisher Builders, </em>we were faced with a duty to indemnify issue, not a duty to defend issue. \u201cThe duty to defend is independent from and broader than the duty to indemnify created by the same insurance contract.\u201d <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>accord Schwan, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 26 (holding the duty to indemnify is \u201cnarrower than the duty to defend\u201d). Unless there exists \u201can unequivocal demonstration that the claim against an insured does not fall within the insurance policy\u2019s coverage, an insurer has a duty to defend.\u201d <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>J &amp; C Moodie, </em>\u00b6 20. Above, we concluded that such an unequivocal demonstration was made under the Failure to Disclose exclusion of the 2014 Policy. However, the same conclusion cannot be reached under the Renter\u2019s Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u00b628 The statements given by the insureds during the interview<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> indicated they were confused about the Disclosure form and how to complete it accurately, raising a legitimate question about whether they intended to provide inaccurate content in their answers. It could be argued in an indemnification case that, whatever the content of their answers, the insureds intended to provide the answers, and thus acted intentionally, not accidentally, which did not constitute an \u201coccurrence.\u201d However, here we consider the duty to defend, and such nuanced arguments about intent make it impossible to conclude that there was \u201can unequivocal demonstration\u201d that Huckins\u2019 claims fell outside the Renter\u2019s Policy. Without such a demonstration, USAA had a duty to defend Van Sickle, at least until a ruling was obtained declaring there was no coverage. By failing to defend Van Sickle, USAA breached its duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\u00b629 The same reasoning applies to USAA\u2019s argument that coverage is excluded under the \u201cowned home\u201d exclusion in the Renter\u2019s Policy. The Renter\u2019s Policy states that it does not cover liability \u201carising out of a premises: (1) owned by an \u2018insured\u2019... that is not an \u2018insured location\u2019.\u201d An \u201cinsured location\u201d is further defined to include \u201ca one to four family residence\u201d or \u201cthat part of any building where you reside\u201d if used as your \u201cprincipal place of residence.\u201d It also includes \u201cthe part of other premises, other structures and grounds used by you as another residence\u201d or \u201cany premises used by you in connection with a or b above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\u00b630 However, as the record indicates and the parties do not factually dispute, the alleged tort claims arose <em>after </em>closing\u2014after the house had been sold to Huckins. Van Sickle did not own the house at that time, and thus the claims did not arise out of \u201cpremises owned by an insured,\u201d which would exclude the personal liability coverage under the Renter\u2019s Policy. This presents another nuanced issue in the interpretation of the policy. USAA urges us to follow foreign authority construing the phrase \u201cowned by an insured\u201d to include both properties that are currently owned and those that were previously owned by an insured. Such an interpretation would make the exclusion applicable, barring coverage and eliminating any duty to indemnify under the policy. Once again, this argument could fairly be made in an indemnification case. However, the necessity of such analysis renders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>it impossible to conclude in a duty to defend case that there was \u201can unequivocal demonstration\u201d that Huckins\u2019 claims fell outside the Renter\u2019s Policy. Further, it must be considered that \u201c[ejxclusions must be narrowly and strictly construed because they are contrary to the fundamental protective purpose of an insurance policy.\u201d <em>Newman, </em>\u00b6 35 (internal quotations omitted). Consequently, this exclusion did not relieve USAA from the duty to defend Van Sickle.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\u00b631  \u201c[W]hen an insurer improperly abandons its insured, the insured is justified in taking steps to limit his or her personal liability.\u201d <em>J &amp; C Moodie, </em>\u00b6 29 (citation omitted). In light of USAA\u2019s abandonment, Van Sickle was justified in entering the stipulated settlement, which was the \u201cnatural and ordinary consequence\u201d of USAA\u2019s breach. <em>Indep.
