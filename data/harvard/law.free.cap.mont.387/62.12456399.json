While detained and under a \u201cno contact\u201d order, Forsythe sent letters to Giana directing her to provide false testimony regarding the incident. Giana provided the letters to the authorities. Thereafter the State charged Forsythe with felony tampering with a witness. A jury found Forsythe guilty of both tampering and PFMA. Forsythe appeals his sentence and evidentiary rulings issued by the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, during and following his trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in holding that the letters Forsythe sent to Giana were protected by spousal privilege?</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">\u00b64 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing a lay witness to testify regarding handwriting samples?</p>\n<p id=\"b87-14\">\u00b65 Did the District Court impose an illegal sentence by ordering Forsythe to pay a $20 information technology surcharge?</p>\n<p id=\"b87-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b87-16\">\u00b66 In November 2013, Joseph Forsythe was charged in the Billings Municipal Court with misdemeanor Partner/Family Member Assault\u2014Second Offense following a violent physical altercation with his wife, Giana, during which she was seriously injured. While confined at the Yellowstone County Detention Facility (YCDF) and under a \u201cno contact\u201d order, Forsythe and Giana wrote letters to one another. Giana received, at a minimum, five letters from Forsythe dated between November 15, 2013, and January 24, 2014. One of these letters unequivocally instructed her to tell the authorities that her injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>were the result of her falling and hitting herself on a cabinet. He further directed her to refuse to testify against him and to claim she had a mental illness that would preclude her from testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b67 Giana gave the letters to the Billings City Attorney\u2019s Office. The City Attorney moved to dismiss the Billings Municipal Court case without prejudice and, in February 2014, Forsythe was charged with one count of felony tampering with a witness<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and one count of misdemeanor PFMA in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court. In May 2014, the State filed notice of its intent to designate Forsythe a persistent felony offender (PFO) on the grounds that less than five years had elapsed between Forsythe\u2019s 2014 felony tampering charge and his 2011 release from parole on a charge of felony residential burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b68 In June 2014, Forsythe filed a motion in limine seeking to prevent the letters he sent to Giana from being admitted into evidence in his tampering case. He argued that the letters constituted confidential communication between spouses and were protected by spousal privilege under \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA. The State countered that the letters to Giana were not within the scope of spousal privilege because the letters were intended to intimidate and harass Giana into silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\u00b69 The court conducted a motion hearing on July 30, 2014, at which law enforcement officer Brad Tucker, who was noticed as a witness on June 23, testified as to his handwriting analysis background and experience and that he had testified at previous unrelated trials as an expert in this field. He also compared letters received by the presiding judge from Forsythe with the letters Giana received and concluded they were all written by the same person. Forsythe objected to Tucker\u2019s testimony on foundation grounds and the State\u2019s failure to notice Tucker as an expert. The court overruled the objections, noting that Forsythe\u2019s handwriting was extremely distinctive and could be effectively compared by the judge, juror, or a lay witness. The court admitted the letters into the record. F oil owing the hearing, the District Court issued its ruling from the bench preliminarily granting Forsythe\u2019s motion in limine. The court\u2019s subsequent written order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>informed the State that it would have to rely on \u201cother evidence, other than the testimony of [Giana], to establish the elements of [witness tampering].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b610 During the pre-trial conference for Forsythe\u2019s August 11, 2014 jury trial, the District Court ruled that Giana could testify that she received letters from Forsythe but she could not testify as to the contents of those letters because to do so would violate spousal privilege as it applied to the witness tampering charge. Following Giana\u2019s trial testimony, the jury heard the same handwriting analysis testimony from Tucker as the District Court had heard at the July 30 hearing. The testimony was intended to establish that Forsythe had written the letters to Giana in violation of \u00a7 45-7-206, MCA, i.e., the tampering statute. The State, however, did not offer him as an expert in this case; consequently, he offered opinion testimony as a lay witness. Forsythe objected to Tucker\u2019s authentication testimony arguing that because the State had not noticed Tucker as an expert Tucker\u2019s lay witness testimony did not satisfy M. R. Evid. 901(b)(2) (Rule 901). Following Tucker\u2019s testimony, the court permitted the State to introduce the letters into evidence in the tampering case. At the time of the admissibility ruling, Forsythe objected solely on the grounds of spousal privilege. The jury found Forsythe guilty of both witness tampering and PFMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u00b611 In January 2015, the District Court issued its Judgment, committing Forsythe to the Montana State Prison for fifteen years with five years suspended for the tampering charge and sentencing him to YCDF for one year for the PFMA. The PFMA sentence was ordered to run concurrently with the tampering sentence. Forsythe received credit for the time served in pre-trial incarceration and was designated a PFO. He was subject to numerous terms and conditions, including completing an anger management program and other behavioral modification programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\u00b612 Forsythe filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">\u00b613 This court reviews a district court\u2019s evidentiary decisions for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Pingree, </em>2015 MT 187, \u00b6 9, 379 Mont. 521, 352 P.3d 1086. The determination of whether evidence is relevant and admissible is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be overturned absent a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Levanger, </em>2015 MT 83, \u00b6 7, 378 Mont. 397, 344 P.3d 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b614 <em>Did the District Court err in holding that the letters Forsythe sent to Giana were protected by spousal privilege </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b615 Forsythe claims his letters are confidential marital communication and thus protected by the spousal privilege doctrine. The doctrine of spousal privilege originated in English common law and was first recognized by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Stein v. Bowman, </em>38 U.S. 209, 10 L.Ed. 129 (1839). Most states subsequently codified the privilege and Montana enacted its first spousal privilege law in 1867. <em>State v. Nettleton, </em>233 Mont. 308, 313, 760 P.2d 733, 736 (1988). The central principle behind the privilege is \u201cto protect the sanctity of the marriage and home.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Sarsfield, </em>206 Mont. 397, 406, 671 P.2d 595, 600 (1983) (citations omitted). However, we also noted in <em>Sarsfield </em>that the privilege is subject to the maxim that \u201c[w]hen the reason of a rule ceases, so should the rule itself.\u201d Section 1-3-201, MCA; <em>Sarsfield, </em>206 Mont. at 406, 671 P.2d at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"Al\">\u00b616 While the principle behind the privilege remains, the law codifying it has evolved considerably since 1867 and the privilege is not as far-sweeping as it once was. Exceptions have arisen, one of which provides that threatening communications\u2014whether oral or written\u2014are not privileged or protected and should not be excluded from evidence based upon the spousal privilege. <em>Nettleton, </em>233 Mont. at 317, 760 P.2d at 739; <em>State v. Edwards, </em>2011 MT 210, \u00b6 19, 361 Mont. 478, 260 P.3d 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u00b617 The applicable spousal privilege statute, \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">Neither spouse may, without the consent of the other, testify during or after the marriage concerning any communication made by one to the other during their marriage. The privilege is restricted to communications made during the existence of the marriage relationship and does not extend to communications made prior to the marriage or to communications made after the marriage is dissolved. The privilege does not apply to a civil action or proceeding by one spouse against the other or to a criminal action or proceeding for a crime committed by one spouse against the other or against a child of either spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">\u00b618 Forsythe asserts that the District Court was correct when it issued its preliminary ruling granting his motion in limine and finding that the letters Giana received while Forsythe was detained at the YCDF were \u201cprivileged spousal communications.\u201d He continues, however, that the court \u201cerred ... in how it subsequently applied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>privilege statute to testimony and evidence on the tampering charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ajq\">\u00b619 Forsythe contends that the court incorrectly ruled that the letters were <em>not </em>covered by the spousal privilege because they were written communications rather than oral testimony. In other words, the District Court correctly concluded that Giana could not orally testify about the spousal communications but it erred when it admitted the letters through a third-party lay witness \u201cmerely because they took a written form.\u201d Forsythe further asserts that admitting the testimony of a lay witness unfamiliar with his handwriting to authenticate the letters violated Rule 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b620 Lastly, Forsythe maintains that the letters contained no threats to Giana and the State produced no evidence that Giana felt fearful or threatened. Rather, and relying on <em>Nettleton, </em>he claims that the letters were communications (1) \u201c \u2018intended to convey a message from one spouse to the other,\u2019 and (2) the message was \u2018intended by the communicating spouse to be confidential in that it was conveyed in reliance on the confidence of the marital relationship.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019 Nettleton, </em>233 Mont. at 317, 760 P.2d at 739. As such, they were privileged spousal communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u00b621 The State acknowledges that the District Court\u2019s reasoning for admitting the letters was erroneous and that written spousal communications are protected by the privilege. However, the State, also relying on <em>Nettleton, </em>maintains that the court did not err in admitting these letters because the content of the communications was intimidating and intended to influence Giana\u2019s participation in the case, and therefore were not protected spousal communications. <em>Nettleton, </em>233 Mont. at 317, 760 P.2d at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\u00b622 Additionally, the State asserts that the statutory language in \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA\u2014\u201c[t]he privilege does not apply to ... a criminal action or proceeding for a crime committed by one spouse against the other\u201d\u2014should apply to the charge of tampering with a witness when the witness is the spouse. It acknowledges that while tampering with a witness typically is an offense against the public administration, it is also an offense committed against Giana in this case. As such the statute supports a finding that the letters are not protected by the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">\u00b623 Unfortunately, the District Court, in its order granting Forsythe\u2019s motion in limine, did not provide a detailed legal rationale for its decision. To the extent, as argued by the parties, that the court drew a distinction between written and oral communications and concluded that written communications are not protected by spousal privilege, this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>\u00b624 Having determined that the written letters were subject to protection under the privilege, we next turn to whether the letters contained intimidating and threatening language, and therefore were not communicated \u201cin reliance on the confidence of the marital <em>relationship.\u2019\u2019Edwards, </em>\u00b6 19. We acknowledge that many of the letters contain terms of endearment and repeated professions of love and that we observed no overt or direct threats of violence. However, we conclude that, based upon the underlying relationship of the persons involved, direct and overt threats of violence are not always necessary to instill fear, intimidation, or a sense of physical vulnerability. As an example, Forsythe wrote in his letter dated January 24, 2014, the last letter Giana turned over to the prosecuting attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">You need to seriously get a hold of yourself, like as of this letter and stop listening to that punk-ass D.A. He is our enemy ... he gets paid to fuck peoples lifes [sic] up. He is playing you for a fuckin dummy, he wants you to turn against me ... and it sounds like it\u2019s working. I\u2019ve got this case beat and they know it, and now the fucks are trying anything including using you. The only way that I can lose is if you testify against me so get a fucking hold of yourself ... now! You give up so fuckin easy. ... You need to be patient. This is not fuckin Burger King, you need to calm the fuck down before you fuck me for good. ... Now, I\u2019m coming home soon so do as I ask, and I mean it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u00b625 Forsythe concluded the letter by telling Giana he loved her \u201cdumb ass\u2014so be good.\u201d We note that Forsythe adopted an angrier and more threatening prose in this letter than in his previous letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\u00b626 In addition to an intimidating posture in Forsythe\u2019s last letter, a few of the letters attempted to suborn perjury by instructing Giana to lie to the authorities about their communications and the manner in which she was injured. For example, Forsythe made the following statement in one of his letters: \u201cJust try to talk to my public defender, I\u2019m saying that we fell down together. And she hit herself on the cabinet, thats [sic] how she got her marks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\u00b627 It is apparent from these letters that Forsythe\u2019s goal, through his written instructions to his wife, was to intimidate her into withdrawing her allegations against him. Forsythe\u2019s letters are a written embodiment of the psychological manipulation and control that inheres in an abusive relationship\u2014escalating to a threat that he is \u201ccoming home soon\u201d where he will have physical access to his wife again. She knows what is coming if that happens. In the context of such a relationship, these communications plainly are a threat and are damaging to, rather than preserving of, the sanctity of the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>\u00b628 First, we note it is not inherently wrong or unlawful for one spouse to encourage the other spouse to exercise his or her spousal privilege. The wrongdoing occurs when one spouse encourages or persuades the other spouse to exercise the privilege/or wrongful purposes such as suborning perjury or <em>through </em>wrongful means such as coercion and intimidation. <em>United States v. Doss, </em>630 F.3d 1181, 1190 (9th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b629 In reaching our conclusion in this case, we are guided, in part, by an observation of the Washington Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Sanders, </em>833 P.2d 452, 455 (1992). The Washington Court was deciding a witness tampering/spousal privilege case in the context of sexual child abuse. The court noted, \u201cThere is a direct, elemental nexus between the act of tampering and the underlying crime.\u201d The underlying crime in this case was Forsythe\u2019s brutal beating of his wife Giana while he was drunk and she was recovering from spinal surgery. The PFMA precipitated the tampering offense. In other words, without the PFMA there would be no tampering charge. And while Giana\u2019s trial testimony indicated she still loved her husband, she also stated that the beating \u201cdestroyed everything I believed in[:] marriage, love, partnership, trust. I lost hope.\u201d When asked if she still had hope for her marriage, she replied, \u201cI can\u2019t answer that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b630 While Giana testified about the PFMA, she was barred from testifying about the letters and their content based upon spousal privilege. But, as we determined above, these letters are not privileged. For this reason, Giana should have been allowed to testify about them and the State should have been allowed to admit them as unprivileged communications through Giana. The District Court erred in its interpretation of the privilege and the manner in which it applied it to testimony and evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u00b631 We conclude, however, that the District Court did not abuse its broad discretion by admitting the letters into evidence as they were not privileged. Moreover, the court had the content of the letters, awareness of the vicious nature of the underlying crime, Giana\u2019s presence and demeanor on the witness stand and her testimony against Forsythe in the PFMA case, as well as knowledge that Giana had turned over the letters to the prosecuting attorney of her own accord. While the court failed to provide its rationale for admitting the letters, our review of the evidence supports the conclusion that the content of the letters, especially the final letter, was threatening and/or intimidating to a woman who was the victim of such a cruel beating and did not constitute protected marital communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">\u00b632 We return to the central principle of the privilege\u2014the protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>of the marital relationship. As the United States Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">When one spouse is willing to testify against the other in a criminal proceeding\u2014whatever the motivation\u2014their relationship is almost certainly in disrepair; there is probably little in the way of marital harmony for the privilege to preserve.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-6\"><em>Trammel v. U.S., </em>445 U.S. 40, 52, 100 S. Ct. 906, 913 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b633 Having concluded that Forsythe\u2019s letters to Giana were not protected by spousal privilege based upon their threatening and intimidating contents and our analysis in <em>Nettleton, </em>we also conclude that our ruling is supported by the express language of the spousal privilege statute. Section 26-1-802, MCA, quoted in full in \u00b6 17 above, provides that the \u201cprivilege does not apply ... to a criminal action or proceeding for a crime committed by one spouse against the other ....\u201d \u00b634 Here, no one disputes that spousal privilege does not apply to the Partner/Family Member Assault charge. The tampering charge, however, clearly arises out of the partner and family member charge and was committed by F orsythe with the specific purpose of frustrating the effective prosecution of the PFMA charge. Indeed, evidence of the letters strongly shows a consciousness of guilt by Forsythe because the letters reveal that he repeatedly sought to prevent Giana from truthfully testifying against him on the assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">\u00b635  Consequently, and based upon the language of the statute, the case before us is <em>one </em>criminal proceeding with <em>two </em>charges arising from the same series of events: commission of the PFMA against Giana and Forsythe\u2019s attempt to alter the evidence for this particular charge. For this reason as well as those set forth above, Forsythe\u2019s letters to Giana were not covered by the privilege because the tampering and PFMA arose from the same set of facts and constitute a \u201ccriminal action or proceeding for a crime committed by one spouse against the other ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYq\">\u00b636 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing a lay witness to testify regarding handwriting </em>samples?</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">\u00b637 Forsythe alternatively asserts that the District Court erroneously admitted the subject correspondence based on foundational authentication testimony of Tucker in violation of Rule 901(b)(2) (permissible handwriting authentication through lay testimony based on non-litigation-related familiarity) and <em>State v. Dewitz, </em>2009 MT 202, \u00b6\u00b6 42-43, 351 Mont. 182, 212 P.3d 1040 (admission of police officer\u2019s non-expert handwriting comparison testimony under Rule 901(b)(2) erroneous absent prior non-case-related familiarity). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>\u00b638  Tucker\u2019s testimony regarding his handwriting comparison expertise and his resulting opinion testimony unquestionably constituted expert testimony beyond the scope of permissible lay opinion testimony. The State concedes that it failed to timely identify Tucker as an expert witness on its court-ordered pretrial witness list and thus purported to present his testimony as merely lay opinion testimony. As in <em>Dewitz, </em>Tucker had no prior non-case-related familiarity with Forsythe\u2019s handwriting. Therefore, the District Court abused its discretion in admitting the subject correspondence based on the foundational authentication testimony of Tucker under Rule 901(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b639 In tacit acquiescence, the State asserts that the error was harmless error. In determining whether an error was reversible error or non-reversible harmless error, the first question is whether the error was \u201cstructural error\u201d or merely \u201ctrial error.\u201d <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 37, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u00b640 \u201cStructural error\u201d is error that affects the framework of the trial process \u201crather than simply an error in the trial process itself.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38 (citing <em>Ariz. v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 310, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 1265 (1991)). Whether occurring pretrial or at trial, structural error \u201cis typically of constitutional dimensions\u201d or of such magnitude to fundamentally undermine \u201cthe fairness of the <em>entire </em>trial proceeding.\u201d <em>See Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38 (narrowly characterizing structural error as typically a pretrial phenomenon) (emphasis added). By nature, structural error is not amenable to measure by any particular qualitative or quantitative means. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38. Presumptively prejudicial, structural error is irrebuttable reversible error not subject to harmless error review under \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-39; <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, \u00b6\u00b6 39-50, 298 Mont. 358, 2 P.3d 204.</p>\n<p id=\"ApU\">\u00b641 In contrast, \u201ctrial error\u201d is \u201cerror that typically occurs during the presentation of a case to the jury,\u201d i.e., the presentation of evidence or jury argument. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. By nature, trial error is amenable to comparative qualitative assessment of the \u201cprejudicial impact\u201d of the tainted evidence relative to the other trial evidence. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. Not presumptively prejudicial, trial error is subject to harmless error review under \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\u00b642 Upon a determination of a non-structural trial error, the burden shifts to the State to show on the trial record that \u201cno reasonable possibility\u201d exists that the inadmissible evidence \u201ccontributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47. The State can satisfy this standard by pointing out other admitted \u201cevidence that proved the same facts as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the tainted evidence\u201d and showing by qualitative comparison that it could not reasonably have contributed to the conviction. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b643 If the tainted evidence was the only evidence tending to prove an element of the charged offense, no basis for qualitative assessment exists and the non-structural error is reversible error. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47. If the tainted evidence is the only evidence tending to prove a fact other than an element of the charged offense, then the error is harmless if the State can show by qualitative comparison to the other trial evidence that the tainted evidence could not reasonably have contributed to the conviction. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b644 In this case, the tainted evidence was Tucker\u2019s handwriting identification testimony offered pursuant to Rule 901(a) to prove the foundational authenticity of the subject correspondence rather than as proof of an element of the charged offense. This evidence was not of constitutional dimension or such significance to fundamentally undermine \u201cthe fairness of the entire trial proceeding\u201d in a manner not amenable to comparative qualitative assessment of prejudice. Rather, this evidence was merely foundational evidence readily amenable to comparative qualitative assessment of prejudice. Therefore, we conclude that the erroneous admission of Tucker\u2019s expert handwriting identification testimony was merely non-structural trial error subject to harmless error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u00b645 In that regard, other compelling evidence authenticated the subject correspondence as Forsythe\u2019s writing independent of Tucker\u2019s testimony. First, as a non-exclusive means of proof of authenticity under Rule 901(a), \u201ca witness with knowledge\u201d may testify \u201cthat a matter is what it is claimed to be.\u201d Rule 901(b)(1). Thus, unless beyond the realm of lay knowledge, a witness may give non-expert opinion testimony \u201cas to the genuineness of handwriting\u201d based on \u201cfamiliarity not acquired for purposes of the litigation.\u201d Rule 901(b)(2). Here, Giana testified unequivocally that she received the subject correspondence from her husband. Forsythe does not dispute that his wife was familiar with his handwriting or that she did not acquire that familiarity for purposes of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">\u00b646 Second, as another non-exclusive means of proof of authenticity under Rule 901(a), a lay jury may determine the foundational authenticity of evidence by comparison \u201cwith specimens which have been authenticated.\u201d Rule 901(b)(3). Unless beyond the realm of lay knowledge, the jury may make this foundational determination by recognition and comparison of \u201c[djistinctive characteristics and the like,\u201d including, inter alia, their \u201clalppearance, contents, substance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>internal patterns or other distinctive characteristics, <em>taken in conjunction with [the] circumstances\u201d at issue. </em>Rule 901(b)(4) (emphasis added). Here, without objection, the court admitted three signed, handwritten letters from Forsythe to the court. Also admitted into evidence and not at issue on appeal was a \u201cNotice of No Contact\u201d acknowledgement bearing Forsythe\u2019s handwritten signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b647 Forsythe has made no assertion or showing here or below that accurate comparative authentication of the subject correspondence was a matter beyond the realm of lay knowledge requiring expert testimony. Thus, Tucker\u2019s handwriting identification testimony was merely cumulative to other evidence proving the foundational authenticity of the subject correspondence as written by Forsythe.</p>\n<p id=\"A_h\">\u00b648 The other cumulative evidence proving the foundational authenticity of the subject correspondence was qualitatively and quantitatively compelling independent of Tucker\u2019s testimony. The record manifests that the handwriting styles in the tainted correspondence and Forsythe\u2019s other untainted handwriting examples were distinctly similar. In its bench ruling, the District Court found that the handwriting on the subject correspondence was \u201cso distinct\u201d that \u201canybody\u201d could identify Forsythe\u2019s handwriting. Though somewhat altered in some of the letters, the writing styles still remained substantially similar in most regards. The fact that some of the letters purported by signature to have been written by somebody other than Forsythe was nonsensical juxtaposed against their distinctive content contrarily identifying the author as a close acquaintance of Forsythe\u2019s wife and the subject of a criminal prosecution in which she was the key witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b649 Giana\u2019s undisputed familiarity with her husband\u2019s handwriting, her unequivocal testimony that she received the subject correspondence from him, the substance of the correspondence, the corroborating surrounding circumstances, and the lack of any evidentiary basis upon which to reasonably conclude that somebody other than Forsythe authored the subject correspondence were independently compelling evidence of the foundational authenticity of the letters. Therefore, we conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the admission of Tucker\u2019s late-disclosed expert handwriting identification testimony significantly contributed to his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u00b650 As for the dissent\u2019s concern that Forsythe was not notified of Tucker\u2019s testimony and could not prepare to defend against, it is unwarranted. Forsythe knew well in advance of the trial that Tucker would be a witness at the trial. Furthermore, as of the hearing in July, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Forsythe knew exactly what Tucker\u2019s testimony would be. Consequently, Forsythe was not taken by surprise by Tucker\u2019s handwriting analysis testimony. While Forsythe again objected at trial that Tucker had not been noticed as an expert, at the time the letters were submitted to the jury, Forsythe\u2019s only objection was spousal privilege. Forsythe offered no closing statement or rebuttal witnesses to address Tucker\u2019s testimony. For these reasons and the reasons presented above, Forsythe cannot establish that Tucker\u2019s testimony was prejudicial; consequently, the admission of the letters was harmless error. Therefore, we conclude that the erroneous admission of Deputy Tucker\u2019s handwriting identification testimony was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b651 <em>Did the District Court impose an illegal sentence by ordering Forsythe to pay a $20 information technology </em>surcharge?</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b652 Lastly, the State concedes that the District Court imposed an illegal sentence when it ordered Forsythe to pay a $20 information technology surcharge when the statute authorizes a single $10 surcharge per criminal case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While we typically remand a judgment to the district court for modification, we conclude a remand is unnecessary in this case. Section 46-20-703(1), MCA, authorizes this Court, as \u201cthe reviewing court... to modify the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken.\u201d Relying on this statute in <em>State v. Fitzpatrick, </em>247 Mont. 206, 805 P.2d 584 (1991), we modified Fitzpatrick\u2019s sentence on appeal after concluding the district court erroneously imposed sentences that exceeded the statutory maximum allowed. As we are merely modifying Forsythe\u2019s sentence to reduce a $20 surcharge to a $10 surcharge, we do so under the authority set forth in \u00a7 46-20-703(1), MCA. It is hereby ordered that Forsythe\u2019s judgment be amended accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">\u00b653 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and modify Forsythe\u2019s sentence as it pertains to the imposed information technology surcharge.</p>\n<judges id=\"b98-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, McKINNON and SANDEFUR concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-8\"> Section 45-7-206, MCA, defines tampering with a witness and provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">(1) A person commits the offense of tampering with witnesses and informants if, believing that an official proceeding or investigation is pending or about to be instituted, the person purposely or knowingly attempts to induce or otherwise cause a witness or informant to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">(a) testify or inform falsely; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-11\">(b) withhold any testimony, information, document, or thing. ...</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-10\"> Section 3-1-317(1)(a), MCA, mandates, with some inapplicable exceptions, that \u201call courts of original jurisdiction shall impose on a defendant in criminal cases, a $10 [information technology] surcharge upon conviction for any conduct made criminal by state statute or upon forfeiture of bond or bail.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"Asu\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b654 I agree with the Court in all respects, with the exception that I would conclude, based solely upon the language of \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA, the spousal privilege does not apply and not, as the Court does, upon an extension of <em>Nettleton </em>and a finding that the letters were intimidating and threatening. The Legislature, by enacting \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA, established the spousal privilege, as well as the exception to that privilege. It is not necessary to extend <em>Nettleton, </em>which abrogated the spousal privilege for reasons not set forth in \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA, as the tampering charge arises out of the PFMA and was committed by Forsythe with the purpose to frustrate effective prosecution of the PFMA. In my opinion, the case before us is one criminal prosecution with two charges, and I would conclude the communications are not protected pursuant to the plain language of the statutory exception because this is \u201ca criminal action or proceeding for a crime committed by one spouse against the other ....\u201d Section 26-1-802, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u00b655 The Court relies on <em>Nettleton </em>to find that the letters were intimidating and/or threatening and that the central principle of the privilege\u2014protection of the marital relationship\u2014was not advanced by excluding the letters. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 31, 33. <em>Nettleton </em>involved threats by the husband to his then-wives of death, stalking, physical violence, and killing the parties\u2019 child. Similarly, in <em>Edwards, </em>\u00b6 20, the communications held not to be privileged were statements by Edwards to his wife, made while pointing a shotgun at her, that he would kill her and her family and burn down her grandmother\u2019s house. Our holdings in <em>Nettleton </em>and <em>Edwards </em>did not construe the statutory exception contained in \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA, and were, in actuality, a judicially created exception to the statutorily created spousal privilege. As such, I am hesitant to extend precedent when it is not in accord with the clear language of a statute which specifically and directly addresses the same subject-matter. Further, extending <em>Nettleton </em>requires the trial court to climb the slippery slope of deciding when a statement is threatening or intimidating and damaging of the marital relationship, particularly in the absence of testimony from the victim that she was so threatened or intimidated and that the marriage was over.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I think the better course, and that set forth in the language of the statute, is that the tampering charge is clearly part of the same proceeding as the PFMA and arose out of and is intricately related to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>the PFMA. On this basis only, I would conclude that the letters are not protected by the spousal privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b656 The role of this Court in the construction of a statute \u201cis simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been asserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. This Court has repeatedly held that we must seek to implement the intention of the Legislature when interpreting a statute. <em>In re K.M.G., </em>2010 MT 81, \u00b6 26, 356 Mont. 91, 229 P.3d 227 (citing \u00a7 1-2-102, MCA; <em>Montana Vending Inc. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., </em>2003 MT 282, \u00b6 21, 318 Mont. 1, 78 P.3d 499). We determine the intention of the Legislature first from the plain meaning of the words used, and if interpretation of the statute can be so determined, we may not go further and apply any other means of interpretation. <em>State v. Trull, </em>2006 MT 119, \u00b6 32, 332 Mont. 233, 136 P.3d 551 (citing <em>Dunphy v. Anaconda Co., </em>151 Mont. 76, 79-81, 438 P.2d 660, 662 (1968)); <em>see also Tongue River Elec. Coop. v. Montana Power Co., </em>195 Mont. 511, 515, 636 P.2d 862, 864 (1981) <em>(citing Haker v. Southwestern R.R., </em>176 Mont. 364, 369, 578 P.2d 724, 727 (1978); <em>State ex rel. Huffman v. District Court, </em>154 Mont. 201, 204, 461 P.2d 847, 849 (1969)). \u201cIn the search for plain meaning, \u2018the language used must be reasonably and logically interpreted, giving words their usual and ordinary meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gaub v. Milbank Ins. Co., </em>220 Mont. 424, 427, 715 P.2d 443, 445 (1986) (quoting <em>In re McCabe, </em>168 Mont. 334, 339, 544 P.2d 825, 828 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u00b657 In my opinion, the language of \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA, is plain and unambiguous. We are thus not required to extend the judicially created exception we made in <em>Nettleton </em>and <em>Edwards, </em>which likely was made pursuant to the compelling circumstances of those cases. While I do not disagree that the substance of Forsythe\u2019s communications, particularly the fifth communication, were designed to threaten and intimidate Giana, the legislature has struck a balance, through its enactment of \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA, between protection of the marital relationship and when that protection is no longer deserving. It is not the role of a judge or this Court to expand on that exception, regardless of whether we agree with the balance struck by the Legislature, and particularly when it is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">\u00b658 The plain language of the statutory exception itself applies to remove from protection the communications made by Forsythe because the case before us is one \u201ccriminal action or proceeding\u201d with two charges arising from the same series of events. I would only apply the statutory exception contained in \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA, to conclude the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>letters were not protected spousal communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">JUSTICE SANDEFUR joins in the concurring Opinion of JUSTICE MCKINNON.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-7\"> During trial, Giana did not testify she was threatened or intimidated and she was unwilling to definitively state her marriage to Forsythe was over.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b101-6\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AIM\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\u00b659 I agree with the Court\u2019s analysis under the first issue regarding spousal privilege, but disagree with the conclusion reached under the second issue regarding the expert testimony that was admitted concerning Forsythe\u2019s letters. It is vital to maintain the distinction between lay witnesses and expert witnesses<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and to properly analyze the error when this distinction is lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">\u00b660 At trial, the State repeatedly claimed Tucker was simply a lay witness. As the State acknowledges on appeal, this assertion was incorrect\u2014Tucker indeed offered expert testimony. As we recently explained, \u201cif testimony crosses from lay to expert testimony the witness must be recognized as an expert by the court or error occurs.\u201d <em>State v. Kaarma, </em>2017 MT 24, \u00b6 86, 386 Mont. 243, 390 P.3d 609. Designating a witness as an expert bears significantly on trial preparation and failure to do so can be prejudicial to the other side. <em>See Superior Enters. LLC v. Mont. Power Co., </em>2002 MT 139, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20, 310 Mont. 198, 49 P.3d 565. In the criminal context, any error must be analyzed under the <em>Van Kirk </em>test. <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735. While the Court acknowledges that Tucker\u2019s testimony constituted an authentication error under M. R. Evid. 901(b)(2), and proffers a <em>Van Kirk </em>analysis, the Court\u2019s analysis is legally incorrect and factually inconsistent with the record. I believe the Court has significantly watered down the <em>Van Kirk </em>standards and has failed to \u201cinsure that the substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced by the admission of tainted evidence.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"AWo\">\u00b661 As an initial matter, the fact should not be lost that the State tried this case with expert testimony, which was noticed, at best, some 12 days before trial was to begin. Although he correctly objected to the expert aspects of Tucker\u2019s testimony, Forsythe was left without time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>to obtain expert testimony to rebut it. This resulted in further prejudice to Forsythe.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b662 The Court takes the most unusual step of conducting its own handwriting analysis of the letters, and concludes therefrom that, \u201c[tjhough somewhat altered in some of the letters, the writing styles still remained substantially similar in most regards.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 46. It should go without saying that an appellate court has no expertise in handwriting analysis; but beyond that, the problem the Court fails to acknowledge is that the <em>only </em>explanation about these \u201cwriting styles\u201d provided during the trial was Tucker\u2019s inadmissible testimony.

from persons other than Forsythe, and the altered writing style was apparently employed to further Forsythe\u2019s alleged subterfuge. Thus, under the State\u2019s theory of the case, it was necessary to establish that the letters were written exclusively by Forsythe. I think it is possible that a rational jury, looking only at the letters, without guiding expert testimony, could have had doubt about whether the letters were written by the same person. In order to establish they were all written by Forsythe, the State offered Tucker, who offered expert testimony to assist the jury, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">[State\u2019s counsel:] Q. And did you use <em>accepted procedures </em>to analyze these letters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">[Tucker:] A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">Q. Now, since then have you had the opportunity to compare those exhibits [(the letters allegedly written by Forsythe and sent to his wife)] to other writings [(the letters allegedly written and signed by Forsythe and sent to the District Court)]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">A. Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">Q. What\u2019s unique about these letters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">A. <em>For example, the letter E, regardless of where the letter was in a word or in a sentence, it was always the same letter form. </em>Particularly, there are some, what we call, hiatuses in writing, particularly with the <em>capital letter M, on the upper left-hand corner of the M, there\u2019s a hiatus, which is basically a lift in the pen, the writing, so that the writing doesn\u2019t connect in that spot, and that\u2019s consistent throughout all of the writing that I looked at. Also, the slope and slant of the t-bar and the I is very\u2014very distinct in all of this writing.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">Q. And you\u2019ve <em>reached an opinion </em>[about the letters]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-12\">A. Yes, the opinion that I\u2019ve reached between both sets [of letters] ... the writing that I was given that was written to the Judge and the writing I was given that was allegedly written to ... [Forsythe\u2019s wife], I consider <em>them not verifiable as far as to who the author actually is, so I consider them questioned documents. But I did compare them together, and my professional opinion is that they were written by the same author, both sets of letters.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5V\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">\u00b664 Tucker provided substantive, technical testimony. He applied \u201caccepted procedures,\u201d analyzed the letters, and offered a <em>professional </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>opinion </em>that \u201cthey were written by the same author, both sets of letters.\u201d The State did not present <em>any </em>other evidence proving this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b665 The Court deals with the problem of Tucker\u2019s inadmissible testimony, first, by minimizing it as \u201cmerely foundational evidence.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 42. It was much more than that. As the Court here affirms, the letters were properly admitted during the trial on the basis of Giana\u2019s testimony that she had received them. See Opinion, \u00b6 31 (\u201c[T]he District Court did not abuse its broad discretion by admitting the letters into evidence as they were not privileged.\u201d). Tucker\u2019s testimony was not necessary to lay additional foundation for admission of the letters. Rather, as evident from the quoted testimony above, the State used Tucker to accomplish a qualitatively different purpose\u2014to establish, by <em>scientific analysis and opinion, </em>that all eight letters at issue had been written by the same person, which was necessary to establish the tampering charge. The Court\u2019s dismissive characterization of Tucker\u2019s testimony as \u201cmerely cumulative to other evidence provingthe foundational authenticity\u201d of the letters, Opinion, \u00b6 45, fails to comprehend the significance of the testimony and the State\u2019s purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b666 Secondly, the Court minimizes the effect of Tucker\u2019s testimony by manufacturing its own, non-record evidence. It relies, repeatedly, on the asserted facts that Giana \u201cwas familiar\u201d with Forsythe\u2019s handwriting and that she \u201cdid not acquire that familiarity for purposes of litigation.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 43-47. However, there is absolutely no evidence of these things in the record. About the letters, Giana testified only that she had received them. The sum total of her testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">[State\u2019s counsel:] Q. Now, Gianna, at some point, you received letters\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">[Gianna:] A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">Q. \u2014from your husband?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">Q. How many did you receive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-13\">A. I think five. I think four, five.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-14\">Q. Did you eventually turn those letters over to law enforcement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-15\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-16\">The absence of any evidence in the record forces the Court to turn these non-record assumptions into evidence on the basis that \u201cForsythe does not dispute\u201d them. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 43, 47. It need only be asked: How was Forsythe supposed to dispute evidence that was never introduced? Forsythe likewise did not dispute a great many other things that were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>not introduced, but that does not magically turn these things into record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b667 Another problem the Court fails to see is the impact on the trial of the tainted testimony <em>in combination with </em>the admitted letters. The jury\u2019s assessment of the letters was polluted by the improper expert testimony that affirmatively concluded all of the letters were written by the same person. The jury was not allowed to draw a conclusion about the letters themselves. While the Court offers that a lay jury may determine foundational authenticity by comparison to other specimens, Opinion, \u00b6 44, it fails to recognize that this province of the jury was invaded here by Tucker\u2019s improper expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b668 As we recently explained in <em>Kaarma </em>about the same error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">Inadmissible evidence will not be found prejudicial so long as the jury was presented with \u201cadmissible evidence that proved the same facts as the tainted evidence proved.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 43. This presented evidence must be admissible and of the same quality of the tainted evidence such that there was <em>no reasonable possibility </em>that it might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 44.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-8\"><em>Kaarma, </em>\u00b6 89 (emphasis added). Here, as noted, no other evidence proving the same facts as the tainted evidence was introduced by the State. While the Court reasons that the tainted evidence was not significant enough to \u201cundermine the fairness\u201d of the trial because it was \u201cmerely\u201d foundational evidence, Opinion, \u00b6 42, the above discussion demonstrates otherwise. This evidence went directly to the elements of tampering\u2014Tucker\u2019s testimony alone uniquely demonstrated scientifically that all the letters had been written by Forsythe. Thus, the State cannot meet its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">\u00b669 \u201cMoreover, the State must also demonstrate that the <em>quality </em>of the tainted evidence was such that there was no reasonable possibility that it might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 44 (emphasis in original). In my view, Tucker\u2019s expert testimony was of a significant quality, as it affirmatively declared on the basis of technical knowledge that a single author had written all of the letters, despite the facial differences in handwriting. No other evidence did so, and Tucker\u2019s expert testimony was powerful evidence to a lay jury. Thus, the State cannot establish that the error was harmless under this inquiry, either. Consequently, reversal here is \u201ccompelled.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 45. The State\u2014and the Court, I would add\u2014have failed to demonstrate \u201cno reasonable possibility exists that the admission of the tainted evidence might have contributed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 46.
