Grove pled not guilty. On the morning of his trial in the City of Helena Municipal Court, Grove filed a motion to dismiss the charges on the grounds that a trial delay violated his right to a speedy trial under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. The Municipal Court denied the motion. After a jury convicted him at trial, Grove appealed the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of his speedy trial motion to the First Judicial District Court. The District Court affirmed and Grove timely appealed. We reverse, addressing the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\n<em>Did the trial court correctly measure the six-month speedy trial deadline under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">\u00b62 The sole issue turns on the proper measurement of \u201cmonths\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. The relevant facts are not in dispute on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">\u00b63 A Helena police officer cited Grove for two misdemeanor offenses on September 27, 2015. Grove was arraigned on September 28, 2015. The Municipal Court initially scheduled Grove\u2019s trial for February 18, 2016, but moved the trial <em>sua sponte </em>to March 29, 2016. On the morning of trial, Grove filed a motion to dismiss, asserting the date of trial was one day past the six-month speedy trial deadline specified for misdemeanor prosecutions by \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. After the Municipal Court denied the motion, a jury convicted Grove as charged at a one-day jury trial on March 29, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">\u00b64 District courts serve as intermediate appellate courts for cases tried in municipal courts. <em>City of Red Lodge v. Pepper, </em>2016 MT 317, \u00b6 11, 385 Mont. 465, 385 P.3d 547; \u00a7\u00a7 3-5-303, 3-6-110, MCA. The scope of district court review on intermediate appeal is confined to review of the record and questions of law. <em>Pepper, </em>\u00b6 11; \u00a7 3-6-110, MCA. We review district court appellate decisions under the applicable standard of review as if originally appealed to this Court. <em>Pepper, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>City of Kalispell v. Gabbert, </em>2014 MT 296, \u00b6 12, 377 Mont. 17, 338 P.3d 51). Whether a criminal defendant\u2019s statutory right to speedy trial has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>been violated is a question of law subject to de novo review for correctness. <em>Pepper, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>Gabbert, </em>\u00b6 13).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b65 <em>Did the trial court correctly measure the six-month speedy trial deadline under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u00b66 Except under circumstances not at issue here, the trial court shall dismiss, \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d a misdemeanor prosecution \u201cnot brought to trial within 6 months\u201d \u201c[a]fter the entry of a plea.\u201d Section 46-13-401(2), MCA. In accordance with the plain language of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, the term \u201c6 months\u201d means \u201c6 calendar months rather than a specific number of days.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Chesarek, 1998 MT 15, \u00b6 10, 287 Mont. 215, 953 P.2d 698; <em>accord State v. Hayes, </em>1998 MT 14, \u00b6 11, 287 Mont. 210, 953 P.2d 700 (citing <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1007 (6th ed.1990)); \u00a7 1-1-301(3), MCA (a month \u201cmeans a calendar month\u201d). Thus, a \u201c \u2018month\u2019 means the time from any day of a month in the calendar to the corresponding day of the next month.\u201d <em>Hayes, </em>\u00b6 11. For example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">1 month would be from the 29th day of May to the 29th day of June. Correspondingly, 6 months would be from the 29th day of May to the 29th day of November.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-11\"><em>Hayes, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">\u00b67 Here, Grove pled not guilty on September 28, 2015. Reasoning that the 29th day of the month will occur seven times in the period from September 29, 2015, to and including March 29, 2016,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Grove asserts that his March 29, 2016, trial actually occurred one day after the last day of the statutory six-month period. However, based on <em>Hayes, </em>\u00b6 8 (start date of six month statutory period is next day after entry of plea), the State asserts that Grove\u2019s trial timely occurred on March 29, 2016, the last day of the statutory six-month period after he pled guilty on September 28, 2015. In <em>Hayes, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-14, we rejected a day-counting method similar to the counting method asserted by Grove. However, for a different reason, we agree that that Grove\u2019s trial was untimely under the plain meaning of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">\u00b68 Though we have consistently adhered to the plain meaning of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, we have inconsistently applied it in calculating the end date of the statutory six-month period after the date of entry of a defendant\u2019s plea. In <em>State v. Ronningen, </em>213 Mont. 358, 691 P.2d 1348 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>(1984), the defendant pled not guilty to a misdemeanor on October 12, 1983. <em>Ronningen, </em>213 Mont. at 360, 691 P.2d at 1349-50. Though we did not explicitly construe the meaning of the language of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, we noted the defendant\u2019s plea date of October 12, 1983, and thus concluded that April 12, 1984, was \u201cthe precise date on which six months had expired from the time defendant had entered his plea.\u201d <em>Ronningen, </em>213 Mont. at 360-61, 691 P.2d at 1349-50. Based on the April 30, 1984, scheduled trial date, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the misdemeanor charge pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. <em>Ronningen, </em>213 Mont. at 361, 691 P.2d at 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b69 Similarly, in <em>State v. Belgarde, </em>244 Mont. 500, 798 P.2d 539 (1990), the defendant was cited on October 12, 1988. <em>Belgarde, </em>244 Mont. at 507, 798 P.2d at 544. Again without explicit construction of \u00a7 46-13-201(2), MCA (1990), we concluded that the statutory six-month period expired on April 12, 1989. <em>Belgarde, </em>244 Mont. at 507, 798 P.2d at 544. Based on the April 12, 1989, trial date, we affirmed the trial court determination that the trial was timely under \u00a7 46-13-201(2), MCA. <em>Belgarde, </em>244 Mont. at 507, 798 P.2d at 544. Our calculations of the end date of the statutory six-month period in <em>Ronningen </em>and <em>Belgarde </em>are consistent with our subsequent plain meaning construction of \u00a7 46-13-401(2)\u2019s calendar month counting example in <em>Hayes, </em>\u00b6 11, which essentially calls for counting forward six months from the date of the plea to and including the day of the month that numerically corresponds with the date of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b610 However, by reference to since-superseded M. R. App. P. 21(a) (1988),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Belgarde </em>noted that the first day of the statutory six-month period is the day after the date of entry of plea. <em>Belgarde, </em>244 Mont. at 507, 798 P.2d at 544 (recognizing October 13, 1988, as the start of the statutory six-month period). Our reference to this time computation rule of appellate procedure was consistent with the plain language of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, triggering the start of the statutory period \u201cla liter the entry of a plea.\u201d However, setting up future imprecision, our summary analysis in <em>Belgarde </em>did not show or explain a uniform calendar month counting methodology, based on a next-day start date, that would result in our calculations of the end of the six-month period in <em>Ronningen </em>and <em>Belgarde. See Belgarde, </em>244 Mont. at 507, 798 P.2d at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>\u00b611 Without reconciliation with the counting methodology apparent in our six-month period end date calculations in <em>Ronningen </em>and <em>Belgarde, </em>we carried forward and expressly applied Belgarde\u2019s next-day start date concept in <em>Hayes </em>and <em>Chesarek. See Hayes, </em>\u00b6 8 (citing <em>Belgarde </em>for the proposition \u201cthat the statutory 6-month period begins to run on the day following the event which triggers the running of the time limitation and expires 6 months later\u201d); <em>Chesarek, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Hayes </em>for the proposition that \u201cthat the 6-month period ... begins to run the day after the entry of the plea and expires 6 months later\u201d). Accordingly, in <em>Hayes, </em>based on a plea date of May 28, 1996, and a next-day start date of May 29, 1996, we concluded that the statutory six-month period expired \u201c6 months later\u201d on November 29, 1996. <em>Hayes, </em>\u00b6 8. We thus affirmed the November 27, 1996, trial date as timely within the statutory six-month period. <em>Hayes, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8 and 15. Similarly, in <em>Chesarek, </em>based on a plea date of February 7, 1996, and a next-day start date of February 8, 1996, we concluded that the last day of the statutory six-month period was August 8, 1996. <em>Chesarek, </em>\u00b6 10. We thus affirmed the August 7, 1996, trial date as timely within the statutory six-month period. <em>Chesarek, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10 and 14. Because of the one-day differential that results from counting forward from either the date of plea or a day later, our six-month period end date calculations in <em>Ronningen </em>and <em>Belgarde </em>are irreconcilable with our end date calculations in <em>Hayes </em>and <em>Chesarek. </em>Though our ultimate holdings in those cases remain correct because the trial dates would have fallen with the statutory six-month period in either event, our calculations in <em>Hayes </em>and <em>Chesarek </em>incorrectly determined end dates that were actually one day later than the last day of the statutory six-month period after the date of entry of plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b612  Therefore, we hereby reaffirm our plain meaning construction of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, in <em>Hayes, </em>\u00b6 10, and <em>Chesarek, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-11. However, we clarify that the correct shorthand calculation method, as manifest in <em>Ronningen </em>and <em>Belgarde, </em>is to simply count forward six months on the calendar from the month of plea to the day in the sixth month corresponding to the numerical calendar day of the date of plea, which will then be last day of the six-month statutory period after the date of entry of plea. If the number of days in the sixth calendar month counting forward from the date of entry of plea is less than the numerical calendar date of entry of plea, then the last day of the statutory six-month period is last day of the sixth calendar month counting forward from the date of entry of plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b613  This case manifests the critical importance of the correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>application of our plain meaning construction of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. Grove pled not guilty on September 28, 2015. Using an incorrect month counting method as in <em>Hayes </em>and <em>Chesarek, </em>Grove\u2019s trial would have timely occurred on May 29, 2016. However, correctly counting forward six calendar months to the day of the sixth month that corresponds with his plea date, the last day of the statutory six-month period after Grove\u2019s plea date was March 28, 2016. Therefore, we conclude that Grove\u2019s March 29, 2016, trial was untimely under the plain meaning of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\u00b614 We hold that the Municipal Court erred in denying Grove\u2019s motion to dismiss due to lack of speedy trial pursuant \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA . We therefore reverse and remand for entry of an order vacating his misdemeanor conviction and dismissing the charge with prejudice.</p>\n<judges id=\"A_9\">JUSTICES McKINNON, SHEA, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-14\"> Because 2016 was a leap year, Grove counts February 29 among the seven dates numbered 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\"> Successor M.
