Verone. She executed a new will and amended her trust in 2012 (2012 Will and 2012 Trust), leaving much of her estate to her housekeeper, Nancy Schulz, and to her handyman, Paul Degel. Helen died in 2013. Schulz petitioned for probate of the 2012 Will. Verone objected and cross-petitioned for probate of the 2010 Will and for validation of the 2010 Trust. The District Court appointed Andrew Suenram, an attorney, as a neutral personal representative of the estate until it could be decided which of the two wills should be admitted to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">\u00b62 Following trial, a Madison County jury found in a special verdict that Schulz or Degel procured the 2012 Will and 2012 Trust by \u201cundue influence, fraud, or duress.\u201d Verone then moved to admit the 2010 Will to probate, to validate the 2010 Trust, and for attorney fees. The court denied her requests, and Verone appeals those denials. Schulz cross-appeals the court\u2019s appointment of Suenram as a neutral personal representative, several evidentiary rulings at trial, and the jury\u2019s special verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">\u00b63 We address the parties\u2019 claims in the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-11\">1. <em>Whether the District Court erred in appointing a neutral personal representative who was not required to defend the 2012 Will against Verone\u2019s challenge;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-12\">2. <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in its evidentiary rulings at trial;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-13\">3. <em>Whether substantial credible evidence existed to support the jury\u2019s findings that the 2012 Will and the 2012 Trust were procured by undue influence, fraud, or duress;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-14\">\n<em>4.

Prior to her husband Jim\u2019s death, Helen and Jim executed wills naming Verone the primary beneficiary. Verone had maintained a close relationship with Helen and Jim for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">\u00b66 Helen executed a new will and created the Helen Edwards Trust in September 2010. The 2010 Will included a pour-over clause distributing the residue of Helen\u2019s estate into the Trust. The 2010 Will and 2010 Trust devised most of Helen\u2019s estate to Verone. The 2010 Will named Verone personal representative of the estate, and the 2010 Trust named Helen and Verone co-trustees. The 2010 Trust also prescribed a procedure for amending the terms of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">\u00b67 Verone hired Schulz in 2011 to work as a housekeeper for Helen. Degel occasionally worked as a handyman for Helen. Helen executed a new will and amended her trust in November 2012, leaving much of her estate to Schulz and Degel, and reducing Verone\u2019s gift to $25,000. The 2012 Will appointed Schulz and R.D. Corette, an attorney, as co-personal representatives, and the 2012 Trust removed Verone as a co-trustee. The 2012 Trust provided also for a $300,000 gift to the Ruby Valley Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">\u00b68 After Helen\u2019s death, Schulz and Corette petitioned for formal probate of the 2012 Will. The court appointed Corette as special administrator of the estate. Verone filed objections to probate of the 2012 Will, arguing that Schulz and others procured that will by undue influence. Verone simultaneously offered the 2010 Will for probate and asserted that it and the 2010 Trust represented Helen\u2019s last, valid dispositional intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">\u00b69 The court appointed Suenram as interim personal representative of the estate and special fiduciary of the trust. It declared that, because the case sought to determine which of the two sets of testamentary documents was valid, Suenram would not advocate for one set over the other. Suenram informed the parties that he intended to remain neutral as to the validity of the competing sets of testamentary documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">\u00b610 The case proceeded to trial in November 2015. At trial, the court made multiple evidentiary rulings over Schulz\u2019s and Degel\u2019s objections. First, it admitted into evidence documentation of a settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>agreement between Verone and Ruby Valley Hospital, in which Verone agreed to grant the Hospital a $300,000 gift even if the jury invalidated the 2012 testamentary documents. Second, it sustained Verone\u2019s objections to testimony by Helen\u2019s attorneys regarding what she allegedly told them about her estate plans. Third, it barred one of Schulz\u2019s witnesses, Dr. Megan Evans, from testifying altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u00b611 At the close of trial, the jury returned a special verdict finding that Schulz or Degel had procured the 2012 Will and 2012 Trust by \u201cundue influence, fraud, or duress.\u201d The jury found also that the 2012 Trust did not violate the 2010 Trust\u2019s requirements for amendment or revocation. The special verdict form did not ask the jury to make any findings on the 2010 Will or the 2010 Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00b612 Verone filed a bill of costs and statement of fees. The court denied her request for attorney fees and partially denied her request for costs. It reasoned that Verone was statutorily barred from recovering attorney fees because the trial addressed only the validity of the 2012 Will, Verone \u201ccontested\u201d that will, and only parties who successfully \u201cdefended\u201d a will were entitled to fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">\u00b613 Verone also petitioned the court to admit the 2010 Will to probate and to declare the 2010 Trust valid, binding, and enforceable. When the court entered judgment, it denied Verone\u2019s requests, reasoning that the litigation \u201cdecided nothing about the validity\u201d of the 2010 Will or the 2010 Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\u00b614 Verone appeals the court\u2019s denial of her requests regarding the 2010 Will and the 2010 Trust and its denial of her request for attorney fees and costs. Schulz cross-appeals the court\u2019s appointment of Suenram as a neutral personal representative, the court\u2019s three evidentiary rulings at trial, and the jury\u2019s special verdict finding \u201cundue influence, fraud, or duress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s appointment of a personal representative to determine whether the court correctly interpreted the law. <em>In re Estate of McMurchie, </em>2004 MT 98, \u00b6 7, 321 Mont. 21, 89 P.3d 18.

Given the two competing wills, the court entered an order stating that it was \u201cinclined to appoint a neutral person/party [as personal representative]\u201d rather than someone \u201cwho may have an interest in the interpretation or validity of [the] disputed documents.\u201d Verone and special administrator Corette filed a joint motion requesting that the court appoint Suenram as interim personal representative. They suggested that, because the proceedings \u201cinvolve a Will contest to determine which of two Wills should be probated,\u201d Suenram should be appointed \u201cuntil there has been a legal determination of which Will shall be probated.\u201d The court then issued an order appointing Suenram as interim personal representative and terminating Corette\u2019s appointment as special administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">\u00b620 Suenram petitioned the court for appointment as special fiduciary of Helen\u2019s Trust. He filed a notice of issue pertaining to this appointment and served copies on Schulz and Degel. The court granted Suenram\u2019s petition and appointed him special fiduciary of the Trust. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Suenram then filed a notice and information to heirs and devisees, confirming his appointment as interim personal representative, and served copies on Schulz and Degel.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b621 Suenram mailed a letter to Schulz and to Degel\u2019s attorney in which he stated that he did not intend to \u201cadvocate for one testamentary document over another,\u201d because to do so would contradict his role as a \u201cneutral and disinterested party.\u201d Suenram requested that the parties stipulate that he had \u201cno fiduciary obligation to advocate for any of the testamentary documents prepared for Helen Edwards.\u201d He informed the parties that, if they did not agree to the stipulation, he would \u201cpetition the Court for a declaratory ruling regarding [his] fiduciary obligation.\u201d When neither Schulz nor Degel\u2019s attorney signed the stipulation, Suenram petitioned the court to declare that he was not obligated to defend the validity of any particular testamentary documents, including the 2012 documents. Suenram served this petition on Schulz\u2019s and Degel\u2019s attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u00b622 Schulz and Degel both formally objected to Suenram\u2019s petition. Schulz argued that Suenram \u201cshould advance and advocate for the [2012] Will and against the current challenge to the Will.\u201d The District Court granted Suenram\u2019s petition. The Final Pretrial Order, signed by counsel for all parties, stipulated that, pursuant to court orders, \u201cMr. Suenram is a neutral third party in this matter. His role is that of a fiduciary to preserve and maintain the assets of the estate and further distribute the assets pursuant to Court Order. Mr. Suenram will not advocate for any interested party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">\u00b623 Schulz argues on cross-appeal that the District Court erred in failing to appoint a personal representative charged with defending the 2012 Will against legal attack. Schulz claims that neither she nor Degel received notice of, or consented to, Suenram\u2019s appointment as a neutral interim personal representative who would not defend the 2012 Will against Verone\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">\u00b624 Montana law provides that a personal representative has a \u201cduty to settle and distribute the estate of the decedent in accordance with the terms of any probated and effective will,\u201d and that the personal representative shall use his authority \u201cfor the best interests of successors to the estate.\u201d Section 72-3-610, MCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A personal representative should not take actions that \u201cbenefit some of the successors at the expense of others.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Evans, </em>217 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>89, 96, 704 P.2d 35, 40 (1985). With regard to trusts, the law provides that \u201c[i]f a trust has two or more beneficiaries, the trustee shall act impartially in investing, managing, and distributing the trust property, giving due regard to the beneficiaries\u2019 respective interests.\u201d Section 72-38-803, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b625 At the time of Suenram\u2019s appointment, neither the 2010 Will nor the 2012 Will was \u201cprobated and effective.\u201d Section 72-3-610, MCA. The identities of the \u201csuccessors to the estate\u201d were undetermined. Section 72-3-610, MCA. Indeed, the very purpose of the litigation was to determine which of the two competing wills should be admitted to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u00b626 Verone filed obj ections to Schulz\u2019s and Corette\u2019s petition for formal probate of the 2012 Will and simultaneously offered the 2010 Will for probate. In her amended objections to probate of the 2012 Will, Verone requested \u201cadjudication and judgment that the [2010 Trust] is a valid, binding, and enforceable irrevocable Trust\u201d and \u201cadjudication and judgment... admitting the [2010 Will] to formal probate.\u201d In Schulz\u2019s response to Verone\u2019s amended objections, Schulz denied Verone\u2019s contentions that the 2010 Will and 2010 Trust were \u201cvalidly executed,\u201d that they \u201cmet all legal requirements,\u201d and that they \u201crepresent] ed I the last valid dispositional intentions of Helen Edwards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\u00b627 In Verone\u2019s and special administrator Corette\u2019s joint motion for appointment of a personal representative, the two stated, \u201cThese proceeding[s] involve a Will contest to determine which of two Wills should be probated.\u201d In the Final Pretrial Order, Verone identified as an issue of law, \u201cWhich of Helen Edwards\u2019 two wills (2010 or 2012) should be admitted to formal probate?\u201d In that same order, Schulz and Degel denied \u201call contentions\u201d of Verone and took the position that the 2012 Will was valid and that it revoked the 2010 Will. Schulz and Degel identified as issues of law, \u201cShould Helen Edwards\u2019 2012 Last Will and Testament be admitted to probate? ... If not, should Helen Edwards\u2019 2010 Last Will and Testament be admitted to probate?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AmX\">\u00b628 In an order on motions, the court acknowledged that Verone had \u201cfiled objections to probate of the 2012 Will and petitioned for formal probate of the 2010 [W]ill\u201d and that, \u201c[ <em>i \\n light of these competing petitions, </em>the parties agreed that the Court should appoint Andrew Suenram ... \u2018as interim personal representative.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) In that same order, the court noted that \u201cVerone has challenged the 2012 Will and offered the 2010 Will. The Court must determine the validity of the <em>competing wills.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Finally, the court acknowledged in its order on costs and fees that \u201cVerone filed objections to the probate of the 2012 Will, alleging that it had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>procured by undue influence, fraud, or duress. In the same document, Verone petitioned for formal probate of the 2010 Will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b629  As shown by the parties\u2019 pleadings and the court\u2019s treatment of the case, this litigation represented a contest between two competing wills to determine which should be admitted to probate. The court committed no legal error when it appointed Suenram as a neutral personal representative and held that he had no duty to defend either will until a determination had been made as to which will was valid and effective. <em>See In re Estate of McMurchie, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b630 Schulz\u2019s claim that she and Degel did not receive proper notice that Suenram would be appointed as a neutral personal representative lacks support in the record. Special administrator Corette\u2014who had jointly petitioned with Schulz for probate of the 2012 Will\u2014stipulated to Suenram\u2019s appointment as interim Personal Representative after the court stated that it was \u201cinclined to appoint a neutral person/party to serve as the Personal Representative.\u201d Schulz and Degel were notified that the court had appointed Suenram as personal representative. Suenram notified Schulz and Degel in writing that he intended to seek a court ruling that he was not obligated to advocate for the 2012 testamentary documents. When Suenram petitioned the court for such a ruling, he served his petition on Schulz and Degel. Schulz and Degel formally objected to that petition. They later stipulated in the Final Pretrial Order to Suenram\u2019s appointment as \u201ca neutral third party\u201d who would not \u201cadvocate for any interested party.\u201d Schulz and Degel thus had notice of Suenram\u2019s appointment as a neutral personal representative and special fiduciary. The District Court did not err in its appointment of Suenram.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">\u00b631 2. <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in its evidentiary rulings at trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\u00b632 Schulz appeals three evidentiary rulings that the District Court made at trial: the court\u2019s admission into evidence of a settlement agreement between Verone and Ruby Valley Hospital; the court\u2019s refusal to permit Helen\u2019s former attorneys from recounting certain statements Helen allegedly made about her estate plans; and the court\u2019s decision to bar Schulz\u2019s expert witness Dr. Megan Evans from testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">A. Verone\u2019s settlement documents with the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">\u00b633 Helen\u2019s 2012 Trust included a $300,000 gift to the Ruby Valley Hospital. Her 2010 testamentary documents contained no such bequest. Verone entered into a settlement agreement with the Hospital agreeing to give the Hospital $300,000 if she prevailed in admitting the 2010 Will to probate and in enforcing the 2010 Trust. Verone and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Hospital filed a joint petition for approval of their settlement with the court, and the court approved the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b634 At trial the court barred the parties from discussing the settlement agreement in the presence of the jury. During the testimony of Bethany Clark, an Adult Protective Services worker who conducted an investigation for financial exploitation of Helen, Schulz\u2019s attorney asked the witness, \u201cif you were to learn subsequently that Ms. Verone doesn\u2019t have any objection to the gift to the hospital [in the 2012 Trust], does that change the outcome of your investigation?\u201d Verone\u2019s attorney objected to the question for assuming facts not in evidence, and the court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u00b635 Verone subsequently sought to admit documentation of her settlement agreement with the Hospital into evidence, and the court allowed her to do so. The court reasoned that \u201cMs. Verone\u2019s attitude about a gift to the hospital has been brought into question by [Schulz\u2019s attorney\u2019s] inquiry.\u201d It stated further, \u201cThe inquiry is before the jury, so the Court is inclined to allow Ms. Verone to address it however she wishes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\u00b636 Schulz argues that the court erred in admitting evidence of the settlement between Verone and the Hospital. In Schulz\u2019s view, Verone sought to introduce this settlement for the purpose of proving that the parties agreed to the settlement, which M. R. Evid. 408 prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">\u00b637 Montana law provides that evidence pertaining to settlement negotiations is inadmissible to prove liability or the validity of a claim or its amount. M. R. Evid. 408; <em>Kiely Constr. L.L.C. v. City of Red Lodge, </em>2002 MT 241, \u00b6 95, 312 Mont. 52, 57 P.3d 836. Under the \u201copening the door\u201d doctrine, however, \u201cthe introduction of inadmissible evidence by one party allows an opponent, in the court\u2019s discretion, to introduce evidence on the same issue to rebut any false impression that might have resulted from the earlier admission.\u201d <em>Stevenson v. Felco Indus., </em>2009 MT 299, \u00b6 40, 352 Mont. 303, 216 P.3d 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">\u00b638  The District Court found that when Schulz suggested to Bethany Clark that Verone did not object to the 2012 Trust\u2019s $300,000 gift to the Hospital, she broached a subject that the court had barred from discussion\u2014Verone\u2019s settlement with the Hospital. Because Schulz raised this topic, the court permitted Verone to \u201cintroduce evidence on the same issue\u201d by showing the jury that she entered into an agreement with the Hospital to convey the $300,000 gift no matter the outcome of the litigation. <em>Stevenson, </em>\u00b6 40. The court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Schulz opened the door to admission of the settlement documents into evidence. <em>Beehler, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>B. Testimony of Helen\u2019s attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u00b639 The District Court prevented Helen\u2019s former attorneys from recounting statements that Helen may have made about her dispositional intentions when she executed the 2012 Will and the 2012 Trust. For instance, Schulz asked William Kebe, one of Helen\u2019s former attorneys, whether Helen had discussed with him \u201cthe changes that she wanted to make to her will and her trust\u201d during a September 2012 meeting. The court sustained Verone\u2019s objection. Responding to another question, Kebe testified, \u201cThe primary thrust of the conversation was she wanted to change ....\u201d The court again sustained Verone\u2019s hearsay objection. The court also prevented Kebe from answering questions about whether Helen said that she wanted to cut Verone out of the 2012 Will and the 2012 Trust. The court did permit testimony by Helen\u2019s attorneys about their interactions with her, their observations of her, the work they did in preparing her wills and trust documents, and their standard practices in preparing testamentary documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\u00b640 Schulz argues that the District Court wrongly barred Helen\u2019s attorneys from commenting on Helen\u2019s statements that may have reflected her testamentary intent. In her view, Helen\u2019s statements to her attorneys were admissible under M. R. Evid. 804(b)(5) because they contained \u201ccircumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness,\u201d and under M. R. Evid. 803(3) because they showed Helen\u2019s \u201cstate of mind.\u201d Schulz contends also that these statements were admissible under the \u201cverbal act doctrine,\u201d because the testimony sought to prove merely that Helen made the statements, as opposed to proving the truth of the matter asserted within the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u00b641 Hearsay statements are inadmissible unless they fall under an exception.

Testimony of Dr. Megan Evans.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\u00b643 Schulz sought to call Dr. Megan Evans, who evaluated Helen for competency in October 2012, as an expert witness at trial. Before trial, the court granted Verone\u2019s witness sequestration motion, in which Verone had asked the court to \u201cinstruct all parties and witnesses not to divulge to other witnesses any aspect of their trial testimony or evidence presented during trial prior to the witness being excused by the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">\u00b644 A few days before Dr. Evans\u2019s scheduled testimony, Dr. Bill Rosen, a medical doctor, testified as an expert witness for Verone. Dr. Rosen opined that Helen was unduly influenced. During his testimony, he referenced a three-page document that he claimed constituted medical literature in support of his testimony. Dr. Rosen gave a copy of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>document to Schulz\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b645 On the day of Dr. Evans\u2019s testimony, Verone\u2019s counsel noticed that Dr. Evans was in possession of the three-page document to which Dr. Rosen had referred during his testimony. When V erone\u2019s counsel asked where Dr. Evans obtained the document, Dr. Evans answered that Schulz\u2019s counsel had provided the document to her and asked her to review it before testifying. Verone\u2019s counsel informed the court of this interaction, and Schulz\u2019s counsel did not deny that she gave the document to Dr. Evans. The court admonished Schulz\u2019s counsel for violating its witness sequestration ruling, and Verone asked the court to bar Dr. Evans from testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b646 After significant deliberation with Verone\u2019s and Schulz\u2019s counsel, the court elected to proceed with voir dire of Dr. Evans. Dr. Evans stated in voir dire that she only evaluated Helen for competency, but not for her ability to withstand influence. Dr. Evans did note, however, that she made \u201cobservations\u201d about Helen\u2019s mental condition that led her to an opinion about Helen\u2019s ability to withstand influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u00b647 The court decided to bar Dr. Evans from testifying at trial. It noted that Dr. Evans \u201cdid not evaluate Helen Edwards for matters of undue influence ... she made observations. But her observations are of no utility unless she made an evaluation.\u201d The court reasoned that it did not wish to \u201crisk confusing the jury by allowing her to testify about her ... observations.\u201d It stated its concern that Dr. Evans\u2019s status as a doctor might cause the jury to give undue weight to her mere \u201cobservations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">\u00b648 Schulz argues that the District Court abused its discretion by preventing Dr. Evans from testifying. She contends that Dr. Evans\u2019s testimony was relevant to the jury\u2019s consideration of Helen\u2019s susceptibility to undue influence.

William Kebe, who met with Helen to prepare her 2012 testamentary documents, testified that he observed that Helen was \u201cdeliberate\u201d and that she \u201cknew what she was doing [and] why she was doing it.\u201d Maria Kegie-Shutey, another attorney present when Helen signed her 2012 testamentary documents, testified that she saw no signs that Helen was unduly influenced or was changing her will and trust by anything other than her own free will. Gayla Allhands, a friend of Helen, testified that Helen was \u201csharp as a tack,\u201d that she always exercised free will, and that she was not susceptible to undue influence. Dr. Roman Hendrickson, Helen\u2019s physician from 2006 to 2009 and again in 2012, testified that Helen seemed independent, that she was not susceptible to other people telling her what to do, and that she appeared in charge of her own affairs, such as maintaining her household, keeping her appointments, and entertaining visitors. He testified that he did not observe any signs of undue influence. Ken Fenno, Chief Executive Officer at Helen\u2019s bank, testified that, when Helen came into the bank in 2012, he was impressed by \u201chow sharp she was for her age\u201d and that she did not appear distressed or susceptible to undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u00b652  Schulz presented considerable evidence, including testimony both from friends and from professionals who had worked with Helen, attesting to their observations about Helen\u2019s susceptibility, or lack thereof, to undue influence. In the face of this evidence, we cannot conclude that the exclusion of Dr. Evans\u2019s testimony affected the outcome of the case. Dr. Evans would have supplied her own observations on the same point, which largely would have been cumulative of the other evidence. The District Court made a discretionary ruling to preclude her testimony based in part on its conclusion that the jury would afford undue weight to Dr. Evans\u2019s observations over those of other witnesses. We conclude that its ruling, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>even if arguably in error, is not cause for reversing the verdict. <em>Reese, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>S&amp;P, </em>\u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b653 3. <em>Whether substantial credible evidence existed to support the jury\u2019s findings that the 2012 Will and the 2012 Trust were procured by undue influence, fraud, or duress.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b654 Schulz argues on appeal that Verone presented no evidence that Schulz or Degel committed any acts of undue influence, fraud, or duress and therefore that the jury\u2019s special verdict was unsupported by substantial credible evidence. Schulz contends that evidence that she and Degel had the \u201copportunity\u201d to unduly influence Helen or that there was suspicion of undue influence was insufficient without proof of specific acts by Schulz or Degel with the purpose of affecting changes to Helen\u2019s will and trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u00b655  Montana law provides that a finding of either undue influence, fraud, or duress may invalidate a will or a trust.

Helen and her late husband Jim treated Verone \u201clike their daughter.\u201d Helen spoke on the phone with Verone almost daily. Verone was the primary beneficiary in Helen\u2019s and Jim\u2019s 2007 wills and in Helen\u2019s 2010 testamentary documents. Testimony from Verone and Helen\u2019s friends alleged that Schulz was not a significant part of Helen\u2019s life prior to her employment in 2011. Indeed, some of Helen\u2019s longtime friends, such as Van Crosby, testified that they had never heard of Schulz prior to 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u00b658 Helen\u2019s friends Betty Staley, Doris Ryan, Crosby, and Diane Orr testified that, when they would visit Helen at home or in the hospital, Schulz typically would not leave the room or give them privacy, and when she did, she did so reluctantly. Schulz would answer Helen\u2019s phone when these friends called her, and Schulz often would not allow them to speak with Helen. Crosby testified that Schulz was \u201cdominating\u201d Helen. Testimony from Staley, Ryan, Verone, and Vicki Gordon established that Helen engaged in behavior with Schulz that the witnesses viewed as disturbing and uncharacteristic of Helen. This behavior included Schulz and Helen rubbing noses, sticking their tongues out at each other, and speaking \u201cbaby talk\u201d to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"A6V\">\u00b659 Dr. Rosen testified that Helen experienced \u201csocial isolation,\u201d that she was susceptible to undue influence, and that the estate plan described in her 2012 testamentary documents was consistent with a finding of undue influence. Testimony from Bethany Clark, who relayed notes from Helen\u2019s former doctor, Dr. Googe, established that Helen was \u201chighly vulnerable\u201d and \u201ceasily manipulated\u201d by persons in close contact with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u00b660 After Schulz began working as Helen\u2019s housekeeper, Orr noticed that Helen became unusually quiet and less \u201copen\u201d than she used to be and that she began to \u201ccurl into herself.\u201d Orr testified that she previously knew Helen to be \u201coutgoing\u201d and \u201cvivacious.\u201d Staley testified that Helen started acting differently in 2012 and appeared \u201cmore distressed,\u201d \u201cmore insecure,\u201d and \u201canxious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\u00b661 Gordon testified that Helen seemed \u201cdependent\u201d on Schulz and that Helen did not seem to be \u201cin charge\u201d or making her own decisions. Staley\u2019s and Kebe\u2019s testimony established that Helen attempted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>remove Staley as a beneficiary other will shortly after Staley got into an argument with Schulz in April 2013. Verone testified that in August 2012 she heard Schulz order Helen to \u201cget those papers; we need to have those papers signed,\u201d referring to documents that Schulz wanted Verone to sign. Verone claimed that, around that same time, Schulz began writing herself checks from Helen\u2019s bank account for her work as Helen\u2019s housekeeper, rather than submitting her timesheets to Verone as she had done before. In October 2012, Schulz accompanied Helen to the bank, where Helen added Schulz as a signatory on her checking account. Around the same time, Helen gave Schulz two powers of attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b662 Testimony from Verone and Degel established that Degel wanted Helen\u2019s property \u201con the mountain\u201d\u2014property that Helen ultimately gifted to him in her 2012 Trust. Degel testified that he, Schulz, and Helen visited the mountain property in 2012 and generally discussed Helen\u2019s estate planning there. On two occasions in 2012, Schulz drove Helen to her attorney\u2019s office\u2014approximately a two-hour round-trip drive\u2014where she had appointments to discuss changes to her testamentary documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b663 Schulz and Degel testified that they believed Verone wanted to put Helen in a nursing home. Degel stated that he knew Helen believed Verone wanted to put her in a nursing home, and he admitted that he did nothing to ease Helen\u2019s concerns that Verone would do that. Crosby, who knew Degel well, testified that Degel constantly criticized Verone and made derogatory comments about her. Testimony from Verone and Staley established that Helen became more critical of Verone in 2012 than she had ever been. Verone testified that Helen became \u201ccold\u201d and \u201cdistant\u201d towards her and did not want to talk to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b664 The evidence before the jury that Schulz or Degel exercised undue influence on Helen was substantial. The testimony established that Schulz and Helen had a confidential relationship and that Schulz held \u201creal or apparent authority over\u201d Helen, including, among other things, Schulz\u2019s status as a housekeeper, her screening of Helen\u2019s phone calls, her failure to leave the room when Helen\u2019s friends came to visit, and the fact that she had obtained Helen\u2019s powers of attorney and the right to sign checks from Helen\u2019s account.

This included testimony that Schulz isolated Helen socially, testimony that Dr. Rosen believed that Helen was susceptible to undue influence, and testimony that Dr. Googe believed that Helen was</p>\n<p id=\"APN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>\u201cvulnerable\u201d and \u201ceasily manipulated.\u201d The jury could have inferred from the evidence that Helen\u2019s \u201cdisposition of property was [not] natural,\u201d given Helen\u2019s closeness to Verone for so many years, her inclusion of Verone as the primary beneficiary in her 2007 and 2010 testamentary documents, and the testimony that Helen and Schulz were not close prior to Schulz\u2019s employment in 2011. <em>Mead, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b665 The testimony also provided the jury with substantial circumstantial evidence to conclude that Schulz or Degel had committed \u201cspecific acts\u201d in order to \u201cprocure the execution of the will.\u201d <em>Mead, </em>\u00b6 27. The testimony established that Schulz\u2019s and Degel\u2019s increasing involvement in Helen\u2019s life leading up to the execution of her 2012 Will and her 2012 Trust coincided with Helen\u2019s change in personality and a deterioration of her relationship with Verone. The jury could have inferred from the testimony that Schulz and Degel deliberately acted to convince Helen to replace Verone with them as primary beneficiaries to her estate. The circumstantial evidence supported a finding that Schulz and Degel may have acted to exacerbate Helen\u2019s fear that Verone would put her in a nursing home despite evidence that Verone acted to reduce the need to move Helen into a nursing home. Verone hired Schulz to assist Helen with household maintenance, and she remodeled Helen\u2019s home to improve its accessibility. The jury also could have inferred from the evidence that Schulz and Degel used their exclusive access to Helen\u2014driving her to appointments with her attorneys and to her mountaintop property to discuss her estate plans\u2014to pressure Helen to change her estate plan in their favor. Thus, by considering \u201cthe opportunity to exercise undue influence\u201d together with both direct and circumstantial evidence of the \u201calleged acts of influence,\u201d the jury reasonably could have determined that Schulz\u2019s and Degel\u2019s actions amounted to undue influence. <em>In re Estate of Harms, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b666  Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Verone, we conclude that the jury\u2019s findings that the 2012 Will and the 2012 Trust were procured by \u201cundue influence, fraud, or duress\u201d were supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Murray, \u00b6 7; D.R.

Because the jury\u2019s invalidation of the 2012 Will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>and the 2012 Trust was supported by substantial credible evidence, whether the 2012 Trust complied with the required procedures for amendment of the 2010 Trust is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b668 4. <em>Whether the District Court erred in refusing to admit the 2010 Will to probate or to validate the 2010 Trust following the jury\u2019s special verdict.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b669 Following the jury\u2019s verdict, Ver one requested judgment admitting the 2010 Will to probate and recognizing the 2010 Trust as \u201cvalid, binding, and enforceable.\u201d The District Court entered judgment invalidating the 2012 Will and the 2012 Trust but refused Verone\u2019s requests regarding the 2010 Will and the 2010 Trust. The court reasoned that the 2010 testamentary documents were not at issue in this case. It stated that the 2010 Will had not been submitted \u201cto scrutiny by the Court and potential objectors\u201d and that the jury\u2019s special verdict \u201cdid not confirm the validity of the 2010 Will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u00b670 Schulz and Degel argue that the trial resolved only the issue whether the 2012 testamentary documents were valid and that the 2010 testamentary documents were not at issue in this case.

After the court conducts a hearing and other procedural requirements have been met, the court \u201cshall determine ... the decedent\u2019s state of testacy. Any will found to be valid and unrevoked must be formally probated.\u201d Section 72-3-313, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">\u00b672  Our de novo review of Verone\u2019s entitlement to judgment as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>matter of law leads us to conclude that the District Court erred in refusing to admit the 2010 Will to probate and to enforce the terms of the 2010 Trust. It is undisputed that Schulz and Corette fulfilled the procedural requirements for initiating formal probate proceedings under \u00a7\u00a7 72-3-301, -302, and -305, MCA. Verone objected to probate of the 2012 Will, in compliance with \u00a7 72-3-308, MCA, and cross-petitioned for probate of the 2010 Will. When Verone petitioned the court to enter judgment admitting the 2010 Will to probate, she joined the issue of the 2010 Will\u2019s validity to the petition for probate of the 2012 Will.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b673 The litigation before the District Court constituted a contest between the 2010 Will and the 2012 Will. Because Schulz and Degel opposed probate of the 2010 Will through the \u201cpetition for probate of a later will revoking the former [will],\u201d the court was required to determine \u201cfirst whether the later will [was] entitled to probate.\u201d Section 72-3-311, MCA. The jury\u2019s special verdict answered this question when it invalidated the 2012 Will.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u00b674 Once the jury issued its verdict, the court was required to determine \u201cthe decedent\u2019s state of testacy\u201d and formally probate \u201c[a]ny will found to be valid and unrevoked.\u201d Section 72-3-313, MCA. Verone had admitted the 2010 Will into evidence without objection. Schulz and Degel stipulated in the Final Pretrial Order that the 2010 Will was \u201cproperly witnessed and notarized\u201d and that Helen \u201cdid not lack Testamentary Intent or Capacity\u201d when she executed that will.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b675 Only an \u201cinterested person\u201d possesses legal standing to contest a will. Section 72-3-302(2), MCA; <em>Stoican v. Wagner (In re Estate of Lawlor), </em>2015 MT 54, \u00b6 16, 378 Mont. 281, 343 P.3d 577. A party qualifies as an \u201cinterested person\u201d if he or she has \u201ca property right in or claim against ... the estate of a decedent.\u201d Section 72-1-103(25), MCA. \u201cThat is, a party has standing to contest a will if he or she stands to gain from a successful contest.\u201d <em>Stoican, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\u00b676  Aside from their claims under the 2012 Will, Schulz and Degel did not have standing to challenge the 2010 Will. That will did not name them as beneficiaries, and they would not have been entitled to an intestate share of Helen\u2019s estate, because they are not related to her. <em>See generally </em>\u00a7\u00a7 72-2-111 to -124, MCA. They did not \u201cstand[ ] to gain from a successful contest\u201d of the 2010 Will. <em>Stoican, </em>\u00b6 16. Thus, once the jury declared the 2012 Will invalid, the 2010 Will became the only \u201cvalid and unrevoked\u201d will before the court. Section 72-3-313, MCA. Helen\u2019s \u201cstate of testacy\u201d at that point was that her 2010 Will was the only will that represented her dispositional intentions. Section 72-3-313, MCA. The court was statutorily required to admit the 2010 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Will to probate. Section 72-3-313, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b677 The Montana Rules of Civil Procedure provide that a judgment \u201cshould grant the relief to which each party is entitled.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 54(c); <em>Goodover v. Lindey\u2019s, </em>255 Mont. 430, 438, 843 P.2d 765, 770 (1992). Questions of law must be decided by a court, rather than by a jury. Section 26-1-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u00b678 Verone asserted the validity of the 2010 Trust, and Schulz and Degel did not object to the 2010 Trust\u2019s validity other than by asserting that the 2012 Trust amended it. When the jury issued its verdict invalidating the 2012 Trust, the only valid trust remaining before the court was the 2010 Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u00b679 The District Court was obligated in issuing its judgment not only to enforce the mandate of the jury\u2019s special verdict, but to \u201cgrant the relief to which each party [was] entitled.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 54(c); <em>Goodover, </em>255 Mont. at 438, 843 P.2d at 770. Because the parties pleaded, and the litigation involved, a contest between two sets of competing testamentary documents, and the jury invalidated the 2012 set, Verone was legally entitled to probate of the 2010 Will and validation of the 2010 Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\u00b680 The validity of the 2010 testamentary documents was not a fact that the parties put at issue for the jury to decide. Admission of the 2010 Will to probate and enforcement of the 2010 Trust\u2014the only valid testamentary documents before the court after the jury issued its verdict\u2014was a question of law to be decided by the court, not by the jury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 26-1-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">\u00b681 We reverse and remand with instructions that the court admit the 2010 Will to probate and enforce the terms of the 2010 Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">\u00b682 5. <em>Whether the District Court erred in refusing to award Verone attorney fees and certain costs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">\u00b683 After the jury\u2019s special verdict, Verone filed a bill of costs and statement of fees in which she requested a total of $903,468.56, which included $892,018.63 in attorney fees and $11,449.93 in costs. The District Court denied Verone\u2019s request for attorney fees and partially denied her request for costs. In denying Verone\u2019s request for attorney fees, the court reasoned that the relevant statute\u2014\u00a7 72-12-206, MCA\u2014\u201climits recovery of attorney fees to only those parties who successfully defended a will. It specifically precludes parties who contest a will from recovering attorney fees even if successful.\u201d The court found that Verone had contested probate of the 2012 Will, but that Schulz and Degel had not contested probate of the 2010 Will. Further, the court reasoned that the statute permitted recovery of attorney fees by the party defending a will only \u201cif the will in probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>is confirmed.\u201d Because Verone contested the 2012 Will but did not defend the 2010 Will, and because neither will was admitted to probate, the court concluded that the statute barred Verone from recovering attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u00b684 Verone argues that the court erred in not awarding her attorney fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She asserts that she defended the 2010 Will and therefore that \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA, did not bar her from recovering attorney fees. Verone requests that this Court remand for a determination and award of the appropriate fees to be awarded to her. She contends also that she is entitled to attorney fees under \u00a7 72-3-632, MCA, because the 2010 Will nominated her personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u00b685 Schulz and Degel assert that the District Court was correct in its ruling on attorney fees because Verone contested\u2014rather than defended\u2014the 2012 Will, which in their view was the only will at issue in the case. They argue that the 2010 Will was not litigated before the District Court, that they did not contest that will, and therefore that the statute bars Verone\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u00b686 The statute governing awards of attorney fees to parties in a will contest provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">When the validity or probate of a will is <em>contested </em>through court action, <em>the attorney fees and costs, </em>as provided in 25-10-201, <em>incurred in defending the validity or probate of the will must be paid by the party contesting the validity or probate of the will if the will in probate is confirmed. </em>If the probate is revoked, costs, as provided in 25-10-201, <em>but not attorney fees, </em>must be paid by the party who resisted the revocation or out of the property of the decedent, as the court directs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Section 72-12-206, MCA (emphasis added). In contrast, a personal representative who \u201cdefends or prosecutes a proceeding in good faith, whether successful or not... is entitled to receive from the estate the personal representative\u2019s necessary expenses and disbursements, including reasonable attorney fees incurred.\u201d Section 72-3-632, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"Atb\">\u00b687 As an initial matter, the court correctly interpreted the meaning of \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA. This Court has rarely applied or interpreted this statute, which long predates Montana\u2019s adoption of the Uniform Probate Code (UPC). The UPC does not appear to contain a corollary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>provision. The statute\u2019s history does suggest, however, that it has always required that only a successful \u201cdefender\u201d of a will in contest\u2014and not a successful \u201ccontestant\u201d\u2014may recover attorney fees. <em>See In re Kesl\u2019s Estate, </em>117 Mont. 377, 161 P.2d 641 (1945) (concluding that an earlier version of this statute, Section 10047, R.C.M. (1935), required that the party who unsuccessfully contests a will must pay attorney fees, but that the party who unsuccessfully defends a will need only pay costs). The Montana Legislature most recently amended \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA, in 1993 to include language that if a will challenge is successful and probate is revoked, costs, \u201cbut not attorney fees,\u201d must be paid by the party who defended the will. 1993 Mont. Laws 1835. The history of this statute makes clear that if a party successfully contests a will, she is entitled to costs, but not attorney fees, whereas if a party successfully defends a will, she is entitled to both attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b688 On the record of this case, however, the District Court\u2019s determination that \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA, barred Verone\u2019s claim for attorney fees was incorrect. <em>Mlekush, </em>\u00b6 8. This case involved a petition for probate of a will and a cross-petition for probate of an earlier will. The personal representative remained a \u201cneutral third party\u201d and did not defend the validity of either will. Had Suenram defended either of these wills, he would have been entitled to fees from the Estate under \u00a7 72-3-632, MCA. But because the appointed personal representative did not advocate for one of these wills over the other, \u00a7 72-3-632, MCA, does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b689 As discussed earlier, the court and the parties treated the case from the beginning as a contest between two competing wills. The court described in an order the \u201ccompeting petitions\u201d for probate of the 2012 Will and the 2010 Will and stated that it \u201cmust determine the validity of the competing wills.\u201d The court correctly determined that Verone contested the 2012 Will and that Schulz and Degel defended it. But, as reflected in the pleadings and in the Final Pretrial Order, Schulz and Degel also contested the 2010 Will, and Verone defended it. In the pleadings, Schulz denied Verone\u2019s contention that the 2010 Will represented \u201cthe last valid dispositional intentions of Helen Edwards.\u201d In the Final Pretrial Order, Schulz and Degel took the position that the 2012 Will revoked the 2010 Will, and they listed as an issue of law whether the 2010 Will should be admitted to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u00b690  Once the jury issued its verdict, the District Court should have admitted the 2010 Will to probate as a matter of law. At that point, \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA, would have applied to the 2010 Will, because that will would have been a \u201cwill in probate\u201d that was \u201cconfirmed.\u201d Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Verone successfully defended that will, the statute did not bar her from seeking attorney fees that she \u201cincurred in defending the validity or probate\u201d of the 2010 Will. Section 72-12-206, MCA. The District Court thus erred in determining that Verone was statutorily barred from recovering attorney fees. <em>Mlekush, </em>\u00b6 8. The amount of any fees to which Verone may be entitled for her defense of the 2010 Will is a matter for review and determination by the District Court. We remand for further proceedings on Verone\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00b691 We affirm the District Court\u2019s appointment of Suenram as a neutral personal representative, the court\u2019s three evidentiary rulings that Schulz appealed, and the jury\u2019s special verdict finding \u201cundue influence, fraud, or duress.\u201d We reverse the court\u2019s decision not to admit the 2010 Will to probate or to validate the 2010 Trust and its denial of Verone\u2019s request for attorney fees. We remand with instructions that the court initiate probate proceedings of the 2010 Will and for further proceedings on Verone\u2019s request for attorney fees, consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b321-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, SANDEFUR and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-9\"> The law defines \u201csuccessors\u201d as \u201cpersons, other than creditors, who are entitled to property of a decedent under the decedent\u2019s will.\u201d Section 72-1-103(48), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b319-10\"> Verone asserts in her issue statement that the District Court also erred in partially denying her request for costs, but she makes no argument on this point separate from her argument regarding attorney fees.
