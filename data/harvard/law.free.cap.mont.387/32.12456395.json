We address the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">\n<em>Whether the Municipal Court erred in imposing alcohol-related conditions on the defendant\u2019s sentence.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">\u00b63 On January 29, 2015, Daniel Barth ran a stop sign while driving a Chevrolet Avalanche and collided with a Dodge Caravan at an intersection in Billings, Montana. Barth was identified as the driver of the Avalanche by a license plate recovered at the scene and by the testimony of an eyewitness who picked him out of a photo lineup. The occupants of the Caravan, a young mother and her eight-month-old child, suffered several serious injuries, requiring medical treatment. Instead of remaining at the scene to check on the well-being of the victims and to alert authorities of the accident, Barth fled. The next day, Barth called police to report that his Avalanche had been stolen the night before.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">\u00b64 Barth was charged with: (1) negligent endangerment in violation of \u00a7 45-5-208, MCA; (2) leaving the scene of an injury accident in violation of \u00a7 61-7-103, MCA; and (3) failing to give notice of an accident in violation of \u00a7 61-7-108, MCA. On September 4, 2015, a jury found Barth guilty of all charges. At the sentencing hearing, the City introduced evidence of Barth\u2019s criminal record, including seven convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), and other traffic violations. Barth\u2019s most recent alcohol-related conviction was a DUI in 2007. The City contended that it was impossible to tell if alcohol was a factor in Barth\u2019s accident in this case because he fled the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">\u00b65 Citing concerns about Barth\u2019s history with alcohol, the Municipal Court included six conditions to Barth\u2019s suspended sentence for negligent endangerment, four of which pertained to alcohol use:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-13\">3. Defendant shall be subject to random urinalysis and breath testing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-14\">4. Defendant shall not enter any place where alcohol is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>primary item of sale including bars and casinos;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">5. Defendant shall not consume any alcohol, drugs, or mood-altering substances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">6. Defendant shall complete a chemical dependency evaluation and shall follow all recommendations made by the licensed addictions counselor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The Municipal Court specifically concluded that Barth was a danger to society because of his history of DUIs.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">\u00b66 Barth filed a timely appeal to the District Court regarding the four alcohol-related conditions of his sentence. Barth did not appeal his convictions or the non-alcohol related conditions of his sentence. Barth argued that the Municipal Court did not establish a sufficient nexus between his criminal history and the conditions imposed on his sentence that related to alcohol. On January 27, 2016, the District Court issued an order and decision affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s conditions. Barth timely appeals the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">\u00b67 On an appeal from a municipal court, district courts function as an intermediate appellate court. <em>City of Bozeman v. Cantu, </em>2013 MT 40, \u00b6 10, 369 Mont. 81, 296 P.3d 461. When the district court is subsequently appealed, we review the case as if the appeal had originally been filed in this Court, and apply the appropriate standard of review. <em>Cantu, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">\u00b68 Sentencing conditions are reviewed first for the condition\u2019s legality, and then for abuse of discretion. <em>Cantu, </em>\u00b6 11. A condition is illegal when there exists no statutory authority to impose it, where the condition exceeds the limits of the relevant sentencing statute, or where the court fails to \u201cadhere to the affirmative mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes.\u201d <em>State v. Heddings, </em>2008 MT 402, \u00b6 11, 347 Mont. 169, 198 P.3d 242. If the condition is legal, we then determine if the condition is a \u201creasonable restriction, or condition considered necessary for rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society.\u201d Section 46-18-201(4)(q), <em>MCA; Heddings, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">\u00b69 <em>Whether the Municipal Court erred in imposing alcohol-related conditions on the defendant\u2019s sentence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-14\">\u00b610 In order for a sentencing court to impose a condition on a defendant\u2019s suspended sentence, the court must find a nexus between the condition and the underlying offense or the offender\u2019s history. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 187, 179 P.3d 1164. Offender-related conditions are appropriate only when the \u201chistory or pattern of conduct to be restricted is recent, and significant or chronic.\u201d <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15. A condition will be invalidated where the nexus is absent altogether, or is \u201cexceedingly tenuous.\u201d <em>State v. Melton, </em>2012 MT 84, \u00b6 18, 364 Mont. 482, 276 P.3d 900 <em>(citing State v. Zimmerman, </em>2010 MT 44, \u00b6 17, 355 Mont. 286, 228 P.3d 1109).</p>\n<p id=\"AsC\">\u00b611  Section 46-18-201(4)(q), MCA, gives sentencing courts the legal authority to impose any reasonable conditions on suspended sentences. At the sentencing hearing, the Municipal Court made clear that the conditions imposed were designed to protect society from Barth\u2019s criminal behavior and alcohol abuse. As there exists clear statutory authority for the Municipal Court\u2019s actions, the conditions imposed on Barth\u2019s suspended sentence were legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b612 We next determine if the condition is reasonable. In that regard, we assess whether the \u201chistory or pattern of conduct to be restricted is recent, and significant or chronic.\u201d <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15. Barth does not dispute that his seven DUI convictions constitute a significant and chronic problem; rather, he contends his alcohol abuse is not recent. Barth argues that because his last DUI prior to the hit-and-run was eight years old, the DUI is both remote and stale under <em>Ashby. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AUt\">\u00b613  We have previously held that a history of chemical dependency, despite no evidence of alcohol abuse in sixteen years prior to arrest, was a sufficient nexus to the offender to support a condition prohibiting alcohol use. <em>State v. Winkel, </em>2008 MT 89, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 342 Mont. 267, 182 P.3d 54. In <em>Winkel, </em>the concern was that alcohol would hinder Winkel\u2019s rehabilitation in light of his extensive history with chemical dependency. Similarly, Barth has developed a lengthy and substantial history of driving under the influence, as well as reckless and careless driving over the last thirty years. As in <em>Winkel, </em>Barth\u2019s history suggests that alcohol presents a barrier to his rehabilitation and makes him a danger to society. Barth\u2019s eight-year-old DUI is decidedly more recent than the sixteen-year gap in <em>Winkel, </em>and is sufficient to meet the recency requirement set forth in <em>Ashby. </em>The Municipal Court\u2019s alcohol-related conditions were both legal and reasonable, and have a sufficient nexus to Barth\u2019s history of alcohol abuse and reckless driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\u00b614 It is unfortunate for Barth that any evidence that his hit-and-run was not alcohol-related evaporated when he chose to flee the scene. On that score, however, Barth is the author of his own misfortune. More to the point, even if we were to give Barth the benefit of the doubt that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>he was merely callous, rather than intoxicated, when he fled the scene of an accident in which he seriously injured a mother and her eight-month-old infant, his extensive DUI history, and obvious chemical dependency issues, justified the alcohol-related conditions imposed by the Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b615 We affirm the District Court\u2019s order upholding the Municipal Court\u2019s alcohol-related conditions on Barth\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b60-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
