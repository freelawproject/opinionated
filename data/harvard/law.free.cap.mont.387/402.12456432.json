Foster (Foster) appeals from the April 1, 2016 District Court denial of his motion to suppress all evidence and motion to dismiss. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\"><em>Was the District Court\u2019s finding that particularized suspicion existed to support an investigatory stop clearly </em>erroneous?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">\u00b63 On April 10, 2015, at approximately 4:57 p.m., Jonathan Rees (Rees) called 911, stating that he was following a driver who appeared to be intoxicated. Rees advised the dispatch that he was driving southbound on Highway 41 near mile marker 14, between Twin Bridges and Dillon, Montana, and that the driver of a dark blue Dodge Ram pickup with a large concrete cylinder in the bed was potentially drunk, as he was \u201cdriving all over the road.\u201d Rees identified himself by first and last name, spelled his last name, and agreed to go to the Beaverhead County Courthouse to sign his report.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">\u00b64 Montana Highway Patrol Trooper Mitch Voss (Trooper Voss) heard radio traffic regarding the potential drunk driver. Trooper Voss was on a residential road, which intersected Highway 41. Trooper Voss testified that he saw a vehicle matching Rees\u2019 description at mile marker 9 on Highway 41. Trooper Voss followed the dark blue Dodge Ram with a concrete cylinder in the bed, observed the vehicle crossing the white line and then coming back into the lane of travel, travel at a relatively low speed, and weave within the lane. Trooper Voss pulled the vehicle over at 5:15 p.m. near mile marker 2 on Highway 41. Trooper Voss identified Foster as the driver and after an investigation arrested Foster for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI)-</p>\n<p id=\"A-g\">\u00b65 The State charged Foster with the offense of DUI. Foster pled not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>guilty. In August 2015 Foster filed a motion to suppress evidence and dismiss the charges based on Trooper Voss\u2019 lack of particularized suspicion for the stop. After a September 21,2015 hearing, the Justice Court denied Foster\u2019s motion to suppress and dismiss on October 3, 2015. On October 29, 2015, following a bench trial, the Justice Court convicted Foster of DUI. Foster filed an appeal to the District Court. He moved to suppress all evidence and to dismiss the charge. After a full briefing by both parties, the District Court conducted a hearing on April 1, 2016. On May 13, 2016, the District Court denied Foster\u2019s motions. Foster and the State entered a plea agreement and on June 17,2016, Foster changed his plea to guilty reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b66 We review a district court's denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the court's findings are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were applied correctly as a matter of law. <em>State v. Gill, </em>2012 MT 36, \u00b6 10, 364 Mont. 182, 272 P.3d 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">\u00b67 <em>Was the District Court\u2019s finding that particularized suspicion existed to support an investigatory stop clearly </em>erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">\u00b68 Foster argues the District Court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the evidence of the stop. Foster argues Trooper Voss lacked the objective data or articulable facts necessary to create particularized suspicion for the investigatory stop. Foster asserts Rees\u2019 report was unreliable because Rees failed to provide sufficient personally identifying information, and Trooper Voss did not corroborate the vehicle\u2019s description. The State argues the District Court\u2019s determination that Trooper Voss had particularized suspicion to stop Foster is supported by substantial evidence in the record and is not clearly erroneous. The State maintains that Rees\u2019 report contained sufficient indicia of reliability to support the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">\u00b69 Both the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution protect individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. U.S. Const. amend. IV; Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 11. Under Montana law, a law enforcement officer \u201cmay stop any person or vehicle that is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d Section 46-5-401(1), MCA; <em>State v. Peters, </em>2011 MT 274, \u00b6 57, 362 Mont. 389, 264 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>1124; <em>Hulse v. DOJ, Motor Vehicle Div., </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 12, 289 Mont. 1, 961 P.2d 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\u00b610 Particularized suspicion exists when an officer has \u201cobjective data and articulable facts from which an officer can make certain inferences, and a resulting suspicion that the subject is, or has been, engaged in wrongdoing.\u201d <em>City of Missoula v. Moore, </em>2011 MT 61, \u00b6 16, 360 Mont. 22, 251 P.3d 679. Whether particularized suspicion exists is a question of fact, which is evaluated under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gill, </em>\u00b6 15. When evaluating the totality of the circumstances a court considers the quantity or content of the information available and the quality or degree of reliability of that information. <em>Gill, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b611  An arresting officer may rely on information conveyed by a reliable third person to form the particularized suspicion necessary to justify an investigative stop. <em>State v. Pratt, </em>286 Mont. 156, 162, 951 P.2d 37, 41 (1997). To determine the reliability of a third person report and thus the sufficiency of an officer\u2019s particularized suspicion based on that report, this Court has adopted three factors to use in its evaluation. <em>State v. Clawson, </em>2009 MT 228, \u00b6 11, 351 Mont. 354, 212 P.3d 1056 (citing Pratt, 286 Mont. at 164-65, 951 P.2d at 42-43). The factors are: (1) whether the informant identified themselves to the authorities; (2) whether the informant\u2019s report is based on personal observation; and (3) whether the officer\u2019s observations corroborate the informant\u2019s information. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 164-65, 951 P.2d at 42-43.</p>\n<p id=\"ACY\">\u00b612 Foster argues Rees\u2019 report was unreliable, and even if it was reliable, Trooper Voss failed to obtain objective data or articulable facts sufficient to provide particularized suspicion for the stop. We judge the reliability of the citizen informant\u2019s report using the <em>Pratt </em>factors. The first <em>Pratt </em>factor is whether the informant identified himself or herself to the authorities. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 43. Foster argues Rees\u2019 report is unreliable because he failed to provide and dispatch failed to ask for personal identifying information such as Rees\u2019 phone number and address. Foster asserts that Rees was required to provide his name, address, and phone number; otherwise, the report is unreliable. We are not convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\u00b613  An informant\u2019s tip may be considered more reliable where the citizen identifies himself or herself, thus exposing himself to civil and criminal liability. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 42; see <em>also State v. Myhre, </em>2005 MT 278, \u00b6 14, 329 Mont. 210, 124 P.3d 126 (during the 911 call, citizen provided her first name, phone number, home town, description of her vehicle, and a partial license plate of the alleged offender); <em>Gill, </em>\u00b6 18-19 (citizen provided first and last name, home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>address, phone number, and location from which she called). However, a citizen reporter is not required to self-identify or provide specific pieces of personal information in order for the report to be deemed reliable. <em>State v. Brander, </em>2004 MT 150, 321 Mont. 484, 92 P.3d 1173 (citizen reporter elected to stay anonymous and based on the totality of the circumstances the arresting officer had particularized suspicion); <em>State v. Lee, </em>282 Mont. 391, 395, 938 P.2d 637, 640 (1997) (\u201can arresting officer may rely on information conveyed by a reliable third person, including an anonymous citizen informant, in forming the basis for a particularized suspicion to justify an investigative stop\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b614 Here, Rees provided his full name, his current location, and that he was willing to, and did in fact, go to the Beaverhead County Courthouse to sign and complete his report. Due to the technology available to the 911 dispatcher, the phone number that Rees used to make his report was known to dispatch. The report provided to dispatch by Rees was reliable. The District Court\u2019s finding that the first <em>Pratt </em>factor was satisfied was based on substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u00b615 The second <em>Pratt </em>factor is whether the informant\u2019s report is based on personal observation. Pratt, 286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 42. Foster argues Rees\u2019 personal observations in his report lacked objective data and articulable facts that Foster was driving while intoxicated. An officer is allowed to infer that a report is based on a citizen informant\u2019s personal observations if \u201cthe report contains sufficient detail that it is apparent that the informant has not been fabricating the report out of whole cloth and the report is of the sort which in common experience may be recognized as having been obtained in a reliable way.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 21. A citizen informant\u2019s belief that a person is DUI must be based on his or her personal observations. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>Clawson, </em>\u00b6 13). Innocent details, personally observed by the citizen informant, are also relevant in assessing the reliability of the report. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">\u00b616 Here, Rees based his report on his personal observations. Rees personally observed a potential drunk driver because the driver was \u201cdriving all over the road.\u201d Rees was traveling in the same direction as Foster when Rees observed his dangerous driving behavior. He provided dispatch with a detailed description of the vehicle, including the make, model, and color, the sex of the driver, and that the vehicle had a \u201cbig concrete cylinder in the bed of his truck.\u201d Rees reported the vehicle had pulled over to the side of the road as he passed by, allowing him to have a closer observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">\u00b617 Foster argues the information Rees provided lacked sufficient detail to provide a basis for his suspicion that Foster was driving while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>intoxicated. He cites <em>State v. Reiner, </em>2003 MT 243, 317 Mont. 304, 77 P.3d 210, and <em>State v. Lee, </em>282 Mont. 391, 938 P.2d 637 (1997). These cases are distinguishable. In both <em>Reiner </em>and <em>Lee, </em>the citizen informant remained anonymous, thus making their reports less reliable than Rees\u2019 report. <em>Reiner, </em>\u00b6 3; <em>Lee, </em>282 Mont. at 395, 938 P.2d at 640. Further, the citizen informants in <em>Reiner </em>and <em>Lee </em>failed to provide any reason why the caller believed the driver was intoxicated. <em>Reiner, </em>\u00b6 3; <em>Lee, </em>282 Mont. at 395, 938 P.2d at 640. The callers provided only a description of the vehicle, direction of travel, and the hunch that the driver was DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\u00b618 Here, Rees\u2019 own contemporaneous personal observations of Foster\u2019s pickup, load, and driving behavior provided sufficient detail of articulable data and objective facts that justified Trooper Voss\u2019 reliance upon the report provided. The District Court\u2019s finding that the second <em>Pratt </em>factor was satisfied was based on substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u00b619 The third <em>Pratt </em>factor is whether the officer\u2019s own observations corroborated the informant\u2019s information. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 43. An officer corroborates an informant\u2019s report by observing illegal activity or by finding \u201cthe person, the vehicle, and the vehicle\u2019s location substantially as described by the informant.\u201d <em>Gill, </em>\u00b6 30 (citing <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 43). Where the first and second factors have been satisfied, an officer may corroborate the citizen informant\u2019s report by observing wholly innocent behavior. <em>Gill, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"AC1\">\u00b620 Foster argues the District Court erred when it determined Trooper Voss corroborated Rees\u2019 report. Foster asserts Trooper Voss could not have corroborated Rees\u2019 description of the vehicle because his vehicle had a memorable license plate and bumper stickers, which were not described by Rees. Foster asserts the concrete cylinder in the truck bed was not sufficient to distinguish the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\u00b621 This Court has determined an officer corroborates a citizen informant\u2019s report by observing \u201cwholly innocent behavior such as the vehicle\u2019s make, model, and color, and found in the direction of travel reported.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 25. Trooper Voss corroborated Rees\u2019 report within minutes of the 911 report by observing a vehicle matching the make (Dodge), model (Ram), color (dark blue), distinctive load (concrete cylinder), traveling on the same highway (Highway 41), and in the last known direction of travel (southbound).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">\u00b622 Moreover, Trooper Voss personally witnessed Foster\u2019s truck \u201ccross the white line\u201d onto the shoulder of the highway, travel at a relatively low speed, and \u201cweave in the traffic lane.\u201d In contrast to <em>Pratt </em>and <em>Lee, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Trooper Voss\u2019 particularized suspicion that Foster was DUI was not based solely on the report. Independent of Rees\u2019 report, Trooper Voss observed \u201cobjective data and articulable facts\u201d from which he was able to infer and thus suspect Foster was DUI. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 16. The District Court\u2019s finding that the third <em>Pratt </em>factor was satisfied was based on substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b623  The State had particularized suspicion for the stop because Trooper Voss observed Foster in circumstances which led Trooper Voss to believe Foster was DUI. Section 46-5-401(1), MCA; <em>Peters, </em>\u00b6 58; <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 12. Trooper Voss had objective data and articulable facts: Foster\u2019s relatively slow speed, weaving in the traffic lane, and crossing the white line, as well as Rees\u2019 report that Foster was \u201call over the road.\u201d From this data and facts Trooper Voss suspected Foster was currently DUI. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 16. The District Court\u2019s determination that the State had particularized suspicion to stop Foster was based on substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\u00b624 Based on the totality of the circumstances, we conclude Rees\u2019 report contained sufficient indicia of reliability to form the basis for Trooper Voss\u2019 particularized suspicion. Moreover, Trooper Voss independently formed particularized suspicion that Foster was DUI. The District Court\u2019s determination that particularized suspicion existed is not clearly erroneous. The District Court did not err in denying Foster\u2019s motion to suppress all evidence and motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"amn-dedup-0\">\u00b625 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b424-8\">JUSTICES SANDEFUR, BAKER, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
