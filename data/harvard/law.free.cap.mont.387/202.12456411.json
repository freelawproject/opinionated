Longsoldier\u2019s Estate, represented by Summer Strieker, brought this case before the Montana Human Rights Bureau alleging that Hill County and Blaine County discriminated against Longsoldier on the basis of race and disability. The Hearing Officer concluded that the Counties had not discriminated against Longsoldier. The Estate appealed to the Human Rights Commission, which found clear error in the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings and concluded that the Counties had discriminated against Longsoldier.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b62 The Counties petitioned the First Judicial District Court to review the Commission\u2019s final agency decision. Presiding Judge Jeffrey Sherlock reversed and vacated the Commission\u2019s decision and reinstated the Hearing Officer\u2019s order as the final agency decision. On the Estate\u2019s motion to alter or amend, Judge James Reynolds\u2014who had assumed jurisdiction of the case following Judge Sherlock\u2019s retirement\u2014concluded that Judge Sherlock had, as a matter of law, fashioned an improper remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b63 Both parties appeal, raising multiple issues. We find the following issues dispositive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">\n<em>1. Whether Judge Sherlock correctly concluded that the Commission improperly modified the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">\n<em>2. Whether Judge Reynolds correctly concluded that Judge Sherlock erred as a matter of law by reinstating the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision as the final agency decision.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">\u00b64 We affirm Judge Sherlock\u2019s order and reverse Judge Reynolds\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">\u00b65 Longsoldier was an intelligent and talented young man who struggled with alcoholism and depression. He excelled at basketball and was trying to get into college at the time of his death. His alcohol abuse resulted in a number of juvenile court proceedings, which led to supervision by a deputy juvenile probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">\u00b66 In the fall of 2009, Longsoldier\u2019s probation officer tried to contact him in order to close his file. The probation officer was unable to get in touch with Longsoldier and eventually requested a \u201cpick up and hold.\u201d A Blaine County sheriffs deputy arrested Longsoldier early on the morning of November 19,2009. The deputy transported Longsoldier to the Hill County Detention Center, where Blaine County\u2019s adult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>prisoners are held pursuant to an agreement between the Counties.</p>\n<p id=\"Agq\">\u00b67 Longsoldier had been drinking heavily for several days prior to his arrest. He had not, however, been drinking immediately before his arrest and showed no signs of intoxication when he was brought to the detention center. Longsoldier did not receive a medical screening when booked into the detention center, contrary to the detention center\u2019s admissions policy. The detention center\u2019s daily logbook indicates that Longsoldier appeared to have no issues\u2014aside from not sleeping\u2014for the first twenty-four hours of his incarceration. At 3:28 a.m. on November 20, 2009, however, the logbook indicates that Longsoldier complained that he could not hold down water and that he asked to go to the hospital. Shortly after that, a fellow inmate observed Longsoldier exhibit behavior that suggested he was hallucinating. Longsoldier\u2019s condition continued to deteriorate. Various entries in the log book demonstrate that detention center officers recognized that Longsoldier was experiencing symptoms associated with \u201cdetoxing\u201d or alcohol withdrawal. Witnesses testified that such symptoms are common among inmates who enter the detention center intoxicated and remain while their bodies process alcohol from their systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b68 During the late afternoon of November 21, 2009, Longsoldier began pounding on the door of his cell and acting increasingly violent. By this point he had not slept for nearly three days. At around 7:00 that evening, Longsoldier was taken to Northern Montana Hospital by a Blaine County sheriff s deputy. A doctor examined him and gave him several medications. The doctor did not diagnose Longsoldier with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Longsoldier\u2019s condition improved to the point that he could hold down water. The doctor ordered that Longsoldier be discharged with six Ativan tablets, prescribed for anxiety. The Hospital discharged Longsoldier with prescriptions for Cymbalta and Ativan, but did not provide the six Ativan tablets the doctor had ordered. The prescriptions were never filled. The daily log indicates that Longsoldier was back at the detention center around 9:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u00b69 Longsoldier\u2019s condition worsened shortly after he returned to the detention center. The log book reveals that over the course of the next several hours officers observed Longsoldier hallucinating, talking to himself, gagging, dry heaving, sweating, and pleading for help. By around 2:30 a.m. on November 22, 2009, Longsoldier\u2019s condition had deteriorated so substantially that a detention center officer called Blaine County authorities and informed them that they may need to take Longsoldier back to the Hospital. The Blaine County dispatcher then called the Hospital and spoke with a nurse. The nurse told the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>dispatcher that Longsoldier just needed to drink fluids and that he was \u201cplaying them.\u201d The nurse advised the dispatcher that Longsoldier was not physically ill and \u201cjust doesn\u2019t like being there.\u201d The Blaine County dispatcher relayed this information to the officer at the detention center, and told the officer that the Hospital said \u201cthere\u2019s nothing they could do for him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b610 The log book entries for the next several hours indicate that Longsoldier continued to suffer from hallucinations, talk to himself, not eat, and not drink any water. An entry at 10:44 p.m. indicates that Longsoldier was shivering and non-responsive. Shortly thereafter, a detention center officer called an ambulance. The ambulance picked up Longsoldier just before midnight on November 22. Longsoldier died at the Hospital from delirium tremens at approximately 2:00 a.m. on November 23, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b611 In May 2010, the Estate filed a claim against the Counties and the Hospital with the Human Rights Bureau. The complaint alleged that the Counties and the Hospital discriminated against Longsoldier because of his race\u2014Native American\u2014and because of his disability\u2014alcoholism. The Hospital settled with the Estate shortly before the contested case hearing. The Hearing Officer heard the claims against the Counties during a four-day hearing in September 2011. In April 2012, the Hearing Officer issued a thorough thirty-page decision. The Hearing Officer found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">There is no evidence that [the Counties\u2019] action or inactions, or the lack of either better information about alcohol withdrawal or any training or information about delirium tremens before November 2009, were the result of any discriminatory animus on the part of [the Counties] ... toward either alcoholics or Native Americans.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvB\">The Hearing Officer concluded that the Counties did not illegally discriminate against Longsoldier due to his race or disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u00b612 Longsoldier\u2019s Estate appealed the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision to the Commission. The Commission held a hearing in July 2012 but the hearing was not recorded due to technical difficulties. At a second hearing in September 2012, the Commission considered its draft order to remand the case to the Hearing Officer. The Commission approved the remand order. It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">[T]he hearing officer misapprehended the effect of the evidence regarding the failure of law enforcement personnel of Hill and Blaine Counties to have the prescriptions issued to Longsoldier by the [Northern Montana Hospital] treating physician on Saturday, November 21, 2009, filled and the failure of Detention Center personnel to administer those medications, as directed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>doctor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The Commission found that the Counties\u2019 failure to fill the prescriptions \u201cmanifest! ed I a discriminatory indifference to Longsoldier\u2019s medical needs based on his disability.\u201d On that basis, the Commission determined that two of the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings of fact were \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d and modified those findings. Neither the Hearing Officer nor the Commission found racial discrimination, and the Estate does not contest that ruling. The Commission remanded to the Hearing Officer to determine the appropriate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b613 Upon remand, the Hearing Officer found the Counties liable to the Estate for $300,000 for the emotional distress Longsoldier suffered. All parties appealed the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision and the Commission conducted another hearing in July 2013. The Commission increased the award to $1,350,000 in its final agency decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u00b614 The Counties filed a petition for judicial review with the District Court. Because the Counties\u2019 petition alleged a variety of procedural errors, Judge Sherlock allowed the parties to engage in discovery regarding the alleged errors. In his order, Judge Sherlock concluded that numerous procedural defects, including several that the Commission acknowledged, required reversal of the final agency decision. Of particular concern, Judge Sherlock determined that the Commission applied an incorrect standard of review to the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision. Based on his conclusion that the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence, and given the nature of the procedural errors, Judge Sherlock concluded that the appropriate remedy was to reinstate the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision as the final agency decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\u00b615 The Estate filed a M. R. Civ. P. 59 motion to alter or amend Judge Sherlock\u2019s order. While that motion was pending, the Estate filed a notice of appeal with this Court. Judge Reynolds then assumed jurisdiction of the case following Judge Sherlock\u2019s retirement. Judge Reynolds concluded that Judge Sherlock correctly determined that the procedural errors justified reversing the Commission\u2019s order. Judge Reynolds concluded, however, that Judge Sherlock committed \u201ca manifest error of law\u201d by reinstating the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision as the final agency decision. Judge Reynolds thus granted the Estate\u2019s motion to alter or amend and remanded to the Commission for further proceedings. The Estate appeals Judge Sherlock\u2019s order and the Counties cross-appeal Judge Reynolds\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">\u00b616 The Montana Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA) governs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>actions brought before the Human Rights Commission. <em>Schmidt v. Cook, </em>2005 MT 53, \u00b6 20, 326 Mont. 202, 108 P.3d 511. The standard of judicial review of an agency decision under MAPA provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">(2) The court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">(a) the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">(i) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">(ii) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">(iii) made upon unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">(iv) affected by other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">(v) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">(vi) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">Section 2-4-704(2), MCA; <em>Schmidt, </em>\u00b6 20. This standard of review applies to both the District Court\u2019s review of the agency\u2019s decision and this Court\u2019s subsequent review of the District Court\u2019s decision. <em>In re Transfer of Ownership &amp; Location of Mont. All-Alcoholic Bevs. License No. 02-401-1287-001, </em>2007 MT 192, \u00b6 6, 338 Mont. 363, 168 P.3d 68.</p>\n<p id=\"ao-dedup-0\">\u00b617 We generally review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to alter or amend for an abuse of discretion. <em>Arnone v. City of Bozeman, </em>2016 MT 184, \u00b6 4, 384 Mont. 250, 376 P.3d 786. Nevertheless, deference is not applied to a district court\u2019s conclusions of law, which are reviewed de novo to determine whether its interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Krutzfeldt Ranch, LLC v. Pinnacle Bank, </em>2012 MT 15, \u00b6 13, 363 Mont. 366, 272 P.3d 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">\u00b618 <em>1. Whether Judge Sherlock correctly concluded that the Commission improperly modified the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-16\">\u00b619 Relying on <em>Schmidt </em>and \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA, Judge Sherlock noted that, when reviewing hearing officer decisions, the Commission applies a standard of review different from the standard a reviewing court applies to the Commission\u2019s decisions. He observed that the Commission\u2019s remand order cited to a case that set forth an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>inapplicable standard of review. This Court, Judge Sherlock declared, has determined \u201cthat a final agency order cannot modify a hearing officer\u2019s findings unless it reviews the complete record and states with particularity in the order that the findings were not based on competent substantial evidence.\u201d (Citing <em>State Personnel Div. v. Child Support Investigators, </em>2002 MT 46, \u00b6 25, 308 Mont. 365, 43 P.3d 305.) Judge Sherlock then determined that the Commission never made a finding that the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings it modified were not based on substantial competent evidence. Thus, Judge Sherlock concluded that the Commission applied an incorrect standard of review to the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision. Upon examination of the full record, Judge Sherlock concluded that there was substantial credible evidence supporting the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings that the Counties did not discriminate against Longsoldier.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b620 Judge Sherlock proceeded to discuss a number of other procedural defects that contributed to his conclusion that the Commission\u2019s final agency decision must be reversed. First, he noted that due to technical problems the Commission kept no record of the first hearing. Although the Commission did hold another hearing to address the lack of a record, Judge Sherlock opined that the Commissioners did not discuss \u201cthe evidentiary defects that led them to alter the hearing officer\u2019s order or what evidence supported their modification of that order.\u201d Judge Sherlock next discussed a number of ex parte communications that occurred between the Commission and the Commission\u2019s attorney. He noted that the administrative rules required the attorney to limit her consultation with the Commission to points of law, but that the attorney had commented on and inaccurately described certain factual matters in the record to a new Commissioner. The attorney also advised the Commissioner that the Commissioner did not need to review the entire record. Finally, Judge Sherlock addressed the fact that the damage award at which the Commission ultimately arrived was not discussed at any public meeting; rather, it was discussed between the attorney and one or more members of the Commission after the public meeting adjourned.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b621 Judge Sherlock concluded that \u201cthe cumulative weight of this series of procedural problems, from using the wrong standard of review in reviewing the hearing officer\u2019s decision, to all of the other procedural defects noted above, have the cumulative effect of requiring a reversal of the activities of the [Commission] in this case.\u201d In reversing and vacating the Commission\u2019s final agency decision, Judge Sherlock determined that the Commission\u2019s decision was \u201cclearly erroneous in the view of the evidence in the whole record\u201d and that it was \u201carbitrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>and capricious in its rejection of the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact.\u201d After reviewing the record evidence and considering all of the procedural defects and the Commission\u2019s discussions of the case, Judge Sherlock determined that the appropriate resolution of the judicial review was to reinstate the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision as the final agency decision. Relying on <em>Brackman v. Board of Nursing, </em>258 Mont. 200, 851 P.2d 1055 (1993), Judge Sherlock concluded that such a remedy would \u201cset this case back to the place where it existed in the administrative process before any serious procedural errors had been made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b622 On appeal, the Estate argues that the Hearing Officer\u2019s determination that there was no evidence of any discriminatory animus on the part of the Counties was a conclusion of law, not a finding of fact. The Estate therefore contends that the Commission did not apply the wrong standard of review in modifying those determinations because legal conclusions are reviewed for correctness. The Estate next contends that even if the Hearing Officer\u2019s determinations could be considered findings of fact, the Hearing Officer failed to address non-animus-based discrimination. Because the Hearing Officer failed to make such findings, the Estate alleges that under <em>Christie v. Department of Environmental Quality, </em>2009 MT 364, 353 Mont. 227, 220 P.3d 405, the Commission was entitled to make its own findings. Finally, the Estate contends that the Commission properly analyzed whether the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous; therefore, the Commission applied the correct standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u00b623 We first address the Estate\u2019s contention that the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings of fact numbers 114 and 115 were conclusions of law. Although there is no \u201crule or principle that will unerringly distinguish a factual finding from a legal conclusion,\u201d determining whether there is evidence of intent to discriminate is a \u201cpure question of fact.\u201d <em>Pullman-Standard, Div. of Pullman v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 288, 102 S. Ct. 1781, 1789 (1982) (citation and internal quotes omitted). The Hearing Officer properly characterized these as findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u00b624 Next, <em>Christie </em>does not support the Estate\u2019s position. In <em>Christie, </em>the hearing officer did not make findings that addressed the central issue of the case. <em>Christie, </em>\u00b6 28. Here, in contrast, the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings on discrimination were findings on the issue at the heart of the Estate\u2019s human rights claim. Thus, our holding in <em>Christie </em>that the agency could make a finding of fact regarding the central issue where its hearing officer failed to do so is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>\u00b625  Under MAPA, an agency may reject a hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact only if, upon review of the complete record, \u201cthe agency first determines that the findings \u2018were not based upon competent substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moran v. Shotgun Willies, </em>270 Mont. 47, 51, 889 P.2d 1185, 1187 (1995) (quoting \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA); <em>accord State Pers. Div., </em>\u00b6 25 (relying on \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA, to conclude that \u201c[a]n agency in its final order may not reject or modify the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact unless it first determines from a review of the complete record and states with particularity in the order that the findings of fact were not based upon competent substantial evidence\u201d); <em>Ulrich v. State ex rel. Board of Funeral Serv., </em>1998 MT 196, \u00b6 14, 289 Mont. 407, 961 P.2d 126 (concluding that an agency \u201cmay reject the examiner\u2019s findings only if they are not based upon competent, substantial evidence\u201d and abuses its discretion pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-704(2)(a)(vi), MCA, if it \u201creject[s] the hearing examiner\u2019s findings in violation of \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consequently, an agency\u2019s rejection or modification of a hearing officer\u2019s findings \u201ccannot survive judicial review unless the court determines as a matter of law that the hearing examiner\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Schmidt, </em>\u00b6 31 <em>(citing Moran, </em>270 Mont. at 51, 889 P.2d at 1187). An agency abuses its discretion if it modifies the findings of a hearing officer without first determining that the findings were not supported by substantial evidence. <em>State Pers. Div., </em>\u00b6 26; <em>Ulrich, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Moran, </em>270 Mont. at 50, 889 P.2d at 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b626 A reviewing body\u2019s standard on review \u201cis not whether there is evidence to support findings different from those made by the trier of fact, but whether substantial credible evidence supports the trier\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Schmidt, </em>\u00b6 31. \u201cSubstantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. It consists of more [than] a mere scintilla of evidence but may be less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>State Pers. Div., </em>\u00b6 19. The evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party when determining whether findings are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Welu </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number><em>v.

Rather, the Commission concluded that the Hearing Officer \u201cmisapprehended the effect of the evidence\u201d relating to discrimination based on disability and determined on that basis that the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings were \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d The Commission did not have the authority to modify the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings on that ground. Section 2-4-621(3), MCA; <em>Schmidt, </em>\u00b6 31; <em>State Pers. Div., </em>\u00b6 25; <em>Ulrich, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Moran, </em>270 Mont. at 51, 889 P.2d at 1187. As a matter of law, the Commission applied the wrong standard of review; it therefore abused its discretion. <em>State Pers. Div., </em>\u00b6 26; <em>Ulrich, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Moran, </em>270 Mont. at 50, 889 P.2d at 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b628 Based on his review of the record, Judge Sherlock determined that it contained substantial evidence to support the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings of fact. We agree. The evidence demonstrates that the Hospital\u2019s discharge instructions advised that Longsoldier should follow up with a medical provider in three to five days; the Hospital did not instruct the Counties on what to do if his condition worsened. Detention center staff appreciated that Longsoldier was experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, but expected\u2014consistent with their experience\u2014that the symptoms would subside. And when they inquired further, they were told that Longsoldier was not ill and just didn\u2019t want to be in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u00b629 The Commission emphasized the evidence that Longsoldier\u2019s prescriptions were not filled and that authorities from both Counties were aware of the fact that he was not given the medication prescribed. But this is a discrimination claim under the Human Rights Act, not a claim for negligence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the Human Rights Act, it is a prohibited \u201cdiscriminatory practice for the state or any of its political subdivisions ... to refuse, withhold from, or deny to a person any ... services ... <em>because of... </em>physical or mental disability.\u201d Section 49-2-308(1), MCA (emphasis added). The Estate\u2019s discrimination claim therefore required it to demonstrate that the Counties failed to fill Longsoldier\u2019s prescriptions because he suffered from alcoholism. <em>Albert v. City of Billings, </em>2012 MT 159, \u00b6 27, 365 Mont. 454, 282 P.3d 704 (quoting Admin. R. M. 24.9.610(2)(a)(iii) and concluding that in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>establish a discrimination claim, a claimant is required to demonstrate that \u201che was \u2018treated differently because of membership in [the] protected class\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commission did not point to any such evidence, nor does the Estate. In fact, the Commission did not modify the Hearing Officer\u2019s finding that the \u201csubstantial and credible evidence of record established that none of [the Counties\u2019 personnel] considered [Longsoldier\u2019s symptoms] to be a disabling or even life-threatening condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b630 The Hearing Officer concluded that Longsoldier suffered from a disability\u2014alcoholism\u2014and that he was denied a government service\u2014medical care. The Hearing Officer concluded also that Longsoldier suffered terribly in the Counties\u2019 custody. Based on the evidence before the Hearing Officer, however, a reasonable mind could accept that the Counties\u2019 failures to provide Longsoldier with further medical treatment were not based on any discriminatory animus toward Longsoldier. That is the inquiry dictated by MAPA\u2019s standard of review. Section 2-4-621(3), MCA; <em>State Pers. Div., </em>\u00b6 25; <em>Ulrich, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Moran, </em>270 Mont. at 51, 889 P.2d at 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b631  We conclude that the Commission lacked authority to modify the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings of fact because those findings were supported by competent substantial evidence. Accordingly, we hold that Judge Sherlock correctly concluded that the Commission improperly modified the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u00b632 <em>2. Whether Judge Reynolds correctly concluded that Judge Sherlock erred as a matter of law by reinstating the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision as the final agency decision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\u00b633 Judge Reynolds concluded that Judge Sherlock \u201cwas correct in determining that procedural errors in this matter warranted a reversal of the [Commission\u2019s] order.\u201d Judge Reynolds noted that Judge Sherlock used a procedure this Court previously has approved when he reinstated the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision as the final agency decision. (Citing <em>Benjamin v. Anderson, </em>2005 MT 123, 327 Mont. 173, 112 P.3d 1039; <em>Moran; Brackman.) </em>Judge Reynolds nevertheless determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>that \u201cthe remedy fashioned by [Judge Sherlock] of adopting the hearing officer\u2019s decision ... as the final agency decision improperly deprives [the Estate] of meaningful review of that decision as required by the Human Rights Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b634 Judge Reynolds opined that the Act \u201ccontemplates a multi-step administrative process for reviewing claims of alleged discrimination.\u201d He concluded that Judge Sherlock\u2019s remedy \u201cshort-circuits this review process\u201d because it deprived the Estate of review by the Commission. Judge Reynolds held, \u201cSuch a remedy is a manifest error of law, and altering this remedy is necessary to prevent manifest injustice.\u201d Judge Reynolds granted the Estate\u2019s motion to alter or amend, in part, and remanded the case to the Commission to conduct a new review of the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b635 The Estate asserts that Judge Reynolds correctly granted its motion to alter or amend. The Estate argues that \u00a7 49-2-505(5), MCA, requires that the Commission, not a hearing officer, render a final agency decision. The Estate cites <em>Frasceli, Inc. v. State Department of Revenue, </em>235 Mont. 152, 766 P.2d 850 (1988), to support its position. The Estate claims further that <em>Benjamin, Moran, and Brackman </em>\u201care inapposite\u201d for various reasons. Remanding the case to the Commission, the Estate contends, \u201csimply sets the case back on the statutory track\u201d required under the Human Rights Act and MAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"AVN\">\u00b636 As Judge Reynolds recognized, we have previously affirmed district court holdings that adopted a hearing officer\u2019s determination as the final agency decision. <em>Brackman, </em>258 Mont. at 209, 851 P.2d at 1060 (concluding that a district court did not err in ordering an agency to adopt the hearing officer\u2019s order in its entirety because the agency abused its discretion by rejecting the hearing officer\u2019s findings without finding that they were not supported by substantial evidence); Moran, 270 Mont. at 53, 889 P.2d at 1188 (concluding that a district court did not err in ordering that the Commission adopt the hearing officer\u2019s findings and conclusions because the Commission\u2019s \u201clegal conclusions concerning the sufficiency of the evidence to support the hearing examiner\u2019s findings were incorrect\u201d); <em>Benjamin, </em>\u00b6 70 (affirming a district court\u2019s decision to re-impose the hearing examiner\u2019s award of damages because the Commission\u2019s reduction of the damages award was arbitrary). The Estate\u2019s attempt to distinguish these cases is unpersuasive. Similar to <em>Brackman </em>and <em>Moran, </em>here the Commission did not find that the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings were not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b637 The Estate\u2019s reliance on <em>Frasceli </em>also is unpersuasive. We did conclude in <em>Frasceli </em>that a district court abused its discretion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>ordering the reinstatement of a hearing officer\u2019s proposed order. <em>Frasceli, </em>235 Mont. at 157, 766 P.2d at 853. But the case is distinguishable. The hearing officer in <em>Frasceli </em>issued a proposed order awarding a beer and wine license to a business. <em>Frasceli, </em>235 Mont. at 153, 766 P.2d at 851. Prior to issuing a final agency decision that reversed the hearing officer\u2019s order and awarded the license to a different business, the Director of the Department of Revenue made personal, unannounced visits to both businesses to inspect them. <em>Frasceli, </em>235 Mont. at 154, 766 P.2d at 850-51. We affirmed the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Director\u2019s unannounced visits violated the business\u2019s due process rights because there was no way to know to what extent the Director\u2019s inspection impacted his final decision. <em>Frasceli, </em>235 Mont. at 157, 766 P.2d at 852. We concluded that the Director\u2019s actions \u201cviolateldl certain other safeguards built in\u201d by MAPA. <em>Frasceli, </em>235 Mont. at 157, 766 P.2d at 852-53. It was within this context that we concluded that the agency should \u201chave an objective and detached officer review the record\u201d rather than just reinstate the hearing officer\u2019s proposed order. <em>Frasceli, </em>235 Mont. at 157, 766 P.2d at 853. <em>Brackman, Moran, </em>and <em>Benjamin </em>provide more apt authority here because all involved the agency\u2019s misapplication of the legal standards governing its review.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b638 We are unconvinced by the Estate\u2019s additional argument that \u00a7 49-2-505(5), MCA, precludes adopting the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision as the final agency decision. The Estate is correct that \u00a7 49-2-505, MCA, outlines the procedure a discrimination claim must follow from the contested case hearing to judicial review. In that context, \u00a7 40-2-505(5), MCA, provides that if a party appeals the decision of a hearing officer, the Commission must hear the case within 120 days of the appeal. Section 49-2-505(5), MCA, provides further: \u201cThe commission may affirm, reject, or modify the decision in whole or in part. The commission shall render a final agency decision within 90 days of hearing the appeal.\u201d Section 49-2-505(5), MCA, thus prescribes certain timelines the Commission must follow once it receives an appeal of ahearing officer\u2019s decision and outlines what the Commission may do with the decision after hearing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b639 When we construe a statute, we do so by \u201creading and interpreting the statute as a whole, without isolating specific terms from the context in which they were used by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Mashek v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>2016 MT 86, \u00b6 10, 383 Mont. 168, 369 P.3d 348 (citation and internal quotations omitted). The Estate interprets one phrase within one sentence out of three in \u00a7 49-2-505(5), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>MCA, to mean that only the Commission can render a final agency decision. Such an interpretation isolates the specific terms\u2014that the \u201ccommission shall render a final agency decision\u201d\u2014from the context in which they were used by the Legislature\u2014the general procedure for appeal of the hearing officer\u2019s decision in a discrimination claim. The Estate\u2019s interpretation ignores that a hearing officer\u2019s decision can become final under certain circumstances, such as when no appeal is taken pursuant to \u00a7 49-2-505(3)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b640 Of course, MAPA also confers ultimate authority on the District Court. As discussed, the Act explicitly provides that the agency \u201cmay not reject or modify the [Hearing Officer\u2019s] findings of fact unless the agency first determines ... that the findings of fact were not based upon competent substantial evidence.\u201d Section 2-4-621(3), MCA; <em>accord Schmidt, </em>\u00b6 31; <em>State Pers. Div., </em>\u00b6 25; Moran, 270 Mont. at 51, 889 P.2d at 1187. Judge Reynolds remanded the case because the Estate was deprived of \u201cmeaningful review.\u201d But that meaningful review already occurred. Based on his review of the complete evidentiary record, Judge Sherlock concluded that the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence. Judge Reynolds\u2019s order did not alter or amend Judge Sherlock\u2019s conclusion. We have affirmed Judge Sherlock\u2019s conclusion. Opinion, \u00b6 31. Accordingly, if the case were to be remanded to the Commission, the Commission could not determine that the findings of fact were not based upon substantial evidence; the Commission thus could not modify the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings that there was no evidence of discriminatory animus by the Counties. <em>See Fiscus v. Beartooth Elec. Coop., </em>180 Mont. 434, 437, 591 P.2d 196, 197 (1979) (concluding that when we state in an opinion \u201ca principle or rule of law necessary to the decision, such pronouncement becomes the law of the case, and must be adhered to throughout its subsequent progress\u201d) (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b641  Because the District Court conducted a complete review of the administrative record and properly applied the applicable standard of review to the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision, there is nothingfurther for the Commission to review. We hold that Judge Reynolds incorrectly concluded that Judge Sherlock erred as a matter of law by adopting the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision as the final agency decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\u00b642  We affirm Judge Sherlock\u2019s order reinstating the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision as the final agency decision. We reverse Judge Reynolds\u2019s order granting the Estate\u2019s motion to alter or amend Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Sherlock\u2019s order. Finally, we acknowledge the heartbreaking truth that Allen Longsoldier, Jr.\u2014a gifted young man\u2014suffered horrendously while dying slowly from alcohol withdrawal syndrome. On this record, however, the Montana Human Rights Act is not a proper legal remedy for his suffering.</p>\n<judges id=\"b241-5\">CHIEF JUSTICES McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-6\"> <em>Core-Mark International, Inc. v.
