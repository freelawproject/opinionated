They appeal from the District Court\u2019s September 19,2016 order granting Renneth\u2019s motion for summary judgment and concluding that they lacked standing to maintain the petition. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows: Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Renneth and dismissing the petition for lack of standing?</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACRGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">\u00b63 The parties to this case are all related. Petitioners Daren and Revin Engellant are the sons of Respondent Renneth Engellant, and they are the nephews of Gregory Engellant. Gregory was permanently disabled in an accident in 1982. His brother Renneth has served as his appointed conservator since 1985. Gregory executed a will in 1978 prior to his accident, and in 2012 he executed a second will. Daren and Revin are devisees under both wills.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">\u00b64 Daren and Revin object to the way their father Renneth has handled their Uncle Gregory\u2019s affairs as conservator. They complained to Montana Adult Protective Services (APS) that Renneth was improperly administering the conservatorship estate. APS filed an action seeking to remove Renneth as conservator, but the action was subsequently dismissed by stipulation. Daren and Revin filed the present action in November 2014 in the conservatorship proceeding, seeking to remove their father Renneth as conservator for their Uncle Gregory.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">\u00b65 In September 2015 Renneth filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that Daren and Revin lacked standing to maintain a proceeding to remove him as conservator. In September 2016 the District Court granted Renneth\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that Daren and Revin lacked standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">\u00b66 Daren and Revin appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b67 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on summary judgment de novo to determine whether it is correct, using the same criteria as the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Pilgeram v. GreenPoint Mortgage, </em>2013 MT 354, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 1, 313 P.3d 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\u00b68 <em>Issue: Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Kenneth and dismissing the petition for lack of standing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\u00b69 The District Court determined that Daren and Kevin\u2019s petition was governed by \u00a7 72-5-413, MCA, which allows a \u201cperson interested in the welfare\u201d of a conserved person to petition for an order removing the conservator. The District Court determined that the definition of \u201cperson interested in the welfare of a protected person\u201d in \u00a7 72-5-413(4), MCA, governed whether Daren and Kevin had standing to pursue the petition. That section provides that \u201c[flor purposes of this section\u201d a \u201cperson interested in the welfare of a protected person\u201d is \u201cany person, institution, or agency that is furnishing or supplying any money for support or care of a person for whom a conservator has been appointed.\u201d The District Court determined that the brothers did not qualify under this definition, and that they could not rely upon the definition of \u201cinterested person\u201d in \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA, because they were only devisees under Uncle Gregory\u2019s will and therefore had only an expectancy interest that was insufficient to grant them standing.</p>\n<p id=\"AhD\">\u00b610 Sections 72-1-103(25) and 72-5-413, MCA, appear in the Uniform Probate Code (UPC), \u00a7 72-1-101, MCA, etseq., which uses some variant of the term \u201cinterested person\u201d in a number of contexts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 72-1-103, MCA, provides \u201cgeneral definitions\u201d for the UPC, while providing that there can be <em>\u201cadditional </em>definitions contained in the subsequent chapters\u201d of the Code (Emphasis added). The definition in \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">\u201cInterested person\u201d includes heirs, devisees, children, spouses, creditors, beneficiaries, and any others having a property right in or claim against a trust estate or the estate of a decedent, ward, or protected person. The term also includes persons having priority for appointment as personal representative and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>fiduciaries representing interested persons. The meaning as it relates to particular persons may vary from time to time and must be determined according to the particular purposes of and matter involved in any proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Subsection (12) of that same statute defines \u201cDevisee\u201d as \u201ca person designated in a will to receive a devise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b611 When interpreting a statute, this Court will \u201cseek to implement the objectives the legislature sought to achieve, and if the legislative intent can be determined from the plain language of the statute, the plain language controls.\u201d <em>In re Conservatorship of Kloss, </em>2005 MT 39, \u00b6 10, 326 Mont. 117, 109 P.3d 205. A statute must be construed according to its plain meaning and if the language is clear and unambiguous then no further interpretation is required. In addition, the Court must construe a statute as a whole in order to avoid absurd results and to give effect to the purpose of the statute. <em>Infinity Ins. Co. v. Dodson, </em>2000 MT 287, \u00b6 46, 302 Mont. 209, 14 P.3d 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b612  Applying these principles here, it is clear that the term interested person defined in \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA, includes Daren and Kevin. They are \u201cinterested persons\u201d under UPC proceedings because they are devisees under Uncle Gregory\u2019s will. We disagree with the District Court\u2019s determination that the phrase \u201cany others having a property right\u201d in \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA, excludes them from the class of \u201cinterested persons.\u201d They are devisees, and whether devisees have a present or future right, they are specifically included as \u201cinterested persons\u201d under \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\u00b613 We disagree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 72-5-413(4), MCA, defines the exclusive class of persons entitled to bring a petition for an order subsequent to appointment. First, the plain language does not say that only those described in subsection (4) may bring a petition. Rather, the plain intent of the subsection is to expand the class of petitioners beyond those included in \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA, to include persons or entities (including agencies) that furnish support for a person under a conservatorship. Second, the general definition in \u00a7 72-1-103, MCA, recognizes that <em>additional </em>definitions of terms may appear elsewhere in the UPC. The definition in \u00a7 72-5-413(4), MCA, is such an \u201cadditional definition\u201d and nothing indicates that it is exclusive or that it supplants the definition in \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA. Finally, \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA, specifically provides that the meaning of interested person \u201cmay vary from time to time and must be determined according to the particular purposes of and matter involved in any proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">\u00b614 In summary, the language in the two statutes at issue, \u00a7\u00a7 72-1-103 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>and 72-5-413, MCA, evidences an intent, as applicable to the facts of this case, to provide a more expansive rather than a more restrictive definition of who may bring a petition under \u00a7 72-5-413, MCA. <em>In re the Conservatorship of Kloss, </em>\u00b6 10. The language of the two statutes does not conflict so that one is the specific and one the general. Clearly the two statutes may be construed and applied harmoniously. <em>In re Estate </em>of Easterbrook, 2003 MT 317, \u00b6 7, 318 Mont. 275, 80 P.3d 419 (applying the two statutes together to determine who is an \u201cinterested person\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AQu\">\u00b615 To the extent that <em>In re the Estate of Miles v. Miles, </em>2000 MT 41, 298 Mont. 312, 994 P.2d 1139 (involving the interest of statutory heirs in an annuity contract that terminated on the annuitant\u2019s death) and <em>In re the Guardianship and Conservatorship of Anderson, </em>2009 MT 344, 353 Mont. 139, 218 P.3d 1220 (involving a payment-on-death beneficiary of an investment account) hold that each class of persons listed in \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA, must possess a present property right in the estate to be an \u201cinterested person,\u201d those cases are factually distinguished. Neither of those cases involved devisees. \u201cDevisees\u201d are \u201cinterested persons\u201d under \u00a7 72-1-103(12) and (25), MCA, and \u00a7 72-5-413, MCA, without possessing any other right or claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b616 This case presents a question of law based upon Montana statutes. While the briefs contain extensive argument about intra-family disagreements regarding the conservatorship, the District Court did not make any findings of fact on those issues, and the parties do not contend that there are disputed issues of material fact that preclude summary judgment. This Opinion is limited to the issue of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"A6b\">\u00b617 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b341-7\">JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON, SANDEFUR and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-10\"> <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 72-3-105, MCA (an interested person may apply to the clerk for a determination in an informal proceeding); \u00a7 72-3-402, MCA (an interested person may petition for supervised administration); \u00a7 72-3-634, MCA (an interested person may move for a settlement of fees).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
