We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\"><em>Issue one: Did the District Court err in determining that the City may properly rely on Title </em>7, <em>chapter 2, part 45, MCA, to annex the Houston Lakeshore Area </em>?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-14\"><em>Issue two: Did the District Court err in finding that the Houston Lakeshore Area is \u201cwholly surrounded\u201d by the City </em>?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-16\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b108-17\">\u00b63 The Property Owners collectively own numerous properties on or near Whitefish Lake in Whitefish, Montana (Houston Lakeshore Area). The Houston Lakeshore Area is located north of the City and consists of the Houston Lake Shore Tracts subdivision, the Stocking Addition Tracts B and C, and five parcels known as Tract 1AB, Tract 1ABA, Tract 1ABB, Tract 1ABC, and Tract 1G. The City has annexed ten tracts in the Houston Lake Shore Tracts and three tracts in the Stocking Addition Tracts C. The area is bounded by Whitefish Lake to the west and south and by City territory to the north and east. The Property Owners access the area via East Lakeshore Drive, which borders the Houston Lakeshore Area to the east. To access their individual properties, the Property Owners turn off East Lakeshore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Drive and onto Houston Drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b64 In 1981, the City passed Resolution No. B-916, annexing a section of East Lakeshore Drive between Reservoir Road and the North boundary of Lot 1, Block 1 of the Houston Point Subdivision. The City annexed this section of the road without receiving a request for annexation from the state of Montana. In 2005, upon petition by the State, the City passed Resolution No. 05-25, annexing Whitefish Lake to its low water mark. The resolution cited a 1987 Attorney General Opinion, which ruled that the bounding of Whitefish Lake on one or more sides of a tract or parcel does not preclude the area from being annexed under the \u201cwholly surrounded\u201d method of annexation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00b65 Piecing together a survey of the area provided in the record and the interactive parcel map maintained by the

to the first priority area for annexation. The City has not given or published a notice of annexation, nor has it passed a resolution of annexation for the area. On May 22, 2015, the Property Owners filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that, under that Title 7, chapter 2, part 45, MCA: 1) the City has no statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>authority to combine separate tracts for purposes of annexation; and 2) the Houston Lakeshore Area is not wholly surrounded for the purposes of annexation. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment and, on March 14,2016, the District Court granted the City\u2019s motion. The Property Owners filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria of M.

We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct and its findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Pilgeram, </em>\u00b6 9. Under Rule 56(c), summary judgment will be granted if the moving party can show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. <em>Roe v.

The court determined that the statutory provisions allowing for annexation of wholly surrounded areas are triggered, not by the number of parcels a city seeks to annex, but instead by the geographic characteristics the freehold territory exhibits in relation to the city seeking to annex it.

Montana within the past few years has become a state wherein more people live within incorporated cities and towns than reside in the country. The City of Missoula is one of the fastest growing cities in the state and one of its problems is the suburban areas. Most of the people who live in such areas earn their livelihood in the city. A large percentage of these people market and shop in the city, use the streets and facilities furnished by its public utilities and no one can question that the city is the hub of the commercial, civic and social life of these people. The very reason the legislature passed [SJection 11-403, R.C.M. 1947, was to care for this situation. To hold otherwise would be to handcuff the orderly development of the city.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApB\"><em>Harrison, </em>146 Mont. at 426-27, 407 P.2d at 707. In <em>Brodie v. Missoula, </em>155 Mont. 185, 468 P.2d 778 (1970), we reiterated that the purpose of these annexation procedures is to \u201cpermit the orderly and uniform extension of city boundaries and city services with urban growth.\u201d <em>Brodie, </em>155 Mont. at 192, 468 P.2d at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\u00b615 The Property Owners argue that this Court should read \u00a7 7-2-4501, MCA, in isolation from \u00a7\u00a7 7-2-4502 and -4504, MCA, and instead rely on a secondary source<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and a different title of the Code, namely Title 76, to define \u201ctract or parcel.\u201d We decline to do so. While we recognize that we often turn to such sources to interpret words left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>undefined in a statute, we conclude that doing so in this case would lead to an interpretation plainly contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-107, MCA (\u201cWhenever the meaning of a word or phrase is defined in any part of this code, such definition is applicable to the same word or phrase wherever it occurs, <em>except where a contrary intention plainly appears.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added)). In this case, when we read \u00a7 7-2-4501, MCA, alongside \u00a7\u00a7 7-2-4502 and -4504, MCA, and further apply the canon of statutory interpretation that generally requires us to conclude that \u201cthe singular means the plural,\u201d it is clear that the Legislature contemplated and intended to allow cities to annex wholly surrounded multiple tracts or parcels in a single resolution. Had the Legislature intended for only single tracts or parcels to be annexed under the wholly surrounded method, it could have drafted the language of \u00a7\u00a7 7-5-4502 and -4504, MCA, to reflect such an intention. Instead, the Legislature chose to use the plural form of the words emphasized above in crafting the sections proceeding \u00a7 7-2-4501, MCA, and we presume this to be intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b616 Further, the legislative history of \u00a7 11-403, RCM (1947), the antecedent of \u00a7 7-2-4501, MCA, supports the conclusion that the wholly surrounded method allows for the annexation of multiple tracts or parcels because the title of the amending act uses the plural form of the words \u201ctract\u201d and \u201cparcel.\u201d Moreover, if we were to interpret \u00a7 7-2-4501, MCA, as the Property Owners suggest, we would fail to give effect to the purpose of the wholly surrounded method of annexation that this Court recognized in <em>Brodie </em>and <em>Harrison. </em>Disallowing cities to annex multiple tracts or parcels in a single act would handcuff the ability of a city to grow its boundaries in an orderly fashion. It would also allow those who reap municipal benefits to shirk their responsibility to share in the cost of the benefits they enjoy as de facto city residents. Given our precedent interpreting the precursor to Title 7, chapter 2, part 45, MCA, this is clearly a consequence the Legislature intended to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b617 Lastly, restricting a city\u2019s ability to annex multiple tracts or parcels in a single resolution would lead to an absurd result; namely, cities would be left to annex wholly surrounded freehold properties in a piecemeal, inefficient fashion, even where, as here, the area is bounded by city territory on all sides of the development. Alternatively, cities would be forced to annex areas using the contiguous method of annexation in such cases. Since this method allows the real property owners of the area to reject annexation through an election or written disapproval, property owners could block annexation indefinitely yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>continue to benefit from city services and infrastructure without contributing to the cost of such city amenities. As the District Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">This result is not only antithetical to the overall ten[or] and purpose of the statute, but it evades common sense because such a reading forces cities to \u201cshoe string\u201d annex single parcels as no single parcel within a single subdivision could ever be \u201cwholly surrounded.\u201d The legislature does not perform such useless acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0-\">\u00b618  In sum, when we read \u00a7\u00a7 7-2-4502 and -4504, MCA, in harmony with \u00a7 7-2-4501, MCA, and take into account the Legislature\u2019s purpose in providing for this method of annexation, the only logical interpretation of the statute that gives effect to all sections of Title 7, chapter 2, part 45, MCA, is one that allows a city to annex multiple tracts or parcels if city territory wholly surrounds the area to be annexed. Accordingly, we agree with the District Court and hold that a city may annex multiple tracts or parcels under Title 7, chapter 2, part 45, MCA, because the wholly surrounded method of annexation is triggered by the geographic relationship between the freehold territory and the city, and not by the number of tracts or parcels a city seeks to annex.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b619 <em>Issue two: Did the District Court err in finding that the Houston Lakeshore Area is \u201cwholly surrounded\u201d by the City </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\u00b620 The Property Owners next argue that, even if the City can annex the entire area in a single resolution, the Houston Lakeshore Area is not wholly surrounded by the City under the test announced by this Court in <em>Calvert v. City of Great Falls, </em>154 Mont. 213, 462 P.2d 182 (1969). In <em>Calvert, </em>we held that \u201c[t]he term \u2018wholly surrounded\u2019 means that a tract of land where all lands on the side of the tract are within the city and where it is impossible to reach the tract without crossing such territory, the tract is \u2018wholly surrounded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Calvert, </em>154 Mont. at 217, 462 P.2d at 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">\u00b621 Both the District Court\u2019s order and both parties\u2019 briefs refer to the \u201ctwo-prong test\u201d of <em>Calvert. </em>However, in <em>Calvert, </em>we did not create a rigid two-step framework to determine whether a property is wholly surrounded.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, <em>Calvert </em>announced an analytical framework that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>is restricted to a single inquiry: that is, whether a tract or parcel is entirely surrounded by city territory, thus requiring one to cross city territory in order to access the area. Therefore, we first take this opportunity to clarify <em>Calvert </em>and return to the test announced therein: specifically, to the single inquiry framework originally embraced by this Court and elucidated above and in <em>Calvert </em>itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b622 The Property Owners first argue that the Houston Lakeshore Area does not satisfy the <em>Calvert </em>test because the area is only minimally bounded by City property. Specifically, the Property Owners maintain that the area is not bounded by City property to the south and west because Resolution No. 05-25 prevents the City from using Whitefish Lake as a way to create contiguity for the purposes of annexation. The District Court found the Houston Lakeshore Area to be wholly surrounded by the city, even at the exclusion of Whitefish Lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u00b623 <em>Calvert </em>requires that all sides of the area to be annexed under the wholly surrounded method be within city territory: however, the four corners of an area need not touch city territory in order for it to be considered \u201cwholly surrounded.\u201d <em>Calvert, </em>154 Mont. at 216-17, 462 P.2d at 184. In <em>Calvert, </em>the plaintiffs challenged the annexation of their property by the City of Great Falls, Montana, because an outdoor theater, an exempt tract,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was included within the area to be annexed and fronted a city street, thus breaking what the plaintiffs referred to as the \u201ccircle of contiguity.\u201d <em>Calvert, </em>154 Mont. at 215, 462 P.2d at 183. In upholding the annexation, we held that property need not be wholly contiguous to city territory in order for it to be wholly surrounded by it for the purposes of annexation. <em>Calvert, </em>154 Mont. at 217, 462 P.2d at 184 (citing <em>Penland v. Missoula, </em>132 Mont. 591, 318 P.2d 1089 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\u00b624 In this case, City territory borders the Houston Lakeshore Area on three sides of the property, while Whitefish Lake borders the area on the remaining sides. In Resolution No. 05-25, the City annexed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>lake, but also established a policy agreeing to refrain from using the contiguous land and wholly surrounded methods of annexation to annex lakeshore property not otherwise contiguous to the City. In other words, the City agreed not to use Whitefish Lake <em>alone </em>to create contiguity or to wholly surround an area. However, as the City points out, the resolution retained the City\u2019s ability to use the wholly surrounded method for properties surrounded on three sides by City territory and also bordered by the lake on the remaining sides of the area. Indeed, the resolution adopted the findings of a 1987 Attorney General Opinion, which found that an area wholly surrounded by the City and by Whitefish Lake may be annexed under Title 7, chapter 2, part 45, MCA. Thus, we cannot say that the resolution precludes the City from annexing the Houston Lakeshore Area.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b625 Furthermore, we find the Attorney General Opinion relied upon by the City persuasive and adopt its finding that the term \u201cwholly surrounded\u201d must \u201cbe practically interpreted to achieve the legislative objective of permitting annexation when a particular parcel has become, in essence, landlocked by a municipality.\u201d 42 Mont. Att\u2019y Gen. Op. 41, 1987 Mont. AG LEXIS at *4. As such, we also agree with the Attorney General\u2019s assessment that a tract or parcel, bordered by both city territory and by a large navigable lake, is \u201cwholly surrounded\u201d when, as to the sides bordered by <em>land, </em>it is surrounded by the municipality. 42 Mont. Att\u2019y Gen. Op. 41, 1987 Mont. AG LEXIS at *4. In this case, the Houston Lakeshore Area has become landlocked by the City because, as to the three sides bordered by land, it is bounded by the City. Consequently, we conclude that the area meets this requirement of <em>Calvert </em>because all lands on the side of the area to be annexed are within the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b626 The <em>Calvert </em>test also provides that an area is wholly surrounded when it is impossible to access the area without crossing city territory. <em>Calvert, </em>154 Mont. at 217, 462 P.2d at 184. The Property Owners argue that since, in their view, the City improperly annexed a portion of East Lakeshore Drive, the road they use to reach their property in fact belongs to the state of Montana and they need not cross City territory to access the Houston Lakeshore Area. The Property Owners also contend that because they could technically reach their property by boat, and because the water of Whitefish Lake is owned by the State, they need not cross City territory in order to reach their property.</p>\n<p id=\"A6Y\">\u00b627 As to the latter argument, we need only refer back to the Attorney General Opinion we cite with approval above. Again, when determining whether an area is \u201cwholly surrounded,\u201d we are only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>concerned with those tracts or parcels surrounded by land, and not with a body of water that borders the area on one or more sides. Accordingly, with respect to reaching the tract or parcel, we are also only concerned with how one accesses the area over land and we will not contemplate access to tracts or parcels by water.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AyC\">\u00b628 As for the former argument, the District Court found the validity of the prior annexation of East Lakeshore Drive immaterial because under \u00a7 7-2-4504, MCA, a road, in and of itself, cannot be a determinative factor as to whether a tract or parcel is wholly surrounded for purposes of annexation. We also find the validity of the road annexation immaterial in this case, but for a different reason: namely, we find that this issue is not properly before the Court because the issue has not previously been adjudicated and because the Property Owners\u2019 cause of action did not seek a declaration that the road annexation was invalid. In this case, the Property Owners sought a general declaration that the Houston Lakeshore Area is not wholly surrounded under \u00a7 7-2-4501, MCA, and then later alleged that the road annexation was void ab initio because the City failed to comply with Title 7, chapter 2, part 44, MCA. However, the Property Owners\u2019 allegation that the road annexation is void, brought without a prior judicial determination that the annexation is invalid, exceeds the scope of a declaratory action. \u201cCourts do not function, even under the Declaratory Judgments Act, to determine speculative matters, to enter anticipatory judgments, to declare social status, to give advisory opinions or to give abstract opinions.\u201d <em>Donaldson v. State, </em>2012 MT 288, \u00b6 9, 367 Mont. 228, 292 P.3d 364, (citing Mont. <em>Dep\u2019t Natural Res. &amp; Conservation v. Intake Water Co., </em>171 Mont. 416, 440, 558 P.2d 1110, 1123 (1976)). The City contends that the annexation is valid in every respect and the record contains a copy of Resolution No. B-916. Thus, for our purposes, and until a party with standing<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> seeks a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>determination that the road annexation is invalid and the resolution is void, the section of East Lakeshore Drive between Reservoir Road and the North boundary of Lot 1, Block 1 of the Houston Point Subdivision is deemed City territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u00b629  The District Court also pointed out that the <em>Calvert </em>test contemplates access across city <em>territory </em>to reach the area to be annexed, not access across city <em>roads. </em>Indeed, in <em>Missoula Rural Fire Dist. v. City of Missoula, </em>283 Mont. 113, 938 P.2d 1328 (1997) <em>(Missoula Rural </em>I), we commented that motor vehicle routes for ingress and egress to the residential properties in question \u201crequire[d] travel of at least three miles <em>through </em>Missoula city limits,\u201d not <em>on </em>city roads.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Missoula Rural I, </em>283 Mont. at 114, 938 P.2d at 1329 (emphasis added). Additionally, in <em>Missoula Rural Fire Dist. v. City of Missoula, </em>286 Mont. 387, 950 P.2d 758 (1997) <em>(Missoula Rural II), </em>the Court considered an annexation where city roadways, annexed prior to annexing the area in question, bordered the area. <em>Missoula Rural II, </em>286 Mont. at 389, 950 P.2d at 759. The property owners challenged the annexation, arguing that the city could not rely on the annexed streets to wholly surround their tracts of land. <em>Missoula Rural II, </em>286 Mont. at 391-92, 950 P.2d at 760-61. The Court disagreed, holding that a street could be considered contiguous to other land for purposes of annexation and concluding, in relevant part, that the area met the <em>Calvert </em>test \u201cbecause it was impossible to reach any of the tracts without crossing City territory, however narrow.\u201d <em>Missoula Rural II, </em>286 Mont. at 396, 950 P.2d at 763. However, while we held in <em>Missoula Rural II </em>that an annexed city street may be used to wholly surround an area, we did not conclude that access to the area must occur over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>annexed roads. The language of \u00a7 7-2-4504, MCA, makes clear that tracts or parcels are contiguous to a city even though the area is separated from city territory \u201cby a street or other roadway.\u201d Section 7-2-4504, MCA. The District Court correctly interpreted this section when it held that an area to be annexed is wholly surrounded even when an intersecting roadway separates the area from the existing city territory that must be crossed to reach it.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b630  Here, the map provided above illustrates that when the Property Owners travel on East Lakeshore Drive, from either the south or north, they must pass through several tracts of city territory. Even when the Property Owners turn off East Lakeshore Drive and onto Houston Drive, the majority of the Property Owners must pass through interspersed tracts of annexed city territory to access their property, specifically the Houston Lake Shore Tracts 11, 13 and 15, and the Stocking Addition Tracts Cl, C3, and C5. As such, in order to access the Houston Lakeshore Area by road, the Property Owners must cross City territory, even when traveling within their own development. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court correctly determined that the Houston Lakeshore Area is wholly surrounded for purposes of annexation under <em>Calvert </em>and Title 7, chapter 2, part 45, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u00b631 For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the District Court\u2019s order granting the City\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment and denying the Property Owner\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b120-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, McKINNON and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-8\"> 42 Mont.
