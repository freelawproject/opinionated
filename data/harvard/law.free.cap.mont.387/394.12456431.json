We reverse, and address the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\"><em>Did the District Court err in its interpretation of \u00a7 70-30-315, MCA, regarding proration of taxes in a condemnation </em>proceeding?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b62 The parties and the District Court agreed that there were no conflicts of material fact. Mountain Water operates a water delivery system located in and around Missoula, which the City initiated an action to condemn, issuing a summons on April 2, 2014. The Fourth Judicial District Court issued a Preliminary Order of Condemnation under \u00a7 70-30-206, MCA, which this Court affirmed in <em>City of Missoula v. Mt. Water Co., </em>2016 MT 183, 384 Mont. 193, 378 P.3d 1113. Compensation has been determined in the proceeding, but no final order of condemnation has been issued pursuant \u00a7 70-30-309, MCA, and title to and possession of the subject property remains with Mountain Water and its affiliated entities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\u00b63 F oil owing initiation of the condemnation action, Mountain Water requested that the Department agree the Company was no longer responsible for property taxes and that the City be deemed responsible, citing \u00a7 70-30-315, MCA, which provides, in toto:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">Proration of taxes. The condemnor must be assessed the condemnor\u2019s pro rata share of taxes for the land being taken as of the date of possession or summons, whichever occurs first. The condemnor must be assessed for all taxes accruing after the date of possession or summons, whichever occurs first.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">The City objected, stating that responsibility for taxes would shift after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>a judgment awarding possession was entered. In a letter to the parties, the Department acknowledged that \u00a7 70-30-315, MCA, \u201cmaybe subject to either of [their] interpretations,\u201d but concluded that, while the statute raised the issue of proration of taxes, \u201cit is not conclusive evidence that there has been or is a transfer of ownership interest from Mountain Water to the [C]ity of Missoula.\u201d The Department thus determined to \u201cchange ownership records only upon receipt of a transfer certificate from the clerk and recorder, or upon completion of the forms from the parties reporting the transfer and after filing of a realty transfer certificate\u201d under the Realty Transfer Act, codified in Title 15 of the Montana Code, and would not shift responsibility for taxes from Mountain Water. The Department has continued to issue property tax assessments naming Mountain Water as the responsible entity for the property taxes throughout the condemnation action. Mountain Water has paid taxes under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b64 Pursuant to \u00a7 15-1-406, MCA, Mountain Water filed a declaratory action against the Department, seeking a determination that \u00a7 70-30-315, MCA, required assessment of property taxes against the City from and after the date of the condemnation summons. The Department answered, seeking approval of its interpretation of the statutes. The City, as explained in its <em>amicus curiae </em>brief filed in this appeal, did not seek to intervene in the District Court based upon its understanding that Mountain Water\u2019s complaint was not requesting an order requiring payment of taxes by the City, but rather sought a refund of the taxes the Company had paid. The City notes that the Company\u2019s complaint specifically requested an order \u201cdeclaring that <em>if Missoula takes possession of the subject properties by eminent domain, </em>then Mountain Water is entitled to an Order directing refund of the property taxes paid by Mountain Water under protest.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b65 Mountain Water\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted by the District Court, which reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">[Section 70-30-315, MCA,] sets forth an exception to the general assessment statutes when eminent domain is involved. Otherwise there would be no point to the statute\u2014the general provisions of Montana Code Annotated \u00a7 15-7-304(2) would [always] govern.... [T]he City of Missoula, as condemnor, must be assessed for all taxes accruing on the subject property after April 2, 2014. Property taxes paid by Mountain Water under protest for any period after April 2, 2014 shall be refunded by [the Department], together with interest as required by the provisions of Montana Code Annotated \u00a7 15-1-402.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\u00b66 The Department appealed and the City moved to intervene before this Court, arguing that the assessment of taxes against the City was done <em>in absentia </em>and violated the City\u2019s due process rights. The Court denied the City\u2019s request to intervene, but granted its request to file an <em>amicus curiae </em>brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b67 We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment, applying the criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). <em>Citizens for a Better Flathead v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>2016 MT 256, \u00b6 10, 385 Mont. 156, 381 P.3d 555 <em>(citing Pilgeram v. GreenPoint Mortg. Funding, </em>Inc., 2013 MT 354, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 1, 313 P.3d 839). We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Citizens for a Better Flathead, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Pilgeram, </em>\u00b6 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court err in its interpretation of\u00a7 70-30-315, MCA, regarding proration of taxes in a condemnation </em>proceeding?</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\u00b69 The Department argues that the District Court\u2019s order to assess taxes against the City violates the City\u2019s constitutional and statutory protections that exempt cities from property taxation, citing Article VIII, Section 5(1)(a) of the Montana Constitution (\u201cThe legislature may exempt from taxation ... property of ... municipal corporations . ...\u201d), and \u00a7 15-6-201(1)(a)(iv), MCA (\u201cThe following categories of property are exempt from taxation: ... municipal corporations.\u201d). The Department also argues it is bound by the Realty Transfer Act and accompanying regulations, which require that it assess Mountain Water for property it owns until a final order of condemnation is issued and recorded with the clerk and recorder, citing \u00a7 15-7-304(2), MCA (\u201cThe department is not required to change any ownership records used for the assessment or taxation of real property unless the department has received a transfer certificate from the clerk and recorder and the transfer has been reported to the department as provided by rule.\u201d), and Admin. R. Mont. 42.20.204(1) (\u201cThe department shall not change to whom real property is assessed unless properly notified by means of an accurately prepared Realty Transfer Certificate....\u201d). The Department also argues that the District Court\u2019s interpretation results in an \u201cabsurd\u201d windfall to Mountain Water by allowing it to profit from use of the property while avoiding property taxes during the pendency of the condemnation action, and, further, that the protested taxes were paid to Missoula County, and thus, the Department is the incorrect agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>to issue a refund. The Department states that, even if it possessed authority to refund the protested taxes, \u201cthose taxes constitute an asset and appear [to be] subject to condemnation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\u00b610 Mountain Water argues that the District Court properly interpreted \u00a7 70-30-315, MCA, according to its plain meaning, and properly concluded that it controls as the more specific statute for condemnation matters over the general tax provisions of the Realty Transfer Act. Mountain Water argues that although the statute grants a \u201csmall favoring of the condemnee,\u201d it is not absurd, given the fact that \u201cthe condemnation power granted to the condemnor is so draconian.\u201d Mountain Water argues that its request for an immediate refund was not challenged before the District Court and that the \u201ctechnicality\u201d of the County, not the Department, collecting the taxes is harmless. Finally, regarding the City\u2019s claimed exemption from taxation, Mountain Water argues that \u201c[assessment does not equate to payment\u201d and that the City has all legal avenues to pursue once it is assessed the taxes, which is \u201can issue between the City and the State entirely separate from this appeal by the State against a private taxpayer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u00b611 The City, as <em>amicus curiae, </em>argues that the District Court erred by ordering the Department to assess property taxes against the City because the City is tax-exempt. It argues that the District Court\u2019s order violated the City\u2019s due process rights because it ordered tax assessment against the City even though the City was not a party in the litigation. Finally, the City argues that the refund to Mountain Water ordered by the District Court, without ordering an accompanying refund to Mountain Water customers, will function as a windfall to Mountain Water because the property tax burden is a pass-through cost in the water rates approved by the Montana Public Service Commission and paid by water customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b612 The parties\u2019 arguments tend to read more into this very short statute than is actually there, and extrapolate beyond the precise purpose of the legislation. \u201cIn the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. \u201c[L]egislative intent is to be ascertained, in the first instance, from the plain meaning of the words used\u201d by the Legislature. <em>W. Energy Co. v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>1999 MT 289, \u00b6 11, 297 Mont. 55, 990 P.2d 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u00b613 Section 70-30-315, MCA, is entitled \u201cProration of taxes.\u201d Senate Bill 269, the 1981 eminent domain bill that created this section and the accompanying section regarding weed control, was entitled \u201cAn Act... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Requiring Proration of Taxes and Weed Control.\u201d 1981 Mont. Laws 1105. Section 70-30-315, MCA, simply prorates property taxes. It prorates taxes \u201cfor the land being taken\u201d as between the condemnor and the condemnee by designating the date from which the taxes will be assessed to the condemnor, which is \u201cthe date of possession or summons, whichever occurs first.\u201d Thus, the Legislature has hereby adopted a different assessment date than the usual \u201cGeneral assessment day\u201d for real property\u2014which is midnight, January 1\u2014as provided in \u00a7 15-8-201(2)(a), MCA. Section 15-8-201(2)(a), MCA, requires the Department to annually \u201cassess property to[] the person by whom it was owned or claimed or in whose possession or control it was\u201d on midnight of January 1 of each year. In contrast, \u00a7 70-30-315, MCA, selects a different date for purposes of designating the person who shall be assessed the property taxes in condemnation situations, requiring the condemnor to be assessed earlier in time than the general tax statutes would normally require, thus effectuating a unique proration of taxes as between condemnation parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b614 This conclusion is further illustrated by noting that the Legislature, when enacting \u00a7 70-30-315, MCA, did not address the Department\u2019s assessment practices, including the Realty Transfer Act, which had previously been enacted in 1975, or the mechanics of payment, protest, grievance, refund, or reimbursement of property taxes, as provided in Article VIII, Section 7 of the Montana Constitution (\u201cThe IL legislature shall provide independent appeal procedures for taxpayer grievances about appraisals, assessments, equalization, and taxes.\u201d), \u00a7 15-15-101, et seq., MCA (property tax appeals generally), and \u00a7 15-1-401, et seq., MCA (payment of taxes under protest). The Legislature did not here concern itself with the reality that the typical condemnor is a government entity that is exempt from paying property taxes, including the state, counties, cities, towns, and municipal corporations. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-6-201(1)(a), MCA. The statute simply established a tax proration date that is more favorable to condemnees than under general law, and provided no additional or alternate process to accompany this simple adjustment. \u00b615 \u201cIt is the general rule that a taking does not occur until: (1) legal title vests in the condemnor, (2) the condemnor enters into actual possession, or (3) the condemnor takes constructive possession either by causing damage to property or by depriving the owner of full beneficial use of his land.\u201d <em>City of Billings v. Hunt, </em>257 Mont. 99, 103, 847 P. 2d 715, 717-18 (1993) (citing <em>Stewart &amp; Grindle, Inc. v. Alaska, </em>524 P.2d 1242, 1246 (Alaska 1974)). Until a taking by one of these methods occurs, the property\u2019s owner \u201cremains responsible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>expenses incidental to legal ownership.\u201d <em>City of Billings, </em>257 Mont. at 103, 847 P.2d at 718. Expenses incidental to legal ownership include property taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b616 American Jurisprudence 2d provides commentary as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARq\">The Model Eminent Domain Code provides that the condemnor is required to pay or reimburse the owner for the prorated portion of property taxes allocable to a period after the date of vesting title in, or the effective date of possession of the property by, the condemnor, whichever is earlier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">26 Am. Jur. 2d Eminent Domain \u00a7 277 (2014) (citing Model Eminent Domain Code \u00a7 211(a)(3)). The Montana Legislature has provided condemnees a potentially \u201cbetter deal\u201d on property taxes than contemplated by the Model Eminent Domain Code. Instead of prorating taxes as of the time of possession or the vesting of property title in the condemnor, whichever is earlier, the Legislature, by enacting \u00a7 70-30-315, MCA, required that \u201cproperty taxes become the responsibility of the condemnor,\u201d <em>City of Billings, </em>257 Mont. at 103, 847 P.2d at 718, at the time of possession or service of the condemnation summons, whichever is earlier. While the statute may shift to the condemnor responsibility for an \u201cincident of ownership\u201d\u2014property tax\u2014that accrues prior to the condemnor\u2019s taking of the property, it did nothing to alter the principle, as stated by the above authorities, that the obligation to <em>pay </em>the taxes does not transfer to the condemnor until the taking actually occurs. The owner \u201cremains responsible\u201d until then. <em>City of Billings, </em>257 Mont. at 103, 847 P.2d at 718. As the City\u2019s counsel correctly explained in pre-litigation correspondence, \u00a7 70-30-315, MCA, \u201cprovides a measure for taxes to be assessed <em>for property actually taken. Once taken, </em>taxes are assessed to the condemnor \u2018as of the date of possession or summons, whichever occurs first.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Likewise, Mountain Water\u2019s complaint acknowledged that <em>\u201cif Missoula takes possession of the subject properties by eminent domain, </em>then Mountain Water is entitled to an Order directing refund of the property taxes paid by Mountain Water under protest.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, Mountain Water retains responsibility for actual payment of the property taxes for the period it possesses the property, until the taking occurs. This makes common sense: if a condemnation action is ultimately unsuccessful and the owner does not lose possession of the property, then the property tax obligation, along with the use and enjoyment of the property, would have rightly remained with the owner during the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u00b617 This understanding of \u00a7 70-30-315, MCA, and Mountain Water\u2019s continuing possession of the property pending a final order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>condemnation, resolves the Department\u2019s current concern that it cannot \u201cceas[e] to assess Mountain Water on property it still owns.\u201d Mountain Water continues to own and possess the property and to be responsible for the taxes until the transfer of title by entry of a final order, consistent with the Realty Transfer Act. However, as the discussion of Montana law herein illustrates, a taking can also be effectuated by a condemnor\u2019s <em>possession </em>of property prior to the entry of a final order, <em>City of Billings, </em>257 Mont. at 103, 847 P. 2d at 717-18, which could trigger a condemnor\u2019s obligation under \u00a7 70-30-315, MCA, to pay the property taxes. In that event, the Department would need to accommodate such a taking by assessing the property taxes, from the date of possession or summons, against the condemnor. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-8-201(2)(a), MCA (\u201cThe department shall assess property to[] the person ... in whose possession or control it was ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b618  Here, Mountain Water continues to possess the property and thus continues to be responsible for payment of property taxes. It is not entitled to a refund at this time. The District Court\u2019s order of a refund to Mountain Water, and of assessment of property taxes against the City of Missoula, is reversed. The condemnation litigation will continue until a final order of condemnation is entered, effectuating a taking of the property by the City. Mountain Water may pursue appropriate remedies for refund, reimbursement or compensation for the taxes it has paid since the date of the condemnation summons in the appropriate forums. Likewise, as Mountain Water acknowledges, the City retains all rights and avenues of relief to raise its defenses in appropriate forums as an entity claiming exemption from the payment of taxes, as well as its claim that any refund would constitute a windfall under the terms of Mountain Water\u2019s regulatory authorization, thus ensuring the City\u2019s right to due process. We resolve today only the question before us\u2014the interpretation and application of \u00a7 70-30-315, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u00b619 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER, McKINNON, SHEA and SANDEFUR concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\"> On May 2, 2017, the City of Missoula filed an unopposed motion to stay appellate proceedings in <em>B &amp; E Corp v.
