Following our remand in <em>Harrington v. Energy West, Inc., </em>2015 MT 233, 380 Mont. 298, 356 P.3d 441 (hereafter <em>Harrington I), </em>the District Court denied Harrington\u2019s motion to amend his complaint and granted Energy West\u2019s motion to dismiss based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens. Harrington contends that the District Court abused its discretion in denying him leave to amend his complaint and that it incorrectly dismissed the case under forum non conveniens.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">\u00b63 Energy West is a Montana corporation and a corporate subsidiary of Gas Natural, Inc.\u2014an Ohio corporation with corporate offices in Ohio and Montana. As we noted in <em>Harrington I, </em>it is unclear whether Energy West or Gas Natural hired Harrington as a corporate controller in February 2011. Nevertheless, the record establishes that Harrington entered into his employment agreement in Ohio; that the agreement was made between Harrington and Gas Natural employees; that Harrington resided and worked primarily in Ohio; that he provided services to Energy West from Gas Natural\u2019s Ohio office; and that Energy West issued Harrington\u2019s paychecks and paid Harrington\u2019s payroll taxes, withholdings, and insurance premiums to the State of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">\u00b64 In October 2012, Harrington\u2019s employment was terminated. Harrington filed suit against Energy West in Montana\u2019s Eighth Judicial District Court, alleging wrongful discharge under the Montana Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act, negligent infliction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>emotional distress, and defamation. Energy West moved under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The District Court granted the motion after hearing oral argument. The court determined that Ohio law governed and that it therefore lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, or, alternatively, that Ohio was the appropriate forum to exercise jurisdiction. Harrington appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">\u00b65 In <em>Harrington </em>I, we concluded that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by declining to hold an evidentiary hearing before granting Energy West\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 11. In so doing, we noted that the \u201cparties vigorously dispute whether Harrington\u2019s employer was Energy West or Gas Natural.\u201d <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 11. That dispute, we emphasized, was \u201cnot material to determinations bearing on the resolution of Energy West\u2019s motion\u201d to dismiss. <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 11. We concluded that the material facts relevant to Energy West\u2019s motion \u201cconcern[ed] the place where Harrington entered into his employment agreement and performed his employment.\u201d <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 11. We noted that the parties did not dispute those material facts. <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\u00b66 Analyzing the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction, we first considered whether Montana or Ohio law governed Harrington\u2019s employment contract. <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-22. We confirmed that the record undisputedly established that \u201cHarrington performed the majority of his duties in his Ohio office\u201d and \u201cthat Harrington\u2019s employment agreement was made in Ohio between Harrington and Gas Natural employees.\u201d <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 21. We thus concluded pursuant to \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA, that the District Court \u201ccorrectly determined that Ohio law governs Harrington\u2019s contract claims\u201d and that Harrington could not rely on Montana law for his wrongful termination claims. <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\u00b67 Notwithstanding application of Montana law, we concluded that Montana courts had subject-matter jurisdiction over Harrington\u2019s claim. <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 25. We then examined the District Court\u2019s alternative basis for dismissal, that Ohio was the appropriate forum for exercise of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-29. This alternative basis, we deduced, \u201cappealed] to refer to the doctrine of forum non conveniens.\u201d <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 26. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">Based on the record on appeal, we cannot determine whether an alternative forum is available for Harrington\u2019s claims. Ohio seems the natural location for this litigation, but for an Ohio court to hear this case it would have to have personal jurisdiction over Energy West. The parties have not argued whether there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>obstacles to jurisdiction in Ohio, but Energy West is a Montana corporation with its principal place of business in Montana, and Energy West has not stated whether it would consent to personal jurisdiction in Ohio. We will not resolve this question without the benefit of argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\">Additionally, Harrington also has claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress and slander that may or may not rely on Montana law. The District Court would need to consider these claims as well in evaluating forum non conveniens. We thus conclude that we cannot resolve the issue of dismissal under the doctrine of forum non conveniens based on the record before us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxX\"><em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28-29. Accordingly, \u201c[w]e vacatledl the District Court\u2019s dismissal and remandledl for further proceedings to consider whether dismissal under the doctrine of forum non conveniens is appropriate.\u201d <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u00b68 Upon remand, Harrington sought leave to file an amended complaint. Harrington\u2019s proposed amended complaint dropped his claims for wrongful discharge and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Harrington instead asserted claims for deceit, negligent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, unjust enrichment, negligent slander, and punitive damages. Energy West opposed Harrington\u2019s motion. It also filed a motion to dismiss based on forum non conveniens.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\u00b69 The District Court held a hearing on the motions. During the hearing, Energy West consented to personal jurisdiction in Ohio. The court\u2019s subsequent order denied Harrington\u2019s motion to amend his complaint on the grounds that it would prejudice Energy West and that this Court had remanded for consideration of forum non conveniens. The court\u2019s order also granted Energy West\u2019s motion to dismiss under forum non conveniens. The District Court based its decision on its conclusion that the convenience of witnesses and interests of justice supported trying Harrington\u2019s original claims in Ohio. Harrington appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\u00b610 We generally review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend pleadings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Bardsley v. Pluger, </em>2015 MT 301, \u00b6 10, 381 Mont. 284, 358 P.3d 907. A district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Bardsley, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">\u00b611 Section 25-2-201(3), MCA, which governs motions to change venue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>within Montana on the ground of convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice, reflects the principles of forum non conveniens. <em>San Diego Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Ninth Judicial Dist. Ct., </em>2014 MT 191, \u00b6 24, 375 Mont. 517, 329 P.3d 1264 (citing <em>State ex rel. Burlington N. R.R. v. Dist. </em>Ct., 270 Mont. 146, 153, 155, 891 P.2d 493, 498-99 (1995); <em>Modroo v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 275, \u00b6 70, 345 Mont. 262, 191 P.3d 389). We have held that \u201c\u00a7 25-2-201(3), MCA, grants the district court wide discretion, and we will not disturb the court\u2019s decision absent a clear abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Lockman, </em>266 Mont. 194, 201-02, 879 P.2d 710, 715 (1994); <em>accord Wagman v. Motl, </em>2015 MT 168, \u00b6 6, 379 Mont. 439, 352 P.3d 609 (\u201cA district court exercises its discretion when transferring venue from one proper county to another proper county for the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice [under \u00a7 25-2-201(3), MCA], and we will not disturb such a decision absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d). Because a forum non conveniens analysis turns on similar considerations, we review a district court\u2019s determination on a motion to dismiss under forum non conveniens for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b612 <em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Harrington\u2019s motion to amend his complaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\u00b613 The District Court explained that Harrington\u2019s proposed amended complaint dropped all but one of his previous legal theories and replaced them with five new theories. The court noted that the \u201ccommon thread in the new theories is alleged misrepresentations to [Harrington] that he worked for Energy West.\u201d The court determined that Harrington\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d theories \u201cdo not outweigh the prejudice to Energy West that would result from changing the legal basis of this case three years after it started and after Energy West prevailed on an important motion.\u201d In addition, the court explained, this Court remanded the case in <em>Harrington I </em>\u201cfor more analysis of the <em>forum non conveniens issue , ... </em>not so Mr. Harrington could experiment with different legal theories.\u201d The court concluded, \u201cThe combination of the prejudice to Energy West that would result from this untimely amendment and the fact that it diverges sharply from the Supreme Court\u2019s remand instructions overcomes the normal preference for free amendment of pleadings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\u00b614 On appeal, Harrington argues that the District Court abused its discretion in denying his motion to amend his complaint. He first asserts that M. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2) provides that leave to amend should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>be freely given so long as the other party is not prejudiced. The amendment could not prejudice Energy West, Harrington maintains, because there was no scheduling order in place, the parties had conducted \u201conly preliminary discovery,\u201d and Energy West had not yet filed an answer to the original complaint. Harrington asserts that we determined in <em>Harrington I </em>that Gas Natural\u2014and not Energy West\u2014was his employer. Thus, Harrington contends that \u201cthe elements of a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation\u201d against Energy West did not arise until after our remand in <em>Harrington I, </em>when he first learned that Gas Natural was his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b615 M. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2)\u2019s preference that a court \u201cfreely\u201d grant leave to amend \u201cwhen justice so requires\u201d \u201cdoes not mean that a court must automatically grant a motion to amend.\u201d <em>Kershaw v. Mont. Dept. of Transp., </em>2011 MT 170, \u00b6 25, 361 Mont. 215, 257 P.3d 358 (citation and internal quotations omitted). A district court does not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to amend \u201cfor an apparent reason such as ... undue prejudice to the opposing party by allowance of the <em>amendment.\u201dFarmers Coop. Ass\u2019n v. Amsden, LLC, </em>2007 MT 286, \u00b6 12, 339 Mont. 445, 171 P.3d 690. We have affirmed a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend \u201cwhen the opposing party already had expended substantial effort and expense in the course of the dispute that would be wasted if the moving party were allowed to proceed on a new legal theory.\u201d <em>Farmers Coop. </em>Ass\u2019n, \u00b6 14 (citation and internal quotations omitted). In making a determination on undue prejudice, a court must balance the prejudice suffered by the opposing party \u201cagainst the sufficiency of the moving party\u2019s justification of the delay.\u201d <em>Farmers Coop. Ass\u2019n, </em>\u00b6 14 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b616 Contrary to Harrington\u2019s assertions, we did not conclude in <em>Harrington I </em>that Gas Natural employed Harrington. We observed that \u201cthe parties vigorously dispute whether Harrington\u2019s employer was Energy West or Gas Natural.\u201d <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 11. We concluded that the dispute was \u201cnot material to determinations bearing on the resolution of Energy West\u2019s motion.\u201d <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 11. As we explained later in the Opinion, where Harrington entered into his employment agreement and where he did his job were the facts material to determining whether Ohio or Montana law applied. <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-22. We concluded that Ohio law governed, not because we determined that Gas Natural employed Harrington, but because the record established that \u201cHarrington performed the majority of his duties in his Ohio office\u201d and that \u201cHarrington\u2019s employment agreement was made in Ohio between Harrington and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Gas Natural Employees.\u201d <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 21. Harrington\u2019s contentions that his negligent misrepresentation claims did not arise until after our remand in <em>Harrington I </em>do not establish that the District Court abused its discretion by refusing to allow him to amend the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"An_\">\u00b617 As the District Court found, Harrington\u2019s proposed amended complaint dropped all but one of his original claims and asserted five completely new legal theories. Harrington sought to amend his complaint over two-and-a-half years after he filed his original complaint. During that time, Energy West had argued successfully that Ohio law applied to Harrington\u2019s wrongful termination claims in his original complaint. We affirmed that conclusion. <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 22. By the time Harrington filed his motion to amend, Energy West \u201calready had expended substantial effort and expense in the course of the dispute that would be wasted if [Harrington] were allowed to proceed on a new legal theory.\u201d <em>Farmers Coop. Ass\u2019n, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b618 Further, we remanded in <em>Harrington I </em>for the narrow purpose of considering \u201cwhether dismissal under the doctrine of forum non conveniens is appropriate.\u201d <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 30. As the District Court emphasized, we did not remand to give Harrington the chance to start over with all new theories. We said only that, in addition to the wrongful discharge claim, the \u201cDistrict Court would need to consider [Harrington\u2019s negligent infliction of emotional distress and slander] claims as well in evaluating forum non conveniens.\u201d <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"Amf\">\u00b619  The District Court did not act arbitrarily or exceed the bounds of reason in concluding that Harrington\u2019s amendment would prejudice Energy West and that the amendment would run counter to our remand instructions in <em>Harrington I. </em>Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Harrington\u2019s motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"AXd\">\u00b620 <em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in granting Energy West\u2019s motion to dismiss based on forum non conveniens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b621 The District Court first addressed whether Ohio courts could exercise personal jurisdiction over Energy West. In so doing, the court noted that neither party \u201cidentified any Ohio-law obstacle to Ohio exercising personal jurisdiction over Energy West,\u201d that personal jurisdiction may be waived by a defendant in Ohio, and that Energy West had \u201cfirmly committed\u201d to waiving personal jurisdiction if Harrington brought suit in Ohio. The District Court therefore concluded that there were no obstacles to jurisdiction in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u00b622 The District Court began its forum non conveniens analysis by noting that a plaintiffs \u201cchoice of a forum should not be disturbed except for weighty reasons.\u201d (Quoting <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 27.) Relying on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>San Diego Gas &amp; Elec. </em>Co., the court affirmed that \u00a7 25-2-201(3), MCA, reflects the principles of forum non conveniens. \u201cThat statute,\u201d the court explained, \u201crequires changing the place of trial when \u2018the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice could be promoted by the change.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting \u00a7 25-2-201(3), MCA.) The court then proceeded to analyze whether forum non conveniens justified dismissing Harrington\u2019s claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress and slander.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b623 The District Court noted that Harrington\u2019s claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress, \u201cby its own terms,\u201d alleged that Energy West inflicted emotional distress \u201cin its handling of [Harrington\u2019s] employment discharge.\u201d The court emphasized that Harrington performed the majority of his duties in Ohio and that his office and his supervisor were located in Ohio. Further, the court went on, Harrington \u201cnecessarily experienced or suffered the alleged emotional distress in Ohio, where he was living and working, and where he was physically located when he learned of his discharge .... Thus the people who allegedly inflicted the emotional distress, together with the people who know of its alleged extent, are in Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u00b624 The District Court summarized Harrington\u2019s slander claim as follows: \u201cIn effect, [Harrington] argues that the allegedly unauthorized use of his name on post-discharge SEC filings that later became controversial defames him.\u201d The court found that the damages Harrington asserted \u201cresult either from Gas Natural stamping his name on reports Gas Natural was submitting to the SEC on behalf of its wholly-owned subsidiary Energy West or, alternatively, Gas Natural <em>permitting </em>its wholly-owned subsidiary Energy West to continue stamping or printing Mr. Harrington\u2019s name on those filings.\u201d \u201cEither way,\u201d the court continued, \u201cthe culpability\u2014if any\u2014and the knowledgeable witnesses are at Gas Natural headquarters in Mentor, Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u00b625 The court stated that the following factors supported a conclusion that \u201cthe convenience of witnesses and interests of justice\u201d necessitated trying Harrington\u2019s claims in Ohio:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">\u2022 The Montana Supreme Court has already determined that Ohio law governs, <em>Harrington [I], </em>\u00b6 21, and Ohio courts are far better suited than this Court to identify and apply Ohio law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">\u2022 Mr. Harrington\u2019s employment ended in Ohio;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">\u2022 Mr. Harrington and the individual responsible for his termination reside in Ohio;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">\u2022 Gas Natural\u2019s records are largely if not exclusively located in Ohio;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>\u2022 Most of the witnesses who know about Mr. Harrington\u2019s discharge, the infliction of the alleged emotional distress, the extent of the alleged emotional distress, and how Mr. Harrington\u2019s signature came to be associated with the disputed SEC filings are in Ohio;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\">\u2022 To the limited extent any potential witnesses are in Montana, M. R. Civ. P. 28(c) provides a straightforward process pursuant to which the Montana clerk of court will issue a Montana deposition subpoena upon the presentation of an appropriate subpoena from the Ohio courts; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">\u2022 Montana jurors should not be burdened with a case based on Ohio law and conduct that occurred in Ohio.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The court noted that the \u201cscant few facts Mr. Harrington might try to prove through Montana witnesses or Montana documents simply do not outweigh the fact that the center of gravity of Mr. Harrington\u2019s employment relationship was in Ohio rather than Montana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">\u00b626 Harrington does not directly address the District Court\u2019s analysis of forum non conveniens. Instead, Harrington contends that the court failed to analyze whether his negligent infliction of emotional distress and slander claims relied on Montana law pursuant to his reading of our remand in <em>Harrington I. </em>Harrington asserts that the District Court improperly relied on our conclusion in <em>Harrington I </em>that Ohio law governed his wrongful termination claims in concluding that his negligent infliction of emotional distress and slander claims belong in Ohio. Moreover, Harrington contends, the court erred by not holding an evidentiary hearing to determine whether records of his employment were located in Montana or Ohio. Finally, he argues that he \u201cclearly set forth by affidavit the fact Montana employees were responsible and involved in each of the wrongful acts alleged\u201d in his original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">\u00b627  The common law doctrine of forum non conveniens \u201callows a court to resist imposition upon its jurisdiction even when jurisdiction is authorized by the letter of a general venue statute.\u201d <em>San Diego Gas &amp; Elec. </em>Co., \u00b6 22 (citation and internal quotations omitted). Under the doctrine, a court may \u201cdismiss a case when it believes that the action may be more appropriately and justly tried elsewhere, including another state, taking into account the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 26 (citations and internal quotations omitted). A district court is granted \u201cwide discretion\u201d in determining whether the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by a change in venue. <em>In re Marriage of Lockman, </em>226 Mont. at 201-02, 879 P.2d at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>\u00b628 Harrington\u2019s reliance on our reference in <em>Harrington I </em>to his negligent infliction of emotional distress and slander claims is misplaced. Although we acknowledged that Harrington\u2019s claims \u201cmay or may not rely on Montana law,\u201d we simply directed the District Court \u201cto consider these claims ... in evaluating forum non conveniens.\u201d <em>Harrington I, </em>\u00b6 29. The District Court clearly did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\u00b629 We agree with the District Court that both of Harrington\u2019s claims relate to his discharge from employment\u2014he claimed emotional distress due to his discharge, and his slander claim rested on post-discharge actions allegedly taken by Gas Natural. The record confirms the District Court\u2019s findings that Harrington\u2019s employment ended in Ohio, that both he and the person who terminated him reside in Ohio, that the witnesses who know about his discharge reside in Ohio, that the infliction of the alleged emotional distress occurred in Ohio, that the witnesses who know the extent of the alleged emotional distress reside in Ohio, and that the witnesses who know why his signature appeared on the disputed SEC filings are in Ohio. As the District Court concluded, \u201cthe center of gravity of Mr. Harrington\u2019s employment relationship was in Ohio rather than Montana.\u201d The District Court also was correct in its observation that Harrington may depose any potential Montana witnesses pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 28(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b630  Given the facts and circumstances of this case, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by determining that resolution of Harrington\u2019s claims in Ohio would promote the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice. Its decision to dismiss Harrington\u2019s complaint based on forum non conveniens is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">\u00b631 We affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Harrington\u2019s motion to amend and granting Energy West\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<judges id=\"b522-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, WHEAT and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
