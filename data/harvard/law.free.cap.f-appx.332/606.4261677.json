Wyne argues the district court abused its discretion when it denied his request for a recess, which prevented him from presenting testimony from a defense witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The parties agree the district court\u2019s denial of this motion for a recess is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. However, we are precluded \u201cfrom reviewing an issue raised on appeal if it has been waived through the doctrine of invited error.\u201d <em>United States v. Brannan, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009) (emphasis and citation omitted). The \u201cdoctrine of invited error is implicated when a party induces or invites the district court into making an error.\u201d <em>Id (quoting United States v. Stone, </em>139 F.3d 822, 838 (11th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">We do not find the court abused its discretion when it refused Wyne\u2019s request for a recess. But even if the court erred, Wyne invited the error of which he now complains. During trial, a defense witness failed to appear at her scheduled time of 9:00 a.m. Wyne told the court that he would exclude her as a witness if she did not arrive by 10:00 a.m. (R.6-114 at 21.) After Wyne\u2019s defense witness failed to arrive by his self-imposed deadline, the district court proceeded with the trial. Accordingly, we affirm Wyne\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
