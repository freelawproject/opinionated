He contends his within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Sarinana asserts: \u201cThe questionable pedigree of the illegal reentry guideline was a significant factor\u201d in producing a guideline range that overstated the seriousness of his offense, failed to accurately reflect his personal history and characteristics, and failed to take into account the reasons for his reentry into the United States. He also contends fast-track programs create unwarranted sentencing disparities between defendants who can avail themselves of a fast-track program and defendants, like him, who cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-26\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United, States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the guidelines is reviewed <em>de </em>novo; its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>As noted, pursuant to <em>Gall, </em>we engage in a bifurcated review of the sentence imposed by the district court. <em>United States v. Delgado-Mariinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). First, we consider whether the district court committed a \u201csignificant procedural error\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 752-53. If, as in this case, there is no such error, we then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, as noted above, for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 751-53. \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable\u201d. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">When, as here, the district court imposes a sentence within a properly-calculated guidelines range, we give \u201cgreat deference to that sentence and will infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines in light of the sentencing considerations set out in \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d. <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.) (internal quotation and citation omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 828, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). Here, the district court specifically noted it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. The district court considered Sarinana\u2019s mitigation contentions for a variance but stated that a guideline sentence was appropriate based on Sarinana\u2019s \u201cprevious criminal conduct and all other factors in [\u00a7 3553(a)]\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">Sarinana has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that applies to his within-guidelines sentence or to demonstrate that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554. Further, as he did in district court, Sarinana concedes his fast-track contention is foreclosed. \u201c[A]ny sentencing disparity resulting from fast track disposition is not unwarranted\u201d. <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1029-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
