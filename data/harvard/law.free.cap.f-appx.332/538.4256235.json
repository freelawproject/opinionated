However, Bragg asserts because he was charged with possessing only \u201ca detectable amount\u201d of cocaine, the applicable statutory maximum penalty was 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. He argues the district court, in recalculating his sentence under Amendment 706, should have realized his original sentence exceeded the statutory maximum and reduced his sentence accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">The district court properly denied \u00a7 3582 relief because Bragg\u2019s guideline range was not lowered as a result of Amendment 706, given that he was held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, and Amendment 706 only lowered base offense levels for quantities of crack cocaine less than 4.5 kilograms. <em>See James, </em>548 F.3d at 986 (holding that the defendant was not entitled to a reduction in sentence because he had been held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, and Amendment 706 did not lower his guideline range). Furthermore, Bragg\u2019s argument his sentence exceeded the statutory maximum penalty is not properly before this Court, because a \u00a7 3582 proceeding \u201cdoes not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing\u201d and \u201cdoes not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the district court properly denied the \u00a7 3582 motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
