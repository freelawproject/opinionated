If the district court erred in admitting this evidence, such error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Hawley, </em>516 F.3d 264, 267-68 (5th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 994, 173 L.Ed.2d 291 (2009). Given the testimony that Garcia Heredia was involved in the transportation of large quantities of narcotics and cash, we conclude that there is not a reasonable possibility that brief testimony regarding the false identification documents substantially influenced the jury\u2019s verdict or contributed to the conviction. <em>See Hawley, </em>516 F.3d at 267-68; <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>957 F.2d 1238, 1243-44 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Garcia Heredia also argues that the district court erred in its calculation of the applicable Sentencing Guidelines. He asserts that the district court \u201cdouble-counted\u201d his drug offenses by using them to calculate his offense level for the drug offenses, to calculate his base offense level for the money laundering conviction, and as the basis for the application of a specific offense characteristic that increased the offense level for the money laundering conviction. Review of a sentence must start with whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d including \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review a district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"AMU\">Impermissible double counting occurs when a defendant\u2019s drug counts and money laundering counts are not grouped for guidelines purposes. <em>See United States v. Rice, </em>185 F.3d 326 (5th Cir.1999). However, in the instant case, Garcia Heredia\u2019s drug and money laundering offenses were properly grouped; therefore, we conclude that there was no double counting. <em>See also United States v. Ramos, </em>\u2014 Fed.Appx. \u2014 (5th Cir.2007) (unpublished). We also conclude that the district court did not err in its guidelines calculations. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
