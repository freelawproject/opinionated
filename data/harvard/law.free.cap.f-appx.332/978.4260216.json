Andrade first argues that, as an Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \u00a7 245(i) applicant, he is exempt from INA \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I), and is thus statutorily eligible to seek adjustment of status. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Mortera-Cruz v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 246, 254-56 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-21\">Andrade additionally argues that he is statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal under INA \u00a7 240A(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l), because his 1998 encounter with immigration officials did not end his accrual of continuous physical presence. It was Andrade\u2019s burden to establish 10 years of continuous physical presence. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d). Given the lack of evidence regarding the circumstances of his 1998 departure on account of his purposeful deception, as well as his three-hour detention and questioning prior to his departure, substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s finding that Andrade did not carry his burden of proof on this issue and is thus ineligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See Garcia-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 661 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-22\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1010-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
