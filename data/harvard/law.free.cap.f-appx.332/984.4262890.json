Soto\u2019s 45-month sentence was above the advisory guidelines sentencing range of 21 to 27 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-22\">Although Soto requested that the district court \u201cconsider the least possible time,\u201d he did not raise any objection to the court\u2019s explanation of his sentence or to the procedural reasonableness of the sentence, which are the very issues he raises on appeal. Accordingly, review of Soto\u2019s claims is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 625, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>(June 24, 2009) (08-11099). To show plain error, Soto must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>error but will do so only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">We generally review sentences for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We first determine whether the sentence is procedurally unreasonable due to a procedural error \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If the sentence is procedurally reasonable, we consider whether it is substantively reasonable under \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a sentence is outside the Guidelines, we give deference to the sentencing court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify the variance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Soto contends that the sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not consider a departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 before imposing a non-guidelines variance. There is no support for his contention. In <em>United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 723 (5th Cir.2007), we rejected the defendants\u2019 contentions that their above-Guidelines sentences were unreasonable because the court did not follow \u00a7 4A1.3 of the Guidelines. We noted that <em>\u201cpost-Booker, </em>a sentencing court may impose a non-Guidelines sentence, i.e., a \u2018variance\u2019, but not a \u2018departure,\u2019 if it calculates the proper sentencing range and references the broad array of factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 721. <em>Mejiar-Huerta </em>also rejected the proposition that a sentencing court\u2019s \u201cfailure to conduct the calculus of \u00a7 4A1.3 renders a non-Guidelines sentence <em>per se </em>unreasonable.\u201d Mej<em>ia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d at 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">Soto also contends that the sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court gave an inadequate explanation of the reasons for the variance and failed to properly balance the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">The record reflects that the district court considered Soto\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to promote respect for the law and to provide deterrence against future criminal conduct and noted those factors in its Statement of Reasons. The record reflects that the district court did not give improper or undue weight to Soto\u2019s criminal history or plainly err in concluding that a sentence of 21 to 27 months of imprisonment would not satisfy the sentencing objections of \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">Soto has failed to show that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable, and he does not contend that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1016-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
