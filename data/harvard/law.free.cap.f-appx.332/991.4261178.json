Plaintiffs-Appellants asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the Americans With Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act. Approximately a year and a half after suit was filed, the district court granted summary judgment that Plaintiffs-Appellants take nothing, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-22\">On appeal, Plaintiffs-Appellants contend that they presented genuine issues of material fact sufficient to preclude a determination at the summary judgment stage that none of the defendants nor any of their agents were deliberately indifferent to the serious medical needs of the decedent while she was in jail. Our review of the record on appeal and the applicable law as presented in the briefs of the parties and the Order of the district court convince us that summary judgment dismissing the claims of Plaintiffs-Appellants was providently granted for the extensive reasons cogently presented by the district court in its Order of December 19, 2008. Accordingly, the court\u2019s Final Judgment of that date is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1023-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
