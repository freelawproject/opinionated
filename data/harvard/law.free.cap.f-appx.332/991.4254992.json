The district court dismissed Brown\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim and concluded that the complaint was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">Brown renews the allegations in his complaint on appeal, but does not challenge any of the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissal. By failing to brief any argument challenging the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissal, Brown has abandoned the only grounds for appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); Bri<em>nkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-13\">Brown\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Brown\u2019s complaint as frivolous and this court\u2019s dismissal of Brown\u2019s appeal count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Ade-pegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Brown is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-18\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1024-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
