An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied petitioner\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal and ordered petitioner removed to Colombia. He appealed the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d). The Board affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissed the appeal. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>now petitions this court for review, challenging the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Two issues are presented: whether substantial evidence supports the denial of petitioner\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal based on (1) an adverse credibility finding and, alternatively, (2) a finding that petitioner\u2019s evidence failed to show that he suffered past persecution at the hands of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) on account of his political association with the Liberal Party.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, the BIA substantially accepted the reasoning of the IJ. Accordingly, we discuss both the IJ\u2019s and the IA\u2019s decision. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">We review the IJ\u2019s findings of fact under the highly deferential substantial evidence test and \u201cmust affirm if they are supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1289-90 (11th Cir.2006). We can reverse an IJ\u2019s finding of fact \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cAn IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determinations are ... factual findings, and thus, are ... subject to the substantial evidence test, and may not be overturned unless the record compels that result.\u201d <em>Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1254 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006). \u201c[A]n adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cOnce the IJ makes an adverse credibility determination, the burden is on the alien to show that the determination was not supported by specific, cogent reasons, or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1254-55 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">In analyzing an adverse credibility finding, some circuits have held that discrepancies in the petitioner\u2019s testimony must go to the \u201cheart of the asylum claim.\u201d <em>See Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Chebchoub v. I.N.S., </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). While we have not addressed the issue in a published opinion, we need not resolve it now because the discrepancies between petitioner\u2019s hearing testimony and his documentary evidence relate to his claim that he suffered persecution on account of his association with the Liberal Party and, thus, are sufficient under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">Here, the IJ made an explicit adverse credibility finding regarding petitioner\u2019s testimony and gave specific, cogent reasons for it. The IJ relied, and the BIA affirmed his reliance, upon (1) an inconsistency between a letter from the Liberal Party, which established only that petitioner worked for the party as a sympathizer, and his testimony that he occupied a leadership position where he helped recruit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>others on behalf of the party; and (2) an inconsistency between a police report, which indicated that petitioner was pursued by the FARC because of his technical expertise, and his testimony that the FARC was interested in him because of his political activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Because a review of the record shows these significant discrepancies between petitioner\u2019s testimony and the documents he submitted, which the IJ could find were not adequately explained, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum to an alien if the. Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General determines that the alien is a refugee within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a) (42)(A). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1Y\">any person who is outside any country <em>of </em>such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving that he qualifies as a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). In order to meet this burden, \u201cthe applicant must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">An alien seeking withholding of removal must show that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in [his] country [of origin] on account of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). \u201cThe alien bears the burden of demonstrating that it is \u2018more likely than not\u2019 [he] will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to [his] country.\u201d <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006) <em>(quoting Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">To establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal, an alien must establish a nexus between a statutorily protected ground and the feared persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. An alien can meet this burden by presenting \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution on account of\u2019 such ground. <em>Id. </em>However, \u201cevidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas, or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz, 440 F.3d </em>at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">We have recognized that an alien\u2019s imputed political opinion satisfies the requirement that persecution be based on a protected ground. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1288-89. However, it is insufficient to find that a political opinion would be imputed to the refugee. <em>Id. </em>at 1289. Instead, the refugee must show persecution based specifically on the imputed political opinion, and not upon some other ground. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">The record does not compel a finding that petitioner satisfied his burden of proof for asylum or withholding of removal because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that the FARC was interested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>in petitioner for his technical expertise, rather than his political opinions or affiliations. While he claims that his father\u2019s political opinions may be imputed to him, we note that he insisted before the IJ that his asylum claim was based on facts totally unrelated to his father\u2019s claim. As a result, the IJ did not discuss his claim of imputed political opinion; neither do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-9\">. The BIA\u2019s decision included the denial of petitioner's application for relief under the Convention Against Torture. Petitioner does not challenge that ruling here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
