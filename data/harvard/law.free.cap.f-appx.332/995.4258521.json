Rowe now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence, which was based on the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019s base offense levels for crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). We review the district court\u2019s determination on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-37 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">Rowe argues that he should receive a sentencing reduction based on the amendment because his codefendants have received the same and the district court\u2019s failure to reduce his sentence created an unwarranted disparity. Rowe\u2019s presen-tence report reveals that he was held accountable \u201cfor conspiracy to possess and distribute 17.28 net kilograms of cocaine base or crack cocaine.\u201d Therefore, even applying the relevant guideline amendment, because Rowe was held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, his guidelines computation would not change, and his sentence would not be lowered. See U.S.S.G. Supp. to App\u2019x C, Amend. 706; U.S.S.G \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). Rowe has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion. See <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1027-37\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
