On appeal, Gulley assei'ts Amendment 706 has reduced his offense level from 36 to 34, and the district court should have resen-tenced him below his amended guideline range based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). In response, the government argues Gulley was originally sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment, and, therefore, was not eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-20\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2008). Section 3582(c)(2) gives federal courts the authority to consider reducing the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The commentary to the applicable guidelines policy statement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, provides that a reduction in sentence is not authorized if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 comment. (n.l (A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-22\">Gulley was originally sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment based on the fact he had four prior felony drug convictions. In <em>Williams, </em>we held a defendant who was originally sentenced based on a statutory minimum is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>not eligible for relief under Amendment 706. <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1342. Because Amendment 706 did not alter that statutory minimum, Gulley was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Moreover, Gulley\u2019s arguments with respect to <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>are foreclosed by our precedent. We have held <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009). Because the district court correctly found Gulley was not eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
