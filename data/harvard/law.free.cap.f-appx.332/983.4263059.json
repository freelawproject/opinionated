Police arrested Bates, along with Julie McCutcheon, upon responding to a call about a forgery at a Radio Shack in Lubbock. Bates argues that the officers lacked probable cause for the arrest; that the officers were not properly trained in the area of forgery; that he did not give McCutcheon permission to drive his car to the Radio Shack, as he was asleep in the vehicle; that McCutcheon gave police a false address; and that police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>arrested him for forgery before they knew about an outstanding arrest warrant from Hale County. Bates\u2019s claims are unavailing. The police report and arrest video show that when police arrived on the scene MeCutcheon implicated Bates in the forgery scheme. In separate questioning, Bates and MeCutcheon provided officers with the same address. During the course of the detention, police also discovered that Bates had an outstanding arrest warrant for burglary of a vehicle. Bates\u2019s arrest was supported by both probable cause to believe Bates was involved in the forgery offense and by the separately valid arrest warrant. <em>See Glenn v. City of Tyler, </em>242 F.3d 307, 313 (5th Cir.2001) (\u201cThe Fourth Amendment requires that an arrest be supported by a properly issued arrest warrant or probable cause.\u201d). The district court properly dismissed the complaint. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), 1915A(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1015-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
