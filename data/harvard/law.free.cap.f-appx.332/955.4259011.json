Tran argues that because he timely filed his \u00a7 212(c) waiver application, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c), the IJ and the BIA ei-red in determining that under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.31 he waived his right to \u00a7 212(c) relief. Ti-an further ai'gues that because he timely filed his application, he was entitled to a hearing on it under the rubric of pi-ocedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">Under \u00a7 1003.31(c), \u201c[i]f an application or document is not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application or document shall be deemed waived.\u201d Neither the IJ nor the BIA erred in determining that Tran failed to file his \u00a7 212(c) waiver application within the time set by the immigration judge and that, as a result, Tran waived his right to apply for \u00a7 212(e) relief. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1003.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b988-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
