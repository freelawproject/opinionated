He contends that the sentence was greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and was therefore substantially unreasonable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Specifically, Argumedo argues that the advisory guideline range was too severe because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 gives heavyweight to the defendant\u2019s prior convictions in calculating the offense level, effectively double-counting the defendant\u2019s prior convictions. He also argues that the advisory guideline range was too severe to account for his non-violent illegal reentry offense and that his motive for reentering was a factor that mitigated the seriousness of his crime. We review the \u201csubstantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">This court has rejected the argument that using a prior conviction to both increase the offense level and calculate the criminal history is impermissible \u201cdouble-counting.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court considered Argumedo\u2019s request for a sentence at the bottom of the applicable guideline range, and it ultimately determined that a sentence at the top of that range was appropriate based on the circumstances of the case and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Argume-do\u2019s assertions that the non-violent nature of his offense and his motive for reentering the United States justified a lower sentence are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As Argume-do has not demonstrated the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence at the top of the guideline range was an abuse of discretion, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b252-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
