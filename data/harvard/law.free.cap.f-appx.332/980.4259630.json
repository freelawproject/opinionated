Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Kastner argues that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing his complaint as frivolous because his case is distinguishable from <em>De-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number><em>Leon v. City of Corpus Christi, </em>488 F.3d 649, 656 (5th Cir.2007). He also argues that, because <em>DeLeon </em>is not applicable to this case, his complaint is not wholly frivolous and that the district court should have analyzed the case in accordance with Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Finally, he argues that his claims should not be barred by <em>Heck </em>because he pleaded causes of action that are \u201cconceptually distinct\u201d from the assault that resulted in the underlying order of deferred adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-23\"><em>Heck\u2019s </em>favorable termination rule requires a district court to consider \u201cwhether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\u201d 512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364. In <em>De-Leon, </em>this court concluded that a deferred adjudication order is a conviction for the purposes of <em>Heck\u2019s </em>favorable termination rule. 488 F.3d at 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-24\">Kastner argues that his case is distinguishable from <em>DeLeon </em>because he pleaded nolo contendere, which did not require him to accept responsibility for the actions alleged in the indictment. The nature of the plea underlying the deferred adjudication order is not relevant in this context. <em>See DeLeon, </em>488 F.3d at 654-56. Thus, Kastner\u2019s suit was properly subject to dismissal under <em>Heck. Id. </em>at 656. Kastner\u2019s argument that the district court should have analyzed his case in accordance with Rule 12(b)(6) is likewise without merit. <em>See Jackson v. City of Beaumont Police Dept., </em>958 F.2d 616, 619 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-25\">Moreover, despite Kastner\u2019s arguments to the contrary, his complaint does not allege claims that are \u201cconceptually distinct\u201d from the underlying assault. If Kastner prevails, he would establish that his deferred adjudication lacks any basis. Accordingly, he may not bring his claims until he satisfies the conditions of <em>Heck. See DeLeon, </em>488 F.3d at 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-21\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Kastner\u2019s complaint as frivolous. Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1012-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
