Jones requested relief based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. On appeal, Jones argues the district court erred in finding he was ineligible for a reduced sentence. Additionally, while he concedes he was sentenced as an armed career criminal, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, he contends the classification was improper. He further argues the 60-month consecutive sentence he received for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and (e) was illegal. Finally, he argues that, because the guidelines are advisory under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his sentence was unreasonable, especially in light of the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-14\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may reduce a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, state a reduction of a term of imprisonment is not authorized if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-15\">Jones\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by precedent. The district court did not have authority to reexamine Jones\u2019s status as an armed career criminal or the constitutionality of his firearm conviction. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that, except for the amended guideline range, all of the court\u2019s original sentencing determinations remain unchanged in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding). Furthermore, we recently held a defendant sentenced as an armed career criminal, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.4, is not enti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>tied to \u00a7 3582 relief. See <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>545 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir.2008) (holding the base offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 played no role in the calculation of the guideline ranges for armed career criminals, and, therefore, a reduction in the guideline range under \u00a7 2D1.1 does not affect the guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.4). Finally, <em>Booker </em>does not entitle Jones to relief. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) (holding <em>Booker </em>did not provide the district court with an independent jurisdictional basis to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
