On appeal, Roberts argues that the district court erred in refusing to consider a sentence below the amended guidelines range based on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions and questions of statutory interpretation in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), cert. <em>denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied</em>, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-18\">Application of Amendment 706 to Roberts\u2019s case shifted his guidelines range from 262 to 327 months to 210 to 262 months. He originally had been sentenced to 290 months. In his section 3582(c)(2) motion, Roberts sought a reduction\u2014 based on his post-sentencing conduct\u2014 greater than the two levels contemplated by Amendment 706; and he argued that the district court had discretion to reduce his sentence below the amended guidelines range under <em>Booker. </em>The district court determined that a sentence in the middle of the amended guidelines range was appropriate and reduced Roberts\u2019s sentence to 236 months. The court noted that it had considered the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and Roberts\u2019s post-sentencing conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-19\">We recently addressed whether <em>Booker </em>and Kimbrough<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prohibit Congress and the Sentencing Commission from limiting the extent to which a district court may reduce a sentence under section 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009). <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009). We concluded that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>did not apply to section 3582(c)(2) proceedings; a district court is bound by the limitations imposed on its discretion by section 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 1192-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-22\">In the light of our decision in Melvin, we reject Roberts\u2019s argument that the district court had the authority to reduce his sentence below the amended guidelines range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>pursuant to <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough. </em>The district court reduced Roberts\u2019s guidelines range to the extent authorized by section 3582(c)(2) and the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 policy statement and committed no resentencing error.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-11\">.
