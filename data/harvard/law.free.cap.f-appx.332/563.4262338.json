After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify an already incarcerated defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). However, \u201c[wjhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), and \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). A reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause <em>of </em>the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">The district court did not err in denying Tucker\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Tucker\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced most of the offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amends. 706, 713. Because Tucker was designated a career offender at his original sentencing, his offense level was based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). This Court concluded in <em>United States v. Moore </em>that a crack cocaine defendant, like Tucker, who was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on Amendment 706. <em>See </em>541 F.3d at 1327-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-14\">Tucker argues that he falls within an exception recognized in <em>Moore </em>because he received a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b) for overrepresented criminal history. However, Tucker\u2019s \u00a7 4A1.3(b) downward departure was to his criminal history category, not to his offense level. Thus, the possible exception discussed in <em>Moore </em>would not apply. <em>See id. </em>at 1329-30. In light of our circuit precedent, <em>see United States v. Smith, </em>289 F.3d 696, 710-711 (11th Cir.2002), Tucker\u2019s other arguments about \u00a7 4A1.3(b) horizontal departures in criminal history, which leave the career-offender offense level untouched, also lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-15\">The district court correctly concluded that it did not have authority to reduce Tucker\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-12\">. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court's conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
