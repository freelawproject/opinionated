We previously affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct appeal, rejecting, inter alia, the argument that in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court committed plain error when it found certain facts relative to sentencing. Jackson subsequently filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, which the district court denied. A judge of this court granted a certificate of appealability on one of the nine claims that Jackson sought to raise on appeal: whether counsel\u2019s failure to raise an objection to the district court\u2019s findings of drug type and quantity pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Jackson was sentenced to 168 months in prison on the drug count. That sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum of 20 years that applies when the amount of cocaine is less than 500 grams. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). In other words, Jackson\u2019s sentence did not exceed the maximum authorized by the jury verdict; thus, there was no <em>Apprendi </em>violation. <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 230, 243 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Dag-gett, </em>230 F.3d 160, 164-65 (5th Cir.2000). It follows that counsel did not render ineffective assistance by failing to raise what would have been a meritless Apprendi\u2014 based objection. <em>See United States v. Kimler, </em>167 F.3d 889, 893 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">As for any failure of counsel to preserve an objection to judicial factfinding regarding drug type and quantity in light of <em>Booker, </em>there likewise was no ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. Fields, </em>565 F.3d 290, 293-97 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1005-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
