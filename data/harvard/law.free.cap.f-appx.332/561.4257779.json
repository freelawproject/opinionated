Evans, a Florida state prisoner, pled guilty to threatening use of a weapon of mass destruction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332a(a)(3); mailing a threatening communication, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(c); and assaulting a federal officer, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a). In Evans\u2019 first appeal, we affirmed his convictions, but vacated his sentence in part. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>478 F.3d 1332, 1335-36 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">On remand, Evans was initially found incompetent to be sentenced. Based on an expert report, however, he was later found competent. At resentencing, he received concurrent terms of 75 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be served consecutive to his current Florida state prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">In this appeal, Evans argues that the district court clearly erred by finding him competent to be resentenced. Appellate review is not available, however, if a defendant waives an error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>see also United States v. Horsfall, </em>552 F.3d 1275, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2034, 173 L.Ed.2d 1120 (2009) (concluding that appellate review was unavailable because the defendant waived any challenge to an upward departure by affirmatively withdrawing his prior objection to the departure).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-15\">Here, the district court allowed defense counsel to comment on the expert report. But counsel affirmatively declined to dispute Evans\u2019 competency. Evans did not want counsel to raise the issue, and Evans considered himself competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-16\">Evans was also given an opportunity to speak at resentencing. He did not dispute his competency or counsel\u2019s waiver of the issue, and the court found him competent. Consequently, Evans waived appellate review of the district court\u2019s competency finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-17\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Evans did not waive appellate review, the district court did not clearly err by finding him competent to be resentenced. A defendant\u2019s competency \u201cis an ongoing inquiry; the defendant must be competent at all stages of trial,\u201d including sentencing. <em>United States v. Rahim, </em>431 F.3d 753, 759 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cFor a defendant to be competent ..., he must have \u2018sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding ... [and] ha[ve] a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>A defendant\u2019s competency is determined by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(d), (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Although Evans\u2019 competency was apparently a close issue, the expert concluded that Evans would be competent if he himself did not speak at his sentencing. The expert was concerned that if Evans allo-cuted, Evans would reveal his delusional beliefs. Evans, in fact, did not allocute at resentencing. He also, according to defense counsel, understood the proceedings, why he was there, and the history of his ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Moreover, the expert report itself supported the district court\u2019s finding of competency. Although it suggested that Evans believed, based on his paranoia and delusional beliefs, that he would be less likely than others to be treated fairly by the judicial system, it indicated that he understood the nature and potential consequences of the proceedings against him and the roles of the various individuals in the courtroom. A competency test also showed that Evans had little or no impairment in his understanding of legal proceedings and reasoning. Thus, a preponderance of the available evidence supports the district court\u2019s finding that Evans was competent to be resentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">After carefully reviewing the record and studying the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. We conclude that even if Evans had preserved appellate review of the district court\u2019s finding, its finding of competency is not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm Evans\u2019 75-month total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
