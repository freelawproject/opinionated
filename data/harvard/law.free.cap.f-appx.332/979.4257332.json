He argues that the sentence is greater than' necessary to meet the sentencing goals outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and specifically asserts that, in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the presumption of reasonableness does not apply to his within-guidelines sentence because the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is flawed in that it is not supported by \u201cempirical data and national experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">We have consistently rejected Enamorado\u2019s \u201cempirical data\u201d argument, concluding that <em>Kimbrough </em>does not question the presumption of reasonableness and does not require district or appellate courts to independently analyze the empirical grounding behind each individual guideline. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009), <em>pet. for cert. filed, (June </em>24, 2009) (No. 08-11099). Because the sentence imposed by the district court was within the advisory guidelines range of 57 to 71 months of imprisonment, it is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). Enamorado has not shown sufficient reason for this court to disturb that presumption. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1011-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
