The Government argues that Gray\u2019s appeal should be dismissed as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-26\">Gray\u2019s notice of appeal was due 10 days after the district court entered its order denying his motion. <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000); Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i). The district court\u2019s denial was entered on April 16, 2008; therefore, Gray had 10 days, or until April 30, 2008, to file a timely notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(2). Gray\u2019s notice of appeal was deposited for mailing, and is considered filed, on June 2, 2008. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 4(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">A district court may extend the time for filing a notice of appeal for an additional 30 days upon a finding of good cause or excusable neglect. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). In criminal cases, the filing of a notice of appeal within this additional period is usually treated \u201cas a motion for a determination as to whether excusable neglect entitled a defendant to an extension of time to appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Golding, </em>739 F.2d 183, 184 (5th Cir.1984) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, in the instant case, the additional 30 day period ended on May 30, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">As the Government has properly challenged the timeliness of Gray\u2019s notice of appeal, we must dismiss the appeal as untimely filed. <em>See United States v. Sealed Appellant, </em>304 Fed.Appx. 282, 284 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Burnley v. City of San Antonio, </em>470 F.3d 189, 192 n. 1 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b224-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
