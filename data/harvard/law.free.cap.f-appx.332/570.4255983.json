Williams\u2019 \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion was based on Amendment 599 to the Sentencing Guidelines; Amendment 599 provided that, when a defendant is being sentenced for both a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) violation of use and carrying a firearm and for the offense underlying the \u00a7 924(c) violation, the court is precluded from applying the weapons enhancement for the underlying offense. On appeal, Williams argues the district court erred in its application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when it refused to sentence him below the minimum of the amended guideline range. Williams asserts, despite the language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, which constrains the court\u2019s authority to vary from the amended range, that section, like all of the guidelines, is merely advisory under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Williams also argues the district court erred because it should have reduced his offense level of 43 to 24, not 39, because the total number of adjustments he received in the original guidelines calculations based on the firearms enhancement was 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). Similarly, we review the district court\u2019s interpretation of Amendment 599 <em>de novo. United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2003). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in \u00a7 1B1.10, state \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Williams\u2019 arguments are foreclosed by precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (holding <em>Booker </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S.Feb.10, 2009) (No. 08-8664). Moreover, the district court removed the weapons enhancement, as required by Amendment 599. Williams contention he should have received a 19-level reduction is without merit. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
