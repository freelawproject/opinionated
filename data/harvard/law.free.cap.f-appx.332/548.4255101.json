On appeal, Williams argues the district court abused its discretion because it did not resentence him at the low end of his amended guideline range, but instead let his mid-guideline-range sentence remain in effect. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-25\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We review for abuse of discretion a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>district court's decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). When considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis. \u201cInitially, the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, first determining a new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Next, the court must decide, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and in its discretion, whether it will impose the newly calculated sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">If the defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction under the first part of the analysis, the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors under the second part of the analysis, regardless of whether it ultimately denies or grants \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1257 (11th Cir.2009). Still, the district court need not specifically articulate the applicability of each factor, \u201cas long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 762 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Here, the district court first calculated Williams\u2019s amended guideline range. Williams does not challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of his amended guideline range, but, instead, argues that the district court abused its discretion during the second step of the analysis, when it determined that a mid-guideline-range sentence adequately addressed the government\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 motion. Because the record reflects that the district court took the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors into account, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining not to grant a sentence reduction. <em>See Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 762-63. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
