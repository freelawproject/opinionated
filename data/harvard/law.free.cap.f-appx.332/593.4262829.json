Harris, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> motion for relief from an allegedly void judgment, in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>employment discrimination lawsuit filed pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2, 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Harris\u2019s original complaint alleged that Corrections Corporation of America (\u201cCCA\u201d), his former employer, discriminated against him based on his race and ultimately terminated him in retaliation for filing an administrative complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. A jury found in Harris\u2019s favor on his retaliation claim, but against him on his discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The district court, however, granted judgment as a matter of law (\u201cJMOL\u201d) in favor of CCA on Harris\u2019s retaliation claim, and we affirmed this decision on direct appeal. <em>See Harris v. Corrections Corp. of Am., </em>139 Fed.Appx. 156 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(\u201cHarris </em>I\u201d). In that proceeding, Harris only raised substantive issues and did not challenge the timeliness of CCA\u2019s filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Harris then filed an initial Rule 60(b) motion <em>(\u201cHarris II\u201d), </em>alleging that CCA and the clerk\u2019s office committed fraud by misrepresenting that CCA\u2019s post-trial motion was timely filed. The district court found that the motion was timely and no fraud had been perpetrated, and we dismissed Harris\u2019s appeal as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Harris then filed his second 60(b) motion, the instant proceeding, asserting that (1) CCA\u2019s post-trial motion for JMOL in <em>Harris I </em>was untimely filed, and (2) as a result, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this motion, which rendered its grant of JMOL in favor of CCA void under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4). The district court rejected that motion for the same reasons and rationale as in <em>Harris II. </em>Harris now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Procedurally, we review application of the law of the case doctrine <em>de novo. Transamerica Leasing, Inc. v. Inst. of London Underwriters, </em>430 F.3d 1326, 1331 (11th Cir.2005). Substantively, we normally review a district court\u2019s denial of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Big Top Koolers, Inc. v. Circus-Man Snacks, Inc., </em>528 F.3d 839, 842 (11th Cir.2008). Even so, Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4) motions \u201cleave no margin for consideration of the district court\u2019s discretion\u201d and are reviewed <em>de novo. Burke v. Smith, </em>252 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2001). We \u201cmay affirm the district court\u2019s decision on any adequate ground, even if it is other than the one on which the court actually relied.\u201d <em>Smith v. Allen, </em>502 F.3d 1255, 1265 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Pursuant to the law of the case doctrine, a party may not relitigate issues that were decided in an earlier stage of the same case, whether explicitly or by necessary implication. <em>Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, </em>403 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005). We have found an implicit holding in cases where the issue in question was in some way a part of the prior proceeding. <em>Transamerica Leasing, Inc., </em>430 F.3d at 1333.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">Such a decision may only be challenged at a later time if (1) a subsequent trial produces substantially different evidence, (2) controlling authority has since made contrary decisions of law applicable to an issue, or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would work manifest injustice. <em>Jackson v. State of Ala. State Tenure Com\u2019n, </em>405 F.3d 1276, 1283 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">Rule 60(b)(4) provides that the district court may vacate a final judgment where \u201cthe judgment is void.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4). \u201cGenerally, a judgment is void under [Rule] 60(b)(4) if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.\u201d <em>Burke, </em>252 F.3d at 1263 (quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>omitted). A party may not use Rule 60 as a substitute for a timely and proper appeal, however, and may not \u201cbring up the underlying judgment for review\u201d in an appeal from the denial of Rule 60(b) relief. <em>Rice v. Ford Motor Co., </em>88 F.3d 914, 919 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Motions under Rule 60(b)(4) must be brought \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1). Nevertheless, virtually any time is \u201creasonable\u201d for challenges to void judgments under Rule 60(b)(4). <em>See Hertz Corp. v. Alamo Rent-A-Car, Inc., </em>16 F.3d 1126, 1130-31 (11th Cir.1994). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has stated, regarding a federal court\u2019s acquisition of subject-matter jurisdiction, that ... \u2018a party does not waive the requirement by failing to challenge jurisdiction early in the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ins. Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, </em>456 U.S. 694, 702, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 2104, 72 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Because the entirety of Harris\u2019s present Rule 60(b) claim \u2014 that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over CCA\u2019s post-trial motion \u2014 hinges on the timeliness of that motion, and because the district court previously found in <em>Harris II </em>that CCA\u2019s post-trial motion was timely, the district court\u2019s denial of Harris\u2019s original Rule 60(b) motion became the law of the case. Accordingly, Harris was not entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(4), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-16\">. While Harris\u2019s also raised a claim under Rule 60(b)(6) below, he does not make this argument on appeal and any claim in this respect may be deemed waived. <em>See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>257 F.3d 1249, 1255 n. 1 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\">. Harris\u2019s request for oral argument is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
