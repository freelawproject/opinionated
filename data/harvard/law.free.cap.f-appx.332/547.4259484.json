Logan argues the district court erred when it dismissed his action because it did not afford him an opportunity to show cause for his false statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-22\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (\u201cRule 11\u201d) authorizes the district court to impose sanctions if a party files pleadings that contain factual contentions that the party knows to be untrue. Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(c). Rule 11 also requires that parties engage in a reasonable inquiry to determine that the information presented to the court is true. Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(b). Rule 11 provides that the district court, on its own initiative, may require a party to \u201cshow cause\u201d why its conduct has not violated Rule 11(b). Fed.R.Civ.P.11(c)(3). We review the district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 for an abuse of discretion. <em>Attwood v. Singletary, </em>105 F.3d 610, 612 (11th Cir.1997). We have held that \u201c[d]ue process requires notice and an opportunity to respond if Rule 11 sanctions are imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613; <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P.11(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-23\">Here the record demonstrates that the district court dismissed Logan\u2019s claim without affording him an opportunity to respond to its sanction. Thus, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>that the district court abused its discretion by not affording Logan notice and an opportunity to show cause for his false filings before it sanctioned him. We vacate and remand for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
