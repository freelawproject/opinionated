Jackson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. Jackson contends that the district court erred in denying her motion because: (1) the Sentencing Commission effectively, if not expressly, reduced the base offense level applicable to her offense; and (2) the court possessed the authority under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to treat the guidelines as advisory in her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment where a defendant has been sentenced based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where a defendant\u2019s guideline range remains unchanged by Amendment 706 because her offense involved 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine, a district court is not authorized to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, Jones v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Jackson\u2019s offense involved at least 15 kilograms of crack cocaine. As a result, Amendment 706 did not lower her guidelines range and she was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l); <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369. Moreover, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>neither gave the district court authority to treat the guidelines as advisory in Jackson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>No. 08-8664 (Feb. 10, 2009), nor provided an independent jurisdictional basis for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (11th Cir.2005). The district court did not err in denying Jackson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
