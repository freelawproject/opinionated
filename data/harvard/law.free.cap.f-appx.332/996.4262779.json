California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Huerta-Ruiz has filed a response in which he argues, among other things, that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to raise objections to the enhancement of his sentence under United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Huerta-Ruiz also has filed motions requesting the appointment of substitute counsel and a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Huerta-Ruiz\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, Huerta-Ruiz\u2019s motions for the appointment of substitute counsel and a hearing are DENIED, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1028-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
