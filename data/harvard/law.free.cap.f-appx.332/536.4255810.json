The IJ found Leon-Jesus remova<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>ble based on her aggravated battery conviction and denied her application for special rule cancellation of removal under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997, Pub.L. No. 105-100, \u00a7 203(b), 111 Stat. 2160, 2198-99. After review, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">To the extent Leon-Jesus seeks review of the BIA\u2019s final removal order, the denial of her application for special rule cancellation of removal, and the denial of her motion to remand to the IJ, we lack jurisdiction to review these claims because Leon-Jesus did not petition for review within 30 days of the date of the BIA\u2019s July 28, 2008 order. <em>See </em>Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005). However, Leon-Jesus\u2019s October 23, 2008 petition for review was filed in time to confer jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s September 25, 3008 order denying Leon-Jesus\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). Our review is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (\u201cThe decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen or reconsider is within the discretion of the [BIA]....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">A properly presented motion to reconsider \u201cshall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(6), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6). However, \u201cmerely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute specifying ... errors of fact or law as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2007) (alteration in original) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">We find no abuse of discretion here. Leon-Jesus\u2019s motion for reconsideration merely reasserted her earlier argument in support of her motion to remand about her aggravated battery conviction. The only difference between the original request for remand and the motion for reconsideration was that Leon-Jesus attached additional documents to support her argument.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, we cannot say that the BIA\u2019s decision was arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">We also reject Leon-Jesus contention that the denial of her motion for reconsideration violated her due process rights. Although aliens in removal proceedings are entitled to due process protection, <em>Sebastian-Soler v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>409 F.3d 1280, 1287 n. 14 (11th Cir.2005), they \u201cdo not enjoy a constitutionally protected liberty interest in a purely discretionary form of relief,\u201d <em>Garcia v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>329 F.3d 1217, 1224 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">Accordingly, the petition for review is dismissed as to the BIA\u2019s July 28, 2008 order and denied as to the BIA\u2019s September 25, 3008 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">. Leon-Jesus does not challenge the BIA\u2019s alternative treatment of her motion to reconsider as a motion to reopen, which the BIA also denied. Accordingly, Leon-Jesus has waived any argument regarding the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that issues not argued on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
