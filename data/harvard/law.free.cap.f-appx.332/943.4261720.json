He argues that the downward variance by the district court, from a guidelines range of imprisonment of 262 to 327 months, insufficiently accounts for Gallegos\u2019s difficult childhood and continuing mental illness, and is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">In exercising its discretion, the district court appropriately considered the advisory sentencing guidelines and the sentencing factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court determined that imposition of the career offender enhancement resulted in a sentence greater than necessary to achieve the statutory purposes of punishment and that the 240-month term of imprisonment appropriately accounted for Gallegos\u2019s personal history and characteristics, as well as his criminal history. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 602. Gallegos has not shown that the district court abused its discretion or that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b976-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
