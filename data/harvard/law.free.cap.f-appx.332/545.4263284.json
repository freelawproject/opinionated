For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Velazquez-Tornet pled guilty to four counts of bringing undocumented aliens into the United States for the purpose of financial gain, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Counts Two, Four, Five, and Eight).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">The probation officer prepared a pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), where he determined that Velazquez-Tor-net had a guideline range of 12 to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, the probation officer also determined that, with respect to Counts 5 and 8, Velazquez-Tornet was subject to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment under \u00a7 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii), which became his guideline sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">Velazquez-Tornet objected to the PSI, arguing that he was entitled to a minor-role reduction and that application of the five-year statutory mandatory minimum penalty violated his equal protection and Eighth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">At sentencing, the court began by stating that it had reviewed the PSI and the objections to the PSI, at which point the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-11\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Judge, if I might. I\u2019m going to interrupt because I\u2019m withdrawing those objections. I\u2019ve spoke to [the prosecutor], and we were able to resolve them. This is going to be a real easy sentencing. There are no objections....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-13\">COURT: So the objections are withdrawn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-14\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">Defense counsel then informed the court that Velazquez-Tornet understood that he was subject to the five-year statutory mandatory minimum sentence. The court thereafter sentenced Velazquez-Tornet to 36 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts 2 and 4, and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts 5 and 8, to run concurrently. Defense counsel stated that he had no objections to the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-17\">On appeal, Velazquez-Tornet argues that the applicable five-year statutory mandatory minimum penalty violates equal protection because it makes irrational and arbitrary classifications among offenses and that it violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. However, defense counsel affirmatively and unequivocally withdrew this exact argument at sentencing. As a result, this argument is deemed waived for purposes of appeal, and we do not review it. <em>See United States v. Horsfall, </em>552 F.3d 1275, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2008) (concluding that defense counsel\u2019s affirmative withdrawal of an objection to the PSI at sentencing precluded this Court from reviewing that argument on appeal), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2034, 173 L.Ed.2d 1120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-20\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-21\">Accordingly, we affirm Velazquez-Tor-net\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
