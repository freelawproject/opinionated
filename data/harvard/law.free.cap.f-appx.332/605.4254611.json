California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Bolyard\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED. Bolyard\u2019s motion for the appointment of new counsel is DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
