Roque, Jr. appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his case for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">On August 14, 2007, Roque mailed a package to the American Red Cross Hurricane Relief Program through certified mail. After failing to receive a confirmation of delivery, Roque made several inquiries and complaints to Greg Meeks and the United States Postal Service (USPS). Ro-que contends that Meeks and the USPS were negligent in their response to his inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">On April 10, 2008, Roque submitted a letter to the USPS styled as a \u201cComplaint.\u201d Without receiving a written denial of his \u201cComplaint,\u201d Roque filed suit in federal district court on August 19, 2008. The district court dismissed the suit for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Roque timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) de novo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) requires a plaintiff to exhaust his available administrative remedies before bringing suit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If, after filing an administrative complaint, the agency fails \u201cto make final disposition of a claim within six months after it is filed,\u201d the claimant may deem such inaction to be a final denial of the claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-17\">Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Roque,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we construe his April 10, 2008 letter to constitute an administrative claim under the FTCA. However, Ro-que did not produce a written denial of his claim, nor did he wait six months before filing his complaint on August 19, 2008. Therefore, Roque failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before bringing suit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b195-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
