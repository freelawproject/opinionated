He asserts that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>erred by not reducing his sentence to the minimum of his amended guideline range. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In June 2004, Guardiola pled guilty in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida to possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(ii). The base offense level for this offense was 32, which, after a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, gave him a total offense level of 31. This offense level, in combination with his criminal history category of I, meant that his guidelines range was 108 to 135 months of imprisonment. The court sentenced him to 122 months of imprisonment, the midpoint of that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In May 2008, Guardiola filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. He asserted that this amendment lowered his total offense level to 29, which meant that he had an amended guidelines range of 87 to 108 months of imprisonment. The government filed a response agreeing with Guardiola\u2019s contention that he was eligible for a sentence reduction and suggesting that 97 months of imprisonment, a figure at the midpoint of his amended guidelines range, would be appropriate. Guardiola subsequently filed two supplements to his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, one <em>pro se </em>and one through counsel, noting that the guidelines were now advisory, describing his post-conviction conduct, and encouraging the court to sentence him to 87 months, the low end of his amended guidelines range. In October 2008, the district court ordered that Guardiola\u2019s sentence be reduced to 97 months of imprisonment. Guardiola appealed this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">On appeal, Guardiola argues that the district court erred by denying his request for a sentence at the low end of his amended guidelines range. He maintains that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rendered the guidelines advisory and, as a result, he was eligible for the requested sentence reduction in light of the factors identified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He asserts that his sentence is unreasonable because the court treated the guidelines as mandatory and failed to address the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In addition, Guardiola maintains that the district court should have addressed the disparity between crack and powder cocaine discussed in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), in determining his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). The ultimate decision regarding whether to grant or deny a sentence reduction is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">In addressing a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must perform a two-step analysis. First, it must recalculate the defendant\u2019s sentence by determining the amended guidelines range that would have applied to the defendant if the current guidelines had been in effect at the time he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>was originally sentenced. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Next, the court must decide whether to impose this newly calculated sentence or retain the original sentence, a decision left to the court\u2019s discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 781. As part of this second step, the district court must consider the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a), regardless of whether it ultimately chooses to grant or deny \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1257 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). The district court need not specifically articulate the applicability of each factor, though the record taken as a whole must demonstrate that it took those factors into account. <em>See United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The parties do not dispute that the district court had the authority to lower Guardiola\u2019s sentence to a figure within the amended guidelines range. Furthermore, to the extent that Guardiola seeks to invoke <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>to justify a sentence reduction, we have deemed both of those decisions inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009). The only relevant question is therefore whether the district court abused its discretion by failing to take into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">In its sentence reduction order, the court did not explicitly state that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; however, it described the pleadings relating to the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and noted that it \u201cha[d] considered such motion.\u201d Rl-114. Guardiola\u2019s pleadings relating to the motion discussed various circumstances specifically tied to \u00a7 3553(a) that he urged the court to take into account, including the crack/powder disparity for the \u00a7 3553(a) analysis and the need for sentences to be no greater than necessary. The government\u2019s response stated that the court could reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only after looking at the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court\u2019s statement that it had considered the motion implies that it mulled over the arguments contained in those documents before reducing Guardiola\u2019s sentence and therefore provides sufficient indication that the court took into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in addressing his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d at 1322-23 (finding that the record demonstrated that the district court took into account the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors when the court briefly stated that it had reviewed the government\u2019s brief, which had set out the pertinent factors and enumerated facts relevant to the factors). Since Guardiola\u2019s sentence was also within the amended guidelines range, the district court did not abuse its discretion in reducing his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">Guardiola appeals the district court\u2019s order reducing his sentence to 97 months of imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The court\u2019s order indicates that it took into account the factors articulated in \u00a7 3553(a), and Guardiola\u2019s arguments relating to <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>are inapplicable in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. We therefore AFFIRM the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
