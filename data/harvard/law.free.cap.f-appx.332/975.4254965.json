The magistrate judge prepared a thorough and convincing Report and Recommendation, suggesting that the decision of the Commissioner be affirmed and that the complaint be dismissed. The district court agreed and entered judgment accordingly; Louviere appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-22\">It is doubtful that, in her short brief, Louviere \u2014 even given the extra latitude we accord <em>pro se </em>litigants \u2014 has presented her issues on appeal with sufficient argument to comply with the applicable rules. She gives a one-page \u201cStatement of the Case\u201d in which she states her claimed disability and inability to find work. She presents no argument as such but states the following as her \u201cSummary of Argument\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-23\">In summary one of your own doctors, Dr. Galloway, has stated that he finds me to be disabled. I am requesting that the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals helps me by reversing Judge Astrue\u2019s decision and Gran[t] me disability compensation, and con[]sider me disabled!)] See attached ex[h]ibit showin[g] degenerative disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-24\">Assuming, only for the sake of argument, that the foregoing is sufficient to raise the issue of whether and how the district court or the Commissioner erred, we find no error. The judgment denying relief is AFFIRMED, essentially for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>reasons given by the magistrate judge and adopted by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1007-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
