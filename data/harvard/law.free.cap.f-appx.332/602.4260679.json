Jorandby and Jon May. In his complaint, Burns alleged that Jorandby and May represented him in his 1980 direct criminal appeal and 1982 federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus without first having been formally appointed by the courts to do so, thereby violating his constitutional right to counsel. The district court dismissed his complaint for failure to state a claim, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), viewing the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1489-90 (11th Cir.1997). In an <em>in forma pauperis </em>proceeding, the district court shall dismiss the case at any time if it determines that the action fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). The plaintiffs complaint should be liberally construed and \u201cshould not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Mashburn, </em>746 F.2d 782, 784 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Upon careful review of the record and upon consideration of Burns\u2019s brief, we discern no reversible error. Section 1983 requires the defendant to have acted \u201cunder color of state law.\u201d <em>Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 315, 102 S.Ct. 445, 448, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981). \u201c[A] public defender does not act under color of state law when performing a lawyer\u2019s traditional functions as counsel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325, 102 S.Ct. at 453; <em>see also Wahl v. McIver, </em>773 F.2d 1169, 1173 (11th Cir.1985). The Complaint alleges that Jorandby and May violated Burn\u2019s rights during their representation of him. Therefore, taking the allegations in his complaint as true, neither defendant was acting under color of state law, and neither may be sued under section 1983. Therefore, Burns failed to state a claim against either Jorandby or May.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\">. Burns further contends that the district court erred in finding his complaint barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and by the four-year statute of limitations. Because we hold that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted, we do not address Burns's remaining arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
