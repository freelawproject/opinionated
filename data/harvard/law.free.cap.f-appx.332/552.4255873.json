On appeal, Smith acknowledges that he was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, but contends that he was nevertheless eligible for a sentence reduction in light of Amendment 706. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-16\">\u201cIn a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines\u201d as well as all \u201cquestions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-21\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the sentence of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In <em>Moore, </em>we held that, if the defendant was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 and the range was not affected by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, then his sentence is not \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\u201d 541 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>1327-28. We have also held that a defendant is not entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction by virtue of the advisory nature of the guidelines. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">There is no merit to Smith\u2019s argument that the district court incorrectly determined that it was not authorized to reduce Smith\u2019s sentence. First, just as in <em>Moore, </em>Smith\u2019s sentencing range was determined by his career-offender status under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and his crack cocaine base offense level played no role in his ultimate sentence. Thus, Smith was not sentenced under the otherwise applicable base offense level set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, and he is ineligible for relief under Amendment 706. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28, 1330; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n. 1(A)) (prohibiting reduction where \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline\u201d). Second, the district court did not have authority to reduce Smith\u2019s sentence by virtue of the advisory nature of the guidelines. <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369. Third, because Smith\u2019s guideline range did not change, the court was not required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cGiven that [defendant\u2019s] sentencing range did not change, the district court correctly recognized that it had no authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence and that it did not need to examine the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d). Finally, to the extent Smith contends that his sentence was unreasonable, his argument is outside the scope of the present \u00a7 3582 proceeding. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (limiting proceedings under this statute to cases where a retroactive amendment affects the applicable guideline range).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
