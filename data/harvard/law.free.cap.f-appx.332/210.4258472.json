He also argued that certain of the Board\u2019s practices amounted to a denial of due process, including: failing to supply evidence or a reasoned argument to support its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>denials, omitting a signature at the end of letters denying release, using boilerplate language, and failing to use a state seal or letterhead. Betts also challenged the Board\u2019s alleged practice of cancelling work-time credits if release to mandatory supervision was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The district court found that Betts had failed to state a claim. The district court determined that the defendants were entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity from claims against them in their official capacities, found that the Board\u2019s practices did not violate the Due Process Clause, and rejected the claim that work credits have a separate statutory basis from good conduct credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">On appeal, Betts has not addressed the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his complaint. Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Ker-ner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Failure to identify an error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if Betts had not appealed the judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Several of Betts\u2019s appellate arguments appear to be raised for the first time on appeal. Assuming that any of these arguments could constitute a cognizable claim for relief, this court will not consider claims raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Stewart Glass &amp; Mirror, Inc. v. U.S. Auto Glass Discount Centers, Inc., </em>200 F.3d 307, 316-17 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">To the extent Betts is requesting the appointment of counsel, such motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
