Defendant was charged and subsequently indicted for trafficking in 400 or more grams of cocaine by transportation and trafficking in 400 or more grams of cocaine by possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   These matters came for hearing at the 12 January 2004 criminal session of Mecklenburg County Superior Court with the Honorable Robert P. Johnston presiding. At trial, the State introduced expert testimony by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department Crime Lab supervising chemist Tony Aldridge. Aldridge's testimony was based on the test results of Willie Rose, a Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department Crime Lab chemist. Rose analyzed the contents of both the pellet and two packages seized from defendant's shoes. The results of Rose's tests consisting of two Crime Laboratory Reports, indicated that the substance in the two shoe packets was \"Cocaine, 735.86 grams,\" and that the substance in the pellet was \"Cocaine, 7.53 grams.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before trial, Rose relocated and was not available to testify. Aldridge testified it was the regular practice of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department Crime Lab Chemistry section to make and keep Crime Laboratory Reports of the type written by Rose. Over defendant's objection, the trial court allowed the Crime Laboratory Reports to be received into evidence under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 803(6) (Rule 803(6)), the business records exception to the hearsay rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant was found guilty as charged on 14 January 2004. The trial court ordered the convictions consolidated for judgment and sentenced defendant to 175-219 months imprisonment and imposed a mandatory fine of $250,000.00. Defendant appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The issues on appeal are whether the trial court erred in: (I) admitting into evidence the Crime Laboratory Reports prepared by a non-testifying chemist, and in admitting the expert testimony of a chemist whose opinion was based on the analysis of the non-testifying chemist; (II) admitting evidence regarding defendant's exercise of his right to remain silent; and (III) admitting evidence that a co-defendant was also charged in connection with the search and seizure at the airport which resulted in defendant's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant asserts the trial court erred by admitting into evidence the Crime Laboratory Reports under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, arguing the reports were inadmissible hearsay, and that admission of the reports and testimony of Aldridge were in violation of the rules of evidence and the Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution. The State argues the reports were properly admitted as business records under Rule 803(6). We conclude,\n   however, the reports were properly admitted as the basis of the expert opinion given by Aldridge\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Our Supreme Court has considered the admissibility of the basis of an expert opinion:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to him at or before the hearing.

Aldridge then testified that, in his expert opinion, based on his review of Rose's findings, both packets and the pellet tested positive for cocaine. The reports themselves were properly admitted as the basis of Aldridge's opinion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, Aldridge testified that the methods employed by Rose were those reasonably relied upon by other forensic chemists, that Aldridge had actually calibrated Rose's machines, used the same machines for similar experiments, and reviewed Rose's work after the analysis was completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As our Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    State v. Daughtry,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"790245\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/340/488/#p511\">\n    340 N.C. 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 511,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=459%20S.E.2d%20747\">\n    459 S.E.2d 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 758 (1995), \"inherently reliable information is admissible to show the basis of an expert's opinion, even if the information would otherwise be inadmissible hearsay.\" There is no evidence in the instant case\n   suggesting the information contained in Rose's test results was not inherently reliable. During\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   and during the trial, Aldridge testified about the types of tests Rose performed on the packages, how those tests were conducted, and how Aldridge reviewed the results of those tests. Those results were used by Aldridge in forming his expert opinion and were admissible at trial to show the basis of that opinion. Further, there was no Confrontation Clause violation where, as here, the expert was available for cross-examination. \"The admission into evidence of expert opinion based upon information not itself admissible into evidence does not violate the Sixth Amendment guarantee of the right of an accused to confront his accusers where the expert is available for cross-examination.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In fact, defendant's entire cross-examination centered on the fact that Aldridge reviewed the test results of another analyst and did not perform the tests himself. As a result, any credibility issues regarding the basis of Aldridge's expert opinion testimony were thoroughly explored before the jury. We hold that defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront his accusers was not violated by the admission of Rose's Criminal Laboratory Reports or Aldridge's expert opinion testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant next argues the trial court committed plain error by allowing into evidence testimony regarding defendant's exercise of his right to remain silent\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   . Specifically, defendant points our attention to the testimony of Detective James Kolbay of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department that defendant was quiet during questioning and often would not respond to questions. Defendant also argues the prosecutor's reference to this testimony during closing arguments constituted plain error\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plain error is error so fundamental as to amount to a miscarriage of justice, or error that probably resulted in the jury reaching a different verdict than it otherwise would have reached.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The appellate court must be convinced that, absent the error, the jury probably would have reached a different result.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., State v. Walker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4696125\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/316/33/\">\n    316 N.C. 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=340%20S.E.2d%2080\">\n    340 S.E.2d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986) (holding cross-examination of a defendant about his silence after he was arrested and advised of his constitutional rights was not plain error).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The transcript reveals that Detective Kolbay was not questioned regarding defendant's exercise of his right to remain silent. Instead, Detective Kolbay was asked about defendant's demeanor during questioning. Detective Kolbay testified that defendant waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and agreed to speak with him. He testified that defendant was never upset during questioning, only quiet and slightly unresponsive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   During closing argument, the prosecutor mentioned that defendant did not answer some of Detective Kolbay's questions and did not react when the drugs were found on his person. Defendant specifically draws the court's attention to the following remarks of the prosecutor during closing argument:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Well, you know, maybe you heard Detective Kolbay say the co-defendant was crying, that was his demeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Well, the Defendant did not show any emotion. He was not upset like the co-defendant was\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   First of all, no eye contact with Inspector Knight-Norwood. Defense Counsel asked wasn't it normal for someone to be nervous when you're being interviewed by Customs?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   You're not nervous, if you're not trying to hide anything. Sure he was nervous, he had 738 grams of cocaine in his shoes. He had a pellet, 7.5 grams in his stomach. Yes, he was nervous. No eye contact. How about no reaction when it was found?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Now, as far as knowingly, again, we're not able to prove that the Defendant said yes, I knew it was there, and I knew it was cocaine. And that is not what we're required to prove\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Rarely are you going to have a Defendant who stands up and says, I knew it was cocaine, I knew I had it. That would be direct evidence of knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Circumstantial evidence of knowledge, all the things we just mentioned. I ask you to consider those, and find circumstantial evidence can support he knowingly possessed, and he knowingly transported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   These closing statements do not amount to an impermissible comment on defendant's right to remain silent. Moreover, given the evidence before the jury, we cannot say the jury would likely have reached a different result had Detective Kolbay's testimony and the prosecutor's closing statements regarding defendant's demeanor not been allowed. The trial court did not commit plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, defendant argues the trial court committed plain error by admitting evidence that co-defendant Marcus McCoy was also charged as a result of the seizure at the airport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Evidence of convictions, guilty pleas, and pleas of nolo-contendere of non-testifying co-defendants is inadmissible unless offered for some legitimate purpose.\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, this error did not amount to plain error . . . Detective Bowes testified that the charges were still pending against Mr. Harris and thus, there was no testimony that Mr. Harris had been found guilty, pleaded guilty, or pleaded nolo contendere to the charges.

As a result, the admission of testimony involving the co-defendant, while error, does not rise to the level of plain error.
