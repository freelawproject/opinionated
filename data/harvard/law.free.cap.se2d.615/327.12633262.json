We find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant, twenty-nine years old, and Danielle Edsel (\"Edsel\"), seventeen years old, were dating in February 2003. Triplett operated Wood's Grocery Store (\"Wood's\") and lived in a house next door. Triplett had known Edsel since she was a child and allowed her to live in a small apartment in the back of Wood's Grocery. He also gave her money and food and permitted her to use his bathroom when those at Wood's were not working. Edsel also occasionally worked for Triplett at Wood's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State's evidence tended to show that defendant and Edsel were seeking money. They discussed robbing Ruth's, where Edsel formerly worked. However, on the day they planned to rob Ruth's, bad weather had forced Ruth's to close early and they could not get inside the store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant and Edsel next planned to rob Triplett. They discussed several options to steal Triplett's money. The first option involved Edsel seducing Triplett, tying him to the bed, then forcing him to tell them where he kept his money. However, they determined that plan would allow Triplett to identify both of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The next plan involved Edsel knocking Triplett out at his house with defendant coming in and killing him. However, Edsel later determined that she would kill Triplett, so defendant would not \"be the one to live with it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the evening of 16 February 2003, Edsel approached Triplett as he was working at Wood's and asked if she could use his bathroom. He agreed and the two walked from Wood's to Triplett's house. Triplett cooked dinner while Edsel showered. The two ate together, drank liquor, and watched television. Triplett asked Edsel if she wanted to spend the night. She agreed and Triplett left the house to move Edsel's car behind Wood's. After Triplett left, Edsel called defendant and asked him to come over to complete the robbery. When defendant hesitated, Edsel told him to \"never mind,\" that she would call him later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Triplett returned home after moving Edsel's car and the two talked for a while. At about 11:00 p.m., Triplett heard someone knocking on the door and went to answer it. Edsel, believing defendant was at the door, panicked and grabbed a gun she had hidden underneath the sofa. She aimed and shot Triplett in the back of the head. Triplett\n   was knocked unconscious by the bullet and collapsed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant came inside Triplett's house and began searching for money. He went to Triplett's room and discovered another gun, which he stole. Edsel and defendant also grabbed some jewelry and another gun. Edsel checked Triplett and determined he was still alive. She was about to shoot him again when defendant stopped her. As Triplett regained consciousness, defendant and Edsel told him that someone had hit him on the head. Defendant advised Triplett to go to the hospital, but he refused. Edsel and defendant asked Triplett where he kept his money. Triplett claimed his niece held it all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant stayed with Triplett while Edsel went to Wood's to look for money. She broke open video poker machines and stole all of the quarters, but could not find additional cash. Edsel returned to Triplett's house and she and defendant attempted to cut the phone lines to Triplett's house. Defendant then left to search Wood's for money. Triplett still refused to go to the hospital. Edsel walked out of Triplett's house for a moment to get away from him. Triplett locked Edsel out of the house and called the police and his sister. Defendant returned to the house and he and Edsel asked Triplett to let them back inside. Triplett refused and informed them that he had called the police and his sister.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant and Edsel returned to Wood's. Defendant broke open another video poker machine, stole cigarettes, and other items. They gathered the stolen goods into several bags and placed them inside Edsel's car. Both entered the vehicle, which they started to defrost the windows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Wilkes County Sheriff's deputies were dispatched to Triplett's house in response to the 911 call. They arrived and saw Edsel's car parked behind Wood's. Triplett told the deputies that someone had knocked him unconscious. When he regained consciousness, he observed defendant and Edsel going through his things. The deputies approached Edsel's car and asked Edsel if they could search the vehicle. Edsel consented to the search. The deputies recovered two guns, a large quantity of cigarette cartons, bags of jewelry, and cash. When asked about these items, defendant and Edsel responded that they did not know how the items got into the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Triplett was taken to Wilkes Regional Medical Center and was treated for a gunshot wound to the head. The bullet fractured Triplett's skull and he was transferred to Baptist Hospital in Winston-Salem. He underwent neurosurgery to treat the gunshot wound and skull fracture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On 14 April 2003 and 8 December 2003, the grand jury of Wilkes County returned true bills of indictment against defendant for: (1) assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury; (2) felonious breaking and entering; (3) felonious larceny; (4) robbery with a dangerous weapon against Triplett; (5) felonious conspiracy to commit first-degree murder under the felony murder rule; (6) felonious conspiracy to commit robbery against Ruth's; (7) felonious conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon against Triplett; and (8) attempted murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    A. Defendant's Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant was tried by a jury during the 12 January 2004 Criminal Session of Wilkes County. Defendant offered evidence from a fellow inmate of Edsel that she had planned the entire event and intended on having sex with Triplett in exchange for money. This testimony tended to show that after Edsel engaged in sexual intercourse, Triplett did not pay her and she shot him. The fellow inmate also testified Edsel stated she did not contact or involve defendant until after she had shot Triplett. Defendant did not testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    B. Verdict and Sentence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On 16 January 2004, the jury found defendant to be guilty of all charges. The trial court arrested judgment on the charge of conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon (03 CRS 50657) and consolidated the verdicts for the charges of felonious larceny (03 CRS 50656) and felonious breaking and entering (03 CRS 50656). During sentencing, defendant was found to have a prior record level of III. Defendant was sentenced in the presumptive range for all charges, the following to run consecutively: (1) 220 months minimum to 273 months maximum\n   for attempted murder; (2) 116 months minimum to 149 months maximum for assault; (3) 220 months minimum to 273 months maximum for conspiracy to commit murder; (4) 103 months minimum to 133 months maximum for armed robbery; and (5) ten months minimum to twelve months maximum for breaking and entering. Defendant was also sentenced for a concurrent term of ten months minimum to twelve maximum for conspiracy to commit robbery. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant argues: (1) the trial court erred in admitting into evidence letters written between defendant and Edsel; (2) the trial court erred in posing a question to a defense witness; (3) he was improperly charged for conspiracy to commit felony murder; and (4) defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    III. Admissibility of Letters\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court committed plain error by failing to edit or redact highly prejudicial portions from letters written by defendant and Edsel and later admitted into evidence at trial. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    A. Preservation of Potential Error for Appellate Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Rule 10(b)(1) of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure requires:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In order to preserve a question for appellate review, a party must have presented to the trial court a timely request, objection or motion, stating the specific grounds for the ruling the party desired the court to make if the specific grounds were not apparent from the context. It is also necessary for the complaining party to obtain a ruling upon the party's request, objection or motion. Any such question which was properly preserved for review by action of counsel taken during the course of proceedings in the trial tribunal by objection noted or which by rule or law was deemed preserved or taken without any such action, may be made the basis of an assignment of error in the record on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   N.C.R.App. P. 10(b)(1) (2004). Assignments of error are generally not considered on appellate review unless an appropriate and timely objection was entered.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1446(a) (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Our review of the transcripts and record fails to show that defendant moved to redact portions of or exclude the letters or made a timely and specific objection when the State proffered the letters and Edsel's corroborating testimony into evidence. Defendant had access to the letters prior to trial, knew the State intended to introduce them, but failed to request the trial court to edit the allegedly prejudicial portions. Under Rule 10(b)(1), defendant failed to preserve this assignment of error for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    B. Plain Error Rule\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Our Supreme Court adopted the plain error rule as an exception to Rule 10 in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defense rebutted with witness Joshua Curry, who testified that he and Defendant tended bar together the night before the alleged crimes, when it had been fifty-cent beer night. Joshua Curry testified that customers left quarters as tips. After testifying that he and Defendant split the quarters in the tip jar in half, the trial court then asked:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Trial Court: What do you do with your quarters when you get them?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Joshua Curry: Cash them in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Trial Court: For dollars?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Joshua Curry: Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Trial Court: You carry them for 48 hours in your pocket if there are 80 quarters?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Joshua Curry: He left early that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The trial court's questions here do not clarify confusing or contradictory testimony. While we have only the benefit of the cold record to review this exchange, it is logical to conclude that the questioning, particularly \"You carry them for 48 hours in your pocket if there are 80 quarters?\" with voice inflections, may have come uncomfortably close to an opinion as to the credibility of the witness's testimony. As this Court has made clear,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Trial judges are prohibited from expressing an opinion by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1222 (1978). They must be careful in what they say and do because a jury looks to the court for guidance and picks up the slightest intimation of an opinion.
