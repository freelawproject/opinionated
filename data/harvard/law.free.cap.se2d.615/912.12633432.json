We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The relevant facts are largely undisputed, and are summarized as follows: Plaintiff was born in 1934, and was 68 years old at the time of the hearing before the Industrial Commission. He was employed by defendant for twenty nine years, from 1972 to 2001. In October 1999 plaintiff suffered an injury to his right knee, which defendant accepted as compensable by filing an Industrial Commission Form 60. In January 2000, plaintiff underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. He received disability compensation from 17 January 2000 through 15 March 2000, the period of disability associated with his surgery. Plaintiff returned to work in March 2000, and worked for defendant until March 2001. After his return to work, plaintiff continued to experience problems with his right knee; additionally, the injury to his right knee aggravated a preexisting injury to his left knee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In February of 2001 plaintiff's supervisor, Ed Nicholson, met with plaintiff and informed him that plaintiff's job was being eliminated effective 3 March 2001, and that he would not be offered a replacement position. Nicholson also gave plaintiff a Severance Agreement, setting out the details of plaintiff's job termination, including a statement that \"[y]ou have 29 years of service and according to the schedule above will be entitled to 10 months pay, beginning 3-1-01, your termination date.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff started receiving severance pay 1 March 2001, when his position was terminated, and continued to receive severance pay through 31 December 2001, the official date of his retirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 18 June 2001 plaintiff had knee replacement surgery on his right knee. Plaintiff became disabled as a result of the surgery and associated complications, and filed an Industrial Commission Form 18 seeking disability benefits. Plaintiff and defendant were unable to agree on plaintiff's compensation, and on 9 September 2002 plaintiff filed an Industrial Commission Form 33 requesting a hearing. Following a hearing, Industrial Commission Deputy Commissioner Theresa Stephenson issued an Opinion and Award concluding, in pertinent part, that \"Defendant is entitled to a credit for ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   amounts paid to plaintiff pursuant to the severance package from 18 June 2001 through 31 December 2001.\" Both parties appealed to the Full Commission, which affirmed the Deputy Commissioner in an Opinion and Award issued 13 July 2004. Plaintiff appeals from this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"This Court's review is limited to a determination of (1) whether the Commission's findings of fact are supported by competent evidence, and (2) whether the Commissioner's conclusions of law are supported by the findings of fact.

On 1 February 2001 defendant notified plaintiff his job was eliminated due to company downsizing. Plaintiff received salary continuation, which was not offered to all employees affected by the downsizing. The reason plaintiff received this continuation was in appreciation of his years of service to the company. It was not part of plaintiff's employment contract. Plaintiff received this full salary continuation through 31 December 2001. Plaintiff's resignation officially became effective on 1 January 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   12. Plaintiff has been disabled since the right knee replacement surgery performed on 18 June 2001 and [is] unable to work. The full salary continuation he received from 18 June 2001 through 30 December 2001 was not due and payable at the time he received it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   14. When plaintiff's salary continuation ended on 31 December 2001, defendant reinstated total disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Based on these and other findings of fact, the Commission concluded in part that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   7. Defendant is entitled to a credit for amounts paid to plaintiff as a severance package for the period 18 June 2001 through 31 December 2001.

Under this severance package, how do you determine the amount that is payable to an employee whose job is terminated[?]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   A. Well, we put a chart together, as far as years of service goes. And then, we provided months of separation based on their years of service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Q.

Is it a function of the employee's health condition?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A. No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Q. Is it a function of the employee's ability to work with Dana Corporation because of a health condition?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A. No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Q. Okay. Interrogatory number four asked for you to identify all qualifying events for which Dana Corporation employees could become entitled to the separation pay that was paid to Mr. Meares. Is that correct?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Q. And what are - or give me a description of all the qualifying events, as you put forth in that answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   A. I answered that an employee would become entitled to separation pay due\n   to plant closings, layoffs, workforce reductions or job elimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Q. Those are all the qualifying events?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   A. As I determined, yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Q. Disability is not one of those qualifying events, is it?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   A. That's right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Q. So, the severance package does not compensate an employee for disability. Is that right?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A. That's right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We also note that, in response to plaintiff's request for a hearing, defendants filed Industrial Commission Form 33R, stating in relevant part that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The employee-plaintiff received a severance package after March 1, 2001, that was on a contractual obligated benefit. The employee-plaintiff was not disabled under the Workers' Compensation Act and rather, the time period he was out of work from March 1, 2001, through December 31, 2001, was due to economic circumstances of the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We conclude that the record contains no evidence that plaintiff's severance pay was in any way associated with his injury, disability, or workers' compensation claim. Defendant's severance agreement contains no indication that severance pay was part of a disability insurance plan or disability wage-replacement plan, or that it might be paid to compensate plaintiff for injury or disability. And, it is undisputed that plaintiff's severance pay began several months before his disabling surgery, and was calculated on the basis of his years of service to the company. The record evidence all suggests that plaintiff's severance pay had nothing to do with workers' compensation, and that he would have received the same amount of severance pay for the same duration if he had not been disabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendants, however, argue that \"the determinative issue is not whether the Plaintiff was compensated for his disability,\" and that \"[t]he court does not need to make a finding that the payment was tantamount to workers' compensation or that the benefits compensated him for his disability.\" Defendant cites no authority for this assertion, and relevant jurisprudence suggests otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See Rice v. City of Winston-Salem,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9251694\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/154/680/#p684\">\n    154 N.C.App. 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 684-85,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=572%20S.E.2d%20794\">\n    572 S.E.2d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 798 (2002):\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The issue remaining in this case is whether defendant's payments to plaintiff ... constituted a wage replacement program such that it ... could form the basis of an offset against workers' compensation benefits.... [I]n\n   <em>\n    Evans,\n   </em>\n   payments for which an employer was seeking an offset were made pursuant to the employer's sickness and accident disability plan. That plan allowed for payments regardless of the cause of an employee's injury, and `operate[d] as a wage replacement program['] [that was] tantamount to workers' compensation.[] Therefore, the Court held the employer was entitled to an offset as was necessary to avoid duplicative payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Evans v. AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2505309\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/332/78/\">\n    332 N.C. 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -79, 85,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=418%20S.E.2d%20503\">\n    418 S.E.2d 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -04, 508 (1992)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendants also attach great significance to (1) whether other employees were also offered severance pay, and (2) whether or not the Severance Agreement was an enforceable contract. Regarding the job classification, or the number, of other employees receiving severance pay, we conclude this issue is not germane to whether plaintiff's severance pay was tantamount to workers' compensation disability compensation and could properly be credited against defendants' workers' compensation obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   We conclude further that the enforceability of the Severance Agreement as a contract was not before the Commission. Moreover, with respect to this conclusion, defendant essentially argues that it is entitled to a credit for any and all monies paid to plaintiff unless plaintiff proves that a payment was made pursuant to a written contract which would be enforceable in a civil suit. However, defendant cites no authority for such an expansive reading of G.S. \u00a7 97-42, and \"[i]n North Carolina, this section has been held not to apply to fringe benefits or to insurance proceeds that are of a contractual nature rather than proceeds that are grounded in the workers' compensation law.\"\n   <em>\n    Moretz,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4695872\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/316/539/#p541\">\n    316 N.C. at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=342%20S.E.2d%20844\">\n    342 S.E.2d at 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation\n   omitted). Plaintiff's severance pay clearly was \"of a contractual nature\"; it was paid pursuant to a written Severance Agreement and was calculated solely by reference to his years of employment with defendant. As discussed above, \"payments ... are `due and payable' when made ... [if] they have been earned by the employee and are not solely under the control of the employer.\"\n   <em>\n    Christopher,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11438283\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/145/427/#p429\">\n    145 N.C.App. at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=550%20S.E.2d%20256\">\n    550 S.E.2d at 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   We conclude (1) that plaintiff's severance pay was an earned benefit of a contractual nature, which was due and payable when received, and (2) that plaintiff's severance pay was not compensation for his disability.
