For the reasons discussed herein, we hold that defendant received a trial free of prejudicial error in part, but we reverse defendant's conviction for robbery with a dangerous weapon, remand the case for entry of judgment on the offense of common law robbery, and vacate defendant's convictions for obtaining habitual felon and violent habitual felon status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State's evidence presented at trial tends to show the following: On 28 June 2003, Geraldine MacQueen (\"MacQueen\") was attending a family reunion in Asheville, North Carolina. As she was returning to her room at the Days Inn, MacQueen entered an elevator with defendant, who began talking to her. Defendant and MacQueen rode the elevator to the fifth floor, where MacQueen's room was located. Defendant followed MacQueen to her room, and as MacQueen opened the door to the room, defendant pushed her inside. MacQueen turned and saw defendant standing in her room, and she \"screamed and screamed, hoping some of [her] family would hear [her].\" Defendant told MacQueen to \"shut up[,]\" that he \"just wanted [her] money[,]\" and that \"if [she] didn't shut up he would kill\" her. Defendant then put his hands on MacQueen's neck and \"squeezed and twisted\" it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After she \"somehow or other . . . got him to stop[,]\" MacQueen located her purse and gave defendant $300.00 in cash. Defendant thereafter attacked MacQueen again, hitting her in the cheek with his fists. After defendant forced MacQueen to the floor, he repeatedly kicked her and began dragging her toward the bathroom. MacQueen believed defendant was going to \"hit [her] head on the tile floor and [she] was going to be dead.\" Instead, defendant grabbed MacQueen by the hair and \"pounded\" her head against the wall until she lost consciousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   MacQueen was transported to a local hospital for treatment of her injuries. As a result of the attack, MacQueen was hospitalized for several days and suffered recurring nausea and vertigo. She experienced a \"total loss of balance[,]\" and she was unable to stand up or walk any distance. At trial, MacQueen testified that she had lost the full range of motion of her neck, continued to have problems with her balance, and continued to experience lightheadedness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Asheville Police Department Detective Wayne Welch (\"Detective Welch\") and Sergeant Daryl Fisher (\"Sergeant Fisher\") investigated the attack. Detective Welch and Sergeant Fisher interviewed MacQueen and her family members, and they reviewed security camera footage from the Days Inn. The videotape footage depicted defendant following MacQueen into the elevator shortly before the attack. The footage also showed defendant checking into the Days Inn. Detective Welch and Sergeant Fisher showed the videotape to another occupant of the hotel, who informed the officers that the individual on the videotape had approached his room the night before asking for money. The occupant told the officers that the individual was staying in Room 505. According to hotel records, defendant was registered to Room 505 the night before MacQueen was attacked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant and his wife were subsequently located, taken into custody, and transported to the Asheville Criminal Investigation Division for questioning. Defendant thereafter confessed to taking money from MacQueen. According to Detective Welch and Sergeant Fisher, defendant did not remember kicking MacQueen and he denied choking her, but he\n   did remember MacQueen fighting back during the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 8 September 2003, defendant was indicted for felonious breaking and entering, felonious assault inflicting serious bodily injury, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury. Through six other indictments, defendant was charged with obtaining habitual felon and violent habitual felon status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant's case proceeded to trial the week of 3 May 2004. During his trial, defendant moved the trial court to suppress his custodial statement to the law enforcement officers, arguing that his statement was not voluntary and was the result of threats against his wife and coercion by the officers. The trial court denied defendant's motion, concluding that defendant's statement \"was not induced by any promise of reward or threat of possibly bringing charges against his wife, but rather, was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made without threat or promise.\" On 5 May 2004, the jury\n   <s>\n    found defendant guilty of felonious\n   </s>\n   breaking and entering, felonious assault inflicting serious injury, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury. The trial court subsequently submitted to the jury one charge of obtaining habitual felon status and one charge of obtaining violent habitual felon status. After a jury verdict finding defendant guilty of both charges, the trial court sentenced defendant to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment without parole for robbery with a dangerous weapon and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury. The trial court arrested judgment on the felonious assault inflicting serious injury conviction, and it sentenced defendant to 133 to 139 months imprisonment for felonious breaking and entering. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We note initially that defendant's brief does not contain arguments supporting each of the original assignments of error on appeal. Pursuant to N.C.R.App. P. 28(b)(6) (2005), the omitted assignments of error are deemed abandoned. Therefore, we limit our present review to those issues argued by defendant in his brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The issues on appeal are whether: (I) the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to suppress his custodial statement; (II) the trial court erred by permitting Detective Welch to testify regarding the custodial statements made by defendant's wife; (III) the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of robbery with a dangerous weapon; (IV) the trial court erred by failing to set aside\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   the jury's verdict on the charge of robbery with a dangerous weapon; (V) defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel; (VI) the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury; (VII) the trial court erred by sentencing defendant as a violent habitual felon; and (VIII) the trial court erred by denying defendant's motions to dismiss the habitual felon indictments and allowing the State to amend the indictment for obtaining habitual felon status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant first argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress his custodial statement to Detective Welch and Sergeant Fisher. Defendant asserts that his statement was involuntary, in that it resulted from unconstitutional threats or coercion on the part of law enforcement officers. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-977(f) (2003) requires a trial court to make findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its order granting or denying a defendant's motion to suppress evidence. Where a defendant contends that his confession to law enforcement officers was involuntary, \"[s]uch findings and conclusions must be determinative on the issue of voluntariness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Detective Welch testified that after defendant told him his wife was not involved, he informed defendant that \"the only way [he] could believe that she was not involved [would be for defendant] to tell [him] exactly what did happen[.]\" Defendant thereafter informed the officers what happened. Detective Welch testified further that he informed defendant \"near the end of our interview\" that his wife would not be charged in connection with the attack. On cross-examination by the State, Detective Welch testified that he did not promise defendant anything in return for his making the statement, and he did not threaten or coerce defendant in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Sergeant Fisher testified in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Q: What, if anything, was mentioned about [defendant's] wife to [defendant] in the interrogation room?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A: Detective Welch asked [defendant] if his wife was part of this thing, and [defendant] advised that she was not. Detective Welch advised [defendant] the only way to believe him was to tell the truth, and [defendant] agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Q: Did you or Detective Welch at any time say to [defendant] anything to the effect that if he doesn't talk, his wife will be charged?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A: No, sir, we did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Q: Did [defendant], at any time during the interrogation, express any concern about his wife and her being charged, if you recall?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A: No, he did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Our courts \"ha[ve] long recognized the principle that mental or psychological pressure brought to bear against a defendant so as to overcome his will and induce a confession can render such a confession involuntary under the totality of the circumstances attendant.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is generally recognized, however, that a confession is \"involuntary\" in the constitutional sense in such cases only when it was produced by wrongful pressure applied by law enforcement officials or others acting for them. Confessions or admissions have not been held inadmissible in evidence merely because the accused in making the confession or admission was motivated by a desire to protect a relative threatened with arrest or in custody when such motivation\n   originated with the accused and was not suggested by law enforcement officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 107-08,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=291%20S.E.2d%20653\">\n    291 S.E.2d at 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In the instant case, as detailed above, the trial court's findings of fact are supported by competent evidence and are thus binding on appeal. Defendant was aware of his constitutional right to remain silent when he chose to speak. Detective Welch testified that prior to being asked whether his wife was involved, defendant said, \"I was there[,]\" and he asked the officers, \"What does the video show?\" Both officers testified that at no point did they indicate to defendant that his wife would be charged if he did not confess, nor did they promise defendant anything if he offered a confession. Based upon our review of the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that defendant was not coerced into confession due to threats made against his wife or suggested by law enforcement officials. Accordingly, we overrule defendant's first argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant next argues that the trial court committed plain error by permitting Detective Welch to testify regarding statements defendant's wife made to law enforcement officers. The State contends that defendant has not properly preserved this issue for appeal because, in his brief, defendant fails to offer any argument supporting his assignment of plain error to the issue. We note that \"[t]he right and requirement to specifically and distinctly contend an error amounts to plain error does not obviate the requirement that a party provide argument supporting the contention that the trial court's [alleged error] amounted to plain error[.]\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

At trial, the State introduced evidence tending to show that defendant was registered at Room 505 of the Days Inn the night before MacQueen was attacked, and that an employee of the hotel saw defendant get on the elevator with MacQueen shortly before she was attacked. MacQueen identified defendant as the individual who attacked her, and, as discussed above, defendant confessed that he attacked MacQueen in her hotel room in order to obtain money and that he \"was cracked up\" during the incident. In light of the foregoing, we are not convinced that absent the trial court's alleged error, the jury probably would have reached a different verdict.

However, we are not convinced that \"means\" was included in the statute in order to reach the situation of the instant case, where a robbery was perpetrated by the use of hands, fists, or feet. \"It is a recognized principle of statutory construction that when particular or specific words or acts, the subject of a statute, are followed by general words, the latter must as a rule be confined to acts and things of the same kind.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In the instant case, there is no indication that MacQueen's life was threatened or endangered by an \"armed\" individual. Defendant's only means of completing the robbery consisted of his own bare hands, fists, and feet. Common sense and the clear intent of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-87 lead us to conclude that an individual cannot possess, use, or threaten to use a dangerous weapon during a robbery where that individual is not possessing, using, or threatening to use some external weapon or instrument during the robbery. The \"critical difference\" between armed and common law robbery \"is that the former is accomplished by the use or threatened use of a dangerous weapon whereby the life of a person is endangered or threatened.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Were an individual's bare hands, fists, and feet considered dangerous weapons for the purposes of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-87, that \"critical difference\" would be erased, and the crime of common law robbery would in effect merge with the crime of robbery with a dangerous weapon. We are not convinced that this result was contemplated by our legislature in enacting N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-87. Therefore, in light of the foregoing, we conclude that an individual's bare hands, fists, and feet are not considered dangerous weapons for the purposes of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-87. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred by failing to dismiss defendant's charge of armed robbery on these grounds, and therefore we reverse defendant's armed robbery conviction. The case is remanded to the trial court with instructions to enter judgment on the offense of common law robbery. Furthermore, because we have decided this issue in favor of defendant, we need not consider his related contentions that the trial court erred by failing to set aside\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   the verdict of guilty of robbery with a dangerous weapon or that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to move the trial court to set aside the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant next argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss the charge of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury.

MacQueen testified that defendant \"slammed\" her on the cheek, causing her to fall to the floor of the hotel room. After MacQueen fell to the floor, defendant began to kick her and drag her towards the bathroom. Defendant grabbed MacQueen by her hair and \"pounded\" her head on the wall of the hotel room until she lost consciousness. The evidence demonstrates that MacQueen was virtually defenseless during the attack, and she suffered vertigo and a total loss of balance following it. MacQueen testified that she continued to suffer from the injuries at defendant's trial. In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the State offered sufficient evidence to reasonably support the inference that defendant intended to kill, rather than merely injure, MacQueen. Accordingly, we overrule defendant's sixth argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant next presents several arguments regarding the propriety of his convictions and sentences for obtaining habitual felon and violent habitual felon status. As discussed above, defendant was charged with obtaining habitual felon status by four separate indictments and obtaining violent habitual felon status by two separate indictments. Prior to submission of the charges to the jury, the State agreed to proceed on only one charge of obtaining habitual felon status and only one charge of obtaining violent habitual felon status. The trial court thereafter submitted indictments 03 CRS 13113 and 03 CRS 13115 to the jury, both of which relied upon defendant's conviction for armed robbery. Because we have reversed defendant's armed robbery conviction, the resulting convictions for obtaining habitual felon and violent habitual felon status are vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In light of the foregoing conclusions, we hold that defendant received a trial free of prejudicial error in part, but we reverse defendant's conviction for robbery with a dangerous weapon, remand the case for entry of judgment on the offense of common law robbery, and vacate defendant's convictions for obtaining habitual felon and violent habitual felon status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Reversed and remanded in part; vacated in part; no error in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Judges McCULLOUGH and TYSON concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
