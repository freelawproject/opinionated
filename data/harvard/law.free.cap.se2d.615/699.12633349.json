Specifically, the trial court concluded as a matter of law that defendant surrendered the leasehold to plaintiff, that the action for summary ejectment is now moot, and that \"despite the findings of fact, . . . defendant did not allege specific enough damages in his counterclaim for the court to grant relief.\" Defendant now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In March 2003, plaintiff and defendant entered into an oral lease agreement to rent a mobile home (\"the leased premises\") in Gaston County, North Carolina, with payments to be made to plaintiff on the third or fifth day of each month at the rate of three hundred and fifty dollars ($350.00) per month. Defendant paid plaintiff two hundred dollars ($200.00) as a security deposit and three hundred and fifty dollars ($350.00) for rent during the months of April, May, June, July, and August 2003. Plaintiff failed to provide necessary repairs to the leased premises notwithstanding defendant's repeated requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On 3 September 2003, defendant refused to pay plaintiff rent, and once again, urged plaintiff to make the necessary repairs to the leased premises. Defendant informed plaintiff that he would not make any further rent payment until all repairs were made. On 6 September 2003, defendant contacted Gaston County Code Enforcement to request an inspection of the leased premises. On 9 September 2003, plaintiff served defendant with a complaint in summary ejectment alleging that the lease period had ended and defendant was holding over. On 18 September 2003, the trial court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff and ordered defendant be removed from possession of the leased premises. On 25 September 2003, defendant filed a notice of appeal with the district court. Defendant signed a bond stating that he would pay rent to the clerk of court as it became due as he was appealing from a summary ejectment judgment and was continuing to stay on the leased premises until the appeal was heard. Accordingly, defendant paid a September rent appeal bond in the amount of one hundred and sixty-one dollars and nine cents ($161.09) to the clerk of court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At trial, the court determined that the fair rental value of the premises in its defective condition was one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00) per month from 1 April 2003 through 30 September 2003 and the fair market value of the premises as warranted was three hundred and fifty dollars ($350.00) per month from 1 April 2003 through 30 September 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court further found that when defendant moved into the mobile home, the flooring in the kitchen and bathroom was unstable and there was a large hole located behind the refrigerator covered with wire. After defendant moved into the premises, he discovered: (1) deteriorating flooring throughout the home; (2) a large sewage leak from the neighboring property which caused a noxious smell and affected defendant's enjoyment of the premises; (3) electrical problems in the kitchen area; and (4) sparks emitting from a breaker box. All of\n   these defects violated the Gaston County Housing Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant asserts that the trial court erred when determining his counterclaims did not allege specific enough damages to entitle him to any relief and in granting plaintiff's motion for a directed verdict. Defendant contends that the pleadings were sufficiently detailed to entitle him to relief pursuant to a breach of the implied warranty of habitability and the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 42-42 (2003); N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 75-1.1 (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, section 1A-1, Rule 41 provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (b) Involuntary dismissal[:]. . . . [A] defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim therein against him. After the plaintiff, in an action tried by the court without a jury, has completed the presentation of evidence, the defendant, without waiving his right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, may move for a dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief. The court as trier of the facts may then determine them and render judgment against the plaintiff or may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (c). . . . The provisions of this rule apply to the dismissal of any counterclaim, cross claim, or third-party claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 41(b) and (c). In the instant case, the trial court stated in its order that \"Plaintiff's motion to dismiss the Defendant's counterclaims by directed verdict is hereby granted.\" However, it is well settled that a motion for a directed verdict only is proper in a jury trial. \"[H]aving been tried without a jury, the proper motion by which to test the sufficiency of plaintiff's evidence to establish a right to relief was a motion for involuntary dismissal under Rule 41(b).\"\n   <em>\n    Town of Rolesville v.

However, the trial court's findings did not address nor list any of those facts set forth in defendant's counterclaim. After carefully examining the evidence before this Court, we believe it is important for clarification purposes to list those facts defendant set forth in his counterclaim:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The rental property was subject to the Residential Rental Agreements Act;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During all relevant times, plaintiff has had actual or apparent authority to perform the landlord's obligations under the Residential Rental Agreements Act;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Residential Rental Agreements Act created an implied warranty of habitability for all rental dwellings in North Carolina;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff's failure to keep the leased premises in a fit and habitable condition breached the implied warranty of habitability statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant is entitled to actual and consequential damages, defendant's obligation to\n   pay rent abated per N.C.G.S. \u00a7 42-41, and defendant was entitled to recover damages in the form of rent abatement calculated as the difference between the fair rental value of the premises in the unfit condition for the period which the premises was in a defective condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On 6 February 2004, the trial court found defendant's premises were defective and thus violated the Gaston County Housing Code. The court referenced problems with the sewage leak from neighboring property owned by plaintiff, deteriorating flooring throughout the kitchen, electrical problems with the kitchen stove, and sparks emitting from the breaker box. The trial court also found that defendant paid six months rent under the rental rate agreed to in the lease-three hundred and fifty dollars per month. The trial court's conclusions of law stated (1) defendant surrendered the leasehold to plaintiff and summary ejectment is therefore moot, and (2) despite the findings of fact, the court believed defendant did not allege specific enough damages in his counterclaim sufficient for the court to grant relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The North Carolina Residential Rental Agreements Act provisions governing claims for implied warranty of habitability require that a landlord must \"[m]ake all repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition\" and shall \"[k]eep all common areas of the premises in safe condition.\" N.C.

Defendant further contends that the trial court's findings regarding the fair market value of the premises in its warranted and defective condition required the trial court to award defendant rent abatement damages. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   According to North Carolina law, defendant is entitled to file suit against plaintiff requesting rent abatement for breach of implied warranty of habitability. In determining the appropriate amount due to defendant in such an action, this Court previously has stated that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"the proper measure of damages in a rent abatement action based on a breach of the implied warranty of habitability is the difference between the fair rental value of the property in a warranted condition and the fair rental value of the property in its unwarranted condition; provided, however, the damages do not exceed the total amount of rent paid by the tenant. Additionally, the tenant is entitled to any `special and consequential damages alleged and proved.'\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Cardwell v.

The trial court also found that defendant paid rent to plaintiff in the amount of three hundred and fifty dollars ($350.00) per month for the months of April, May, June, July, and August 2003. Defendant then paid to the clerk of court the September rent appeal bond in the amount of one hundred and sixty one dollars and nine cents ($161.09). According to the trial court, the fair rental value of the premises in its defective condition for the months of 1 April 2003 through 30 September 2003 was one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00) per month. The fair market value of the premises, as warranted, for the months of 1\n   April 2003 through 30 September 2003 was three hundred and fifty dollars ($350.00).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Having found the trial court erred in involuntarily dismissing defendant's counterclaim for breach of implied warranty, we also conclude that defendant was entitled to damages. This assignment of error is reversed and remanded for further calculation of damages in favor of defendant not inconsistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After thorough review of the record, we hold that there was competent evidence to support the trial court's findings; however, those findings did not support the trial court's conclusions of law. Therefore, we reverse the trial court's judgment finding in favor of plaintiff on the issues of breach of implied warranty of habitability and unfair and deceptive trade practices. We further remand the case to the trial court for judgment to be entered in favor of defendant. The trial court shall make a determination of defendant's damages consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Chief Judge MARTIN and Judge HUDSON concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
