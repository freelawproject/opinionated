The indictment alleged that on 7 November 2001, defendant intentionally and severely burned his nine month old son, thereby causing serious injury to the child. Defendant pleaded not guilty to the offense and was tried by jury at the 28 January 2003 term of Gaston County Superior Court before Judge J. Gentry Caudill. On 31 January 2003, the jury unanimously found defendant guilty of felony child abuse inflicting serious bodily injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the sentencing proceeding, Judge Caudill calculated that defendant had a prior record level of II, based upon one previous Class 1 misdemeanor conviction and one previous Class A1 misdemeanor conviction. Judge Caudill made additional findings of aggravating and mitigating factors. In aggravation, Judge Caudill found by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant's abuse of his son was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. In mitigation, Judge Caudill found three factors by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) \"the defendant has been a person of good character or has had a good reputation in the community,\" (2) \"the defendant has a support system in the community,\" and (3) \"the defendant was punished emotionally.\" Judge Caudill determined that \"factors in aggravation outweigh the factors in mitigation and that an aggravated sentence is justified.\" Finally, Judge Caudill imposed an aggravated sentence of 115 months minimum to 147 months maximum\n   imprisonment. Defendant's maximum aggravated sentence is eighteen months longer than the maximum presumptive sentence permitted by statute for a Class C felony, prior record level II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant appealed to the North Carolina Court of Appeals, contesting, among other assignments of error, the sufficiency of evidence supporting Judge Caudill's finding of the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating factor. On 29 June 2004, while his direct appeal was pending in the Court of Appeals, defendant filed a motion for appropriate relief in that Court. In his motion, defendant argued that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution required the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating factor to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Because Judge Caudill found that aggravating factor by a preponderance of the evidence, defendant requested a new sentencing proceeding. In support of his motion, defendant cited the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Blakely v. Washington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    542 U.S. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004), which applied the Court's earlier holding in\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v.

On 7 September 2004, a unanimous panel of the Court of Appeals issued an opinion finding no error in defendant's trial, but remanded defendant's case for resentencing pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   and this Court's 1983 decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant contends that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to review the Court of Appeals' decision because he raised the question of\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   error in the Court of Appeals by a motion for appropriate relief. In support of his argument, defendant cites N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1422(f), which states that \"[d]ecisions of the Court of Appeals on motions for appropriate relief that [are made more than ten days after entry of judgment] are final and not subject to further review by appeal, certification, writ, motion, or otherwise.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We agree that N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1422(f) bars this Court's review of Court of Appeals' decisions on most motions for appropriate relief from noncapital judgments and convictions.\n   <em>\n    See State v. Barrett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8560860\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/307/126/\">\n    307 N.C. 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=302%20S.E.2d%20632\">\n    302 S.E.2d 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) (dismissing the defendant's appeal of the Court of Appeals decision denying his motion for appropriate relief). This restriction has the desirable effect of imparting finality to post-conviction proceedings and freeing limited judicial resources for attention to cases on direct review, which involve capital or constitutional questions, and questions in dispute among the members of the Court of Appeals as reflected by a dissenting opinion. N.C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 7A-27(a), 30 (2003). Collateral review of noncapital judgments and convictions is, in general, not a core function of the Supreme Court of North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   However, collateral review is proper in certain rare circumstances, as when the Court of Appeals applies a new federal constitutional rule of widespread effect on the administration of justice throughout the state.\n   <em>\n    Cf.

Read broadly, the Court of Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Allen,\n   </em>\n   applying\n   <em>\n    Blakely,\n   </em>\n   calls into question the constitutionality of North Carolina's Structured Sentencing Act and identifies a new type of structural error\n   which is reversible\n   <em>\n    per se.\n   </em>\n   For these reasons\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   have the potential to affect a significant number of criminal sentences in North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Because a prompt and definitive resolution of this issue is necessary to ensure the continued fair and effective administration of North Carolina's criminal courts, we exercise the supervisory authority of this Court, which is embodied in Article IV, Section 12, Clause 1 of the North Carolina Constitution, and review the opinion of the Court of Appeals. In so doing, we note that N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1422(f) cannot restrict this Court's constitutionally granted power to \"issue any remedial writs necessary to give it general supervision and control over the proceedings of the other courts.\" N.C.

Plainly, it is more difficult for an appellate court, reviewing a cold record, to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that a jury would have found an offense \"especially heinous\" than it is for an appellate court to determine that the defendant \"knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person by means of a weapon or device which would normally be hazardous to the lives of more than one person,\" N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1340.16(d)(8) (2003), or \"committed the offense while on pretrial release on another charge,\" N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1340.16(d)(12). This is not to say, however, that a judicial finding that an offense was \"heinous, atrocious, or cruel\" can\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Even in the context of capital sentencing proceedings, we have never held that the subjectivity of the \"heinous, atrocious, or cruel\" aggravator precluded appellate courts from considering whether the evidence was sufficient to support findings of that factor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., State v.

(McLaughlin), the physician assistant who treated the victim's burns. McLaughlin had approximately twenty-seven years of experience as a physician assistant and had worked at the hospital emergency room for six years. He did not possess a license to practice medicine or a medical degree. Although he had no specialized burn training, McLaughlin found that the child had either second- or third-degree burns on his hand, wrist, stomach, and knee. Based on the severity of the burns and his belief that a person would not hold on to a hot object long enough to cause burns that deep, McLaughlin opined that the burns were caused by someone holding an object against the child's skin. He also opined that the shapes of the burns were not consistent with a burn suffered from grabbing a curling iron. Because the burns were round and not linear in shape, McLaughlin concluded that they were most likely caused by a round object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   While this testimony certainly supports the inference that defendant intentionally inflicted multiple burns on his child - the factual predicate for the (d)(7) aggravator in this case - the evidence in support of that factor is far from \"overwhelming.\" Had the\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   error not occurred, a jury could certainly have decided to reject all or part of McLaughlin's testimony in light of (1) his relative inexperience with burns, (2) his lack of a medical degree or license to practice medicine, and (3) defendant's consistent and strenuous testimony that he did not harm the child. In addition, a jury could rationally have determined that defendant's bandaging of the child's hand suggested he was unaware of the other burns on the child's body and that he acted compassionately, not in an \"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\" manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Moreover, the \"heinous, atrocious, or cruel\" aggravator is complicated by the requirement that the offense be \"\n   <em>\n    especially\n   </em>\n   \" heinous, atrocious, or cruel. N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1340.16(d)(7) (2003) (emphasis added). As we have previously explained, the aggravator applies only if \"the facts of the case disclose\n   <em>\n    excessive\n   </em>\n   brutality, or physical pain, psychological suffering, or dehumanizing aspects\n   <em>\n    not normally present in [the] offense.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because the offense of felonious child abuse inflicting serious injury\n   <em>\n    inherently\n   </em>\n   involves \"brutality, ... physical pain, ...

Indeed, a comparison of this state's appellate precedents demonstrates that application of the\n   <em>\n    Blackwelder\n   </em>\n   standard often requires fine distinctions that do not readily lend themselves to harmless-error analysis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., State v.

However, on the facts presented here, I cannot conclude that this particular\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, and on these grounds only, I agree that the instant case should be remanded to the Court of Appeals for further remand to the trial court with instructions to submit the (d)(7) aggravating factor for determination by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Although, undoubtedly, judicial fact-finding of aggravating factors violates the federal constitutional rule enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Blakely v. Washington,\n   </em>\n   United States Supreme Court precedent also compels application of the harmless-error doctrine to\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   violations. I have no doubt that my colleagues in the majority are motivated by the noblest of intentions. Nevertheless, the majority's invocation of \"structural error\" to\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   violations is erroneous under federal constitutional principles which govern\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Moreover, the public record reflects that 75 \"\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   cases\" are now pending for disposition in our 15-member intermediate appellate court, the North Carolina Court of Appeals. To put this in perspective, the Court of Appeals has issued a total of 738 opinions so far in 2005. And the burden on our legal and judicial system does not end there. Each improvident \"\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   remand\" to the trial court, in North Carolina and every other state, necessarily entails the application of additional prosecutorial, legal, and other \"justice system\" resources. Where the\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   error in any such case is \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,\" these resources are, in turn, potentially unavailable to redress prejudicial legal error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   With that said, I fully concur in our remand order based on the particular facts of the instant case. But taxing our already overburdened judicial and legal resources through indiscriminate application of a categorical rule accomplishes nothing from a practical perspective, elevates form over substance, and unnecessarily undermines the salutary objectives that are undeniably effectuated by application of harmless-error review. Accordingly, I dissent from the majority's holding that\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   errors are categorically unamenable to harmless-error review. In all other respects, I concur in the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Chief Justice LAKE and Justice NEWBY join in this concurring and dissenting opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   ---------------\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <a href=\"#fn2-2\" id=\"fr2-2\" name=\"fr2-2\">\n    9.\n   </a>\n   What is now referred to as the\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   rule had its genesis in\n   <em>\n    Jones v.
