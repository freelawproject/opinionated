In Bruce et al. <em>v. </em>Platt et al., 80 <em>N. Y. </em>379, it was said by Danforth, J., that it is settled by repeated decisions that the statute in question is penal, and not to be extended by construction; and that in an action to enforce a liability thereby created, nothing can be presumed against the defendants, but that every fact necessary to establish their liability must be affirmatively proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The amended complaint which the order appealed from permitted to be served, fails to allege the fact, that the services for which the plaintiff seeks to recover, were rendered <em>at the request </em>of the corporation. Such a request is vital to the cause of action (Dinsmore <em>v. </em>Mayor, &amp;c., 4 <em>Hun, </em>643), for otherwise, from all that appears upon the record, the rendition of the services may have been a voluntary courtesy. Comstock <em>v. </em>Smith, 7 <em>Johns. </em>87; Bartholomew <em>v </em>Jackson, 20 <em>Johns. </em>28; Griffin <em>v. </em>Potter, 14 <em>Wend. </em>209; Maltby <em>v. </em>Harwood, 12 <em>Barb. </em>473; Ingraham <em>v. </em>Gilbert, 20 <em>Barb. </em>151; Williams <em>v. </em>Hutchinson, 3 <em>N. Y. </em>312.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Even where a promise to pay, made subsequent to the rendition of services, is shown, it must also be shown that the services were rendered at the defendants\u2019 request. Frear <em>v. </em>Hardenbergh, 5 <em>Johns. </em>272; Comstock <em>v. </em>Smith, 7 <em>Johns. </em>87; Parker <em>v. </em>Crane, 6 <em>Wend. </em>647.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">As the existence of a fact not averred will not be presumed, unless the presumption necessarily arises from what has been alleged (Malone <em>v. </em>Sherman, 49 <em>Superior Ct. R. </em>530), and the amended complaint contains no allegations from which a request may be presumed or implied as a necessary consequence, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>amended complaint is demurrable on its face. Such a defect cannot be obviated by a liberal construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The amended complaint being demurrable upon its face, the court below, under the decision of Pracht v. Ritter, 48 <em>Super. Ct. </em>509, had no discretion to allow it to be served as an amendment of the\u2019 earlier complaint which had been adjudged insufficient. (See 54 <em>Superior Ct. </em>123.)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The order should be reversed with ten dollars costs and disbursements to be taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., and O\u2019Gorman, J. concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
