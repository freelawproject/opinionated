Pro. It is argued that the Code refers to actions for conversion <em>simplieiter, </em>when the sheriff has taken under process property which he is not justified in taking, but that the present action is for a willful and malicious trespass by the sheriff, made with the intention of breaking up the business of plaintiff. In my opinion, the complaint claims conversion only, and under it damages for conversion only can be recovered. The so called malice and intent to break up the business as alleged in the complaint, do not alter the act of conversion or give greater damages than those that follow a conversion; for the only thing averred to have been actually done by the defendants was taking and converting and retaining goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-5\">\u201cThe complaint charges that \u2018the defendants wrongfully and unlawfully and with malice and with intent to injure the plaintiff and destroy her said business, for the profit and advantage of the defendants, they the said defendants unlawfully took and carried away and converted to their own use, and still retain from her, the goods and chattels,\u2019 etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-6\">\u201cIt'is not meant to deny or affirm that there may be a malicious trespass connected with a conversion which will give a right to exemplary damages, or which will\u2019 have, as a proximate result, other damages than are measured by the value of the property taken. Such a case is not described in the complaint. A bare conversion is charged, and its consequences are not enlarged by an allegation of motive and intent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-7\">\u201c The next objection js, that the application did not show that the indemnitors were liable for all that the sheriff seized under the execution. The affidavit said on this subject that, \u2018 under said execution, the defendant sheriff levied on the property, or part thereof, referred to in the complaint.\u2019 It is supposed that this may leave a case of the indemnitors being responsible for part and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the sheriff responsible for the rest. Taking all the affidavits and papers, they show that the indemnitors were responsible for all that the sheriff took, but the extract from the affidavits reserves the question of fact of what the sheriff did actually take.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-5\">\u201c The order as made required the plaintiff to serve upon the indemnitors\u2019 attorney a copy of the complaint. It is supposed that as those attorneys had already appeared for the defendants other than the sheriff, it was not necessary under section 479 of the Code, to make a further service upon the indemnitors becoming defendants. It may be doubted whether section 479 is to be applied to this case. If it be applicable, the appellants have not been injured by a direction that tended to certainty and regularity in the progress of the action.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b559-6\"><em>James A.
