The defendant did not accept them in the usual way, but the plaintiff claimed that the defendant had written a letter which must be construed as an unconditional promise to accept, under the statute (1 <em>R. S. [Edm] </em>722, \u00a7 8), and that the plaintiff having discounted the drafts on the strength of this letter, the defendant can be held as acceptor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-4\">The letter in question was as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-5\">\u201cNew York, July 2, 1883.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-6\">\u201c Messrs. Wills &amp; Wildberger :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-7\">\u201cGentlemen:\u2014We find you have to pay us about nine hundred dollars the present month. We now propose to extend this amount if necessary by a payment of ten per cent, and interest. You must be aware this constant extension with small payments cannot give us confidence to increase or continue your account; and it has occurred to us as your orders have been quite liberal, that your business must be sufficiently active to make a better showing. If we were satisfied that your condition was such as to secure us from ultimate loss, we would have much less objection to the method we are now doing business with you, or we would systematize your credits, that you could keep a full stock to your advantage. Let us hear from you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-8\">\u201c Yours truly,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-9\">\u201cJ. G. Shaw, P.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-10\">It appeared from the testimony of Mr. Wildberger, a member of the firm who drew the draft in question on defendant, that the mode of dealing with the defendant company was, that \u201c goods were bought by the firm from the company, on four months\u2019 time and an acceptance given for the amount.\u201d He also testified, that the $900 mentioned in the letter referred to paper of said firm of Wills &amp; Wildberger, maturing during the month mentioned, and that the whole amount was represented by drafts upon his firm ; that the company had been in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the habit of drawing upon his firm for acceptance, and had been extending their paper for four or five years, and he described the method of extension, as follows :\u2014 \u201c That if the firm could not meet a note it would draw back for part of it; make a sight draft on defendant for the part it was unable to pay and have that draft discounted in the bank ; \u201d he further stated that he never drew any drafts on the company except as part or whole payment of his firm\u2019s acceptances, and that the drafts in suit were drawn for that purpose. There was some testimony tending to show knowledge by plaintiff of this course of dealing between said firm and defendant, and that it was induced to cash the drafts in question by the reading of the letter above referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-5\">The defendant offered no testimony, and at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case the court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for the direction of a verdict, and directed a verdict for the defendant, to which rulings plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-6\"><em>Gibson &amp; </em>Whiting, and <em>John B. </em>Whiting, for plaintiff :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhS\">I. It is not necessary that there should be an explicit reference to bills of exchange in the letter itself (Ruiz <em>v. </em>Renauld, 100 N. <em>Y. </em>256).</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-7\">II. The letter when taken in connection with the course of 'dealing of the parties can only be construed as containing an authorization to draw.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-8\">HI. There was sufficient evidence to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of knowledge on the part of the bank of the dealings between the firm and the company. Assuming then, that there was such a course of dealing, it is clear from the authorities that evidence to show it was admissible, and it should be considered in construing the letter (Ruiz v. Renauld, <em>supra; </em>also <em>Daily Reg. </em>Sept. 14, 1883).</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-9\">IY- It has been repeatedly held, that an authorization to draw is equivalent to a promise to accept (Merchant\u2019s Bank <em>v. </em>Griswold, 72 N. <em>Y. </em>472 <em>; </em>Barney <em>v. </em>Worthing<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>ton, 37 <em>Ib. </em>116 ; Merchant\u2019s. Exchange Bank <em>v. </em>Cardozo, 3 <em>J. &amp; S. </em>162).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-4\"><em>Holmes &amp; Adams, </em>and <em>George H Adams, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b108-5\">By the Court.\u2014Ingraham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMk\">In order to make tile defendant liable there must be \u201c an unconditional promise in writing to accept \u201d the bill. This promise must be in writing, and it must be to accept the draft or bill of exchange sued on.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The letter relied on by the plaintiff contains simply a proposition to extend the payment of the $900 coming due during the month. There is nothing in the letter that would inform any one that it was proposed to draw a draft, or that a draft was to be accepted when drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Where the contract is required by law to be in writing the material parts of the contract must be embraced in the writing, and it is incompetent to supply any deficiency by parol. This rule has been applied so frequently in cases arising under the statute of frauds that it is hardly necessary to cite authorities. The case of Wright <em>v. </em>Weeks (25 <em>N. Y. </em>153), is however, in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">In the case of Ruiz <em>v. </em>Renauld (100 <em>N. Y. </em>257), relied \u2022 on by the plaintiff, the letter said to contain the promise was in answer to a letter written by the drawer of the draft sued on, which contained a request to allow the writers \u201cto continue our drafts,\u201d and stated \u201cWe expect that you will allow us to continue our drafts and remittances as we have been doing until now,\u201d and in reply to such request the defendants wrote that \u201c In the meantime we naturally rely upon the renewal of the drafts due on the 29th inst.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">It will be seen that taking these two letters together, there was an absolute authority to draw the drafts sued on for the renewal of the drafts due on the 29th, and that was held to be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">But in the case at bar, no request for the renewal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>any existing drafts is in evidence, and no authority to draw or promise to accept a draft can be made out by the letter itself. No authority to draw or promise to accept the draft is in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We think the exceptions should be overruled, and judgment ordered for the defendant on the verdict with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., and Freedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
