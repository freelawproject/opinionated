If, however, as is stated in the affidavit, the proof presented at the inquest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>was sufficient to justify and require an assessment of damages amounting to not less than $5,800, instead of $300, the amount for which the damages were actually assessed, then the plaintiff would have been entitled to a new trial on motion at Special Term, and this remedy, we think, remains still open to him.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b529-5\"><em>E.
