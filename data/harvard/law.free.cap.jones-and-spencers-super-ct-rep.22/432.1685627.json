To this direction, the defendant corporation excepted, and the only question to be considered on this appeal is whether that exception was well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In the case of Dubois <em>v. </em>City of Kingston, 102 <em>N. Y. </em>221, the plaintiff was injured from a similar cause, and had a verdict and judgment in his favor, from which the defendant appealed. The Court of Appeals held that the court erred on the trial in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, and that there was no evidence which justified the conclusion that the stepping stone, there in question, was dangerous to travellers or that the defendant, the city of Kingston, was liable for negligence in allowing it to remain on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">This decision was rendered since the trial of the case at bar, and it may justly be inferred from it, that in the opinion of the court, the question whether the allowing such an obstruction to remain on the sidewalk was in itself negligence, should be left to the jury under all the circumstances of each case, as a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The refusal in the case at bar, to send the question to the jury was, therefore, error.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The judgment should he reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
