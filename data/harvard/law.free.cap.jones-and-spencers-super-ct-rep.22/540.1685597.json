The petition of the plaintiff disclosed his reasons for suspecting the general incorrectness of the defendants\u2019 accounts, and for his expectation that testimony to prove errors can be found in the books. But he does not specify any error or fraud in the accounts detrimental to plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and the examination applied for would, if it had been granted, lead only to a search for evidence without any special aim or special subject of inquiry. This is not the legitimate object of the motion.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b562-12\"><em>Abel E.
