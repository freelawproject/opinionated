Meyer, </em>attorney, and of counsel for appellant, on the questions considered in the opinion, argued :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A71\">The referee erred in his ruling that the defendant could not be compelled by a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>duly served to produce certain books and papers then stated to be in the hands of his counsel. Bonesteel <em>v. </em>Lynde, 8 <em>How. </em>226, 352; Shelp <em>v. </em>Morrison, 13 <em>Hun, </em>110, and other cases cited in <em>Bailey's Trial Pr. </em>p. 83; <em>Code of Civil Pro., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 852, 867.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-13\"><em>Ira Shafer, </em>attorney, and of counsel for respondent, argued that the testimony of the witness showed that he did not have and never had books or papers of the character called for; and that therefore the ruling of the referee, to which exception was taken, did not harm the plaintiff ; the defendant had nothing to produce.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b374-14\">By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al0\">The nature of the issues required the defendant to account to the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>for the disposition of moneys placed in his hands by the plaintiff. In holding these moneys and in disposing of them the defendant was under the obligation of a trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In the course of the trial the plaintiff called the defendant as a witness and asked him to produce certain books, that had been described in a subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>that had been served upon the witness. It appeared <em>prima facie </em>that the hooks referred to contained entries as to the receipt and disbursement by the witness of the moneys in question. The witness did not produce them and said they were in the hands of his counsel. The counsel for plaintiff asked the referee to direct the defendant counsel to produce these books. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected on the ground that the witness could not be compelled to produce them by subpoena <em>duces tecum. </em>The referee sustained the objection, and refused to make such a direction. To this plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">It seems to me that the plaintiff had a right to the production of books in which his trustee had kept an account of moneys in his hand as trustee, and that this right could be enforced through a subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>and further that the court might make a verbal direction that the counsel of defendant should produce the books which the counsel would be hound to obey. In this case, the referee should have made such a direction. As it cannot be determined what effect upon the trial of the issues proof of the contents of the books would have had, there should be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Judgment reversed, order of reference vacated and a new trial ordered with costs to abide- the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Fbeedmax, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
