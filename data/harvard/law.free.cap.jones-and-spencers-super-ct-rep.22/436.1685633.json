The difference of a few inches more or less in the description lines of a city lot, may be most important and valuable, and might cause a difference in pecuniary value exceeding that of acres of farm land. This accurate and full measurement in feet and inches, is a proper description of a city lot, and that by which the parties to the contract must have intended to be bound, and should be held to in this case.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b458-9\">Before Sedgwick, Ch. J., and O\u2019Gorman, J.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b458-10\"><em>Decided May </em>2, 1887.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-11\">Appeal from a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for two hundred and forty-two dollars and fifty cents, entered on a verdict by direction of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b458-12\"><em>E.

Plaintiff expended also one hundred dollars for examination of title. The defendant answered, setting up a counterclaim for $1,225,75 damages alleged to have been incurred by him by reason of plaintiff\u2019s refusal to accept the deed tendered to him and pay the balance of purchase money.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The defendant\u2019s contention cannot prevail. The plaintiff was clearly entitled to a conveyance sufficient to vest in him the title to all, not merely a portion, of the lot as described in the contract of sale, and to compel him to pay the whole purchase money for a lot smaller than that described in that contract, would be manifestly unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The cases cited on behalf of the defense, do not seem to me to be in point or controlling. In the purchase of a city lot, the quantity of space can seldom be accurately described by visible metes and bounds, as may be done in the case of the purchase of a tract of farm land. The usual and only accurate and reliable mode of measurement of a city lot is by feet and inches and this measurement is the proper description, and that by which the parties to the contract must have intended to be bound, for the difference of a few inches more or less in the lines within which a city lot is bounded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>might cause a difference in pecuniary value exceeding that of acres of farm land.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The direction of the learned trial judge and the verdict rendered thereon, were right.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
