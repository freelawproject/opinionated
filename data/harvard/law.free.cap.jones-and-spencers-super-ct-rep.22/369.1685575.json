KEELER, Appellant, <em>v. </em>BARRETTS, PALMER &amp; HEAL DYEING ESTABLISHMENT, Respondents.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b391-5\">\n<em>Motion for a now trial on the minutes, request for direction of verdict, when, and when not necessary to sustain motion.</em>\n</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b391-6\">It is the settled law of the Superior Court that the party against whom a verdict is rendered on conflicting evidence, cannot sustain a motion for a' new trial on the minutes, either on the ground of the insufficiency of the evidence, or that the verdict is contrary to the evidence, if he <em>neglects to request </em>the court to direct a verdict in his favor.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b391-7\">But where there is no conflict of evidence, the question whether it is sufficient to support the verdict may <em>without such request, </em>be\" considered on a motion for a new trial on the minutes, made on the ground that the verdict is against law.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b391-8\">Before Sedgwick, Ch. J., Tritax and Dugro, J.J.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b391-9\"><em>Decided March </em>14, 1887.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-10\">This is an appeal from an order denying a motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-11\">The case was before this court on an appeal from the judgment, on which appeal the judgment was affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-12\">The facts sufficiently appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-13\"><em>S. F. Kneeland, </em>attorney, and of counsel for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-14\"><em>Taylor &amp; Ferris, </em>attorneys, and <em>James A. Taylor, </em>of counsel for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b391-15\">By the Court.\u2014Truax, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMC\">The plaintiff moved under \u00a7 999 of the Code of Civil Procedure for a new trial, on the grounds that the verdict was against the evidence<em>, </em>and also against law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The material question in the case was, what was the agreement which had been entered into between the parties hereto, ?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The evidence on that question is conflicting, and therefore the court rightly left it to the jury to determine the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The plaintiff conceded that the evidence was conflicting, because he did not move the court to direct a verdict in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">It is settled in this court that where evidence is conflicting, and the plaintiff neglects to ask the court to direct a verdict in his favor, he cannot afterwards sustain a motion for a new trial on the judge\u2019s minutes on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to warrant the verdict\u2014or on the ground that the verdict was contrary to the evidence. Rowe <em>v. </em>Stevens, 34 <em>Super. Ct. </em>436; Sickle <em>v. </em>Gillies, 45 <em>Howard, </em>94; Pollock <em>v. </em>Brennan, 39 <em>Super. Ct. </em>477.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">This court held in the case of Rowe <em>v. </em>Stevens, <em>supra. </em>that by not asking the court to direct a verdict in his favor, the party conceded that there was sufficient evidence to carry the case to the jury, and having consented to a decision by that tribunal, and having taken his chance of a favorable verdict which would have concluded his opponent upon the facts, he should not after-wards be permitted to allege that the verdict is without evidence or insufficiently supported by the evidence, and for that reason against law. See Barrett <em>v. </em>Third Avenue R. R. Co., 45 <em>N. Y. </em>632.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">It is true that where there is no conflict in the evidence, the question whether it is sufficient to support the verdict is one of law, and may be considered on a motion for a new trial on the minutes, if the motion is made on the ground that the verdict is against law\u2014 but that is not this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">Here there was a conflict of evidence on the material point in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>The plaintiff also moves for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against law.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The law in this case was the judge\u2019s charge, to which there was no exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">A careful examination shows us that the verdict was not contrary to the charge of the court, but was in strict conformity to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In this case we think that substantial justice has been done, and that the jury decided in favor of, and not against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Order appealed from affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., and Dugro, J. concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
