Schwarz for the sum of $2,677.52. It does not appear by the record of that case tha,t the letter \u201cA,\u201d by which the defendant was designated, was used as an abbreviation for the defendant, or that the defendant\u2019s name was unknown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-5\">\u201c The action was upon two promissory notes signed A Schwarz, and was against A. Schwarz. The process in that action was served upon the defendant in this action, and judgment was entered by reason of his failure to appear and file the necessary affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-6\">\u201c The defendant in this action, Anton Schwarz, is sued on that judgment. It is not alleged in the complaint in filiis action that the defendant, Anton Schwarz, was known by the name of A. Schwarz, or that he was the person who signed the promissory notes upon which the action in the court of common pleas for the county of Philadelphia was founded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-7\">\u201c On this record, as it stands, I do not think plaintiff is entitled to recover against Anton Schwarz on the judgment. There is no evidence as to the law of the state of Pennsylvania on the question here presented, and the rules of common law are therefore presumed to apply. It is well settled in this state that an action against an individual by a wrong name does not give the court jurisdiction to enter any judgment against the person intended to be sued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-8\">\u201cIn Farnham <em>v. </em>Hildreth (32 <em>Barb. </em>278), it was held a judgment entered against Freeman Hildreth did not authorize a sale of the property of Truman Hildreth, although he might have been the individual intended, and also held that the service of a summons upon a party by a wrong name does not give the court jurisdiction over his person, and his appearance cannot be compelled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-9\">\u201c Anton Schwarz did not appear in the action in the court of common pleas of the county of Philadelphia, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>and I think it clear on the authorities that the service of that writ against A. Schwarz gave the court no jurisdiction to enter a judgment against Anton Schwarz, and consequently the entry of the judgment against A. Schwarz was not a judgment against Anton Schwarz.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-5\">\u201cIn the case of Grant <em>v. </em>Birdsall (48 Super. Ct, 428), cited by the plaintiff, it appeared that, in proceedings supplementary to execution, defendant had obtained and signed adjournments, and had promised at one of the adjournments to pay the judgment, and the court held that the objection had been waived. There is nothing in the case at bar from which a waiver of the objection could be founded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-6\">\u201c I have examined all the cases cited, and am clearly of the opinion that the judgment of the court of common pleas, of Philadelphia, against A. Schwarz, is not a judgment against Anton Schwarz, and the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-7\">\u201cThe complaint must therefore be dismissed with costs. Findings to be settled on two days\u2019 notice.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b193-8\"><em>Blair, Snow &amp; Rudd, </em>and <em>B. F. Blair, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXt\">I. It appears'most conclusively, not only by the record, but also by the findings, that the letter A <em>was </em>used as an abbreviation. The name of the defendant in the Pennsylvania suit is mentioned repeatedly both in the record of that suit and in the findings here, and in not a single instance is the letter A used as a part of the defendant\u2019s name without being followed by a period.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-9\">A single letter, when used as part of a name, if followed by a period, is used as an initial of a name, and not as, in itself, a name.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-10\">II. The defendant was not sued \u201cby a wrong name,\u201d in the action in Philadelphia, but merely by an abbreviation of his true name.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-11\"><em>Prima facie, </em>personal service of the process of a court of general jurisdiction upon a party gives that court jurisdiction of the person served, therefore it is for de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>fendant to show why personal service o\u00ed process upon a defendant so designated does not confer upon the court jurisdiction to render judgment against him. (Counsel here commented on and distinguished authorities cited in respondent\u2019s points.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-5\">Thus it appears that not one of the cases cited by the defendant supports the proposition that a valid, judgment may not be rendered by default against a defendant sued by the initial of his Christian name, unless it is to be held, as a matter of law, that the initial is really another and a wrong name for' the defendant\u2014a view which no case we have been able to find supports.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-6\">HI. That a valid judgment by default may be entered against a defendant sued by the initials of his Christian name, see Grant <em>v. </em>Birdsall, 2 <em>Civ. Pro. Rep. </em>422; Lynch <em>v. </em>Tomlinson, <em>N. Y. Daily Reg. Oct. </em>30; Sarony <em>v. </em>The Burrow Giles Lithographic Co. 16 <em>Rep. </em>80; Bell <em>v. </em>Sun Printing, etc. Co. 42 <em>Super. Ct. </em>567; Lucas <em>v. </em>Farrington, 21 <em>Ills. </em>31; Fenton <em>v. </em>Perkins, 3 <em>Mo. </em>106 ; Weaver <em>v. </em>McElhenon, 13 <em>Ib. </em>89 ; State <em>v. </em>Burtis, 34 <em>Ib. </em>92; Ferguson <em>v. </em>Smith &amp; Dunham, 10 <em>Kans. </em>394; Martin <em>v. </em>Barron, 37 <em>Ib. </em>30; Jones\u2019s Estate, 27 <em>Penn. </em>336; Weber <em>v. </em>Davis, 5 <em>Allen, </em>393.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-7\"><em>Wehle &amp; Jordan </em>and <em>Henry Wehle, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY0\">I. A summons not addressed to a person, but served upon him, does not authorize his appearance in court (Gannon <em>v. </em>Myers, <em>Daily Reg. Nov. </em>19, 1886).</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-8\">II. A single letter, if a vowel, can form a name by itself (Garish, <em>v. </em>Alabama, 53 <em>Ala. </em>576; 18 <em>Alb. L. J. </em>505). Even if \u201cA.\u201d in A. Schwarz should stand merely as an initial, the defendant was not bound to assume that it-stood for his initial. The law assumes that every person has a Christian name and a surname, and requires that every person, whose name is known, must be proceeded against by that name. It was the absolute right of the defendant, when served with a summons of the court of common pleas, to disregard the same (Gardner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number><em>v. </em>Kraft, 52 <em>How. </em>99; Farnham <em>v. </em>Hildreth, 32 <em>Barb. </em>277; Patrick <em>v. </em>Solinger, 9 <em>Daly, </em>149; McCabe <em>v. </em>Doe, 2 <em>E. D. S. </em>64; Davenport <em>v. </em>Doady, 3 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>409; Frank <em>v. </em>Levie, 5 <em>Rob. </em>599; Van Vorhis <em>v. </em>Budd, 39 <em>Barb. </em>479; Finch <em>v. </em>Cocken, 3 <em>D. P. C. </em>678; Miller <em>v. </em>Foley, 28 <em>Barb. </em>630).</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-5\">in. There is no intimation upon the record, or otherwise, that any one but A. Schwarz was intended to be sued. There is no evidence offered to show that A. Schwarz, who made the promissory notes upon which the judgment was recovered in Philadelphia, has a name different from A. Schwarz, or that he is identical with the defendant. There is no intimation upon the record that <em>\u201cA\u201d </em>was intended as an initial, and hence this court must assume conclusively that \u201cA\u201d was intended as a name. It must be assumed that the common law governs the course of procedure in Pennsylvania, and the case of Kinnersley <em>v. </em>Nott (7 Dowling &amp; Loundes, 128) illustrates to what extent the common law adheres to the rule above quoted. Even if <em>\u201cA\u201d </em>is intended as an initial, it stands no more for Anton than it stands for Arthur or any other name commencing with \u201cA.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-6\">IV. It is the policy of the law that a person served with process should be aware that the process is intended for him, hence a designation of his name is required, and, even under the liberal course of procedure prescribed by our Code, where the name of the person to be served with process is unknown, it is necessary to add \u201ca description tending to identify him\u201d <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 51; Weil <em>v. </em>Martin, 1 <em>Civ. Pro. R. </em>133; <em>Pindar v. </em>Black, 4 <em>How. </em>95). Where the defendant is not thus named or identified, he is not bound to take cognizance of the process (Gardner <em>v. </em>Craft, 52 <em>How. </em>499; Muldoon <em>v. </em>Pierz, ] <em>Abb. </em>N. <em>C. </em>309; Horback <em>v. </em>Knox, 6 <em>Penn. St. </em>377).</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-7\">V. Proof of identityvwas not offered, and would have been inadmissible had it been offered. In actions on judgment against natural persons it is not permissible</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b196-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A0Z\">The judgment should be affirmed with costs on the opinion of the learned judge below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
