The facts were as follows : The plaintiff herein was arrested on a body execution in an action in the then Marine Court, September 4, 1882. He gave a bond for the jail liberties and was allowed on the limits. The judgment on which the execution was founded was for costs, and the execution upon which the arrest was made so stated. On December 13, 1882, the Marine Court judgment was satisfied by the execution of a satisfaction piece signed and acknowledged by T. C. McKennie, the attorney of record. On the same day the judgment was satisfied of record in the Marine Court and County Clerk\u2019s office. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>McKennie signed a paper requesting the sheriff to discharge the prisoner, Abraham Davis, from custody, and Davis\u2019 attorney caused this notice to be served at the sheriff\u2019s office. On a conflict of evidence as to whether this notice was left with the sheriff, the jury found for plaintiff. Some time in the latter part of December, 1882, and after the paper had been served, the sheriff\u2019s attorney and the under sheriff were informed' in the sheriff\u2019s office that the Marine Court judgment had been paid and satisfied of record; but no certificate of satisfaction was produced at the sheriff\u2019s office. At this time the paper was in the possession of the sheriff\u2019s office. On Saturday, January 6, 1883, at half-past ten at night, two deputy sheriffs arrested Davis, brought him to the door of Ludlow street jail, and then allowed him to go free on payment of ten dollars. The right to arrest was based on a remand order in the old Marine Court action, Sheriff Bowe\u2019s term of office being about to expire. The court charged the jury that the notice signed by McKennie was .sufficient to entitle Davis to a discharge, and defendant excepted. The jury found for plaintiff in the sum of six hundred dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-5\">There was no evidence in the case as to the value of the attorney\u2019s services in the action in which the body execution was issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-6\">The Court at General Term held <em>:\u2014\u201c </em>The costs of the successful party in all actions do not belong legally to the attorney.
