Clark, this defendant\u2019s testator; and set forth at length the complaint therein (the facts of which are fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>stated in the opinion of the court in the last reported case, <em>ante </em>p. 494); the entry of judgment therein that the assignment there in suit was void, and that plaintiffs recover the sum of $1,667.31; the death of the defendant therein, and the appointment of the defendant here as his executrix\u2014and proceeded as follows : \u201c That said Lemuel B. Clark deposited the $10,000 above mentioned in the Hanover National Bank, on or about February 23, 1886, to his own account, and paid these plaintiffs the $8,500 above mentioned therefrom; and that the balance of $1,500 remained therein ; and that as these plaintiffs are informed and believe, said Clark continued to make deposits to his said account and to draw therefrom, to the time of his death, and that the defendant herein, after obtaining letters testamentary, as above alleged and by virtue thereof, drew from said bank the sum of $3,000 or thereabouts, and closed said account of said Lemuel B. Clark with said bank. That payment of said sum of $1,500, with interest from February 25, 1886, has been demanded of said defendant herein, and that no part thereof or of said judgment has been paid. Wherefore these plaintiffs demand judgment against said defendant, that the above judgment be declared a lien upon the balance so drawn by her from said bank, to the extent of said $1,500, with interest from February 25, 1886, and directing her to pay the same; and that they have judgment against said defendant for the costs of this action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\">The defendant demurred to the complaint, upon the ground, among others, that it did not state facts showing a cause of action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-6\"><em>Horace W.

The judgment obtained was not against the defendant .therein in a fiduciary capacity, and the money of the plaintiffs was not held by the defendant in a fiduciary capacity, but wrongfully, and in flagrant violation of law. The money, unlawfully retained by him, had been mixed with his own, and had wholly lost its identity, and plaintiff\u2019s remedy depending on that judgment was against all the defendant\u2019s property by execution, not against any special portion thereof, on the theory of a special lien on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The judgment below is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Sedgwick, Ch.
