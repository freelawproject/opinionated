She was entitled to recover only for the damages that she personally had sustained. For the damages that her husband has sustained by reason of the acts of the defendants, he had a cause of action against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">We are of the opinion that the errors committed in the admission of this evidence, and in the refusal to charge as requested, and in the charge as made, to which an exception was taken, call for the reversal of this judgment and for the granting of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>We are also of the opinion that the complaint states, and that the evidence tended to prove a cause of action against all of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Judgment and order appealed from reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants, to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
