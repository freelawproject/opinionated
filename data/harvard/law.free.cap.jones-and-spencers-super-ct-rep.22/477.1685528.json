The orders of discontinuance were illegal, as well as irregular, and the illegality was such they could not be validated by mere lapse of time against the attorney injured thereby. <em>Code Civ.Proc., </em>\u00a7 55; Keenan <em>v. </em>Campbell, 1 <em>Law Bul. </em>18 ; Pilzer <em>v. </em>Gore, 12 <em>Abb. </em>244 ; Chadwick <em>v. </em>Snedeker, 26 <em>How. </em>260; Webb <em>v. </em>Dill, 18 <em>Abb. </em>264; Halsey <em>v. </em>Carter, 6 <em>Rob. </em>535; Miller <em>v. </em>Thall, 67 <em>Barb. </em>446.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-7\">II. The appellant, as assignee of the causes of action, as collateral to secure his agreed compensation and the indebtedness of the Neills to him of $2,100, for money loaned and other services, had the sole right to prosecute the actions and any interference therewith by the Neills and Van Wagenen, after the assignment, with notice to Van Wagenen, was necessarily and absolut\u00e9ly illegal, wrongful and fraudulent.

The suppression of the attorneys of Van Wagenen from the court, of the knowledge, that the consents were not signed by plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, was a fraud, on the court, amounting to something more than mere &lt;\u2022- irregularity.\u201d There is no limitation of time upon the power of the court in such cases.

Neither sections 1282, 1283 nor 1290 apply in such cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-5\">IY. \u201c Such an act as entering an order of discontinuance on the consent of the client, where he has an attorney, is something more than irregularity, it is a nullity.\u201d Jackson <em>v. </em>Smith, 16 <em>Abb. </em>201; Miller <em>v. </em>Thall, 67 <em>Barb. </em>446; Kellogg <em>v. </em>Hill, 62 <em>Ib. </em>280; Winnebrunner <em>v. </em>Edgerton, 8 <em>Abb. </em>419; Nugent <em>v. </em>Mulvy, 90 <em>How. </em>460; Bowe <em>v. </em>Mangold, 50 <em>Ib. </em>248; 2 <em>S. &amp; T.

While actions for equitable relief are ordinarily barred after the lapse of ten years; on motion, no limit of time restrains the court, after the action is commenced, from granting relief therein. <em>Code Civ.

Courts will always treat as sufficient a reasonable or satisfactory excuse for delay, which might otherwise be deemed laches, and will always exercise a tender and benevolent jurisdiction in seeking to protect their officers from loss of the fruits of their industry or skill, by fraud and collusion of adverse parties. Wade <em>v. </em>De Leyer, 40 <em>Super. Ct. </em>541; Dietz <em>v. </em>McCullum, 44 <em>How. Pr. </em>493.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-9\">VII. The delay of the appellant to seek judicial relief, by motion, was not an answer to his application on the state of facts shown on the motion below. Matter of Lord, 78 <em>N. Y. </em>114; Hackley <em>v. </em>Draper, 60 <em>Ib. </em>92; McLean <em>v. </em>Tompkins, 18 <em>Abb. </em>24; Hill <em>v. </em>Hemans, 59 N. <em>Y. </em>396 ; Truman <em>v. </em>Leland, 6 <em>Hill, </em>237; Booth <em>v. </em>Bank, 50 <em>N. Y. </em>396.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-10\">VIII. This court has recently held that the relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>asked for by appellant (for the court to vacate the orders of discontinuance and allow appellant to prosecute the actions) is the appropriate relief to be granted in such cases, and whereby the rights of all parties would be protected, without any shadow or degree of injustice. This relief being granted, the attorney would not be driven to a new action, as assignee of the claims against respondent, which would be clearly barred at this time by the statute of limitations.

Y. </em>114 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b502-7\"><em>Charles M. Marsh, </em>attorney, and of counsel for respondents, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asi\">I. The order of discontinuance was a judgment under the definition of the Code ; it was a final determination of the rights of the parties in that action. <em>Code, </em>\u00a7 1200 ; Crockett <em>v. </em>Smith, 14 <em>Abb. </em>62.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-8\">II. While the order of discontinuance was improperly granted it was an irregularity only, and this motion expressly states that it is to set aside the discontinuance as irregularly entered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-9\">III. The judgment or order of discontinuance is shown by the moving papers to have been entered and brought to the notice of the moving party on October 10, 1877, more than eight years ago.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-10\">IV. The Code provides: A motion to set aside a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>judgment for irregularity shall not he heard after the expiration of one year since the filing of the judgment roll, etc. \u00a7 1282.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-5\">Y. The motion should not be granted upon the merits. 1. There has been gross laches, in delaying for nine years to make this motion. In ordinary cases the law lias fixed six years within which an action upon contract can be brought. If the allegations in the moving affidavit, that not only was there an agreement for compensation, but the whole cause of action was assigned, is true, Randall could upon the discontinuing have at once brought a new action in his own name. He has neglected this for nearly nine years, and is now asking the court to aid him in evading the statute. 2. Conceding, for the argument, that Neill\u2019s consent to discontinue was unauthorized, yet by commencing his action Randall ratified or acknowledged the validity of the act. The foundation of that action was supposed to be a valid act by Neill in ending the suit. It is true that Randall, ignorant of his legal rights, supposed that he could by that election hold Yan Wagenen for damages he claimed to have sustained, but does not alter the fact that he elected to consider the discontinuance valid and binding.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b503-6\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Auh\">The appeal is from two orders made at special term denying the motion of the attorney of the plaintiffs in these actions to set aside the orders of discontinuance entered on consent of the plaintiffs. The orders of discontinuance were entered October 8, 1877. The amendment of section 66 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which gives to an attorney, from the commencement of the action, or the service of an answer;, containing a counterclaim, a lien upon his client\u2019s cause of action or counterclaim, was not passed until 1879. For this reason Whittaker <em>v. </em>N. Y. &amp; Harlem R. R. Co. (54 <em>Super. Ct. </em>8) does not help the appellant. As the law stood in 1877, the lien of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>appellant as attorney for his compensation extended only to the papers in his hands, and upon proof of a settlement privately effected between the parties with the design of defrauding the attorney, the court could have insisted upon the payment to him of a reasonable compensation before granting a discontinuance. The actions were settled and discontinued by and between the parties and the orders of discontinuance entered, without notice to the appellant. This was clearly irregular so far as he wa's concerned, and upon his motion the orders of discontinuance might have been set aside. But the orders were not a nullity. They were good as between the parties, and the appellant could ratify them by acquiescence. Copies of the orders of discontinuance were served on the appellant on October 10, 1877, and for about eight years he did acquiesce. Moreover he elected to pursue another remedy. He brought an action in this court against Van Wagenen and the two Neills,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> in which he alleged that by a parol assignment the Neills had assigned to him all their right, title and interest in and to the causes of action upon which the above entitled actions had been brought; that notice of this assignment had been given to Van Wagenen ; and that Van Wagenen and the Neills had conspired together to defraud him and fraudulently had settled the said actions and procured them to be discontinued. He also averred that in consequence of said conspiracy and fraud he had sustained damages to the amount of ten thousand dollars, and he prayed judgment for that amount. The orders of discontinuance were thus made' the basis of the action brought by the appellant, and consequently the bringing of the action was in affirmance of the orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Upon this state of facts the motion made by the appellant after the lapse of eight years to have the orders of discontinuance set aside, was properly denied. More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>over he was not injured by the said orders so far as his interest related to the indebtedness due to him by the Neills or to the causes of action which had been assigned to him. He could have enforced his rights in these respects in proper actions notwithstanding the discontinuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">O\u2019Gorman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b504-6\"> See following case in this volume.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
