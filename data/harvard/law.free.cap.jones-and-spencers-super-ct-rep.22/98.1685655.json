There was no evidence that his case would have been sooner disposed of had he not been so removed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b120-7\"><em>Held, </em>not sufficient to sustain an <em>action </em>of false imprisonment against such court officer.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b120-8\">Before Sedgwick, Ch. J., Freedman and Ingraham, JJ.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b120-9\"><em>Decided December </em>17, 1886.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-10\">Appeal by plaintiff from judgment entered on verdict in favor of defendant, directed by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-11\">Action for false imprisonment brought by the plaintiff against the defendant who, at the time of the matters complained of, was an assistant to the clerk of a police court in this city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-12\">The plaintiff alleged in his complaint, that on April 12, 1884, the defendant, by the aid of a police officer, forcibly compelled him to enter a room adjoining a police court room in the twelfth ward of this city, in which criminals and those accused of crime are imprisoned while awaiting trial or hearing, and caused him to be therein imprisoned for about thirty minutes without any right or authority, and to his damage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-13\">Further facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b120-14\"><em>Sackett, Lang, Reed </em>and <em>McKenna, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b120-16\"><em>Gratz Nathan, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ABh\">This action was brought to recover damages for false imprisonment. To sustain the action, plaintiff must prove an unlawful restraint of his liberty by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Plaintiff was charged with an assault on a person engaged in erecting a telegraph pole in front of plaintiff\u2019s premises, was arrested by a police officer, and taken to the police court by said officer, and was under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">His imprisonment was caused by the arrest, such imprisonment continuing until his discharge. Whether he should be permitted to remain in the court-room or taken to an adjoining room where prisoners were usually kept, was within the discretion of the officer. He was in either place in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The direction to the police officer to remove plaintiff from the court-room to the room kept for the confinement of prisoners, until his case could be heard by the magistrate, was not therefore an illegal restraint of plaintiff\u2019s person. There was no evidence that plaintiff\u2019s case would have been sooner disposed of if he had not been removed. He was only kept in the prisoners\u2019 room a few moments, when he was brought before the magistrate and committed for trial. Plaintiff was just as much restrained of his liberty before the direction as after, the detention being in a different place.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">It is clear, from all the evidence, that plaintiff\u2019s conduct in the courtroom was such as disturbed the proceedings of the court, and it was the duty of the officers of the court to preserve order. The direction given by the defendant was simply the proper performance of that duty; and it is, to say the least, a novel proposition that the fact that the prisoner\u2019s preference as to the particular place of his confinement was not consulted would give him a cause of action as against the officer selecting such place of detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
