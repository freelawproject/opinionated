On October 14, 1875, the said lots were sold at public auction for the lowest term of years at which any person or persons offered to take the same in consideration of advancing the said assessment, together with interest thereon from the time of its confirmation to the time of sale, together with the charges of the sale. On June 15, 1883, a tax or assessment lease from the corporation of the city of New York was given to the purchaser at said sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-6\">On the trial the court directed a verdict for the plaintiff, and ordered the exceptions to be heard in the first instance at the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-7\"><em>John </em>Townshend, attorney, and of counsel for plaintiff, argued :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajq\">That the ordinance authorizing the work for which the assessment was laid was not duly advertised was an irregularity only. The legislature might have authorized an assessment without any publication of the ordinance ; the legislature has therefore the power to validate retrospectively an assessment made without any publication (2 <em>Desty on Taxation, </em>617 ; <em>Cooley on Taxation, </em>229 ; Tifft <em>v. </em>City of Buffalo, 82 <em>N.

(a) The assessment was confirmed June 30, 1871, and the legislature, by Laws 1872, ch. 580, \u00a7 7, amended by Laws 1874, ch. 313, validated such assessment and the sale was October, 1875.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-8\"><em>J.

In defending our property against an action that seeks to divest us, for a thousand years, of its possession and use, we are protected by the constitution in every defense (Lennon <em>v. </em>Mayor, 55 <em>N. Y. </em>366).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b93-8\">By the Court.\u2014Truax, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWJ\">The evidence shows that the corporate authorities wholly neglected and failed to appoint newspapers in which corporation ordinances should he published as required by section 20 of the charter of 1870.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>For this reason the original assessment was invalid <em>(In re </em>Douglass, 46 N. <em>Y. </em>42 ; Lennon <em>v. </em>Mayor, 55 <em>Ib. </em>364). And the only question is, was the invalidity of the assessment cured by section 7 of chapter 580 of the Laws of 1872, as amended by chapter 313 of the Laws of 1874 (See also \u00a7\u00a7 897, 899, chap. 410, Laws 1882).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">It has never been determined in this state whether the legislature can render valid, assessments which were void when made. But it was determined in the Lennon case that if the assessment in question has not been made valid, the defendants may resist its collection or may dispute the title of any purchaser who may claim by virtue of a sale had under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">It was also determined in that case that even if the legislature could render valid such an assessment, it could only render it valid from the time of the passage of the validating act, for it must be upheld, if at all, as an exercise of the power of taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In this case, there was no valid assessment and no authority to sell the property, or any interest therein, until after the passage of the Act of 1872, which was on the seventh day of May in that year. But the sale was made in consideration of the assessment and the interest thereon from the time of the confirmation of the said assessment to the time of the sale. Now if the assessment was valid only from the day the Act of 1872 was passed, then the interest should have been only from that day and not from the day when the assessment was confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The sale then was made for more than was justly due, and for that reason it is not a valid sale <em>(Blackwell\u2019s Tax Titles, </em>p. 159 <em>et seq).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">The defendants\u2019 exceptions should be sustained, and a new trial ordered with costs to the defendants to abide the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., and O\u2019Gorman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
