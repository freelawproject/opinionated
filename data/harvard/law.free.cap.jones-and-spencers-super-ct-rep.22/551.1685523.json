This testimony was contradicted by the appellant. The appellant then sought 0 to show that as a matter of fact he had at the time this ^statement was alleged to have been made more than the sum of three or four thousand dollars in the bank\u2014and questions tending to show that such was the fact were asked, and under the objection of the respondent, excluded.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b573-11\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"AqF1\">\u201c.....There was no error in so excluding this evidence. It did not prove, nor did it tend to prove, that the appellant had not made the statement which it was alleged that he had made. The record fails to show an exception that constitutes a ground for reversal, and the verdict cannot be held to be against evidence or the weight of evidence.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>T.
