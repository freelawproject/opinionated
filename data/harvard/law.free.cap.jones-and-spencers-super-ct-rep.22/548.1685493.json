Defendant afterwards removed the boat from the place where it had been laid up by him to another place, from which it drifted, went ashore and became a total wreck. Defendant testified that he was employed by the plaintiff to look after the boat during the whole winter, and in the exercise of the general license and powers thus conferred on him, he continued in charge of the boat, and in the exercise of his best judgment removed the boat from where she had been first placed by him, and that her loss was the result of an accident, and not of any negligence or wrong doing for which he was to blame. The trial judge charged the jury that the plaintiff, in order to recover, should establish the wrongful taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>of the boat, and for that purpose it was enough to establish a taking by defendant without authority or the color of authority. To this instruction counsel for plaintiff excepted, on the ground that it was sufficient for plaintiff to prove that he owned the boat, and that defendant took it away, and that the <em>onus </em>of proving license in defendant rested on him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-5\">The Court at General Term (after stating the facts as above), said:\u2014\u201c This exception is not well taken. The action is for a wrongful taking of the boat about January 15, 1885. That the defendant had a right to the possession of the boat by the consent and direction of the plaintiff up to the latter part of December, 1884, is testified to by plaintiff himself...... That such authority did not continue was the gist of the action, and the foundation of plaintiff\u2019s claim; and unless that discontinuance was proved, the plaintiff could not recover. The plaintiff did, in his own testimony at the trial, give evidence that the defendant\u2019s authority over the boat did not continue, but ceased by his full discharge in the latter part of December. In this he was contradicted by the defendant and by witnesses examined on his behalf, and the question was \u00ableft to the jury to decide on all the evidence. The affirmative of that issue was clearly with the plaintiff, and the trial on his part was conducted under that theory.....\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b571-7\"><em>Charles E.
