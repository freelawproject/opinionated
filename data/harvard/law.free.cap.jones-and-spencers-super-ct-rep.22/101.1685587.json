At the time of execution of this agreement plaintiff paid to defendant $500 of said $1,900. On the day fixed for the consummation of the contract defendant refused to complete. Thereupon plaintiff brought this action to recover said $500. Defendant denied his liability therefor, and pleaded a counter-claim of $442.65 for expenses incurred in the examination of title, surveying the property, and broker\u2019s fees on the sale of his property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-6\">The cause was tried before the court without a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-7\">On the trial of the action the following stipulation was made and signed by the parties: \u201cIt is agreed</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-8\">that on the day of the closing of the title, tender was made by plaintiff, and that defendant refused to take the real estate mentioned in the contract, on the ground that the wall of the owner adjoining on the East side encroached between 8 and 12 inches on plaintiff\u2019s land, and thereupon the contract was rescinded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-9\">\u201c It is further stipulated that plaintiff has demanded of defendant the $500, claimed in his complaint, and that payment thereof was refused, and that there is no dispute as to the amount of each respective item mentioned in defendant\u2019s bill of particulars, but plaintiff disputes defendant\u2019s right to recover any part thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-10\">The learned judge before whom the cause was tried rendered a decision in favor of the plaintiff, on which judgment was entered adjudging that plaintiff recover of defendant $560, with $76.34 costs, amounting in all to $636.34.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-11\">From this judgment defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>Souther &amp; Stedman, </em>attorneys, and <em>C. E. Souther, </em>of counsel for appellant, on the questions considered in the opinion, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao3\">I. The contract was not a \u201c contract of exchange,\u201d and by this error the case below throughout was permeated and infected (Wilcox <em>v. </em>Randall, 7 <em>Barb. </em>638; 3 <em>R. S. [Throop\u2019s </em>ed.], 2197, \u00a7 3). Not being an \u201c exchange,\u201d it was simply the instrument to an ordinary transfer of real estate (from defendant as vendor), where the consideration therefor (from plaintiff as vendee was to be part money and part land; and the case is wholly without evidence that \u201c it was mutually rescinded;\u201d or that it \u201cwas agreed to he rescinded, and was rescinded by the parties; \u201d or that \u201c it was thereupon rescinded by mutual consent.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-5\">The breach by plaintiff conferred on defendant the right of rescission, \u201c thereupon the contract was rescinded,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>of course, by defendant, as the only one having that right, and by him simply because if plaintiff could not pay for the thing, defendant need not continue bound to sell it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b125-6\"><em>Kelly &amp; Macrae, </em>attorneys, and <em>Wm. F. Macrae, </em>of counsel for respondent, on the questions considered in the opinion, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUV\">I. The defendant having backed out from the contract, and the contract having been rescinded by consent, the parties were placed in <em>statu quo, </em>and defendant was hound to refund the $500 (Green <em>v. </em>Green, 9 <em>Cow. </em>50; Thrasher <em>v. </em>Bentley, 2 <em>T. &amp; C. </em>309 ; Weaver <em>v. </em>Bentley, 1 <em>Caines, </em>47; Utter <em>v. </em>Stuart, 30 <em>Barb. </em>20 ; Cockroft <em>v. </em>N. Y. &amp; N. H. R. R., 69 <em>N. Y. </em>207; Tice <em>v. </em>Zinsser, 76 <em>Ib. </em>552 ; Graves <em>v. </em>White, 87 <em>Ib. </em>463 ; Bigler <em>v. </em>Morgan, 77 <em>Ib. </em>312).</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-7\">BE. The defendant entirely mistakes the law applicable to this case in his insistence on his counter-claim for expenses. The rescission absolutely foreclosed and cut off any claim of that kind. It is only on the theory of a breach of an obligatory contract that defendant\u2019s ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>penses could be counter-claimed, and as the rescission entirely abrogated the contract no breach can be assigned as against either party predicated thereon (Bigler <em>v. </em>Morgan, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b126-5\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AL8\">The stipulation made and signed by the parties showed that the contract was rescinded. This presumptively meant a mutual rescission, and, in the absence of evidence rebutting the presumption, justified the finding that the rescission was by mutual agreement. This being so, although the contract was not strictly one for the exchange of real estate, the plaintiff became entitled to recover back what he had paid on account of the contract and the defendant could not maintain recoupment. There cannot be a rescission in part and an affirmance in part. The learned judge below was therefore right in the determination made by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
