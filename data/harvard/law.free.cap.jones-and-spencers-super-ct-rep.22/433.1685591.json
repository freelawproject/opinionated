Y. </em>254, say:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AzY\">&gt; _ \u201c The defendant, desiring to remove two large cases of merchandise from his store in the city of New York, placed a pair of skids from a truck across the sidewalk to the steps of the store...... The defendant had the right to place the skids across the sidewalk temporarily for the purpose of removing the cases of merchandise. Every one doing business along a street, in a populous city, must have such a right, to be exercised in a reasonable manner so as not to unnecessarily incumber and obstruct the sidewalk.\u201d In this and the case at bar, although the facts are not precisely the same, yet they are similar in their main features, and in principle analogous.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">The trial judge in the case at bar, was justified in charging as he did, that the act of the defendant\u2019s driver, in placing his wagon on the sidewalk, was not, <em>per se, </em>unlawful under all the circumstances of the case. He clearly and carefully instructed them that the defendant was liable for any negligence of his driver in the management of his horse while the wagon was on the sidewalk. This was all that the plaintiff was entitled to ; and this and the other exceptions to the judge\u2019s charge, are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs ; and the order denying the motion for a new trial should be affirmed..</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
