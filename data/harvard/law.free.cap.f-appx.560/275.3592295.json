Mayo alleged that the defendants had violated his constitutional rights and Article 21.11 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-23\">The Pasadena Police Department and the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Department filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 12(b)(6). Meanwhile, Mayo filed motions for leave to file first, second, and third amended complaints, and the defendants responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-24\">On April 8, 2013, the district court denied Mayo\u2019s motions for leave to amend his complaint and also dismissed Mayo\u2019s lawsuit with prejudice and entered final judgment. On May 10, 2013, Mayo filed a motion to reinstate the case. On May 28, 2013, the district court denied Mayo\u2019s motion to reinstate, which the district court construed as a FRCP 60 motion for relief from judgment. On June 10, 2013, Mayo filed a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s April 8, 2013 order and final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-25\">Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A), a notice of appeal must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>usually be filed within 30 days of the judgment or order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, there are certain exceptions to this rule. As relevant to this appeal, under Rule 4(a)(4), if a party files a motion \u201cfor relief under [FRCP] 60 ... no later than 28 days after judgment is entered,\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> then \u201cthe time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In other words, the 30-day deadline begins to run after the resolution of the FRCP 60 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">To the extent Mayo tries to appeal the April 8th order and final judgment, he has failed to timely appeal. Mayo did not meet the 30-day deadline set out by Rule 4(a)(1)(A). The notice of appeal was filed on June 10, 2013 \u2014 63 days after the order and final judgment. Moreover, Mayo\u2019s motion to reinstate, which the district court construed as a FRCP 60 motion, failed to delay the running of the deadline clock under Rule 4(a)(4). Mayo filed his FRCP 60 motion on May 10, 2013 \u2014 32 days after the judgment. As a result, Mayo\u2019s notice of appeal filed on June 10, 2013 was untimely. Since a timely filed notice of appeal is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an appellate court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we lack jurisdiction over the appeal as to the April 8th order and final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">To the extent Mayo tries to appeal the May 28th order denying his FRCP 60 motion, his appeal still fails. Rule 3(c)(1)(B) requires that a notice of appeal \u201cdesignate the judgment, order or part thereof being appealed.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rule 4(a)(4)(B)(ii) provides that \u201c[a] party intending to challenge an order disposing of any motion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A), or a judgment\u2019s alteration or amendment upon such a motion, must file a notice of appeal, or an amended notice of appeal \u2014 in compliance with Rule 3(c) \u2014 within the time prescribed by this Rule measured from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mayo\u2019s notice of appeal states that it is an appeal \u201cfrom the dismissal hearing (Docket Entries No. 5, 7) that his lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice and leave to amend would be futile. This is a final judgment signed by Honorable Judge Lee H. Rosenthal on April 08, 2013.\u201d Thus, Mayo only designated the April 8th order and final judgment, and not the May 28th order. As a result, we lack jurisdiction over the appeal as to the May 28th order as well.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">It is true that even though we require a separate notice of appeal as to the FRCP 60 motion, \u201c[w]e construe this requirement liberally\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that \u201ca brief may serve as the \u2018functional equivalent\u2019 of an appeal if it is filed within the time specified by [Rule 4] and gives the notice required by [Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>3].\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Even under this liberal construction, however, Mayo\u2019s brief does not constitute a timely notice of appeal as to the May 28th order. The FRCP 60 motion was denied on May 28, 2013, but Mayo\u2019s brief was not filed until September 26, 2013 at the earliest. This does not comply with the 30-day deadline under Rule 4(a)(1)(A). Therefore, we still lack jurisdiction over the May 28th order.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Plaintiffs appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
