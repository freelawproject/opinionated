Torres contends that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-20\">We review objections to the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). When the district court has imposed a sentence that varies from the guidelines range, reasonableness review requires that we evaluate whether the sentence \u201cunreasonably fails to reflect the statutory sentencing factors\u201d set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-21\">The record indicates that the district court properly considered the arguments of counsel in mitigation of sentence and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Contrary to Torres\u2019s assertion, nothing in the record indicates that the district court ignored counsel\u2019s mitigation arguments. The court specifically stated that it had taken into account the allocution of the parties, as well as the factual information contained within the presentence report. Further, the 36-month sentence reflected Torres\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to promote respect for the law, and the need to protect the public and deter future crimes. The sentence imposed was reasonable under the totality of the circumstances, <em>see United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008), and the district court did not abuse its discretion in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>see United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). The sentence was nine months above the top of the advisory guidelines sentencing range. We have upheld variances considerably greater than the increase to Torres\u2019s sentence. <em>E.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number><em>Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 349-50; <em>United States v.
