In her petition, Lin argues that the BIA erred by ignoring evidence that demonstrates that conditions have materially changed in China with respect to the enforcement of the one-child policy. After thorough review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-25\">Lin, a native of Changle City, Fujian Province, illegally entered the United States in May 2003 and has since given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>birth to two children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 4, 2007, Lin submitted an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), on the grounds that she opposed China\u2019s coercive birth control policies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) served her with a Notice to Appear, charging her as removable as an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Following a merits hearing in November 2008, the Immigration Judge (IJ) denied Lin\u2019s application for asylum as untimely. The IJ further found that there were no changed country conditions to excuse the untimely application. Alternatively, the IJ found that Lin failed to demonstrate an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution. Lin appealed to the BIA, which dismissed the appeal on September 30, 2009,</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">On November 3, 2009, Lin filed her first motion to reopen, arguing that new evidence sufficiently demonstrated changed country conditions in China with respect to the enforcement of the one-child policy. The BIA denied Lin relief. We subsequently denied Lin\u2019s petition for review, holding that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lin\u2019s first motion to reopen because the evidence she submitted was available during her 2008 merits hearing, or was unauthenticated and incomplete. <em>See Lin et al. v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>429 Fed.Appx. 923, 927 (11th Cir.2011) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">In February 2013, Lin filed a second motion to reopen her proceedings. The BIA denied the motion, concluding that much of the evidence Lin submitted predated her removal hearing and thus did not constitute new evidence. Moreover, the BIA found the new evidence attached to Lin\u2019s second motion to reopen was substantially similar to the evidence the BIA previously had considered and was not sufficiently material, even considered cumulatively, to justify reopening her proceedings. This is Lin\u2019s petition for review of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-14\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen an immigration petition for an abuse of discretion. <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). Our review \u201cis limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The moving party bears a heavy burden, <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 813 (11th Cir.2006), as motions to reopen are disfavored, especially in removal proceedings, <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">A party may only file one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A)-(B). A \u201cmotion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal,\u201d subject to cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>tain exceptions. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). The time and number limits do not apply if the motion to reopen is \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">Here, Lin does not dispute that her second motion to reopen was untimely and numerically barred. Thus, Lin\u2019s motion was due to be denied unless she could show by previously unavailable evidence a material change in country conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">We cannot say that the BIA acted arbitrarily or capriciously in denying Lin\u2019s second motion to reopen. In the first instance, the BIA properly discounted a significant amount of background evidence Lin submitted because that material was not previously unavailable. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">As to the new evidence Lin attached to her second motion to reopen, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that this evidence was substantially similar to the evidence that Lin previously had submitted, and, therefore, did not show a material change in country conditions in China regarding the enforcement, of the one-child policy. For instance, a 2012 Report from the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada and the 2010 Annual Report for the Congressional-Executive Commission on China show that Chinese officials have consistently \u2014 both before and after Lin\u2019s November 2008 merits hearing \u2014 used coercion, sometimes including forced sterilization and abortion, to enforce its family planning policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Lin contends that the BIA abused its discretion by ignoring official documents from China that were not authenticated, including 2010 government documents from the Changle City Family Planning and Leadership Group. That was not an abuse of discretion, however, because official documents are required to be authenticated in BIA proceedings, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1287.6, and we have held that \u201c[u]nau-thenticated documents lack veracity and are entitled to no deference,\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>672 F.3d 961, 964 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">In any event, the BIA did not ignore the unauthenticated official documents, but rather concluded that these documents discussed general trends in family planning policies in certain towns in Changle City. For instance, Lin submitted unauthenticated local government reports from the towns of Tantou and Jinfeng. Although these documents highlight a general re-commitment to the one-child policy in various townships in Changle City, they do not show substantially increased enforcement of the one-child policy or other material change in country conditions since Lin\u2019s merits hearing in 2008. Notably, Lin has failed to include any documentation from her local town, Yingqian, to show that individuals like Lin would suffer persecution. <em>Cf. Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319-20 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that reopening may be warranted if the evidence presented shows undisputed evidence that the one-child policy is enforced more stringently in the alien\u2019s locality).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">Lin\u2019s argument that the BIA failed to fully consider all the supporting documents attached to her second motion to reconsider also is unavailing. The BIA was not required to analyze each piece of evidence individually, so long as the agency gave reasoned consideration to Lin\u2019s second motion to reopen and made adequate findings, which it did. <em>Seck v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>663 F.3d 1356, 1364 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>Finally, although Lin argues at considerable length that we should remand as the Seventh Circuit recently did in <em>Ni v. Holder, </em>715 F.3d 620 (7th Cir.2013), her reliance on this case is misplaced. First, <em>Ni </em>is not binding on this Circuit. More importantly, unlike the situation in <em>Ni, id. at </em>624-30, the record in this case shows that the BIA gave reasoned consideration to the new evidence that Lin submitted with her second motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">In sum, because Lin did not show materially changed country conditions with respect to the enforcement of the family planning policy against parents of U.S.born children in Changle City, Fujian Province since her 2008 removal hearing, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying her second motion to reopen. Accordingly, we deny Lin\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-9\">.
