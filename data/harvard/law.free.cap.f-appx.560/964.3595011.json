He now appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-20\">On appeal, Solomon argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance at sentencing by misunderstanding the applicable law, directing the District Court\u2019s attention to Solomon\u2019s criminal history, and failing to highlight factors that supported a downward variance from the Guidelines sentence range. He also argues that the District Court plainly erred when it considered a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) citing, in its criminal history section, four arrests unaccompanied by information regarding the circumstances of the arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-21\">We do not consider Solomon\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel argument because the record, as it would relate to that argument, is entirely undeveloped. Claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel are, almost without exception, developed in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. 2255. <em>See United States v. Patterson, </em>595 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2010). We therefore move to Solomon\u2019s plain error argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-22\">An appellant establishes plain error by showing that: \u201c(1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error affected substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>661 F.3d 568, 583 (11th Cir.2011). If he can also establish that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceeding, we have discretion to vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>If the \u201cexplicit language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Solomon points us to no such authority holding that a district court errs simply by looking at a presentence report that cites arrests unaccompanied by information regarding the circumstances of the arrests. This no doubt explains why he did not object to his sentence when, following its imposition, the court asked him if he had any objections. Since no statute or rule or controlling judicial precedent informed the District Court that it would be committing error if it looked at Solomon\u2019s presentence report, no error and therefore no plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
