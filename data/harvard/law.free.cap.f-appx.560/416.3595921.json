Specifically, he challenges only the written judgment\u2019s requirement that he contribute a minimum of $35 per month toward the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>cost of his participation in a substance abuse treatment program which is higher than the $25 orally pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Chandler had no opportunity at sentencing to object to the special conditions of supervised release in the written judgment; therefore, review is for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Bigelow, </em>462 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2006). The sentencing transcript reflects that the district court orally instructed Chandler to contribute at least $25 per month toward the cost of his substance abuse treatment services. As the Government concedes, an actual conflict exists between the oral and written judgments. <em>See United States v. Wheeler, </em>322 F.3d 823, 828 (5th Cir.2003). Therefore, the oral pronouncement of sentence controls. <em>See Bigelow, </em>462 F.3d at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s unopposed motion to reform the judgment is GRANTED. We MODIFY the district court\u2019s judgment to reference minimum monthly payments of $25 for Chandler\u2019s participation in a substance abuse treatment program during his term of supervised release. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106. We AFFIRM the judgment as modified. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 369 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">AFFIRM as modified; GRANT motion to reform.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b439-8\">HAYNES, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ap3\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">I concur in the court\u2019s judgment. I write separately simply to note that this situation appears to be either a \u201cclear error\u201d of the type referenced in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a) or a \u201cclerical error\u201d as described in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36. In my view, it would have made more sense to raise the matter with the district court through a motion under one of those rules than to take the time and expense of filing an appeal and accompanying brief in our court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
