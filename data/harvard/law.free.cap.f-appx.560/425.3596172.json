Nor does he address the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal as it pertained to the IJ\u2019s denial of his request for protection under the CAT. Carranza therefore has abandoned any challenge to the denial of such relief. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-24\">Carranza challenges, on several grounds, the denial of his applications for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>asylum and withholding of removal insofar as he sought relief based on his membership in the purported social group of persons who had involuntarily become collaborators with the Gulf Cartel and whom the Cartel believes had betrayed them. We review the BIA\u2019s order and will consider the underlying decision of the IJ to the extent that it influenced the BIA\u2019s determination. <em>Sharma v. Holder, </em>729 F.3d 407, 411 (5th Cir.2013). The BIA\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">In his petition for review, Carranza places undue emphasis on the BIA\u2019s use of the term \u201ctype\u201d when it stated that Carranza \u201cha[d] not demonstrated membership in the type of \u2018social group\u2019 for which the immigration laws provide protection from persecution.\u201d When read in context, the BIA\u2019s statement effectively adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning that the group lacked the particularity and social visibility requirements for protection under the Act. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). Carranza presents no substantive argument in his petition for review that his claimed group satisfied the particularity and social visibility requirements to constitute a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). He thus has abandoned this issue. <em>See Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 833. Further, even if this court considered the latter issue, Carranza could not show that the BIA erred in concluding that the claimed group did not constitute a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the Act. <em>See Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 521-22 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">This court lacks jurisdiction to review the Attorney General\u2019s discretionary decision regarding cancellation of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>see Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004); \u00a7 1229b(a). Although Carranza contends that he has presented legal arguments not subject to the jurisdiction-stripping provision of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), we need not consider his arguments because they essentially challenge the basis for the discretionary denial of his claim for cancellation of removal. <em>See Delgado-Reynua v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 596, 600 (5th Cir.2006). To the extent Carranza raises a due process challenge in relation to the denial of cancellation of removal, that claim is unavailing as \u201c[eligibility for discretionary relief from a removal order is not a liberty or property interest warranting due process protection.\u201d <em>Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 219 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Carranza\u2019s unopposed motion requesting that this court take judicial notice of the BIA\u2019s decision denying his motion to reconsider is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
