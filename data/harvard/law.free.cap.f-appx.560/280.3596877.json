Lacour has moved for leave to withdraw and has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Lacour has filed a response. The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Lacour\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel; such a claim generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-21\">As to Lacour\u2019s conviction and sentence for wire fraud in case number 12-51267, we have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Lacour\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-22\">As to Lacour\u2019s revocation of probation in case number 13-50010, Lacour has completed his 24-month sentence. No further term of probation or supervised release was imposed upon revocation. Thus, Lac-our\u2019s appeal of the revocation of probation and sentence is moot. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). Accordingly, as to case number 12-51267, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. As to case number 13-50010, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
