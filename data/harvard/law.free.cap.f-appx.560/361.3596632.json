Estelle, </em>503 F.Supp. 1265 (S.D.Tex.1980), <em>aff'd in part and vacated in part </em>679 F.2d 1115 (5th Cir.), <em>amended in part and vacated in part </em>688 F.2d 266 (5th Cir.1982). He argues that the district court erred when it treated his suit as an independent complaint, rather than as an enforcement action arising under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 and Rule 70(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. He argues that the district court erred when it failed to enforce the standing orders in <em>Ruiz </em>and that it also engaged in racially discriminatory behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-22\">The district court dismissed Simmons\u2019s action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) as frivolous, finding that it lacked an arguable basis in fact. This court\u2019s precedent is inconsistent as to whether a Section 1915A(b)(l) dismissal is reviewed de novo or for abuse of discretion. <em>See Morris v. McAllester, </em>702 F.3d 187, 189 (5th Cir.2012). However, there is no need to resolve the discrepancy. Even under the more stringent de nov\u00f3 standard, Simmons fails to show any error by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-23\">Simmons has made no attempt to show that he was entitled to mandamus under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Section 1651. It is clear that the remedy for a claim of denial of access to the courts is instead a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>400 F.3d 277, 280 (5th Cir.2005). To the extent that Simmons seeks enforcement of the <em>Ruiz </em>decree through a Section 1983 action, the district court properly dismissed his claim as frivolous. The <em>Ruiz </em>decree, by itself, does not create constitutional rights that may be vindicated in Section 1983 suits by individual prisoners. <em>Green v. McKaskle, </em>788 F.2d 1116, 1123 (5th Cir.1986); <em>see also Sanders v. Johnson, </em>2001 WL 872796 at *1 (5th Cir. July 6, 2001) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">To the extent that Simmons asserted a claim of denial of access to the courts, he failed to state a claim. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). Although Simmons alleges that defendant J.D. Seigle removed law books from the law library, he does not indicate how the removal of those books personally harmed him. The claim is abandoned due to inadequate briefing. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Finally, Simmons raised claims of racism and misconduct by the district judge in his motion to alter or amend the judgment in the district court. The district court implicitly denied those claims. He has not shown that the district court erred in denying these claims as they are purely speculative. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Because Simmons\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Simmons\u2019s motion as frivolous and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Ade-pegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Simmons is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes he will no longer be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
