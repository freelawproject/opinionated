In a complaint brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, the appellants made a number of claims, including a claim that the conditions to which they were subjected during the search violated their Eighth Amendment rights. A majority of the claims were dismissed as frivolous; however, the Eighth Amendment claims against Warden Clay and Major Castro were allowed to proceed. Claims against Warden Clay in her official capacity and against Captain Saenz, for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, also were allowed to proceed. The appellees filed a motion for summary judgment arguing, primarily, that they were entitled to qualified immunity. The magistrate judge determined that the Eighth Amendment claims should be dismissed because the conditions alleged were not sufficiently objectively harmful to form the basis of an Eighth Amendment violation. The instant appeal follows the district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s determination and granting the appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The appellants first argue that the magistrate judge improperly adjudicated the motion for summary judgment without fully airing their discovery requests, which prevented them from putting forth their best case. Discovery issues are left to the sound discretion of the district court and will not be reversed unless they are arbitrary or clearly unreasonable. <em>McCreary v. Richardson, </em>738 F.3d 651, 654 (5th Cir.2013). The magistrate judge gave full consideration to the appellants\u2019 original discovery motion, and the denial of the motion left little doubt about the likelihood of obtaining the information requested in the amended discovery motion. Although the case had been pending for over a year, the amended discovery motion was not filed until well after the original discovery motion was denied. No abuse of discretion has been shown. See <em>McCreary, </em>738 F.3d at 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Regarding the merits of the case, the appellants argue that given the district court\u2019s general acceptance of their version of the facts, \u201cit is all the more distressing that the trial court found nothing in these allegations that rose to a threshold of constitutional violation.\u201d They argue that \u201cwillfully and intentionally locking prisoners on a sun-exposed concrete slab for six hours with no means or access of protecting themselves, resulting in second-degree sunburn\u201d is not constitutionally permissible conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010). All facts and inferences are construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Id. </em>Summary judgment is appropriate where the \u201cmovant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">To establish an Eighth Amendment violation based on prison conditions, a prisoner must show (1) that the deprivation alleged was sufficiently serious so as to result in the denial of the minimal civi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>lized measure of life\u2019s necessities, and (2) that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to his' health or safety. <em>Herman v. Holiday, </em>238 F.3d 660, 664 (5th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994)). The first showing requires the prisoner to demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s act or omission was \u201cobjectively serious\u201d and that it exposed him to a \u201csubstantial risk of serious harm.\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970. The second showing requires a demonstration that the defendant had a \u201csufficiently culpable state of mind\u201d and, thus, was deliberately indifferent to inmate health or safety. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The magistrate judge determined that the appellants failed to make the required showing of objective conditions which subjected them to a substantial risk of serious harm. Conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm are those that result in the \u201cextreme deprivation\u201d of humane conditions. <em>Gates v. Cook, </em>376 F.3d 323, 332-33 (5th Cir.2004). While evidence of a past medical injury \u201cwould clearly strengthen\u201d a plaintiffs case, a plaintiff does not have to show a medical injury to substantiate his claims. <em>Id. </em>at 341. In <em>Gates, </em>376 F.3d at 334, we affirmed the district court\u2019s conclusion that the conditions presented a substantial risk of serious harm where temperatures averaged in the nineties with high humidity, the facility primarily was not air conditioned, the ventilation was inadequate, and the probability of heat related illness was extreme.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The conditions alleged by the appellants are not on par with any that we have recognized as violative of the Eighth Amendment. Although the appellants contend that it has become \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that exposure to the sun can result in skin cancer, they offer no authority establishing that there exists a \u201cclearly established\u201d constitutional right to be free from exposure to the sun. <em>See Williams, </em>736 F.3d at 688 (noting that the constitutional right allegedly abridged must be clearly established); <em>see also Burleson v. Tex. Dep\u2019t Criminal Justice, </em>393 F.3d 577, 590 (5th Cir.2004) (affirming magistrate judge\u2019s ruling of no constitutional violation where there was no evidence that the prisoner\u2019s exposure to thoriated tungsten posed a substantial risk of harm). Moreover, the relatively brief duration of the appellants\u2019 exposure to the sun does not mitigate in their favor. <em>Cf. Hutto v. Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 686-87, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978) (\u201cthe length of confinement cannot be ignored in deciding whether the confinement meets constitutional standards\u201d); <em>see also Helling v. McKinney, </em>509 U.S. 25, 36, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993) (noting that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s objective inquiry requires a court to \u201cassess whether society considers the risk that the prisoner complains of to be so grave that it violates contemporary standards of decency to expose anyone unwillingly to such a risk.\u201d). Although a prisoner need not show \u201cserious current symptoms\u201d or actual injury to state a valid Eighth Amendment claim, <em>see Helling, </em>509 U.S. at 33, 113 S.Ct. 2475, the magistrate judge did not conclude, per se, that the lack of serious injury precluded the appellants\u2019 claims. Similarly, the appellants\u2019 allegations of injury do not, per se, establish an Eighth Amendment claim. <em>See Gates, </em>376 F.3d at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Proof of \u201cboth the subjective and objective elements [is] necessary to prove an Eighth Amendment violation.\u201d <em>Helling, </em>509 U.S. at 35, 113 S.Ct. 2475. Because the appellants have not demonstrated reversible error in the district court\u2019s rejection of their claims based on their failure to establish an objective Eighth Amendment violation, we do not address their arguments relating to the subjective ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>ment of deliberate indifference. It is also not necessary for this court to reach the merits of the district court\u2019s finding of Eleventh Amendment immunity, or the finding that Appellant Critchley failed to exhaust his claims. <em>Cf. Spiller v. City of Tex. City Police Dep\u2019t, </em>130 F.3d 162, 167 (5th Cir.1997) (noting that plaintiffs seeking to hold defendant liable in official capacity must show a custom or policy resulting in a constitutional violation). The appellants have shown no error in the district court\u2019s determination that they failed to exhaust their claims against Captain Saenz. <em>See Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 515 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 867-68 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
