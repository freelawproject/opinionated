He candidly acknowledges that the standard of review is abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Before denying reconsideration, the district court had issued a careful and convincing eleven-page Opinion and Order explaining why dismissal was appropriate after Falconer had failed to prosecute the case. The court pointed out, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[although not disclosed at the time, that \u2018pro se\u2019 complaint was actually drafted by suspended attorney, Michael L. Barnes.\u201d Also, \u201cUnbeknownst to this Court, ... Falconer refiled exactly the same complaint ..., resulting in the opening of another case before [a different judge] .... Falconer then attempted to pay his filing fee with a check drafted in Barnes\u2019 name, but that check was returned for nonsufficient funds .... Falconer took no further action in that case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">On appeal, Falconer mainly argues that his failure to prosecute was that he needed more time to obtain a lawyer. That does not constitute \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d There is no abuse of discretion. Essentially for the reasons amply provided by the district court, the order appealed from, which is the Memorandum and Order dated August 7, 2013, denying the motion to reconsider, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
