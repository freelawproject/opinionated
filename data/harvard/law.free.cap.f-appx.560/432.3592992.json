The district court dismissed his claims against the facility for failure to state a claim. The claims against defendant Walker were dismissed for failure to effect service of process. Defendants Smoot and Seitz were granted judgment as a matter of law during a jury trial proceeding. The jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants Rudolph, Crockett, and Foster. Hubbard appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-20\">\u201cThis Court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion, if necessary.\u201d <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Hubbard\u2019s claims against Captain Donald remain pending in the district court. Though the defendants filed a suggestion of death and Hubbard failed to move to substitute, the district court did not enter a judgment of dismissal as to the claims against Donald. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(a). We therefore lack jurisdiction over Hubbard\u2019s appeal. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>1292(a),(b); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Martin v. Halliburton, </em>618 F.3d 476, 481 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"AyI\">Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and. is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
