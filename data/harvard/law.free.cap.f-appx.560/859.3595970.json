He argues the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372, required the district court to resentence him to rectify the disparity between powder-cocaine sentences and his crack-cocaine sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-25\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the Sentencing Guidelines and the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the prison sentence of a \u201cdefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>ing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The grounds upon which a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are narrow. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir.2012). For a defendant to be eligible for this reduction, the Sentencing Commission must have amended the Sentencing Guidelines, that amendment must have lowered the defendant\u2019s sentencing range, and the amendment also must be listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) &amp; cmt. n. 1(A). In evaluating whether a reduction is warranted, the district court determines the Guidelines range that would have been applicable had the relevant amendment been in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s sentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). The district court can substitute only the relevant amendment in its original Guidelines calculation and must leave all other Guidelines application decisions unaffected. <em>Id.; United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, made retroactive by Amendment 759, lowered the sentencing range applicable to crack-cocaine crimes by revising the crack-cocaine quantity tables listed in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 750, 759. Section 2Dl.l(c) now assigns a base offense level of 36 in cases involving at least 2.8 kilograms, but less than 8.4 kilograms, of crack cocaine. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2). It assigns a base offense level of 38, the highest offense level possible, in cases involving 8.4 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">Although Amendment 750 can be a basis for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), \u201cthe FSA is not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress, and thus it does not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.\u201d <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 376-77. Moreover, the FSA does not apply retroactively to convicted defendants sentenced prior to the Act\u2019s August 3, 2010, date of enactment. <em>Id. </em>at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">Johnson relies almost exclusively on the FSA. Because the FSA cannot serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction, his argument fails. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 376-77. To the extent that Johnson relies on Amendment 750, his argument also fails. When Johnson originally was sentenced, he had a total offense level of 41 and a criminal history category of VI, which resulted in a Guidelines range of 360 months to life.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) of the current version of the Guidelines, Johnson\u2019s Guidelines range is also 360 months to life. Assuming Johnson possessed at least 2.8, but not more than 8.4, kilograms, of crack cocaine, his base offense level would have been 36.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2) (2012). Leaving the other Guidelines application decisions intact, Johnson\u2019s total offense level would have been 37. A total offense level of 37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>and criminal history category of VI under the amended Guidelines yield a sentencing range of 360 months to life. U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A, Sentencing Table (2012). Because Amendment 750 does not alter the sentencing range upon which Johnson\u2019s sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in his sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Other claims Johnson asserts, such as whether the district court broke a promise to resentence him after the passage of the FSA, are not proper in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, because they do not involve retroactive amendments to the Guidelines. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-7\">. For purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions, the Guidelines range to which the amendment should be applied is the original range determined before any departures or variances. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A). Johnson\u2019s departure for substantial assistance under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) is not relevant to the Guidelines range to which the amendment is applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b882-11\">. Johnson's plea agreement contained a stipulation of facts, in which he agreed he had obtained at least 5, but not more than 15, kilograms of crack cocaine. Even giving Johnson the benefit of the lower amount of crack cocaine, he is not entitled to a sentence reduction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
