The district court gave no reasons for its decision. We affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">To the extent Guzman\u2019s motion may be liberally construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s existing restitution order, rather than as a challenge to the payment plan created by the Bureau of Prisons under the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (IFRP), Guzman properly invoked \u00a7 3664(k). <em>See United States v. Diggs, </em>578 F.3d 318, 319-20 (5th Cir.2009). But his cryptic assertions provide no discernible basis for relief. The judgment is AFFIRMED IN PART as it pertains to any claims concerning the district court\u2019s existing restitution order under \u00a7 3664(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">In all other respects, Guzman seeks modification of the IFRP plan. He must seek this relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the district of incarceration after exhausting all administrative remedies. <em>See Diggs, </em>578 F.3d at 319-20. Guzman sought relief in the correct district. But the district court did not consider his request under \u00a7 2241. Moreover, there is no evidence concerning exhaustion, and the Government has not had an opportunity to address Guzman\u2019s request. We therefore VACATE AND REMAND IN PART so that the district court can consider Guzman\u2019s request under \u00a7 2241 and determine whether he has exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">The judgment is AFFIRMED IN PART and VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
