Chhetri contends that the IJ erroneously denied his application for adjustment of status and that the BIA did not properly evaluate all of the relevant factors prior to rendering its decision. He claims that both the IJ and the BIA improperly assessed and evaluated the testimony and evidence in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-24\">To the extent that Chhetri is attacking the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal, we lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>jurisdiction to consider his assertions because he failed timely to file a petition for review from that decision. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 676 (5th Cir.2003). Chhetri filed a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration, but we lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary denial of a request for adjustment of status, including the denial of a motion for reconsideration of such a decision. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>see also Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 800 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 474 (5th Cir.2004). Although the jurisdictional bar set forth in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) does not preclude review of constitutional claims or questions of law, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007), Chhetri\u2019s assertions amount to nothing more than his disagreement with the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s weighing of the factors underlying the discretionary equities determination. Because Chhetri challenges the consideration and weighing of the evidence, we lack jurisdiction over his claim that the BIA erred in denying his motion for reconsideration of its decision affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for adjustment of status. <em>See Sung, </em>505 F.3d at 377. Chhetri\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
