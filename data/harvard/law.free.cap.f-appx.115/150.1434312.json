Walden contends the officers violated his constitutional rights by conducting an illegal <em>Terry </em>stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-24\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo. We have reviewed the record, briefs, and applicable case law on this matter, and we have had the benefit of oral argument. Our careful review persuades us that the district court was correct in finding that, under the facts presented, a reasonable officer would not have known that the officers\u2019 <em>Terry </em>stop was unconstitutional. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment in favor of the officers on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Walden v. Frame, </em>C.A. No. 2:03-00225 (S.D.W.V. Dec. 9, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
