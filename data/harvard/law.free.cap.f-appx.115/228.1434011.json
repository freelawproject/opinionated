Robinson contends that the district court erred by holding that he had failed to satisfy the requirements of <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893 (5th Cir.2001), to pursue 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 relief because he relied on the retroactive application of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993), for his underlying habeas claim. In <em>Stinson, </em>the Supreme Court held, inter alia, that the commentaries to the sentencing guidelines are binding in most instances. <em>See Stinson, </em>508 U.S. at 43-47, 113 S.Ct. 1913. Robinson argues that relief on his claim was not possible until 1999, when the Eleventh Circuit decided <em>United States v. Gallo, </em>195 F.3d 1278 (11th Cir.1999), in which the Eleventh Circuit relied on <em>Stinson </em>to hold that sentencing guidelines commentary requiring a finding of reasonable foreseeability before adjustment of a defendant\u2019s offense level for possession of a firearm by a coconspirator was binding. <em>Gallo, </em>195 F.3d at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-22\">Robinson has not shown that the district court erred by dismissing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. First, <em>Stinson </em>was decid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>ed in 1998, before Robinson was convicted. Thus, Robinson could have relied on <em>Stinson </em>during his sentencing, on direct appeal, or in his previous 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding. Robinson thus does not rely on retroactive application of a Supreme Court opinion for his claim. <em>See Reyes-</em>Requena, 243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
