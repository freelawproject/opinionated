Werner\u2019s complaint alleged that the Appellees, who were contractors providing computer services at the Coast Guard\u2019s Operations Systems Center in Martinsburg, West Virginia (\u201cOSC\u201d), engaged in a practice of including time lost due to base <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>closures or spent at training seminars and social events as time worked by employees on their invoices. In response, the Appellees asserted that officials at OSC responsible for overseeing their contracts knew of and approved of these practices. Following discovery, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo. <em>Castillo v. Emergency Med. </em>Assocs., <em>P.A., </em>372 F.3d 643, 646 (4th Cir.2004). In granting summary judgment, the district court found that the facts adduced by the parties demonstrated that the Appellees were entitled to the \u201cgovernment knowledge\u201d defense. <em>See, e.g., United States ex rel. Becker v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., </em>305 F.3d 284, 288 (4th Cir.2002). In <em>Becker, </em>we held that where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2P\">the government knows and approves of the particulars of a claim for payment before that claim is presented, the presenter cannot be said to have knowingly presented a fraudulent or false claim. In such a case, the government\u2019s knowledge effectively negates the fraud or falsity required by the FCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-5\"><em>Becker, </em>305 F.3d at 289 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Despite ample evidence that the Appellees discussed the billing practices in question with the OSC officials responsible for managing their contracts, Werner asserts that the district court erred on several grounds. Werner reiterates his argument that Appellees impermissibly sought recovery under their contracts for hours not actually worked, that Appellees failed to disclose to the contracting officers information necessary to give rise to the \u201cgovernment knowledge\u201d defense, and that the OSC officials lacked the authority necessary to authorize the billing practices that Werner claims are fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs, the voluminous joint appendix, and having had the benefit of oral argument, we find that the district court correctly addressed and resolved all of the issues raised. We therefore affirm on the basis of its well reasoned opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
