The district court denied Butler leave to proceed IFP upon a finding that he had accumulated three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-24\">Section 1915(g) provides that a prisoner may not proceed IFP in a civil action or in an appeal of a judgment in a civil action if the prisoner has, on three or more prior occasions, while incarcerated, brought an action or appeal that was dismissed as frivolous or for failure to state a claim, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. The determination as to whether a prisoner is in \u201cimminent danger\u201d must be made at the time the prisoner seeks to proceed with the appeal or files a motion to proceed IFP. <em>Ba\u00f1os v. O\u2019Guin, </em>144 F.3d 883, 884 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-25\">Butler fails to show that he is in \u201cimminent danger\u201d as required under \u00a7 1915(g). Accordingly, his motion for IFP is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <em>the </em>limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
