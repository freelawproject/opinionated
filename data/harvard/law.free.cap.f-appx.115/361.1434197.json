To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, <em>de Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 759, 761 (9th Cir.2004). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The IJ did not abuse her discretion by denying Barajas-Magana\u2019s motion to reopen because the motion was not timely filed pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that the agency does not abuse its discretion unless it acts arbitrarily, irrationally, or contrary to law). Moreover, Barajas-Magana\u2019s motion to reopen was properly denied because she did not establish that the IJ retained jurisdiction of her case following the 1996 order of voluntary departure under safeguards. <em>See Carancho v. INS, </em>68 F.3d 356, 360-61 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that the BIA may deny a motion to reopen for failure to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">We lack jurisdiction to review Barajas-Magana\u2019s contention that the IJ should have sua sponte reopened the proceedings. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s refusal to exercise its authority to reopen sua sponte.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">Barajas-Magana\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b396-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
