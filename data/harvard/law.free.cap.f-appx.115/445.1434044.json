The defendant/appellant, Wilfredo Figueroa Zapata (\u201cFigueroa\u201d), faces a controlled substance charge carrying at least a ten-year maximum sentence; indeed, he faces a possible maximum sentence of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Therefore, it is presumed that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of the community if Figueroa is released. <em>See 18 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 8142(e). Figueroa\u2019s arguments that he only bought from, and did not sell to, the lead defendant in this case, and that he dealt no more than five kilograms of cocaine, are wholly unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Figueroa argues that the district court did not, as it should have, focus on whether he was likely to resume illegal drug dealing if he were released. Given the evidence presented at the detention hearing, the district court was not required to conclude that the conspiracy had shut down or that Figueroa would not resume his illegal activities if released. We find no error in the district court\u2019s decision that Figueroa had not overcome the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Figueroa introduced into evidence letters of support from his family and friends, and he argued that these along with family medical concerns offered additional reasons to release him pending trial. This evidence arguably tends to rebut the presumption that Figueroa might flee pending trial (though we take no position on that question); but the district court based its detention decision on dangerousness, not on the relative risk of flight presented. It is that decision we review. We see no error in the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">We deny as moot Figueroa\u2019s motion to reconsider this court\u2019s order extending the government\u2019s deadline for filing its brief; and we note that the extension of time was appropriate, given that the court also had granted appellant an extension of time within which to file certified translations in support of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\"><em>Affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
