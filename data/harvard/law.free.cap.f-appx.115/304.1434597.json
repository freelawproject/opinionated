Delgado-Gama argues that subsection (b)(2) of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 is a sentencing provision and that the district court erred in instructing the jury that the Government was required to prove that he had been deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony. He contends that he was prejudiced by the district court\u2019s erroneous jury instruction because evidence of his prior criminal history was introduced at trial. He further contends that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the testimony of a fingerprint expert at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-22\">Delgado-Gama is correct that the district court erred in instructing the jury that the Government had to prove that he was deported following an aggravated felony conviction. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Nevertheless, because the evidence of Delgado-Gama\u2019s guilt was overwhelming, the erroneous jury instruction and consequently the introduction of his prior criminal history at trial, had no affect on Delgado-Gama\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>161 F.3d 256, 259 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc); <em>United States v. Arteaga-Limones, </em>529 F.2d 1183, 1199 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-23\">Additionally, Delgado-Gama has failed to show that the district court plainly erred in admitting expert testimony at trial. <em>See United States v. Ramirez-Velasquez, 322 </em>F.3d 868, 878-79 (5th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 840, 124 S.Ct. 107, 157 L.Ed.2d 74 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-24\">Accordingly, Delgado-Gama\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
