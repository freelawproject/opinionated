(\u201cAetna\u201d) and Joseph Kushnerick, alleging, as relevant here, violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>The District Court granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and Shramban appealed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We review the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Sempier v. Johnson &amp; Higgins, </em>45 F.3d 724, 727 (3d Cir.1995). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Only if the record contains insufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to find in favor of the non-moving party at trial will summary judgment be warranted. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). The reviewing court must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in his or her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">We will set forth only those facts necessary to our decision. Appellant is a blonde Caucasian woman originally from the former Soviet Republic of Moldavia. Since April 2000, she has been employed as a computer programmer for Aetna. In her deposition, appellant testified that her supervisor, Mr. Kushnerick,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> repeatedly made offensive comments towards her. Specifically, she testified that Kushnerick asked her if she \u201cknew what people said about blondes\u201d; that Kushnerick said \u201cthere is only one way to tell a natural blonde\u201d; that Kushnerick twice made inappropriate contact with her hand while exchanging paperwork; and that Kushnerick made comments about her personal life, clothes, jewelry and appearance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s App. at 158a, 426a-428a, 468a, 471a.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">In April and June, 2001, appellant formally complained to higher management of Kushnerick\u2019s conduct and the over-time he was requiring her to work. In response, Aetna launched an investigation, and in July, 2001, transferred her to another position within the company at a different facility. Although the parties agree that the transfer did not result in any loss of pay or any reduced job code, appellant claims that the transfer was a demotion because the new project was a \u201cstep backwards\u201d in her career. The parties also agree that appellant did not suffer any harassment after her reassignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">In order to successfully bring an action under Title VTI for a hostile work environment, appellant was required to prove the following: (1) she suffered intentional discrimination because of her gender; (2) the discrimination was pervasive and regular; (3) the discrimination detrimentally affected her; (4) the discrimination would detrimentally affect a reasonable person of the same sex in that position; and (5) the existence of respondeat superior liability. <em>Andrews v. City of Phila., </em>895 F.2d 1469, 1482 (3d Cir.1990) (citing <em>Rabidue v. Osceola Refining Co., </em>805 F.2d 611, 619-20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>(6th Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>481 U.S. 1041, 107 S.Ct. 1983, 95 L.Ed.2d 823 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The Supreme Court has made it quite clear that \u201c[c]onduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment \u2014 an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive \u2014 is beyond Title VIPs purview.\u201d <em>Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993). \u201cSimple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the \u2018terms and conditions of employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662, (1998). Viewing all the facts and the reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to appellant, we agree with the District Court that appellant failed to demonstrate that she suffered intentional discrimination within the meaning of Title VII. While Kushneriek\u2019s comments were certainly inappropriate if not boorish, they simply do not rise to a level sufficient to create a hostile work environment. Moreover, as the District Court also found, appellant failed to demonstrate either that Kushnerick\u2019s conduct was pervasive and regular or that it would detrimentally affect a reasonable person of the same sex in appellant\u2019s position, although that conduct detrimentally affected appellant herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Appellant\u2019s inability to prove the elements noted above dooms her hostile work environment claim and, a <em>fortiori, </em>any claim of respondeat superior liability. We will affirm the order of the District Court granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\">. Appellees deny that Kushnerick was, in fact, appellant's \"supervisor\u201d for Title VII purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-9\">. Appellant also testified that Kushnerick made derogatory comments concerning her national origin. Although she initially complained of retaliation and of discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion and national origin, she has confined her appeal solely to discrimination based on gender. Therefore, we will analyze that claim only.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
