We previously remanded to the district court for resentencing, and Hall appeals from that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-22\">Hall argues, relying on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), that the district court plainly erred by increasing his offense level by two levels based on the district court\u2019s finding that the firearm had been stolen. He also contends that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to establish that the firearm that he possessed traveled in or affected interstate commerce. Hall concedes that these arguments are foreclosed but raises them to preserve further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-24\">In <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263), this court held that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply to the federal sentencing guidelines. Therefore, Hall\u2019s sentencing argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-25\">Hall unsuccessfully raised the interstate commerce issue in his prior appeal. <em>See United States v. Hall, 88 </em>Fed.Appx. 28, No. 03-20573 (5th Cir. Feb. 12, 2004) (unpublished). This issue is barred by the law of the case doctrine. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 320 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
