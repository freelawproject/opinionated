We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). We review the award of fees to professionals for abuse of discretion. <em>Kord Enterprises II v. Calif. Commerce Bank (In re Kord Enterprises </em>II), 139 F.3d 684, 686 (9th Cir.1998). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-21\">The bankruptcy court entered an order approving King\u2019s Third Amended Chapter 11 plan in December, 1990, which, <em>inter alia, </em>provided for the appointment of a disbursing agent to make distributions required by the plan and to resolve disputed claims against King\u2019s estate. We do not consider King\u2019s contentions challenging the plan because they were raised for the first time before the Bankruptcy Court in 2002. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8002(a) (establishing ten day period to file a notice of appeal from entry of an order); <em>Anderson v. Mouradick (In re </em>Mouradick), 13 F.3d 326, 327 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cThe provisions of Bankruptcy Rule 8002 are jurisdictional; the untimely filing of a notice of appeal deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court\u2019s order.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"AU_\">On February 15, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court entered a final decree granting the disbursing agent\u2019s motion to disburse payments to all professionals, including the tax counsel King retained to resolve a 1.2 million dollar assessment by the Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Revenue Service. For the reasons expressed by the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel in its July 8, 2003 order, we find no abuse of discretion in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s disbursing of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">King\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">We decline to consider contentions not raised before the Bankruptcy Court or the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel. <em>See El Paso City of Texas v. American West Airlines, Inc. (In re American West Airlines, Inc.), </em>217 F.3d 1161, 1165 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b431-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
