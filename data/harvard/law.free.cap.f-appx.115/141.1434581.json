Our review of the record discloses that the Board\u2019s decision is based upon substantial evidence and is without reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the Board. <em>See Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Minor, </em>BRB No. 02-0850 (BRB Aug. 27, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-24\">The petition for review is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b175-25\">\n<em>DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
