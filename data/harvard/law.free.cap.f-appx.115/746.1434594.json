The district court sentenced him to 46 months in prison and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-21\">For the first time on appeal, Nieves argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). He also asserts that if <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is overruled and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), is held to apply to the federal sentencing guidelines, then the calculation of his sentence would be unconstitutional. Nieves\u2019s arguments are, as he concedes, foreclosed. <em>See Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 235, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219; <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004)(No. 04-5263); <em>United States v. Ddbeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Nieves\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b780-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
