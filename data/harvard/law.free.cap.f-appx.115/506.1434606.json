Weinstein, <em>District </em>Judge), denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Petitioner contends that his appellate counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to object to various aspects of a hearing held in state trial court pursuant to <em>People v. Darden, </em>34 N.Y.2d 177, 356 N.Y.S.2d 582, 313 N.E.2d 49 (1974). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-18\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of relief under \u00a7 2254 <em>de novo. See Brown v. Artuz, </em>283 F.3d 492, 497 (2d Cir.2002). Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), the district court must ascertain whether the state court\u2019s adjudication of the petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). In order to prevail, the petitioner must demonstrate that: (1) \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and (2) \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Moreover, the petitioner must do more than \u201cconvince a federal habeas court that, in its independent judgment, the state court applied <em>Strickland </em>incorrectly. Rather, he must show that the [state court] applied <em>Strickland </em>to the facts of his case in an objectively reasonable manner.\u201d <em>Cox v. Donnelly, </em>387 F.3d 193, 197 (2d Cir.2004) (citing <em>Bell v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number><em>Cone, </em>585 U.S. 685, 689-90, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In the instant case, the district court concluded that appellate counsel\u2019s failure to (1) provide the trial court with questions for the <em>Darden </em>hearing, (2) object to the re-opening of the <em>Darden </em>hearing, and (3) raise this issue on direct appeal, did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. We agree with the district court that the petitioner has failed to identify any meaningful way in which he was prejudiced by his appellate counsel\u2019s purported shortcomings, nor has he demonstrated that the state court applied <em>Strickland </em>in an objectively unreasonable manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
