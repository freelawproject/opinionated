Nguyen first argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that he was responsible for 50,000 units of Ecstasy, a determination that affected his base offense level. He attacks the credibility of testimony presented at his sentencing hearing, and he argues that there is no reliable evidence to connect him to 50,000 units of Ecstasy. In view of the testimony adduced at his sentencing hearing, Nguyen has failed to show that the district court clearly erred in holding him accountable for 50,000 units of Ecstasy. <em>See United States v. Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d 832, 878 (5th Cir.1998); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-24\">Nguyen also challenges the district court\u2019s determination that he was a manager or supervisor under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). Because Nguyen\u2019s Factual Resume and the testimony adduced at his sentencing hearing support the district court\u2019s application of the three-level adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), Nguyen has failed to show that the district court\u2019s factual finding as to his role in the offense was clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Parker, </em>133 F.3d 322, 329 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-25\">Finally, relying on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>- U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), Nguyen contends that the sentencing guidelines are unconstitutional as applied to his case because he has not admitted to being involved with 50,000 units of Ecstasy or to his role in the offense. Nguyen acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 473 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263), but he seeks to preserve the issue for further review. Nguyen\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>ment is foreclosed. <em>See Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
