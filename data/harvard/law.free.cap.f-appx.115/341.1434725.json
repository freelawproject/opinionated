We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s findings, <em>see Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-24\">The BIA relied on sufficiently individualized State Department country profile reports as to the current treatment of Sikhs in Punjab, and substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that, even assuming past persecution, respondent rebutted the presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution through an individualized analysis of changed conditions in Punjab. <em>See Garcia-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 1066, 1074 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>2004) (requiring individualized analysis of how changed country conditions affect specific petitioner\u2019s situation); <em>Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998-1000 (9th Cir.2003) (substantial evidence supported BIA\u2019s determination that government rebutted presumption of well-founded fear based on sufficiently individualized State Department country profile report).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Because petitioners failed to demonstrate that they were eligible for asylum, it follows that they did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). In addition, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of relief under the CAT. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Pursuant to <em>Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897 (9th Cir.2004) (order), petitioners\u2019 voluntary departure period will begin to run upon issuance of this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b375-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
