We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-17\">Galvan-Betancourt contends that the amended information did not expressly allege count II as a subsequent (felony) offense to count I, meaning that he pled guilty to two misdemeanor counts and should have been sentenced to two consecutive terms of six months. Galvan-Betancourt did not raise this objection in district court, therefore any error is subject to plain error analysis. <em>See United States v. Leos-Maldonado, </em>302 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir.2002) (noting that \u201creview of an untimely objection to the sufficiency of the indictment is limited to the plain error test of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b)\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-21\">Even if the amended information was somehow deficient in pleading count II as a felony, any such deficiency does not rise to the level of plain error. <em>See Leos-Maldonado, </em>302 F.3d at 1064 (stating that relief is not warranted under the plain error standard unless there has been error, which is plain, affects substantial rights, and seriously affects \u201cthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b366-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
