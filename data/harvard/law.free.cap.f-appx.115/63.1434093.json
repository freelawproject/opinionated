We consider whether Vasquez\u2019s petition for review should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-21\">Vasquez\u2019s petition for review was dismissed for failure to pay the filing fee and failure to file a Fed. Cir. R. 15(c) statement concerning discrimination. Vasquez has now filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and a Rule 15(c) form; thus, reinstatement is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-22\">Many of Vasquez\u2019s requests relate to discovery, interrogatories, and the like. Those provisions apply to trial procedures, but do not apply to appellate procedures. Rather, an appellate court reviews a case based on the record that was before the trial tribunal i.e., the Merit Systems Protection Board. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 16(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-24\">Vasquez also requests attorney fees. However, no attorney has entered an appearance on Vasquez\u2019s behalf. In any event, attorney fees are not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-25\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b97-26\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b97-27\">(1) Vasquez\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-28\">(2) The court\u2019s September 3, 2004 dismissal order is vacated, the mandate is recalled, and the petition for review is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-29\">(3) OPM\u2019s brief is due within 21 days of the date of filing of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-30\">(4) Vasquez\u2019s submissions requesting various relief are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b97-40\"> Among other requests, Vasquez seeks a copy of a transcript. Vasquez should address this request to the Merit Systems Protection Board directly.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
