Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). We will reverse the Board only if the evidence \u2018\u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. U.S. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84). The evidence does not compel such a result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">In addition, we uphold the denial of Yang\u2019s application for -withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">We deny Yang\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b169-9\"> Yang raises no issues regarding the Convention Against Torture claim in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
