The government has expressly waived oral argument. Kayrouz has been deemed to have waived oral argument because he failed to respond to this court\u2019s show cause letter concerning the waiver of such argument. This panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-16\">Kayrouz entered the United States in September 1988 as a lawful permanent resident. In July 2001, he pleaded guilty to using a telephone to facilitate the possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). The United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio sentenced Kayrouz to twelve months and one day of imprisonment. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) began removal proceedings in December 2001. The INS charged that Kayrouz was removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) because of his conviction for violating a law relating to a controlled substance, and under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A) (iii) for committing an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). Kayrouz requested cancellation of removal under \u00a7 240(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). An immigration judge (IJ) determined that Kayrouz\u2019s conviction constituted an aggravated felony and ordered him removed. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) upheld that decision in January 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-17\">Before the BIA entered its decision, Kayrouz filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the court of his conviction. The case was transferred to the Eastern District of Kentucky, where Kayrouz was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>incarcerated, and Kayrouz requested a temporary restraining order (TRO) barring his removal from the country. The district court denied Kayrouz a TRO and dismissed the petition. The district court found that Kayrouz\u2019s conviction was an aggravated felony for purposes of the INA. <em>Kayrouz v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.Supp.2d 760, 763-64 (E.D.Ky.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">On appeal, Kayrouz argues that the district court erred: (1) in finding that his conviction is an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as defined under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43); (2) in finding that summary affirmation by the BIA in his case constituted proper administrative review; and (3) in determining that the other prongs of the four-part test for the issuance of a temporary restraining order did not weigh heavily in favor of him and mandate the granting of injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Initially, we note that an order ruling on a motion for a TRO is not appeal-able. <em>Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, AFL-CIO, </em>473 U.S. 1301, 1303-05, 105 S.Ct. 3467, 87 L.Ed.2d 603 (1985). Thus, we need not address Kayrouz\u2019s arguments regarding his motion for a TRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s judgment dismissing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Asad v. Reno, </em>242 F.3d 702, 704 (6th Cir.2001). Upon review, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision for the reasons stated by the district court. Under the INA, any alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony is removable. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The INA defines aggravated felony to include \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance ..., including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). The referenced statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), defines drug trafficking crime to include \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801, <em>el seq.).\u201d </em>The crime of using a telephone to facilitate the possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute is part of the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). Thus, under the plain language of the relevant statutes, a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b) qualifies as an aggravated felony under the INA. <em>See Khan v. Ashcroft, </em>352 F.3d 521, 522 (2d Cir.2003). Kayrouz has presented no authority to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">Kayrouz\u2019s argument that summary affirmation by the BIA did not constitute proper administrative review and denied him due process is without merit. This court has held that neither the BIA\u2019s streamlining procedures for reviewing appeals nor its practice of affirming IJ decisions without issuing an opinion violates an alien\u2019s rights to due process. <em>Denko v. INS, </em>351 F.3d 717, 730 (6th Cir.2003). Moreover, although Kayrouz argues that he was not given a fair review, this court \u201cwill not assume such a complete breakdown in the system in the absence of tangible evidence to support such a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739. Kayrouz has identified no evidence that his case was reviewed improperly.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
