An enhancement for more than minimal planning is warranted if a defendant takes significant affirmative steps to conceal his offense. Here, Elve provided false information on his loan application and thereby concealed that he had illegally obtained the HUD-owned property. He also provided his bank with a false warranty deed, which incorrectly showed that he had purchased the property for $70,000. The district court did not commit clear error in concluding that Elve took significant steps to avoid detection of his crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
