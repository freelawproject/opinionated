Hawkins, who allegedly has since discharged his sentence, now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous. The district court concluded that Hawkins had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to the claims contained in his complaint, as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-22\">On appeal, Hawkins reiterates his allegations of deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. But he does not acknowledge or challenge the basis for the district court\u2019s procedural ruling that he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Accordingly, it is as if Hawkins had not appealed the judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Hawkins\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-23\">As Hawkins\u2019s appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2. Because Hawkins was incarcerated at the time he filed the instant complaint, the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Should Hawkins be returned to prison and accumulate three strikes, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>would not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he were under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b741-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
