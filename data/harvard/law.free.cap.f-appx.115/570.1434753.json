Skeddle.\u201d (Pet. at 1.) This Court denies rehearing for the two reasons explained herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">First, Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(5) and Third Circuit Local Appellate Rule 28.1(a) provide that an issue will only be addressed by the Court if the appellant sets forth the issue in a \u201cstatement of issues presented for review\u201d and presents argument in support of the issue in its opening brief. <em>Kost v. Kozakiewicz, </em>1 F.3d 176, 182 (3d Cir.1993) (citing Fed. RApp. P. 28(a)(5); Local App. R. 28.1(a)); <em>see also </em>16A Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc.3d \u00a7 3974.1 (\u201cto assure consideration of an issue by the court the appellant must both raise it in this \u2018Statement of the Issues\u2019 and pursue it in the \u2018Argument\u2019 portion of the brief\u2019). \u201cIt is well settled that if an appellant fails to comply with these requirements on a particular issue, the appellant normally has abandoned and waived that issue on appeal and it need not be addressed by the court of appeals.\u201d <em>Kost, </em>1 F.3d at 182 (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-14\">The Plaintiff-Appellants seek rehearing on an issue that they did not raise in their \u201cStatement of Issues on Appeal,\u201d <em>(see </em>Appellant Br. at 5-6.), and that they referred to once in the \u201cArgument\u201d portion of the brief in a footnote, <em>(see id. </em>at 76 n. 63).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, their reference to the Skeddle grand jury testimony in the footnote did not purport to raise the issue for consideration; instead it stated in a section relating to the District Court\u2019s suppression of notes written by Ronald Skeddle that \u201c[t]he District Court compounded its error by excluding Skeddle\u2019s and Bryant\u2019s grand jury testimony. This type of evidence has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness to be admissible under Rule 807. [citing cases].\u201d This \u201ccasual[] mention\u201d of the grand jury testimony \u201cis insufficient to preserve the issue for review on appeal.\u201d <em>Nagle v. Alspach, </em>8 F.3d 141, 143 (3d Cir.1993) (citing <em>Simmons v. City of Philadelphia, </em>947 F.2d 1042, 1066 (3d Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Second, even if the Plaintiff-Appellants had properly raised this issue in their brief, rehearing is not warranted because the District Court properly excluded the grand jury testimony. The Plaintiff-Appellants assert that this Court should find that Skeddle\u2019s grand jury testimony has \u201csufficient guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d for admissibility under Federal Rule of Evidence 807, the residual exception to the hearsay rule,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the same reasons that the Court remanded the issue of whether Skeddle\u2019s handwritten notes had \u201ctrustworthiness and reliability\u201d as statements against interest under Rule 804(b)(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The Skeddle grand jury testimony, though, is fundamentally different from the Skeddle notes for purposes of admissibility because there is no question that Skeddle\u2019s testimony to the grand jury was not contemporaneous. In considering the Skeddle notes, for which a question of timing remains, this Court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">We agree ... that a finding that Skeddle\u2019s notes were not contemporaneous would support a conclusion that the statements are not reliable or corroborated by the circumstances. Skeddle left LOF under a cloud of mutual disaffection. Consequently, documenting LOF wrongdoing during a time when LOF was alleging that Skeddle himself had engaged in wrongdoing would tend to impugn Skeddle\u2019s motives and therefore also the reliability of the statements. But it is not clear that the District Court excluded Skeddle\u2019s notes because it found that they were not contemporaneous. Moreover, it is not clear that the record supports such a conclusion; on them face, many of the notes give no indication that they were ex post fabrications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">Slip Op. at 32-33. For the same reasons, the District Court was well within its discretion in concluding that Skeddle\u2019s after-the-fact testimony does not have circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness for purposes of Rule 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">SUR PETITION FOR PANEL REHEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">The petition for panel rehearing filed by Plaintiffs-Appellants in the above-entitled case having been submitted to the judges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>who participated in the decision of this Court, and no judge who concurred in the decision having asked for rehearing, the petition for rehearing by the panel, is denied-</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-11\">. The Plaintiff-Appellants also made passing reference to the grand jury testimony in their \"Preliminary Statement\u201d where they stated that \"Plaintiffs believe this ruling was error\u201d in reference to the District Court's decision to exclude the grand jury testimony, (Appellant Br. at 3, n.l), and in their \"Statement of Facts\u201d where they stated that the \"grand jury testimony [was] erroneously stricken from the summary judgment record by the District Court in response to motions <em>in limine </em>filed by PPG,\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 18).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\">. Fed.R.Evid. 807 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"Agn\">A statement not specifically covered by Rule 803 or 804 but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, is not excluded by the hearsay rule, if the court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact; (B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence ....</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b607-8\">. Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"Agi\">The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness ... A statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant's pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the declarant against another, that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true. A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
