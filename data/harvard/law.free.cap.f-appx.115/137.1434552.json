To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Francois fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that Francois seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of Francois\u2019 application for withholding of removal. <em>See Chen v. U.S. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). We thus deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b172-26\"> Francois does not dispute the denial of relief under CAT.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
