Moffite argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss his indictment for a violation of the Speedy Trial Act <em>(See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161-62); the prosecutor made improper comments during closing argument; and there was insufficient evidence presented to establish jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-17\">The district court denied Moffite\u2019s motion to dismiss his indictment for violation of the Speedy Trial Act because it found that Moffite\u2019s voluntary participation in a joint motion for a trial continuance barred him from challenging the timeliness of his trial. The district court granted the parties\u2019 joint motion for a trial continuance under the \u201cends of justice\u201d provision of the Speedy Trial Act, which is one of the exemptions to the time limit in the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number><em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(A). However, because of an administrative oversight, the order granting the motion was not entered into the record of the case until after trial commenced. Moffite argues therefore that the order did not comply with the requirements of the Speedy Trial Act. Unless the time period during which the continuance was in effect is excludable, Moffite\u2019s trial was not timely under the Speedy Trial Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">In <em>United States v. Willis, </em>958 F.2d 60, 64 (5th Cir.1992), we held that a defendant does not waive his rights under the Speedy Trial Act \u201csimply by asking for or agreeing to a continuance.\u201d Nevertheless, we cautioned that \u201cthe defendant should not be allowed to argue one legal theory or characterization of facts to obtain a continuance and then argue that the district court\u2019s ruling was erroneous to seek dismissal under the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where the defendant has sought a continuance under an erroneous interpretation of the Act that the district court adopts, we will \u201cask whether the district court could have granted [an 18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3161(h)(8) continuance. If so, we will treat the time as an excludable continuance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Moffite seeks to take advantage of a technicality and an apparent oversight on the part of the district court that caused the order for continuance not to be filed into the record until after the trial. Unlike the order at issue in <em>Willis, </em>which erroneously relied upon the defendant\u2019s purported waiver of his rights under the Speedy Trial Act, the district court in this case granted the order under the \u201cends of justice\u201d provision of the Speedy Trial Act based in part upon the representation by Moffite\u2019s counsel that he needed more time to prepare for trial. <em>See Willis, </em>958 F.2d at 62-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Therefore, because the district court gave its reasons for granting a continuance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(8) and Moffite has not shown that the district court erred, the period during which the continuance was in effect is properly excluded, and the district court did not err in rejecting Moffite\u2019s claim based upon the Speedy Trial Act. <em>See United States v. Bieganowski, </em>313 F.3d 264, 283 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 1014, 123 S.Ct. 1956, 155 L.Ed.2d 851 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Moffite also argues that improper comments made by the prosecutor during closing argument at trial warrant reversal of his conviction. The prosecutor\u2019s remarks were permissible even though they may have served to bolster the Government\u2019s case because they responded to the defense\u2019s attack upon the Government\u2019s witness. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>44 F.3d 1271, 1278 (5th Cir.1995). Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks did not involve an expression of the prosecutor\u2019s personal opinion. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>831 F.2d 63, 67 (5th Cir.1987). Furthermore, Moffite has not shown that the prosecutor manifestly intended to comment on Moffite\u2019s choice not to testify or that the jury necessarily would view his comments in that light. <em>See United States v. Johnston, </em>127 F.3d 380, 396 (5th Cir.1997). Finally, the district court\u2019s jury instructions were sufficient to cure any prejudice. <em>See United States v. Ramirez-Velasquez, </em>322 F.3d 868, 875 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 840, 124 S.Ct. 107, 157 L.Ed.2d 74 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">Moffite also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence establishing the jurisdictional requirement and essential element of the statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(f), that the bank was insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) on the day of the robbery. A showing of the witness\u2019s personal knowledge about the status of the bank\u2019s FDIC insurance was not necessary because Mof<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>fite did not challenge the testimony offered by the Government at trial. <em>See United States v. Trice, </em>823 F.2d 80, 87 n. 6 (5th Cir.1987). Thus, the Government\u2019s proof of insured status provided an adequate basis for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the bank was insured by the FDIC on the day of the robbery. <em>See id. </em>at 86-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Accordingly, Moffite\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b725-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
