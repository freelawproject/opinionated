Musgrave\u2019s complaint, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleges that Hoyos violated her civil rights by, <em>inter alia, </em>issuing a default money judgment and eviction order against Musgrave.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that, as a matter of law, jurisdiction does not exist. <em>See Moccio v. New York State Office of Court Admin., </em>95 F.3d 195, 198 (2d Cir.1996). Having carefully reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 arguments in this case, we agree that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">As an initial matter, any decision as to the merits of Musgrave\u2019s claims would necessarily require the district court to review the propriety of Judge Hoyos\u2019 orders, a task the lower federal courts are not empowered to do. <em>See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 486, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983) (holding that district courts \u201cdo not have jurisdiction ... over challenges to state court decisions ... even if those challenges allege that the state court\u2019s action was unconstitutional\u201d); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 416, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923) (holding that district court may not sit in direct appellate review of a state court judgment because \u201c[t]he jurisdiction possessed by the District Courts is strictly original\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">In addition, as the district court observed, it is well-settled that judicial officers like Judge Hoyos are entitled to absolute immunity from civil suit for any acts taken in their official capacities. <em>Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 554, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967) (holding that judges could not be held liable for damages under \u00a7 1983, even for allegedly unconstitutional acts). This immunity serves to preserve judicial independence by shielding judges from the inhibitory threat of economic sanction. <em>See id.; Hili v. Sciarrotta, </em>140 F.3d 210, 213 (2nd Cir.1998). As a consequence, persons claiming to have been injured by judicial misconduct must seek alternative forms of relief such as state appellate or collateral review, judicial misconduct or disciplinary proceedings, or working to prevent the judge\u2019s re-election.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED and Musgrave\u2019s motion to strike appellee\u2019s brief is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
