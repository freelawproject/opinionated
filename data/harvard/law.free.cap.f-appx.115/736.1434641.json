The district court imposed a 77-month term of imprisonment followed by a two-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-26\">For the first time on appeal, Bernal contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>ed felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 </em>U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Bernal concedes, this issue is foreclosed. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Bernal further argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), should be applied to sentences determined under the federal sentencing guidelines. As Bernal also concedes, this argument is foreclosed by our opinion in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 473 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04r-5263), but he raises it to preserve it for possible further review. Accordingly, the sentence of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b770-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
