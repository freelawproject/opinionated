He argues for the first time on appeal that, pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are elements of the offense, not sentence enhancements, making those provisions unconstitutional. As Araguz concedes, however, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-22\">Araguz also argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), should be applied to sentences determined under the federal sentencing guidelines. He concedes that this argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263), but he raises it to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-25\">Araguz does not brief any argument concerning how or why any potential reduction in his sentence for the 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 conviction would have any bearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>on the sentence the district court imposed upon revocation of his supervised release for his prior illegal-reentry conviction. He has therefore abandoned his appeal from the revocation of his supervised release. <em>United States v. Valdiosera-Godinez, </em>932 F.2d 1093, 1099 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
