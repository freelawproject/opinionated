PARKER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b519-9\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">We consider whether the district court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, following the presentation of plaintiffs case-in-chief, in a jury trial of Nweze\u2019s action asserting hostile work environment and intentional discrimination claims pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">This Court reviews the grant of a Rule 50 motion de novo. <em>See Diesel v. Town of Lewisboro, </em>232 F.3d 92, 103 (2d Cir.2000). The motion may be granted \u201c[o]nly if there is such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury\u2019s findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture, or such an overwhelming amount of evidence in favor of the movant that reasonable and fair minded men could not arrive at a verdict against the moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">A plaintiff alleging a hostile work environment \u201cmust demonstrate either that a single incident was extraordinarily severe, or that a series of incidents were sufficiently continuous and concerted to have altered the conditions of [the] working environment.\u201d <em>Alfano v. Costello, </em>294 F.3d 365, 374 (2d Cir.2002) (internal quotations omitted) (Title VII case). \u201cTo decide whether the threshold has been reached, courts examine the case-specific circumstances in their totality and evaluate the severity, frequency and degree of the abuse.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-16\">Nweze failed to establish that his supervisor David Foell\u2019s yelling and requests for errands were based on race. <em>See id. </em>However, even if this conduct was racially motivated, the circumstances, taken as a whole, do not establish that Nweze\u2019s workplace was \u201cpermeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult,\u201d or that the conduct altered the conditions of Nweze\u2019s employment. <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Alfano, </em>294 F.3d at 376-81. And the single March 1995 remark does not satisfy the \u201cso severe or pervasive\u201d standard required of a Title VII plaintiff alleging a hostile work environment. <em>See Harris, </em>510 U.S. at 21-22, 114 S.Ct. 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-17\">To prevail on a disparate treatment claim, a Title VII \u201cplaintiff is required to prove that the defendant had a discriminatory intent or motive.\u201d <em>Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust, </em>487 U.S. 977, 986, 108 S.Ct. 2777, 101 L.Ed.2d 827 (1988). A plaintiff makes out a pilma facie claim of discrimination by establishing that 1) he was a member of a protected class; 2) he was qualified for the position; 3) an adverse employment decision took place; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>4) the decision occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Nweze failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. The evidence, taken as a whole, is insufficient to support the inference that Nweze was terminated because of his race. Because Nweze provided no evidence that Foell, who allegedly made the racist comment, recommended Nweze\u2019s discharge, the alleged comment cannot support a finding that the discharge decision was based on Nweze\u2019s race. <em>See McLee v. Chrysler Corp., </em>109 F.3d 130, 137 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Even if Foell had recommended that Nweze be terminated, moreover, the evidence is insufficient to support a finding that the decision was motivated by racial animus. Foell\u2019s alleged remark was made nineteen months before Nweze\u2019s discharge and was not shown to have any connection to the decision to terminate Nweze. Nweze has pointed to no other evidence of disparate treatment or racial discrimination in the trial record. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment as a matter of law dismissing the disparate treatment claim should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The judgment of the district court is therefore hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
