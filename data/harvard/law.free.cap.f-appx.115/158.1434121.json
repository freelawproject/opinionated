Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-24\">Parties are given thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-25\">The district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate\u2019s recommendation was entered on the docket on July 9, 2004. McBride filed a timely motion for reconsideration on July 21, 2004. The district court\u2019s order denying McBride\u2019s motion was entered on the docket on August 2, 2004. The notice of appeal was filed on September 25, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>2004.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because McBride failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b193-20\"> For purposes of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court.
