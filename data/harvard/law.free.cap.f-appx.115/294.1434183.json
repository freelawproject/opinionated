In the complaint, which was filed in early December 2003, Bell alleged that defendant Steven Fisher, a police officer, subjected him to excessive force by shooting him in the knee and kicking him in the mouth during an apparent arrest on September 13, 2001. The district court concluded that Bell\u2019s complaint was barred by the applicable two-year Texas limitations statute for personal-injury actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-21\">In the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 context, a federal court \u201cborrows\u201d a statute of limitations from the forum state\u2019s general personal-injury limitations provision. <em>See Jacobsen v. Osborne, </em>133 F.3d 315, 319 (5th Cir.1998). In Texas, that period is two years. <em>Hitt v. Connell, </em>301 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2002). A federal court also gives effect to the state\u2019s tolling provisions. <em>Slack v. Carpenter, </em>7 F.3d 418, 419 (5th Cir.1993). \u201c[A] \u00a7 1983 action generally accrues when a plaintiff \u2018knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 157 (5th Cir.1999) (citation omitted); <em>see Jacobsen, </em>133 F.3d at 319 (federal law determines when action accrues).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-22\">Although Bell does not explicitly deny that his claim accrued for federal purposes on September 13, 2001, and that his complaint was not filed until more than two years later, he argues that his complaint was timely filed under various Texas tolling and accrual doctrines. These argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>ments are meritless. Our review of the record confirms that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Bell\u2019s complaint as frivolous. <em>See Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Bell\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we DISMISS the appeal as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of the three-strikes provision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Bell is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
