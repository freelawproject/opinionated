Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141 (5th Cir.1994). The Government\u2019s refusal to move for a reduction of sentence is unreviewable by the district court absent a \u201csubstantial threshold showing\u201d that the decision is based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (reviewing Government\u2019s refusal to file a motion pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K1.1). Deckard does not allege that the Government\u2019s decision not to file a Rule 35(b) motion in his case was based on an unconstitutional motive. Deckard\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion was thus \u201can unauthorized motion which the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain.\u201d <em>Early, </em>27 F.3d at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b259-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
