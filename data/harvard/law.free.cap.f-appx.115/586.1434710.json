One week later, he sent a letter to the District Court, seeking to withdraw his guilty plea. The District Court denied his request after an evidentiary hearing, and Perez appealed. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">Once the District Court has accepted a guilty plea, it \u201cmay not automatically be withdrawn at the defendant\u2019s whim.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>250 F.3d 811, 815 (3d Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>785 F.2d 111 (3d Cir.1986)). The Court must instead determine whether the defendant has \u201ca fair and just reason for withdrawing a plea of guilty,\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(e), considering the following three factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-13\">(1) whether the defendant asserts his innocence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-14\">(2) whether the government would be prejudiced by the withdrawal; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-15\">(3) the strength of the defendant\u2019s reason to withdraw the plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-16\"><em>Id, </em>(citing <em>United States v. Huff, </em>873 F.2d 709, 711 (3d Cir.1989)). The burden is on the defendant to assert his innocence and reason to withdraw the plea. If he fails to do so, the government need not establish prejudice. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>44 F.3d 1206, 1210 (3d Cir.1995). \u201cA shift in defense tactics, a change of mind, or the fear of punishment are not adequate reasons to impose on the government the expense, difficulty, and risk of trying a defendant who has already acknowledged his guilt by pleading guilty.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>250 F.3d at 815 (quoting <em>United States v. Jones, </em>979 F.2d 317, 318 (3d Cir.1992) (superseded by statute on other grounds)). The District Court\u2019s \u201cdecision not to grant such a motion -will only be disturbed if the court has abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Isaac, </em>141 F.3d 477, 485 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-17\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that the Defendant did not provide any \u201cfair and just reasons\u201d for withdrawing his guilty plea. First, the Defendant never maintained his innocence, even at the evidentiary hearing regarding his plea withdrawal request. There, when asked whether he \u201cin fact, commit[ted] each and every one of the robberies that [he] pled guilty to,\u201d he answered, \u2018Tes, I admitted to the ones that you had witnesses for, the people that testified here in the trial.\u201d (App. 169; <em>see also </em>Appellant Br. at 13.) Second, the Defendant did not provide a \u201cfair and just\u201d reason for his withdrawal request. Instead, his assertion that he did not understand his plea because it was in English is belied by his competent representation by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>a bilingual attorney and the presence of a Spanish interpreter throughout the plea colloquy. Perez\u2019s claim that he was \u201cpressured\u201d to plead guilty because he was told that he would otherwise face life imprisonment is negated by clear case law that \u201cfear of substantial sentence\u201d does not provide grounds to withdraw a plea, <em>see Jones, </em>979 F.2d at 318. Finally, the Government would suffer prejudice if the Defendant were allowed to withdraw the plea he made mid-trial, as it would require the Government to duplicate its previous efforts if required to bring the case to trial before a new jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The District Court was within its discretion when it denied the Defendant\u2019s request to withdraw his plea of guilty, and this Court will affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
