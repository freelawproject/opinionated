The district court held that (1) the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim against defendant-appellee Weldon A. Abt was not actionable because, as a professional consultant, he was not a state actor; (2) the \u00a7 1983 claims against the Village of Goshen defendants-appellees should be dismissed because (a) the takings claim was not ripe for review, (b) R-Goshen did not have a legitimate, constitutionally protected property interest to support a substantive due process violation claim, (c) the procedural due process violation claim was without merit, and (d) there was no evidence of impermissible motive for R-Gosh-en\u2019s equal protection violation claim; and (3) the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 claim, as against all defendants-appellees, should be dismissed because there was no evidence of class-based animus. Familiarity with the facts and procedural history is assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-18\">On appeal, R-Goshen, which brought suit against the Village of Goshen and individuals involved in the consideration of R-Goshen\u2019s application for a land use permit, argues: (1) Section 15 of the Village of Goshen\u2019s Zoning Code is unconstitutional; (2) defendants-appellees were aware of or recklessly indifferent to the alleged unconstitutionality of the ordinance; (3) defendants-appellees avoided Article 78 review of the constitutionality of the ordinance; and (4) assuming the ordinance is unconstitutional, R-Goshen presented sufficient disputed issues of material fact to survive summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-19\">The district court found that plaintiffs takings claim was unripe, <em>R-Goshen LLC v. Village of Goshen, </em>289 F.Supp.2d 441, 450 (S.D.N.Y.2003), and we conclude that all of plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claims were unripe, <em>see Williamson County Reg\u2019l Comm\u2019n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, </em>473 U.S. 172, 186, 194, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985) (establishing two-part test for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>assessing ripeness of takings claims); <em>Dougherty v. Town of N. Hempstead Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>282 F.3d 83, 88-89 (2d Cir.2002) (extending <em>Williamson </em>County\u2019s ripeness analysis to procedural due process and equal protection violation claims that arise \u201cin the context of land use challenges\u201d); <em>Southview </em>Assocs., <em>Ltd. v. Bongartz, </em>980 F.2d 84, 96-97 (2d Cir.1992) (same for substantive due process violation claims). Following the planning board\u2019s indication that the proposal did not conform to the zoning provisions, R-Goshen and the planning board continued to discuss possible modifications to R-Goshen\u2019s plan. R-Goshen did not press the board to a final determination and, instead, brought this suit. Under these circumstances, none of R-Goshen\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims were ripe, jurisdiction was lacking, and thus their dismissal was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">We have carefully considered all of RGoshen\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Accordingly, and for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
