We assume that the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural history and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">Because Hill brought his action for relief against the warden of a facility in which he concedes he is no longer incarcerated, his petition for relief is moot. <em>See Prins v. Coughlin, </em>76 F.3d 504, 506 (2d Cir.1996) (noting that it is well settled in this circuit that a transfer to a new facility moots an action for injunctive relief against the prior facility).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">Hill asserts that he is suffering the same deprivations at his current facility, but we decline to consider these issues as raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See June v. Town of Westfield, </em>370 F.3d 255, 258 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
