Edgar and Tommy Thomas on Ray\u2019s excessive force claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Ray argues that the district court erred in granting the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion prior to receiving his response. Ray notes that he was proceeding <em>pro se </em>in the district court, and he contends that he was never informed of a time limit to respond to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and that he was ignorant of the local rules of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-22\">The sole notice requirement when a motion for summary judgment has been filed is that the motion must be served at least 10 days before the summary judgment hearing is held. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Enplanar, Inc. v. Marsh, </em>11 F.3d 1284, 1293 n. 11 (5th Cir.1994). A court satisfies the notice requirements of Rule 56 if local rules require that a response to a summary judgment motion be filed within a specified period. <em>See Rodriguez v. Pacificare of Tex., Inc., </em>980 F.2d 1014, 1020 (5th Cir.1993). The local rules of the district court provide sufficient notice for a <em>pro se </em>litigant such as Ray. <em>See </em>S.D. Tex. Civ. R. 7.3 <em>&amp; </em>7.4; <em>Martin v. Harrison County Jail, </em>975 F.2d 192,193 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-23\">Ray also argues that the district court would not have granted summary judgment had it considered the evidence pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>sented in his late-filed response to the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion. In considering an argument that the grant of summary judgment was improper, this court considers \u201conly the evidence that was in front of the district court.\u201d <em>Wallace v. Texas Tech Univ., </em>80 F.3d 1042, 1047 (5th Cir.1996). Because Ray has failed to provide a \u201cvalid excuse\u201d for his failure to produce the evidence prior to the district court\u2019s ruling on the summary judgment motion, he has not shown that he is entitled to relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
