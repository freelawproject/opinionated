Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). A trial court is not required to appoint counsel for an indigent plaintiff asserting a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim except in exceptional circumstances. <em>Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982). Harris\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that this case is in any way \u201cexceptional.\u201d <em>See id. </em>The motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Harris\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. We caution Harris that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). If Harris accumulates three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility, unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Harris\u2019s motion to stay the district court proceedings pending the resolution of the appeal is DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED; MOTION TO STAY DISTRICT COURT PROCEEDINGS DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b765-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
