We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider, and we review de novo claims of due process violations. <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Hernandez-Espinoza\u2019s motion to reconsider. As the BIA noted, Hernandez-Espinoza\u2019s motion to reconsider did not comply with the regulations governing motions to reconsider because it failed to identify any errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>see also Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir.2003) (stating \u201ca motion to reconsider challenges determinations of law and fact made by the BIA.\u201d). Indeed, Hernandez-Espinoza\u2019s motion did not advance any legal or factual arguments, nor did it indicate how the BIA\u2019s decision would have been different if Hemandez-Espinoza had filed a brief with the BIA in the earlier proceedings. Accordingly, the BIA acted within its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider. <em>See Cano-Merida, </em>311 F.3d at 966.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Hernandez-Espinoza\u2019s due process claim fails because he has not established any prejudice. <em>Cf. Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 1164, 1168-69 (9th Cir.2004) (finding due process violation when BIA sent briefing schedule and transcript to wrong address and denied petitioner\u2019s motion to file a late brief to explain allegedly inconsistent testimony). Hernandez-Espinoza\u2019s contention that the BIA denied his right to counsel is deemed abandoned because this contention was <em>not </em>supported by any argument in petitioner\u2019s opening brief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
